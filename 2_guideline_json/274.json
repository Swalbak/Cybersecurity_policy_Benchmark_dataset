In the process of constantly improving  our methodology for the development of threat landscapes, this year’s work has been supported by a newly formatted  ENISA ad hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL).  The time span of the ETL 2021 report is April 2020 to July 2021 and is referred to as the \"reporting period\" throughout  the report. During the reporting period, the prime threats identified include:   Ransomware   Malware   Cryptojacking   E-mail related threats   Threats against data   Threats against availability and integrity   Disinformation – misinformation   Non-malicious threats   Supply-chain attacks  In this report we discuss the first 8 cybersecurity threat categories. Supply chain threats, the 9th category, were  analysed in detail, due to their particular prominence, in a dedicated ENISA report “ENISA Threat landscape for  Supply Chain Attacks” 1.  For each of the identified threats, attack techniques, notable incidents and trends are discussed along with proposed  mitigation measures. As regards trends, during the reporting period we highlight the following:   Ransomware has been assessed as the prime threat for 2020-2021.   Governmental organisations have stepped up their game at both national and international level.   Cybercriminals are increasingly motivated by monetisation of their activities, e.g. ransomware.  Cryptocurrency remains the most common pay-out method for threat actors.   Malware decline that was observed in 2020 continues during 2021. In 2021, we saw an increase in threat  actors resorting to relatively new or uncommon programming languages to port their code.   The volume of cryptojacking infections attained a record high in the first quarter of 2021, compared to  recent years. The financial gain associated with cryptojacking incentivised threat actors to carry out these  attacks.   COVID-19 is still the dominant lure in campaigns for e-mail attacks.   There was a surge in healthcare sector related data breaches.   Traditional DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) campaigns in 2021 are more targeted, more persistent  and increasingly multivector. The IoT (Internet of Things) in conjunction with mobile networks is resulting  in a new wave of DDoS attacks.   In 2020 and 2021, we observe a spike in non-malicious incidents, as the COVID-19 pandemic became a  multiplier for human errors and system misconfigurations, up to the point that most of the breaches in  2020 were caused by errors.  Understanding the trends related to threat actors, their motivations and their targets greatly assists in planning  cybersecurity defences and mitigation strategies. This is an integral part of our overall threat assessment, since it  1 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  5  allows security controls to be prioritised and a dedicated strategy to be devised based on the potential impact and  likelihood of threat materialisation. With this in mind, for the purposes of the ETL 2021, the following four categories of  cybersecurity threat actors are considered:   State-sponsored actors   Cybercrime actors   Hacker-for-hire actors   Hacktivists  Through continuous analysis, ENISA derived trends and points of interest for each of the major threats presented in  the ETL 2021. The key findings and judgments in this assessment are based on multiple and publicly available  resources which are provided in the references used for the development of this document. The report is mainly  targeted at strategic decision-makers and policy-makers, but it will also be of interest to the technical cybersecurity  community.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  6  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  7  1. THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW  In its ninth edition, the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) report provides a general overview of the cybersecurity threat  landscape. The ETL report is partly strategic and partly technical, with information relevant to both technical and non-  technical readers. This year’s work has been supported by a newly formatted ENISA ad hoc Working Group on  Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL)2.  Cybersecurity attacks have continued to increase through the years 2020 and 2021, not only in terms of vectors and  numbers but also in terms of their impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has also –expectedly– had an impact on the  cybersecurity threat landscape. One of the more enduring developments that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic is  a lasting shift to a hybrid office model. Therefore, cybersecurity threats related to the pandemic and exploiting the  “new normal” are becoming mainstream. This trend has increased the attack surface and, as a result, we have seen a  rise in the number of cyber-attacks targeting organisations and companies through home offices3.  In general, cybersecurity threats are on the rise. Spurred by an ever-growing online presence, the transitioning of  traditional infrastructures to online and cloud-based solutions, advanced interconnectivity and the exploitation of new  features of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)45, the cybersecurity landscape has grown in terms  of sophistication of attacks, their complexity and their impact. Notably, the threat to supply chains and their  significance due to their potentially catastrophic cascading effects has reached the highest position among major  threats, so much so that ENISA produced a dedicated threat landscape for this category of threat6.  It is worth noting that in this iteration of the ETL, particular focus has been given on the impact of cyber threats in  various sectors, including the ones listed in the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD). Interesting insight  may be drawn from the particularities of each sector when it comes to the threat landscape, as well as potential  interdependencies and areas of significance. Accordingly, sectorial threat landscapes merit further attention.  There have also been some notable steps from the side of defenders in the cyber community this year, as well as the  policy makers. The global community has begun to realise the importance of communication and cooperation in  examining and tracking cybercriminals, with ransomware (the most prominent threat for the reporting period of ETL  2021) in particular becoming a prime item in agendas for meetings on strategy among global leaders.  Dedicated readers of past editions of the ETL 2021 will notice a difference in the mapping of prime threats. This year,  ENISA took a step back and consolidated threat categories in a move towards integration and better representation of  similar threats. This is part of ongoing efforts towards a revamped threat taxonomy and will help in establishing trends  methodologically over the next few years.  The ETL 2021 is based on a variety of open-source information and cyber threat intelligence sources. It identifies  major threats, trends and findings, and provides relevant high-level mitigation strategies. ENISA is currently working  on solidifying the methodology for reporting on the threat landscape to promote transparency and consistency in the  work.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  3 IBM – Cost of a Data Breach Report 2020 - https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/  4 ENISA AI Threat Landscape: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  5 https://www.stealthlabs.com/blog/top-10-cybersecurity-trends-in-2021-and-beyond/  6 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.stealthlabs.com/blog/top-10-cybersecurity-trends-in-2021-and-beyond/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  8  1.1 PRIME THREATS  A series of cyber threats emerged and materialised in the course of 2020 and 2021. Based on the analysis presented  in this report, the ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 identifies and focuses on the following 8 prime threat groups (See  Figure 1). These 8 threat groups are highlighted because of their prominence during the reporting period, their  popularity and the impact that materialisation of these threats has had.   Ransomware  Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organisation’s data and demand payment to  restore access. Ransomware has been the prime threat during the reporting period, with several high profile and  highly publicised incidents. The significance and impact of the threat of ransomware is also evidenced by a series  of related policy initiatives in the European Union (EU) and worldwide.   Malware  Malware is software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorised process that will have an adverse impact on  the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system. The threat of malware has been consistently ranked high for  many years, albeit at a decreasing rate during the reporting period of ETL 2021. The use of new attach techniques  and some major wins for the law enforcement community have impacted the operations of relevant threat actors.   Cryptojacking  Cryptojacking or hidden cryptomining is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim’s computing  power to generate cryptocurrency. With the proliferation of cryptocurrencies and their ever-increasing uptake by  the wider public, an increase in corresponding cybersecurity incidents has been observed.   E-mail related threats  E-mail related attacks are a bundle of threats that exploit weaknesses in the human psyche and in everyday  habits, rather than technical vulnerabilities in information systems. Interestingly and despite the many awareness  and education campaigns against these types of attacks, the threat persists to a notable degree. In particular, the  compromise of business e-mails and advanced sophisticated techniques in extracting monetary gains are on the  rise.   Threats against data  This category encompasses data breaches/leaks. A data breach or data leak is the release of sensitive,  confidential or protected data to an untrusted environment. Data breaches can occur as a result of a cyber-attack,  an insider job, unintentional loss or exposure of data. The threat continues to be high, since access to data is a  prime target for attackers for numerous reasons, e.g. extortion, ransom, defamation, misinformation, etc.   Threats against availability and integrity  Availability and integrity are the target of a plethora of threats and attacks, among which the families of Denial of  Service (DoS) and Web Attacks stand out. Strictly related to web-based attacks, DDoS is one of the most critical  threats to IT systems, targeting their availability by exhausting resources, causing decreases in performance, loss  of data, and service outages. The treat is consistently ranked high in the ENISA threat landscape, both because of  its manifestation in actual incidents and its potential for high impact.   Disinformation – misinformation  Disinformation and misinformation campaigns are on the rise, spurred by the increased use of social media  platforms and online media, as well as a result of the increase of people’s online presence due to the COVID-19  pandemic. This group of threats is making its first appearance in the ETL; however its importance in the cyber  world is high. Disinformation and misinformation campaigns are frequently used in hybrid attacks to reduce the  overall perception of trust, a major proponent of cybersecurity.   Non-malicious threats  Threats are commonly considered as voluntary and malicious activities brought by adversaries that have some  incentives to attack a specific target. With this category, we cover threats where malicious intent is not apparent.  These are mostly based on human errors and system misconfigurations, but they can also refer to physical  disasters that target IT infrastructures. Also attributed to their nature, these threats have a constant presence in  the annual threat landscape and are a major concern for risk assessments.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  9  Figure 1: ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 - Prime threats  It needs to be noted that the aforementioned threats involve categories and the collection of threats, consolidated into  the eight areas mentioned above. Each of the threat groups is further analysed in a dedicated chapter of this report,  which elaborates on its particularities and provides more specific information, findings, trends, attack techniques and  mitigation vectors.  1.2 KEY TRENDS  The list below summarises the main trends observed in the cyber threat landscape during the reporting period. These  are also reviewed in detail throughout the various chapters comprising the ENISA threat landscape of 2021.   Highly sophisticated and impactful supply chain compromises proliferated, as highlighted by the  dedicated ENISA Threat Landscape on Supply Chain. Managed service providers are high-value targets  for cybercriminals.   COVID-19 drove cyber espionage tasking and created opportunities for cybercriminals.   Governmental organisations have stepped up their game at both national and international level.  Increased efforts have been observed from governments to disrupt and take legal action against state-  sponsored threat actors.   Cybercriminals are increasingly motivated by monetisation of their activities, e.g. ransomware.  Cryptocurrency remains the most common pay-out method for threat actors.   Cybercrime attacks increasingly target and impact critical infrastructure.   Compromise through phishing e-mails, and brute-forcing on Remote Desktop Services (RDP) remain  the two most common ransomware infection vectors.   The focus on Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) type business models has increased over 2021, making  proper attribution of individual threat actors difficult.   The occurrence of triple extortion ransomware schemes increased strongly over the course of 2021.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  10   The malware decline that was observed in 2020 continues during 2021. In 2021, we saw an increase in  threat actors resorting to relatively new or uncommon programming languages to port their code.   Malware targeting container environments have become much more prevalent, with novel evolutions like  file-less malware being executed from memory.   Malware developers keep finding ways to make reverse engineering and dynamic analysis harder.   The volume of cryptojacking infections attained a record high in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the  last few years. The financial gain associated with cryptojacking incentivised the threat actors to carry out  these attacks.   The volume of Crypto mining in 2021 and cryptojacking activities are at a record high.   We can see that a shift from browser to file-based cryptojacking is taking place.   COVID-19 is still the dominant lure in campaigns for e-mail attacks.   Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) has increased, has grown in sophistication and become more  targeted.   The Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) business model is gaining prevalence.   Threat actors shifted their attention towards vaccine information in the context of threats to data and  information.   There was a surge in healthcare sector related data breaches.   Traditional DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are moving towards mobile networks and IoT  (Internet of Things).   Ransom Denial of Service (RDoS) is the new frontier of denial of service attacks.   Sharing of resources in virtualised environments acts as an amplifier of DDoS attacks.   DDoS campaigns in 2021 have become more targeted and much more persistent and increasingly  multivector.   Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled disinformation supports attackers in carrying out their attacks.   Phishing is at the heart of disinformation attacks and strongly exploits people’s beliefs.   Misinformation and disinformation are at the core of cybercrime activities and is increasing at an  unprecedented rate.   Disinformation-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model has grown significantly, spurred by the increasing  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to have more information.   In 2020 and 2021, we observed a spike in non-malicious incidents, as the COVID-19 pandemic became a  multiplier for human errors and system misconfigurations, up to the point that most of the breaches in  2020 were caused by errors.   There has been a spike in cloud security non-malicious incidents.  1.3 EU PROXIMITY OF PRIME THREATS  An important aspect to consider in the context of the ENISA Threat Landscape involves the proximity of a cyber threat  with respect to the European Union (EU). This is particularly important to assist analysts in assessing the significance  of cyber threats, correlate them with potential threat actors and vectors and even to guide the selection of appropriate  targeted mitigation vectors. In line with the proposed classification for the EU Common Security and Defence Policy  (CSDP)7, we classify cyber threats into four categories as illustrated in Table 1.  Table 1: Classification of proximity of cyber threats  Proximity Concerns  NEAR  Affected networks, systems, controlled and assured within EU borders. Affected population within  the borders of the EU.  MID  Networks and systems considered vital for operational objectives within the scope of the EU  digital single market and the NISD sectors, but their control and assurance relies on non-EU  institutional or MS public or private authorities. Affected population in geographical areas close to  EU borders.  7 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  11  Proximity Concerns  FAR  Networks and systems that, if influenced, will have a critical impact on operational objectives  within the scope of the EU digital single market and the NISD sectors. Control and assurance of  those networks and systems lies beyond EU institutional or Member States’ (MS) public or private  authorities. Affected population in geographical areas far from the EU.  GLOBAL All the aforementioned areas  Figure 2 illustrates a timeline of incidents related to the prime threat categories reported in the ETL 2021. It should be  noted that the information in the graph is based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and is a result of work by  ENISA in the area of Situational Awareness8.  Figure 2: Timeline of observed incidents related to major ETL threats (OSINT-based situational  awareness) in terms of their proximity.  As evidenced by the above figure, 2021 has seen a higher number of incidents compared to 2020. In particular, the  category NEAR has a constantly rising number of observed incidents related to prime threats, which implies their  significance in the context of the EU. Unsurprisingly, the monthly trends (not shown in the figure for brevity) are quite  similar among the different classifications since cybersecurity knows no border and in most cases threats materialise  at all levels of proximity. It is noteworthy that, during the last months covered by ETL 2021, a higher EU NEAR  proximity is observed, a trend that ENISA will continue monitoring to see how it evolves and how it relates to the  activities of threat actors and ongoing threat vectors.  1.4 PRIME THREATS PER SECTOR  Cyber threats are usually not restricted to one particular sector and in most cases affect more than one of them. This  is indeed true since in many cases the threats manifest themselves by exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying ICT  systems that are being used in a variety of sectors. However, targeted attacks as well as attacks exploiting the  differences in cybersecurity maturity across sectors and the popularity/prominence of certain sectors, are all factors  that need to be considered. These factors contribute to threats manifesting themselves as incidents in specific sectors  8 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  12  and this is why it is important to look deeply into sectorial aspects of observed incidents and threats. Moreover, trends  noticed in each sector and cross-sector dependencies are observations that may be drawn from such an analysis.  Figure 3 and Figure 4 highlight the affected sectors concerning incidents observed based on OSINT (Open Source  Intelligence) and is a result of work by ENISA in the area of Situational Awareness9. They refer to incidents related to  the prime threats of ETL 2021. This is the first attempt by ENISA to map the impact of threats on specific sectors. In  the coming years and in future iterations of the threat landscape, efforts will be made to align the sectors with the  ones listed in the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) and the proposal for its review (NISD 2.0).  Figure 3: Timeline of observed incidents related to prime ETL threats in terms of the affected sector.  9 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN)  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  13  Figure 4: Targeted sectors per number of incidents (April 2020-July 2021)  During this reporting period, a large number of incidents targeted public administration and government and digital  service providers. The latter is to be expected given the horizontal provisioning of services for this sector and thus its  impact on many other sectors. We also observed a significant number of incidents targeting end users and not  necessarily a particular sector. The health sector was also targeted significantly, and this activity shows signs of  increasing during the last few months of the reporting period (May-July 2021). Interestingly, the finance sector faces a  consistent number of incidents throughout the year. The supply chain of software also shows an increased number of  incidents during 2021, which is also an observation in the ENISA Supply Chain threat landscape report10.  1.5 METHODOLOGY  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) 2021 report is based on information available from open sources, mainly of a  strategic nature and ENISA’s own Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities, and covers more than one sector,  technology and context. The report attempts to be industry and vendor agnostic and references or cites the work from  various security researchers, security blogs and news media articles throughout the text in multiple footnotes. The  time span of the ETL 2021 report is April 2020 to July 2021 and is referred to as the \"reporting period\" throughout the  report.  For the production of the ETL 2021 report, the following approach was used. Throughout the relevant time period  ENISA, by means of situational awareness, gathered a list of major incidents as they appeared in open sources. This  list served as the foundation for the identification of the list of prime threats, as well as the source material for several  trends and statistics in the report.  Subsequently, an in-depth desk research of available literature from open sources such as news media articles,  expert opinion, intelligence reports, incident analysis and security research reports was conducted by ENISA and  external experts. Through continuous analysis, ENISA derived trends and points of interest for each of the major  threats presented in ETL 2021. The key findings and judgments in this assessment are based on multiple and publicly  available resources which are provided in the references used for the development of this document.  10 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  14  Within the report, we try to differentiate between what has been reported by our sources and what is our assessment.  (We do so by specifically using the phrase “in our assessment”). Finally, when conducting an assessment, we convey  probability by using words that express an estimate of probability (e.g. likely, very likely, certainly)11.  MITRE ATT&CK® framework12 was used in this report to highlight the attack tactics and techniques relevant to a  given threat (see Annex A). For each ATT&CK® tactic, the techniques the adversary used are presented. This can  lead to a list of ATT&CK Mitigations13 that can be applied. MITRE ATT&CK® is a knowledge base, a common  language for adversarial tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge  base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in  government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.  The report was validated by the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes14 that was established in  April 2021, a group that consists of experts from European and international public and private sector entities.  For the future development of Threat Landscapes, ENISA is in the process of formalising a new methodology, to  promote transparency and set the foundations for structured and well-aligned processes. In this endeavour, together  with a revised threat taxonomy, the methodology for threat landscapes will be made public in the future.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) 2021 has maintained the structure of previous ETL reports by using a similar  structure for highlighting the prime cyber threats in 2021. Readers of past iterations will notice that the threat  categories have been consolidated in line with a move towards a new cybersecurity threat taxonomy to be used in the  future.  This report is structured as follows:  Chapter 2 explores the trends related to threat actors (i.e. state-sponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hacker-for-hire  actors and hacktivists).  Chapter 3 discusses major findings, incidents and trends regarding ransomware.  Chapter 4 presents major findings, incidents and trends regarding malware.  Chapter 5 describes major findings, incidents and trends regarding cryptojacking.  Chapter 6 highlights major findings, incidents and trends regarding e-mail related threats.  Chapter 7 discusses major findings, incidents and trends regarding threats to data.  Chapter 8 presents major findings, incidents and trends regarding threats against availability and integrity.  Chapter 9 underlines the importance of hybrid threats and describes major findings, incidents and trends regarding  disinformation and misinformation.  Chapter 10 focuses on major findings, incidents and trends regarding non-malicious threats.  Annex A presents the techniques commonly used for each threat, based on the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.  Annex B includes notable incidents per threat, as observed during the reporting period.  11 CIA - Words of Estimative Probability https://www.cia.gov/static/0aae8f84700a256abf63f7aad73b0a7d/Words-of-Estimative-Probability.pdf  12 MITRE ATT&CK® , https://attack.mitre.org/  13 https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise /  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  https://www.cia.gov/static/0aae8f84700a256abf63f7aad73b0a7d/Words-of-Estimative-Probability.pdf https://attack.mitre.org/ https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  15  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  16  2. THREAT ACTOR TRENDS  Cyber threat actors are an integral component of the threat landscape. They are entities aiming to carry out a  malicious act by taking advantage of existing vulnerabilities, with the intent to do harm to their victims. Understanding  how threat actors think and act, what their motivations and goals are, is an important step towards a stronger cyber  incident response. Monitoring the latest developments with respect to the tactics and techniques used by threat actors  to achieve their objectives, along with staying up-to-date with the long-term trends in motivations and targets, is crucial  for an efficient defence in today’s cybersecurity ecosystem.  Moreover, understanding the trends related to threat actors, their motivations and their targets assist greatly in  planning cybersecurity defences and mitigation strategies. It is an integral part of the overall threat assessment since  it allows security controls to be prioritised and a dedicated strategy based on potential impact and the likelihood that  threats will materialise to be devised. Having no understanding of threat actors and the way they operate creates a  significant knowledge gap in cybersecurity, because one ends up looking and analysing threats without considering  the motivations and goals behind those threats.  In this section, we explore the trends related to threat actors. This assessment does not provide an exhaustive list of  all trends during the reporting period, but rather a high-level view of major trends observed at a strategic level. We  focus on the threat actors’ motives, capabilities and targeting, and their evolution is assessed.  For the purposes of the ETL 2021, the following four categories of cybersecurity threat actors are considered:   State-sponsored actors   Cybercrime actors   Hacker-for-hire actors   Hacktivists  The list of potential threat actors is evidently large and encompasses other categories such as insider actors, etc. The  focus on the particular four categories above does not imply that other categories of threat actors are deemed of  lesser significance. The reasoning behind the focus on the four selected threat actor categories is based on their  relative prominence during the ETL 2021 reporting period.  2.1 STATE-SPONSORED ACTORS  COVID-19 drove cyber espionage tasking. During the reporting period, we observed state-backed groups  conducting cyber espionage operations related to COVID-19 as well as using COVID-19 related lures for social  engineering. Regarding COVID-19 related cyber-espionage, threat actors have been tasked to pursue information  related to recovery and vaccine development efforts15. According to publicly available reports, state-sponsored threat  actors have been observed to be likely seeking data related to infection rates, country-level responses, and  treatments.15,16,17,18,19 Moreover, the collection of scientific information related to the COVID-19 vaccine was a high-  priority requirement and thus the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and medical research sectors have been heavily  targeted.15,17,21  15 FireEye / Mandiant - M-Trends 2021 https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021  16 NCSC-UK - Advisory: APT29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine- development  17 CrowdStrike - 2021 Global Threat Report - https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2021GTR.pdf  18 El Pais - Chinese hackers accused of stealing information from Spanish centers working on COVID-19 vaccine -  https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-COVID-19- vaccine.html  19 US Department of Justice - Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign  Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research -  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese- hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion  https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2021GTR.pdf https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-COVID-19-vaccine.html https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-COVID-19-vaccine.html https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  17  Our assessment is that the targeting of the these sectors by state-sponsored actors will certainly continue as long as  the pandemic lasts. In addition, we believe that the targeting of contact tracing systems as well as other COVID-19  related applications deployed by governments whose data can be valuable for intelligence gathering and spear  phishing campaigns is likely.  Finally, threat actors that have been ascribed as acting in the interests of nation states  exploited the concern and confusion related to COVID-19 with spear-phishing lures.17,20,21 In our opinion, cyber  espionage groups will almost certainly continue to conduct (spear-) phishing attacks using COVID-19 themes.22  Highly sophisticated and impactful supply chain compromises. While supply chain compromises by state-backed  threat actors are not new, during the reporting period, this type of attack reached new levels of sophistication and  impact.23,24 One of the major campaigns that took place during the reporting period is the SolarWinds supply chain  compromise.23,25,26,27,28,29,30 The SolarWinds supply chain compromise is a prominent example of how great an impact  a supply chain attack can have. The state-backed group behind this supply chain attack meticulously planned the  attack making almost no operational security mistakes.17 Moreover, the threat actor showed exceptional knowledge of  cloud environments,17 something that highlights the threats and current gaps in our knowledge of cloud  environments.31,32 The threat actor had well-defined and long-term espionage objectives judging from the careful  selection of the targets and subsequent post-compromise activity compared to the circa 18.000 organisations that  have been affected.  Based on ENISA’s analysis,23 on at least 17 occasions between 2020 and 2021, investigations confirm that supply  chain attacks were conducted by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, often state-sponsored, which constitutes  more than 50% of the attributed supply chain attacks during this period. Moreover, software supply chain attacks are  the most frequent type of supply chain attacks while the software services sector is the most targeted. From an  attacker's perspective, the characteristics of the targeted software are usually the following:33 i) cross-network  communication capability, ii) has root/admin-level privileges, iii) cross-platform/cross-operating system, iv) often  whitelisted, and v) acts as a centralised management platform.  Historically, the majority of supply chain attacks resulted, or had the potential to result, in remote code execution.34  According to publicly available reports, various state actors have conducted software supply chain attacks. The most  likely distribution vector of the supply chain attacks conducted by state-backed threat actors is via the hijacking of the  software update process (others include the undermining of software certificates, open-source compromise, and  mobile app store attacks).34 This distribution vector is very sophisticated and is indicative of the complexity and the  careful planning and execution that is needed for such operations (e.g. see SolarWinds campaign timeline35).  Summing up, the diversified and complex world of supply chains offers a wealth of targets for state-backed threat  actors. Moreover, the move to teleworking, exacerbated by COVID-19, led organisations to maintain or even increase  the third-party suppliers they depend on for their operational needs. In our assessment, state-backed threat actors will  certainly continue conducting supply chain attacks (especially targeting software, cloud, and managed service  20 Kaspersky - APT annual review: What the world’s threat actors got up to in 2020 https://securelist.com/apt-annual-review-what-the-worlds-threat- actors-got-up-to-in-2020/99574/  21 Accenture - 2020 Cyber Threatscape Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf  22 Kaspersky - Advanced Threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/apt-predictions-for-2021/99387/  23 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  24 Kaspersky - APT  Trends Report Q1 2021 - https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967/  25 Microsoft - Addressing cybersecurity risk in industrial IoT and OT -  https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/10/21/addressing-cybersecurity- risk-in-industrial-iot-and-ot/  26 FireEye - Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor -  https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html  27 Microsoft - Microsoft Internal Solorigate Investigation Update - https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation- update/  28 CrowdStrike - SUNSPOT: An Implant in the Build Process - https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/  29 SolarWinds - SolarWinds Security Advisory - https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory  30 European Commission - Answer given by Mr. Hahn on behalf of the European Commission - https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9- 2021-001112-ASW_EN.pdf  31 Atlantic Council - Broken Trust: Lessons from Sunburst - https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BROKEN-TRUST.pdf  32 CERT-EU - Threat Landscape Report (Volume 1) - https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU- Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf  33 Obscurity Labs – Software supply chain targeting – Who will the APTs target next?

As we have observed in the  past, there have been cases where state-sponsored adversaries have engaged in cybercrime operations.37,38  Moreover, during the reporting period, we identified cases indicating this is an increasing trend among various threat  groups that are linked to nation states:   We observed for the first time that the Lazarus group conducted targeted ransomware intrusions for  financial gain.39 The likely motive behind these activities is monetary gain.   The US Department of Justice has issued indictments against individuals linked with the threat group  APT41/WICKED PANDA for conducting cybercrime operations targeting the video game sector whilst also  conducting cyber espionage operations.40,41 The APT41’s cybercrime operations have been conducted for  personal financial gain, e.g. obtain or generate video game currency via hacking to then sell it for profit.   The PIONEER KITTEN threat group has been identified with advertising and selling corporate network  access on an underground forum.42 This activity has been likely conducted for personal gain.   Various threat groups (Labyrinth Chollima, Stardust Chollima, Velvet Chollima43) have been observed to  deploy malicious cryptocurrency applications, targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing cryptocurrency  wallet credentials, and other currency generation operations. The likely motive behind these activities is  monetary gain.   A member of the Sandworm threat group has been identified conducting spear-phishing campaigns against  real estate companies, auto dealers, and cryptocurrency exchanges for personal gain44 .   According to the US Department of Justice, several Iran-based threat actors conducted both espionage and  criminal operations45. Regarding the actors’ money-making activities for personal gain (likely as a secondary  income), they used the victims’ stolen information to steal financial information and they attempted to extort  the victims after stealing sensitive information from them.   Cybercriminals allegedly acting on behalf of nation states have reportedly conducted cyber operations  (ransomware attacks, cyber-enabled extortion, cryptojacking, and rank theft) for their personal gain46.  It is our assessment that state-backed actors will certainly continue conducting revenue generating cyber intrusions (in  pursuit of strategic objectives or for personal gain) with varying levels of national responsibility47 and thus further blur  the lines between cyberespionage and cybercrime operations. As states leverage cybercrime groups to conduct cyber  operations, we expect this trend to increase and these state-affiliated groups to engage in money-making intrusions  for themselves.  Governmental organisations step up their game. During the reporting period, we observed increased efforts from  governments to disrupt, “name and shame”, and take legal action against state-sponsored threat actors.

Finally, we observed the FBI obtaining court approval to remove web shells from Internet-connected and  compromised Microsoft Exchange servers in the US.57  The goal of the activities described above is to disrupt the operations of adversaries, enable network defenders to  detect and respond to malicious activities, act as a means of signalling to adversaries (potentially deterring them or  influencing their behaviour), and establish a level of cyber norms in cyberspace.58 We assess that it is likely that more  countries will start using indictments, public disclosures and attribution statements as part of their cyber strategy.59 On  the flip side, it is still not yet clear how these activities will deter highly sophisticated and determined state-backed  threat actors in the long term. The hacking of the e-mail accounts of the most prominent federal prosecutors in the US  Department of Justice during the SolarWinds campaign suggests, though, that indictments against foreign cyber  operators can have a deterrent effect60.  Hindering defenders’ efforts. During the past few years, we have observed threat actors monitoring threat  intelligence reporting and attribution disclosures and responses from an operational and strategic perspective. Over  the years, one can claim that state-backed threat actors have been learning from their past mistakes and they have  been improving their operational security and leaving no high fidelity indicators during their intrusions61.  48 FireEye -

Moreover, the  leveraging of cybercriminal contract hackers by states (for deniability) as well as the wide use of common tools and  techniques by cybercrime and state-backed actors undermine credible attribution.67  Finally, the use of false flags can be regarded as an established method related to state-backed threat actors.68  During the reporting period, we observed the cases of MontysThree69 and DeathStalker70 threat actors that utilised  false flags.  In our assessment state-backed groups will certainly be leveraging offensive security tools, living-off-the-land  techniques, published PoCs, false flags, criminal contract hackers, crimeware-as-a-service, and will also be exhibiting  high levels of operational security to conduct cyber operations. All these will further complicate the detection,  response, and especially the defenders’ attribution efforts.71  Increased targeting of ICS networks. Historically, organisations have had less visibility in their ICS networks as  compared to their IT networks. Moreover, digital transformation initiatives, the rise of Industrial IoT,72  the cloud  connectivity of ICS devices, as well as the remote access services for ICS networks provide opportunities for the  threat actors73 (For example, the abuse of valid accounts was the No1 technique used by threat groups targeting ICS  networks74).  During the last 5-10 years, adversaries have increasingly invested resources to target ICS networks. According to  publicly available reports, the number of threat groups targeting ICS networks is growing at a rate three times faster  than they are going dormant74 and, during the reporting period, at least four new groups were discovered: STIBNITE,  TALONITE, KAMACITE, and VANADINITE.75 The objectives of these groups vary from information collection and  long-term persistence to disruption of ICS operations and potential physical destruction.  In our assessment the interest in targeting ICS networks will certainly grow in the near future. While we previously  discussed the opportunities for ICS targeting, the drivers for such operations include the desire for technological  independence, geopolitics (e.g. conflicts, long-term persistence, cyber warfare), as well as testing the capabilities of  threat actors and preparing for future attacks (some threat actors are still learning about ICS domain, experimenting  and developing ICS-targeting capabilities).  62 Intezer – Offensive Security Tools (OST) Map - https://www.intezer.com/ost-map/  63 Accenture - Threats Unmasked 2021 Cyber Threat Intelligence Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-158/Accenture-2021-Cyber- Threat-Intelligence-Report.pdf  Proofpoint -  Cobalt Strike: Favorite Tool from APT to Crimeware - https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/cobalt-strike-favorite-tool-apt- crimeware  64 ZDNet - Cobalt Strike and Metasploit accounted for a quarter of all malware C&C servers in 2020  - https://www.zdnet.com/article/cobalt-strike-and- metasploit-accounted-for-a-quarter-of-all-malware-c-c-servers-in-2020/  65 Symantec/Broadcom - Living off the Land: Attackers Leverage Legitimate Tools for Malicious Ends - https://symantec-enterprise- blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/living-land-legitimate-tools-malicious  66 Accenture - 2020 Cyber Threatscape Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf  67 White House - The United States, Joined by Allies and Partners, Attributes Malicious Cyber Activity and Irresponsible State Behavior to the People’s  Republic of China - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners- attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/  68 VirusBulletin - Wave your false flags!

It is common  knowledge, nowadays, that cyber operations are conducted by most states all over the world to accomplish their  strategic objectives.76 Thus, states are striving to develop, buy or hire cyber offensive capabilities to place themselves  in a favourable position in this cyber arms race. The implementation of such cyber capabilities is important for their  national strategies and their long-term planning. Currently, some of the trends we observe are that a) states with  advanced cyber capabilities are using them to strategically shape global political, military, economic, and ideological  power, b) middle powers are focusing on initiatives related to regulation, cyber norms, and protection of their critical  infrastructure, and c) low-capability cyber powers are enhancing their defensive and offensive postures.77  During the reporting period, we observed that cyber operations were aligned with the strategic objectives of states as  well as with the geopolitical landscape and real-world events. Notably, we observed increased cyber intrusion  activities in regions of trade routes (e.g. between Europe and Asia78), in regions of armed conflict,79,80,81 against  strategic targets such as governmental organisations (e.g. SolarWinds supply chain attack), and cyber operations as  enablers for large-scale espionage, personally identifiable information and the theft of intellectual property (e.g. the  Microsoft Exchange hack82).  State-sponsored groups are increasingly testing and exhibiting their capabilities for disruptive operations. In our  assessment state-backed actors will certainly continue pursuing their strategic objectives via cyber operations for  intelligence gathering for advantages in decision-making, stealing intellectual property, and pre-positioning of military  and critical infrastructure (preparation of the operational environment) for future conflicts.83 It is also our assessment  that state-backed groups will possibly develop (or buy or otherwise procure) and conduct disruptive/destructive  operations masqueraded as ransomware to weaken, demoralise and discredit adversarial governments.84 Finally,  local conflicts will likely include cyber operations paired with drone attacks and media-driven misinformation in order to  amplify impact.85  Information operations as a tool to pursue states’ strategic goals. Information operations dominated the news  headlines during the 2016 US elections. Currently, several states are leveraging information operations as a tool for  hybrid conflicts exploiting societal divisions, undermining trust, and polarising societies over issues that are sensitive  and important in certain countries.96  During the last few years, we observed an evolution in how threat actors are conducting information operations. First,  we observed threat actors conducting more targeted information operations as compared to the “noisy” ones in the  pas.t95 Moreover, currently there are commercial actors that sell Information-Operations-as-a-Service, providing  plausible deniability for their sponsors.86 Threat actors have also adapted their TTPs and exhibit better operational  security as well as platform diversification to survive takedowns87.  76 Ben Buchanan - The Hacker and the State: Cyber-Attacks and the New Normal of Geopolitics - https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-State-Attacks- Normal-Geopolitics/dp/0674987551  77 Control Risks - Geopolitics and cyber in 2021 - https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021  78 Kaspersky - Advanced Threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/apt-predictions-for-2021/99387/  79 Recorded Future - China-linked Group RedEcho Targets the Indian Power Sector Amid Heightened Border Tensions -  https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/  80 Cisco Talos - PoetRAT: Malware targeting public and private sector in Azerbaijan evolves - https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/poetrat- update.html  BBC - Nagorno-Karabakh: The Armenian-Azeri 'information wars' - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54614392  Azerbaycan 24 -  Azerbaijani hackers broke into over 90 Armenian websites - https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/azerbaijani-hackers-broke-into-over- 90-armenian-websites-video/  81 National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine - The NCCC at the NSDC of Ukraine warns of a cyberattack on the document management system  of state bodies - https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4823.html  82 NCSC-UK - UK and allies hold Chinese state responsible for pervasive pattern of hacking - https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese- state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking  83 Control Risks - Geopolitics and cyber in 2021 - https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021  84 Accenture - 2020 Cyber Threatscape Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf  85 Kaspersky - ICS threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/  86 ZDNet - Disinformation for hire: PR firms are the new battleground for Facebook - https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are- the-new-battleground-for-facebook/  87 Facebook - The State of Influence Operations 2017-2020 - https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IO-Threat-Report-May-20-2021.pdf  https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-State-Attacks-Normal-Geopolitics/dp/0674987551 https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-State-Attacks-Normal-Geopolitics/dp/0674987551 https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021 https://securelist.com/apt-predictions-for-2021/99387/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/ https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/poetrat-update.html https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/poetrat-update.html https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54614392 https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/azerbaijani-hackers-broke-into-over-90-armenian-websites-video/ https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/azerbaijani-hackers-broke-into-over-90-armenian-websites-video/ https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4823.html https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021 https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are-the-new-battleground-for-facebook/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are-the-new-battleground-for-facebook/ https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IO-Threat-Report-May-20-2021.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  22  During the reporting period, major topics of information operations included election interference and COVID-19.  During the 2020 US elections88 and the 2021 pre-election period in Germany,89 there were reported cases of  information operations as preparatory work for such operations. According to publicly available reports, intelligence  services have been conducting information operations related to COVID-19 issues.90 The EUvsDisinfo is a European  task force that tracks disinformation threats and has 922 COVID-19 disinformation narratives in its database (as of  31st July 2021).91 These narratives vary from promoting conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19, through  vaccine rollout and disinformation about vaccination strategies, the handling of public health measures, undermining  public trust in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and to fuelling anti-vaccination movements in the EU.92  Our assessment is that threat actors will very likely continue pursuing their strategic objectives by conducting cyber-  enabled information operations for the next decade focusing on important geopolitical issues like elections, public  health, humanitarian crises, human rights, and security.93 Also, in our opinion, threat actors will very likely continue  leveraging the latest technology (e.g. Artificial Intelligence, deep fakes, voice biometrics) to impersonate individuals as  part of their information operations.94 Finally, in our view, it is possible that there will be increased leveraging of  Information-Operations-as-a-Service together with increased competition of these disinformation networks.94  Hack-and-leak operations are an established tactic. Hack-and-leak operations include activities where a threat  actor has unlawfully accessed information via a cyberattack and then leaks this information. This information is usually  leaked in a specific context  ̶  sometimes the information is manipulated  ̶  and at a time that serves the threat actor’s  objectives to achieve the desired effect and influence public debate.95 Targets for these operations can be  businesses, politicians, as well as governmental organisations, and they are information operations impacting the  confidentiality and integrity of the information leaked.96  Hack-and-leak operations are not a new tactic but they gained traction after the hack-and-leak operations during the  2016 US elections. For these operations, their impact, perpetrators (mostly using fake identities), and targets are hard  to predict. However, if the stolen information is not sold on underground forums (showing a financial motivation by the  threat actor) but rather shared with the public, one can assess that these operations likely have a political  motivation.97 Threat actors conducting hack-and-leak operations usually fall within the category of state actors,  hacktivists, or front entities acting on behalf of nation-backed groups such as hacktivists. The latter is also a trend that  has been identified in recent years as state-backed groups are increasingly using hacktivists as cover under which to  conduct their operations; they even co-ordinate with hacktivists so that these operations look like the work of genuine  hacktivists97, 98, 99.  88 The New York Times - Iran and Russia Seek to Influence Election in Final Days, US Officials Warn -  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/iran-russia-election-interference.html  CISA - Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Identified Obtaining Voter Registration Data - https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a  89 Cyberscoop - Hackers target German lawmakers in an election year - https://www.cyberscoop.com/bundestag-germany-hackers-ghostwriter/  Der Taggesspiegel - Angriffswellen russischer Hacker auf Abgeordnete - https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/gefahr-fuer-die-bundestagswahl- angriffswellen-russischer-hacker-auf-abgeordnete/27418978.html  90 APNews - US officials: Russia behind spread of virus disinformation - https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-health-moscow-ap-fact- check-3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1  EU Disinfo Lab - How two information portals hide their ties to the Russian news agency InfoRos - https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/how-two- information-portals-hide-their-ties-to-the-russian-news-agency-inforos/  91 EUvsDisinfo – Disinfo Database (COVID-19 related narratives) - https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation- cases/?disinfo_keywords%5B%5D=106935&disinfo_keywords%5B%5D=88558&date=&per_page=  92 EUvsDisinfo - EEAS SPECIAL REPORT UPDATE: SHORT ASSESSMENT OF NARRATIVES AND DISINFORMATION AROUND THE COVID-19  PANDEMIC (UPDATE DECEMBER 2020 - APRIL 2021) -  https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eeas-special-report-update-short-assessment-of-narratives-and- disinformation-around-the-COVID-19-pandemic-update-december-2020-april-2021/?highlight=COVID  EUvsDisinfo - EEAS SPECIAL REPORT UPDATE: SHORT ASSESSMENT OF NARRATIVES AND DISINFORMATION AROUND THE COVID-19  PANDEMIC (UPDATE MAY - NOVEMBER) - https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eeas-special-report-update-short-assessment-of-narratives-and-disinformation- around-the-COVID-19-pandemic-update-may-november/?highlight=COVID  EUvsDisinfo - WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020?

The stolen information  was made public through the Internet and was picked up by the media.100,101 Based on the EMA’s investigation, not all  the leaked documents were in their original form and this data manipulation could spread doubt about admission  procedures and the safety of COVD-19 vaccines. Another interesting case was the operation conducted by the  Ghostwriter threat group that targeted members of the German Parliament and Polish government officials (among  others).102,103,104,105 According to publicly available reports, documents from the personal e-mail accounts of  government officials were leaked on Telegram103 while the operation against German MPs was likely to be  preparatory work for a future hack-and-leak information (especially taking into account that 2021 is an election year in  Germany).106107  In our assessment hack-and-leak operations by state-backed and state-affiliated groups will very likely continue in the  near future, as these operations require low to medium resource investment by the threat actors compared to their  potential impact. Moreover, we expect these operations to intensify during periods of high interest (e.g. pre-election  periods) and exploit political divisions or instability. Moreover, our assessment is that threat actors will likely conduct  these operations through a series of releases so that they can sustain news media attention.108 The latter highlights  the importance of the target’s response towards the leak operation in order to direct the media narrative more to the  hack element rather than the leak element of the adversary’s operation.  2.2 CYBERCRIMINALS  COVID-19 created opportunities for cybercriminals. Social engineering remains the most prevalent attack  technique.109 The effectiveness of a phishing campaign depends on whether it taps into strong emotions that drive  action from the recipient’s side.110 During the pandemic, cybercriminals have been exploiting people’s interest,  concern, curiosity, and fear by using phishing lures related to COVID-19 for financial gain.111 The COVID-19 lure  themes matched the different stages of the pandemic.112 The major ones used by the cybercriminals have reportedly  been the following:112,113   Exploitation of individuals looking for details on disease tracking, testing, and treatment;   Impersonation of medical bodies, including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and US Centre for  Disease Control and Prevention;   Financial assistance and government stimulus packages;   Tailored attacks against employees working from home;   Scams offering personal protective equipment;   Passing mention of COVID-19 with previously used phishing lure content (e.g. deliveries, invoices, and  purchase orders);   Vaccination-related lures;   Phishing lures related to new variants of COVID-19.  100 European Medicines Agency -

Finally, in our  opinion the targeting of COVID-19 related applications deployed by governments, whose data can be valuable and be  made available for sale in underground markets and phishing campaigns, is likely.120  The exploitation of Work-From-Home technologies. During the pandemic, organisations were forced to change  their strategies and quickly adopt technologies that would support the new reality of remote working. This allowed  cybercrime adversaries to take advantage of the rapid deployment of these teleworking technologies and exploit them  for initial access. Technologies that have been heavily targeted by cybercrime actors are network appliances121 and  remote access services (especially Virtual Private Network122, Citrix123124 and RDP services125). The exploitation of  such technologies involved old, unpatched and newly discovered vulnerabilities as well as initial access via  compromised credentials.126  In our view cybercrime threat actors will certainly continue targeting technologies that support teleworking and  specifically VPN and remote access services. The organisation will be relying on these services as long as the  pandemic lasts and their successful compromise by the adversaries gives the latter the opportunity of remote access  to their victims without even deploying any malware.127 Another interesting point is that the potential return to the  office may leave these teleworking services orphaned and this will provide additional opportunities for adversaries.124  All these highlight the importance of fundamentals such as patch and vulnerability management as well as the  security hardening of these systems and applications.  114 Accenture -

During the reporting period, the frequency and  the complexity of ransomware attacks increased124 (by more than 150% in 2020128) and became one of the greatest  threats that organisations face today regardless of the sector to which they belong. We are observing the golden era  of ransomware  ̶  it has become a national security priority129 ̶  and some argue that it has not yet reached the peak of  its impact.130 Ransomware attacks are such a big issue that the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) issued an  advisory to instruct organisations about the risks of potential sanctions for facilitating ransomware payments.131  It has been observed that cybercriminals are less likely to target payment-related data (e.g. credit cards) and more  likely to target any data that will have an impact on the victims' operations.132 The successful business model of  human-operated ransomware (aka Big Game Hunting) has been increasingly attracting cyber-criminal threat actors  and it is also having an impact on their targeting.133 An indicative example is the FIN11 threat group whose observed  target has changed due to the likely shift of its operations from point-of-sale (POS) campaigns to targeted  ransomware.134  Moreover, the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model is blooming.135 During 2020, two-thirds of  ransomware campaigns were attributed to operators using RaaS.136 This trend sets a relatively low barrier for  conducting this type of cybercrime and allows inexperienced cybercriminals to conduct ransomware attacks.137  Taking into account the increasing number of publicly reported ransom payments, the success of the RaaS business  model, and the active recruitment of new members for the ransomware groups on Dark Web forums.138 139 Our  assessment is that more cybercriminals will very likely be attracted to shifting their targeting to focus on targeted  ransomware operations and replicate these successes.140  Multiple extortion methods. During the reporting period, the tactics that ransomware groups use to put pressure on  their victims and force them to pay the ransom have evolved. In late 2019, the Maze group demonstrated double  extortion tactics141: a) the systems and data of an organisation are encrypted and a ransom is requested, and b) the  organisation’s sensitive data are exfiltrated and Maze operators threaten to publish the exfiltrated data on “public  shaming websites” as extra leverage to demand further ransom payments.  During the reporting period, we have observed further evolutions in the tactics used by ransomware groups:134 142   Monetisation of the stolen information through data auctions in the dark web;143   Media amplification of their victim’s compromise by contacting journalists;144   Cold calling victims if they begin the ransomware recovery process without paying the ransom;145  128 Group-IB - Group-IB: ransomware empire prospers in pandemic-hit world.

Our assessment  is that the extortion methods of cybercriminals will certainly evolve further so they keep succeeding in getting higher  ransom payments from their victims.  Increasing collaboration and professionalisation. During the reporting period, we observed cybercrime groups that  have developed specialised cybercrime services, and cybercriminals that have built relationships within the ecosystem  as well as affiliate models.  The cybercrime ecosystem has a global presence. In this ecosystem, we observed different actors providing and  specialising in different services. This “Cybercrime-as-a-Service” trend lowers the barriers for threat actors that want  to conduct cybercrimes while it enhances the reach of cyberattacks. The different types of services offered in the  cybercrime ecosystem include:152   Main types of services: access brokers, phishing kits, credit/debit card testing services, malware packing  services, web inject kits, hardware for sale, ransomware, loaders, (bulletproof) hosting and infrastructure,  DDoS attack tools, anonymity and encryption, crime-as-a-service, counter antivirus service/checkers,  recruiting for criminal groups;   Distribution services: social network and instant messaging spam, exploit kit development, spam e-mail  distribution, purchasing traffic and/or traffic distribution systems (TDS);   Monetisation services: money mule and cashing services, reshipping fraud networks, dump shops,  collection and sale of payment card information, money laundering, ransom payments and extortion, wire  fraud cryptocurrency services.  Many of the cybercrime groups in this ecosystem provide services that support targeted ransomware operations, but  access brokers play an increasingly critical role.153 We have observed cybercriminal groups that had historically been  operating banking trojans (e.g. Trickbot,154 Qakbot155) capitalise on their access to compromised organisations by  selling it (mostly to ransomware groups and operators). According to publicly available reports, there are at least 10  threat actors that act as access facilitators (or are ransomware affiliates) and sell their access to multiple ransomware  operators156. While there is not a 1:1 relationship between these access-enabling malwares and ransomware  attacks156 there was a unique relationship between Emotet (malware distribution), Ryuk (ransomware), and Trickbot  146 Bleeping Computer - Ransomware gang plans to call victim's business partners about attacks -  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victims-business-partners-about-attacks/  147 Threat Post - Ransomware’s New Swindle: Triple Extortion - https://threatpost.com/ransomwares-swindle-triple-extortion/166149/  148 Bleeping Computer - Ransomware gang urges victims’ customers to demand a ransom payment -  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-urges-victims-customers-to-demand-a-ransom-payment/  149 FireEye / Mandiant - M-Trends 2021 https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021  150 Motherboard - Ransomware Gang Turns to Revenge Porn - https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzby/ransomware-gang-revenge-porn-leaks-nude- images  151 Flashpoint - Facing Five Types of Ransomware and Cyber Extortion - https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/facing-five-types-of-ransomware-and- cyber-extortion/  152 Europol - IOCTA 2020 - https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf  153 Digital Shadows - The Rise Of Initial Access Brokers - https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rise-of-initial-access-brokers/  154 CISA – TrickBot Malware - https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a  155 AT&T – The risk of QakBot - https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/the-rise-of-qakbot  156 Proofpoint - The First Step: Initial Access Leads to Ransomware - https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads- ransomware  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victims-business-partners-about-attacks/ https://threatpost.com/ransomwares-swindle-triple-extortion/166149/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-urges-victims-customers-to-demand-a-ransom-payment/ https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021 https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzby/ransomware-gang-revenge-porn-leaks-nude-images https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzby/ransomware-gang-revenge-porn-leaks-nude-images https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/facing-five-types-of-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion/ https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/facing-five-types-of-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion/ https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rise-of-initial-access-brokers/ https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/the-rise-of-qakbot https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  27  (backdoor) that suggests that the groups behind these different approaches to attack are either part of a larger  criminal organisation or they increasingly collaborate and depend on each other157.  We have also observed cybercrime groups that have developed affiliate programs where they exclusively sell the  malware to the affiliates and share the money paid.158 Finally, we have observed ransomware groups creating cartels  to enhance collaboration, share tactics and help each other publish their victims’ data on their “public shaming  sites”.159  Our assessment is that botnet operators will very likely capitalise on their infections by selling access to other  cybercriminals.160 It is also our opinion that access brokers and the threat actors behind them will very likely increase  in sophistication and demand, while some of them are likely to abandon cybercrime forums and use private channels.  Finally, state-backed threat actors will likely be buying initial access to organisations of interest from access  brokers161.  Managed service providers as high-value targets for cybercriminals. Nowadays, we observe that organisations  are increasingly outsourcing their IT infrastructure management and are depending on other companies for various  digital services. Managed service providers are high-value targets for cybercriminals since their compromise enables  them to target their clients as well.  The compromise of a service provider introduces the following potential risks for its clients;162   Confidentiality risks related to the clients’ data as they can be exfiltrated and stolen;   Availability risks related to the continuity of the service provider’s business, with a subsequent impact on its  clients;   Risks related to the potential propagation of an infection from the service provider to its clients;   Risks related to the misuse of clients’ service accounts for further malicious activities.  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape on Supply Chain10, attacks against managed service providers are  increasing but it is still unclear whether the scope of the attackers was also to target their clients in all cases. Within  the reporting period, some of the most prominent cybercriminal activities against service providers include the cases  of Blackbaud,163 SendGrid,164 AG165 and Kaseya.166  The cyberattack against Kaseya by the REvil ransomware group was one of the major cyberattacks observed during  the reporting period.167 Kaseya is a vendor that provides Kaseya VSA software that is widely used by Managed  Service Providers to manage IT infrastructure. The impact of this supply chain attack was huge;168 50 Managed  Service Providers (MSPs) had been using Kaseya’s VSA software which was compromised while 800-1500  businesses that were managed by the compromised MSPs were infected with the ransomware. Moreover, about one  157 https://intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot  158 Group-IB - Group-IB: ransomware empire prospers in pandemic-hit world.

It is interesting to note that the threat group demanded ransom payments only from the end  businesses that were impacted and not from the compromised MSPs. While MSPs have been (indirectly) targeted by  supply chain attacks, the fact that they could deploy software (ransomware in this case) to their clients (this is part of  the daily tasks of IT infrastructure management) amplified the effect of this attack.  Our assessment is that cybercriminal actors will certainly continue targeting (directly or indirectly via their suppliers)  managed service providers as a way to target the clients of MSPs, especially with respect to ransomware attacks.170  Cybercriminals transitioning to the cloud. The pandemic fastened the adoption of cloud infrastructure and services  by organisations globally and the “moving to the cloud” trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  However, apart from the apparent benefits of migrating to the cloud, there are also associated risks for  organisations.171 The rapid deployment of cloud infrastructure and services due to the urgent needs of the teleworking  workforce during the pandemic as well as the gap in cloud-specific expertise172 resulted in poorly secured and  managed cloud deployments that provide opportunities for cybercriminals. According to publicly available reports,  misconfigured cloud deployments were a leading cause of breaches173 while external cloud systems were more  common than on-premises assets in data breaches.174  Cybercriminals (as well as state-back actors) have already identified these opportunities and developed capabilities to  breach cloud infrastructure and services. During the reporting period, we observed cybercriminals enumerating cloud  environments,175 deploying the first cryptomining worm to steal AWS credentials,176 cryptomining on Linux servers in  the cloud,177 and targeting Docker and Kubernetes environments.178,179  Moreover, there is an increasing trend of  cloud providers being compromised by ransomware groups such as BlackBaud,180 Swiss Cloud,181 Equinix,182 and  Cloudstar.183. Finally, credential-based attacks against cloud services that are poorly secured or have not enabled  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) proliferate.184  Our assessment is that attacks against cloud environments will almost certainly continue and will likely have a greater  impact as more organisations adopt and implement Cloud-First strategies. Cloud downtimes will likely cause enough  pressure (due to SLAs as well as a lack of tested recovery processes and cloud expertise) to coerce companies into  paying ransoms in cases where they have been victims of ransomware attacks (even if they have backups in some  cases)185.  169 Lawfare Blog - The Kaseya Ransomware Attack Is a Really Big Deal - https://www.lawfareblog.com/kaseya-ransomware-attack-really-big-dea l  170 Canadian Center of Cybersecurity – National Cyberthreat Assessment - https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/national-cyber-threat-assessment-2020  171 CERT-EU - Threat Landscape Report (Volume 1) - https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU- Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf  ZeroFOX -  The Future of Digital Threats: 2020 Insights, 2021 Predictions - https://www.zerofox.com/blog/cyber-threat-trends-report/  172 CloudHealth - The Cloud Management Skills Gap Is Real.

During the reporting period, we  observed increased targeting of critical infrastructure by cybercrime actors. Major critical infrastructure sectors being  impacted are the healthcare, transportation, and energy sectors.  Ransomware attacks have disrupted the operations of public health agencies, hospitals, and emergency services.186  Threat actors have been specifically targeting the healthcare and public health sector despite the promises of some  ransomware gangs to stop doing so during the pandemic.187 They grasped this opportunity during the pandemic since  this sector became extremely significant and highly susceptible.188 Ryuk is a ransomware gang that heavily targeted  the healthcare sector in the USA186 despite the attempts cybersecurity vendors to take them down.189  According to publicly available reports, the transportation industry has faced cybercrime threats related to initial  access offerings, gift card fraud, and ransomware.190 All four major shipping companies have fallen victim to  ransomware attacks during recent years191 while the trucking sector has experienced high-profile ransomware  attacks.192 Because the Courier, Express, and Parcel (CEP) business is blooming it could be regarded as critical  infrastructure during the pandemic. Thus it attracted the attention of cybercriminals who targeted the CEP sector.193  Finally, despite limited flights and air traffic during the pandemic, the aviation industry faced disproportional numbers  of cyberattacks.194  The ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline (a US fuel company) by the Darkside ransomware group had a high  impact as a perceived gas shortage led to stockpiling and panic (although the IT network was impacted, operators  stopped ICS operations for protection).195 Colonial Pipeline’s ransomware attack196 also drove policy initiatives within  the US with Joe Biden signing an Executive Order to strengthen cybersecurity197 and restarting the discussion on the  responsibility of states for cybercrime attacks.198 199 Regarding the targeting of ICS networks, there has been an  increase in public and non-public ransomware events affecting ICS environments.200 Ransomware families like  EKANS,201 Megacortex202 and Clop203 have already developed ICS-aware functionality to stop industrial processes.  It is our opinion that, as our society becomes increasingly dependent on technology and Internet connectivity,  cybercrime attacks against critical infrastructure are very likely to become more disruptive. It is also likely that  186 CISA - Ransomware Activity Targeting the Healthcare and Public Health Sector - https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a  Wired - The untold story of a cyberattack, a hospital, and a dying woman - https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ransomware-hospital-death-germany  HHS - Ransomware Trends 2021 - https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ransomware-trends-2021.pdf  BBC - Cyber-attack on Irish health service 'catastrophic' - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977  187 Bleeping Computer - Ransomware Gangs to Stop Attacking Health Orgs During Pandemic -  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-to-stop-attacking-health-orgs-during-pandemic/  188 CTI League – Darknet Report 2021 - https://cti-league.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CTI-League-Darknet-Report-2021.pdf  189 Microsoft - New action to combat ransomware ahead of US elections - https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/12/trickbot-ransomware- cyberthreat-us-elections/  190 Intel471 - How cybercriminals create turbulence for the transportation industry - https://intel471.com/blog/how-cybercriminals-create-turbulence-for- the-transportation-industry  191 ZDNet - All four of the world's largest shipping companies have now been hit by cyber-attacks - https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-four-of-the-worlds- largest-shipping-companies-have-now-been-hit-by-cyber-attacks/  192 Freight Waves - 5 defining cyberattacks on trucking and logistics in 2020 - https://www.freightwaves.com/news/5-defining-cyberattacks-on-trucking- and-logistics-in-2020  193 SRM - The Courier, Express and Parcel industry is booming.

During the reporting period, we  observed a general trend that applies to many of actors, predominantly to the cybercriminals given the financial  implications. The dark web has become even more connected with the threat actors during the reporting period. In  previous years we observed the growth of both the flow of cryptocurrencies and the anonymising of networks. These  two key developments helped the dark wed become even more accessible due to the anonymisation it provided.205  Marketplaces have given the ability to threat actors to procure services and capabilities that they lack, and to promptly  gain access to breached data.206 Through the markets and underground forums threat actors that lack certain skills,  for example to develop a custom ransomware, are able to identify RaaS providers and procure the necessary skillset.  The providers offer to the customers various services (trading, payment and recovery). In exchange for these tools  and services the providers receive a small portion of the ransoms207. A recent report also showed the average price  listings of the most common requested services.208 We have also seen cases in which the threat actors launched  recruitment campaigns via the dark wed (Revil). 209  In conclusion, the revenue of dark web markets hit a record during the reporting period at a total of 1.7 billion dollars’  worth in cryptocurrency, even though this was mainly to the growth of Hydra.210 This is a prime indicator that the dark  wed has become an integrated part in the ecosystem of the threat actors.  2.3 HACKER-FOR-HIRE ACTORS  Rise of hacker-for-hire services. This category of threat actors refers to actors within the “Access-as-a-Service”  (AaaS) market that is mostly comprised of firms that offer offensive cyber capabilities. Their clients are usually  governments (but also corporations and individuals) and the service categories they offer are (usually bundled  altogether as a single service):211 Vulnerability Research and Exploitation, Malware Payload Development, Technical  Command and Control, Operational Management, and Training and Support.  The hacker-for-hire companies operate legally in their country of operation and the market as a whole is currently  semi-regulated.211 The clients of these companies pay them mostly to conduct cyber espionage operations, get  access to advanced offensive cyber capabilities and enjoy plausible deniability. These hacker-for-hire threat actors  complicate the threat landscape and introduce the following challenges for defenders:212   Their targeting cannot be predicted as it depends on the tasks their clients order; there is no focus on  specific sectors and thus any sector has the potential to be targeted.   These threat actors act as proxies and it is very difficult for defenders to identify their sponsors as well as  their objectives.  204 Kaspersky - ICS threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/  205 Five Key Reasons Dark Web Markets Are Booming - https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/23/five-key-reasons-dark-web- markets-are-booming/?sh=378b3b3a6f6f  206 Stolen data on the dark web is being accessed faster than ever - https://siliconangle.com/2021/10/19/stolen-data-dark-web-accessed-quicker-ever/  207 Cybercrime - A Peek at the Cybercriminal Ecosystem - https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/peek-cybercriminal-ecosystem  208  The cost of hiring a hacker on the dark web: report - https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/hiring-hacker-dark-web-report/  209 REvil Ransomware Gang Offers $1 Million As Part Of Recruitment Drive- https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware- gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=2a40595d7bab  210 Russian dark web marketplace Hydra cryptocurrency transactions reached $1.37bn in 2020- https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-dark-web- marketplace-hydra-cryptocurrency-transactions-reached-1-37bn-in-2020/  211 Atlantic Council - Countering Cyber Proliferation – Zeroing in on Access-as-a-Service - https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Offensive-Cyber-Capabilities-Proliferation-Report-1.pdf  212 PwC - Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect - https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf  https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/23/five-key-reasons-dark-web-markets-are-booming/?sh=378b3b3a6f6f https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/23/five-key-reasons-dark-web-markets-are-booming/?sh=378b3b3a6f6f https://siliconangle.com/2021/10/19/stolen-data-dark-web-accessed-quicker-ever/ https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/peek-cybercriminal-ecosystem https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/hiring-hacker-dark-web-report/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=2a40595d7bab https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=2a40595d7bab https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-dark-web-marketplace-hydra-cryptocurrency-transactions-reached-1-37bn-in-2020/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-dark-web-marketplace-hydra-cryptocurrency-transactions-reached-1-37bn-in-2020/ https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Offensive-Cyber-Capabilities-Proliferation-Report-1.pdf https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Offensive-Cyber-Capabilities-Proliferation-Report-1.pdf https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  31  During the reporting period, the major hacker-for-hire actor under discussion was the NSO Group and a leak that was  related to the targeting of activists, journalists, and political leaders.213 The impact of this leak is evidenced by several  proposals across the globe on managing such a threat.214 215  We also observed the alleged hacker-for-hire group called DeathStalker that has been targeting organisations within  the Financial and Legal services sectors for corporate espionage.216 While the group’s TTPs are evolving (e.g. use of  false flags217), its operations are representative of the fact that these threat actors can accomplish their goals without  using highly sophisticated tools.218  Some groups have focused on cyber espionage activities in specific regions e.g. Bahamut targeted entities in the  Middle East and South Asia, CostaRico mostly focused on targets in South Asia, etc.212 Thus, we observed some  regional targeting from some hacker-for-hire groups, which is likely due to their country of operations as well as their  client base.  Our assessment is that hacker-for-hire companies will certainly continue targeting any sector based on their sponsors’  requirements. While the operations of hacker-for-hire companies are disclosed from time to time, our  assessment is  that these companies will certainly complicate defenders’ efforts in identifying their original clients.219 Finally, in our  opinion, the hacker-for-hire industry will likely experience increased state control and oversight (and potentially more  attention from cybersecurity companies) due to potential national security risks as well as human rights abuse220 213.  2.4 HACKTIVISTS  Hacktivists’ operations remain low in numbers, sophistication, and impact. After 2016, we observed a falloff in  hacktivism following its peak during the period 2010-2015.221  Nowadays, hacktivists act mostly in small groups of  individuals, protesting against regional events and targeting specific organisations.222 Their targets remain their  traditional ones: financial institutions and governmental agencies. Massive public participation is missing.222 This is  likely due to the prosecution of various hacktivists in recent years which has acted as a deterrent.223  Regarding hacktivists’ capabilities, their tactics remain “old school” 224 mostly focusing on DDoS attacks, defacements,  releasing of sensitive data, and account takeovers.222 During the reporting period, the frequency of hacktivists’  operations was low and did not have the impact they had in the past. This is something that can be attributed to the  limited sophistication of their operations and their limited resources as well as the improved security controls that their  target organisations have developed over the years.  It was expected that there would be a rise in hacktivism during the pandemic as more people were staying at home  and this would increase the potential for participating in online protests (and disruptions).223,224 However, this  213 Amnesty International - Massive data leak reveals Israeli NSO Group's spyware used to target activists, journalists, and political leaders globally -  https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/  Google Sheets - Links to articles about Project Pegasus -  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aWl8aTFTsEc2Q66picrIBiv5aXVyNZlmrrhYv10MLfw/edit#gid=0  214 The Guardian - Israel ‘creating task force’ to manage response to Pegasus project - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/israel-creating- task-force-to-manage-response-to-pegasus-project  215 Enough is Enough – Joint statement from representatives TOM MALINOWSKI, KATIE PORTER, JOAQUIN CASTRO AND ANNA G.

During the reporting period, some of the most notable hacktivist activities were:   Verkada hack – A group of hackers gained unauthorised access to 150,000 video archives of security  cameras by taking over accounts. The hackers claimed responsibility for the attack and their motivation was  to highlight the dangers of mass video surveillance as well as the insufficiency of security controls for  securing these video recordings.225 A Swiss hacker, who claimed hacktivism motives, was arrested and  charged for this cyberattack.226   Black Lives Matter – During the summer of 2020, the hacktivist group Anonymous re-emerged during the  protests related to the death of George Floyd227. The group focused on DDoS attacks against the  Minneapolis police department website as well as releasing e-mail addresses and credentials allegedly  taken from police servers (but it is likely their source was old data breaches228).   BlueLeaks hack – BlueLeaks was probably the most prominent hacktivist operation conducted during the  reporting period. This anonymous hacktivist group leaked more than 1 million documents stolen from a  Texas firm called Netsential that provided web-hosting services to several US law enforcement agencies.224  The leaks were distributed via the DDoSecrets229 platform whose Twitter account was later suspended for  policy violations related to the distribution of hacked data.230  Our assessment is that the threat posed by hacktivists will very likely remain low in the near future. Our opinion is  based on the number, sophistication, and impact of the hacktivists’ operations during the reporting period. The focus  of hacktivists’ activity will remain regional although new movements are gaining traction (e.g. environmental and anti-  discrimination) that are likely to develop hacktivism side-tactics and attract wider public participation for online protest  (and disruption). Finally, It is our opinion that state-backed groups will almost certainly continue to leverage hacktivism  as a disguise to achieve their strategic goals.  225 ZDNet - Verkada disables accounts after reports its security cameras were breached - https://www.zdnet.com/article/verkada-disables-accounts- after-reports-its-security-cameras-were-breached/  226 The Verge - ‘Anti-capitalist’ Verkada hacker charged by US government with attacks on dozens of companies -  https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339625/tillie-kottmann-swiss-hacker-verkada-charged-us-government-verkada  227 BBC - George Floyd: Anonymous hackers re-emerge amid US unrest - https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52879000  228 Troy Hunt -  Analysing the (Alleged) Minneapolis Police Department \"Hack\" -  https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police- department-hack/  229 Krebs on Security - ‘BlueLeaks’ Exposes Files from Hundreds of Police Departments - https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files- from-hundreds-of-police-departments/  230 ZDNet - Twitter bans DDoSecrets account over 'BlueLeaks' police data dump - https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-over- blueleaks-police-data-dump/  https://www.zdnet.com/article/verkada-disables-accounts-after-reports-its-security-cameras-were-breached/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/verkada-disables-accounts-after-reports-its-security-cameras-were-breached/ https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339625/tillie-kottmann-swiss-hacker-verkada-charged-us-government-verkada https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police-department-hack/ https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police-department-hack/ https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files-from-hundreds-of-police-departments/ https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files-from-hundreds-of-police-departments/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-over-blueleaks-police-data-dump/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-over-blueleaks-police-data-dump/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  33  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  34  3. RANSOMWARE  Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organisation’s data and demand payment to  restore access. In some instances, attackers may also steal an organisation’s information and demand additional  payment in return for not disclosing the information to authorities, competitors, or the public.231  Compromise through phishing e-mails and brute-forcing on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services remain the two  most common infection vectors. During the reporting period in 2021, we saw that the Conti and REvil threat actors  dominated the ransomware market from a financial as well as from a volume of infections point of view. Both actors  provide separate ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms through which affiliates can efficiently orchestrate their  attacks. The focus on RaaS-type business models increased during 2021, making proper attribution to individual  threat actors difficult.  The occurrence of multiple extortion schemes also increased strongly during 2021. After initially stealing and  encrypting sensitive data from organisations and threatening to release it publicly unless a payment is made,  attackers also target the organisations’ customers and/or partners for ransom to maximise their profits.  Cryptocurrency remains the most common pay-out method for threat actors. Attackers shifted to Monero as their  cryptocurrency of choice because of its enhanced anonymity and the indistinguishability of transactions.  The average ransom amount doubled over the last year, though small amounts of ransom are still popular with threat  actors. They tend to be paid more easily and result in less public exposure for the threat actor. The higher demands  also increased. Over just a few months, the highest demand made in 2020 more than doubled in 2021.  Some large ransomware operations shut down, whether voluntary or due to actions carried out by law-enforcement  agencies. However, groups have shut down in the past, only to resurface under another operation.  Several ransomware attacks were reported during the ETL reporting period. Figure 5 shows the incidents observed  based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA for the purposes of situational awareness.232 The  scope of the collection is global and multi-sectorial. Incidents, however, with a direct impact in the EU area are given  priority. We have observed a steady increase in ransomware incidents being reported since 2020, and a sharp  increase in May and June 2021. A list of notable ransomware incidents can be found in Annex B.  Figure 5: Ransomware incidents observed by ENISA (April 2020-July 2021)  231 NIST Preliminary Draft NISTIR 8374 - Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management,  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir//draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf  232 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN)  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  35  3.1 TRENDS  3.1.1 Conti and REvil ransomware groups lead the market  Based on crowdsourced ransomware payment data (as illustrated in Figure 6), the ransomware groups with the most  financial gains in 2021 are Conti ($12.7 million), REvil/Sodinokibi ($12 Million), DarkSide ($4.6 Million), MountLocker  ($4.2 Million), Blackmatter ($4.0 Million) and Egregor ($3.1 Million).233  Figure 6: Ransomware data, grouped by family, in 2021. (Source: https://ransomwhe.re/)  When looking at statistics based on trends in responses to ransomware incidents, the ransomware groups with the  most market share in 2021 Q1 are REvil/Sodinokibi (14.2%), Conti V2 (10.2%), Lockbit (7.5%), Clop (7.1%), and  Egregor (5.3%). For 2021 Q2 the top is represented by Sodinokibi (16.5%), Conti V2 (4.4%), Avaddon (5.4%),  Mespinoza (4.9%) and Hello Kitty (4.5%). These last two are newly emerging ransomware variants.234  Both from a financial and an incident perspective, we see that Conti and REvil dominated the ransomware market in  2021. We expect to see no infections from the original REvil/Sodinokibi and Darkside groups in the coming months, as  these have shut down at the time of writing this report. We also waiting to see whether the arrest of Clop members,  involved in money laundering, will impact the rest of their operations.  3.1.2 RDP and phishing remain the most common attack vectors  Initial compromise through RDP has been the major attack vector for the last few years. However, since 2020, we see  that this attack vector is in decline. In contrast, attacks through phishing e-mails rose during 2020.235 In Q2 2020, we  see both vectors as the most used ways to gain an initial foothold. Note that these two vectors are also the cheapest  and thus most profitable methods for threat actors.235  Compromise through RDP is mostly achieved by brute-forcing credentials. The advantage of this method is that threat  actors enter the network using legitimate credentials, allowing them to stay unnoticed. Although organisations with a  higher security maturity will monitor this type of activity, most medium to small businesses will not. Brute-forcing RDP  credentials is possible due to weak credentials, lack of two-factor authentication or a secure tunnel (VPN) to access  the RDP. Compromise of the RDP service itself due to a vulnerability happens but is less common.236  233 Ransomwhere, https://ransomwhe.re  234 Q2 Ransom Payment Amounts Decline as Ransomware becomes a National Security Priority, https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2- ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority  235 Q2 Ransom Payment Amounts Decline as Ransomware becomes a National Security Priority, https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2- ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority  236 Critical RDP Vulnerabilities Continue to Proliferate, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities- continue-to-proliferate/  https://ransomwhe.re/ https://ransomwhe.re/ https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities-continue-to-proliferate/ https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities-continue-to-proliferate/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  36  3.1.3 Ransomware-as-a-Service business model  The use of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms during attacks has become the norm. This type of service offers  a platform for other threat actors, groups, and individuals and is based on an affiliate model. The platform facilitates all  the elements needed to cover a ransomware attack, from file encryption and storage to payment.  The RaaS provider takes a cut on the ransom payments received from the victim, while the affiliate stays in control of  the bounty and the communication towards the victim. The platform makes all the tools needed for easy deployment on  the compromised target, and these tools are under continuous development. Like a healthy business, the RaaS  platforms are continuously adapting to changes in the environment in order to stay undetected by endpoint and network  security tools. RaaS has made ransomware attacks available to any malicious actor, even when they lack technical  knowledge.  3.1.4 Recruiting future insider threats  An upcoming trend in more elaborate ransomware attacks is the active recruitment of employees to assist during the  ransomware campaign. In August 2020, a Russian national was convicted for actively targeting and recruiting an  employee at Tesla. The employee needed to execute malware on his company’s computer system, which would  exfiltrate data from the company’s network. He would then threaten to disclose the data online unless the company  paid a ransom demand. The employee would receive $1,000,000 in bitcoins after the malware was installed.237  Lockbit also promises the gain of ‘millions’ in its insider recruitment program.238  3.1.5 Profit maximisation: a shift from double to multiple extortion  Throughout 2020, double extortion was a common theme during ransomware attacks. This type of attack combines  the traditional encryption of files on the victim’s network and systems, as well as the exfiltration of it. The extracted  data is then hosted and held hostage on a leak or dump-site owned by the ransomware group. These are also  referred to as shame sites. While negotiations are ongoing, the files often remained locked. Some RaaS platforms  include the feature of a timer to indicate the time a victim has left to resolve the payment or negotiate the ransom.  Research showed that in Q3 2020, almost half of all ransomware incidents featured the threat of data release.239  Traditional ransomware attacks would only cripple the organisations’ internal operations. By threatening to release the  data, victims are not only pressured to meet the group’s ransom demand but also by the threat to disclose the breach  to their customers and partners. In previous ransomware incidents, this notification was often neglected due to fear of  impacting business and public relations. Due to the public shaming aspect of breaches due to double extortion  ransomware, companies are in a way incentivised to openly communicate about an incident. The threat to leak  exfiltrated data has increased significantly, from 8.7% in 2020 to 81% in 2021 Q2.240  We see the requirement to report breaches to law enforcement agencies becoming an important theme for  cybersecurity lawmakers.241 An interview with a supposed member of the Lockbit ransomware group mentions that  threat actors are aware of this. They predict that payments can become more difficult for United States-based victims.  Supposedly, Europeans pay immediately out of fear for GDPR fines.242  In 2021, we see another evolution in the maximisation of profit: the emergence of the multiple extortion scheme. After  initially stealing and encrypting sensitive data from organisations and threatening to release it publicly unless a  payment is made, attackers now also target the organisations’ customers and/or partners for ransom.243 In April 2021,  REvil targeted Quanta Computer, a notebook manufacturer. When the company refused to pay any ransom, the  attackers turned their attention to Apple, and threatened to release blueprints they stole through the initial attack.

After targeting RaceTrac Petroleum and threatening to release  the companies’ files, the actor moved forward to contact their customers and partners directly and threaten to release  their files.245 Note that some research describes the use of DDoS as the triple extortion vector, and the ransom  towards the victim’s client then becomes the quadruple extortion. However, a DDoS attack is only used to increase  the pressure but adds no actual ransom or extortion to the process, as the company is already locked out at that  time.246 Through a ransomware breach, third parties themselves become exposed. Like a regular company, the  ransomware actors are constantly on the lookout for more business opportunities. These third-party victims are ideal  vectors to request new ransoms or even start new ransomware campaigns using the internal information that was  previously obtained.  3.1.6 Cryptocurrency for ransom payment: a shift from Bitcoin to Monero  For a few years now, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins have been preferred by cyber threat actors to receive ransom  payments. The promise of a fast, secure, and anonymous channel to move the money made it a perfect solution. The  transparent and decentralised structure makes it a reliable channel and protects the money. In addition, due to the  higher computer power necessary to generate new hashes, and stricter regulations,247 the value of bitcoin has  dramatically increased over the last two years. While the wallet can offer anonymity, it is not untraceable. Due to the  transparency of bitcoin transactions and the wallets associated with specific ransomware groups, it becomes possible  to research the affiliation between groups and follow the payments being made. This data gives an insight to estimate  the actual financial gains of threat actor groups more reliably.  In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline fell victim to a ransomware attack orchestrated by ransomware group DarkSide. The  FBI was involved after the victim had already paid the ransom demand of around 75 bitcoins. By reviewing the Bitcoin  public ledger, law enforcement could track multiple bitcoin transfers and identify that the group had transferred  approximately 63.7 bitcoins to a specific wallet address. It turns out that the FBI had the “private key” needed to  access assets from the specific Bitcoin address. With a seizure warrant, the FBI proceeded to seise the coins. It was  not disclosed how the FBI obtained the private key.248 This operation was a success and the first time law  enforcement retrieved the larger part of a ransom in cryptocurrency.  After the seizure, a shift was noticed towards the use of Monero as cryptocurrency. Monero was launched as an open-  source project to add anonymity and indistinguishability of transactions but quickly gained traction among users and  has had stable growth over the last few years. Ransomware group REvil only accepted Monero in 2021. Other groups  such as DarkSide and Babuk left the choice to the victim but added charges when choosing bitcoin to pay the  ransom.249  While not all are originating from cybercrime, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has seised $1.2 billion worth of  cryptocurrency in 2021 alone.250 Typically, seised wallets are auctioned publicly. In addition, crowdsourced projects  give easy visibility to these payments and the malware families.251  244 Hacker Group Mysteriously Removes Stolen Apple Schematics and Extortion Threat From Ransomware Website,  https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/  245 Ransom Gangs E-mailing Victim Customers for Leverage, https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-e-mailing-victim-customers-for- leverage  246 Ransomware Double Extortion and Beyond: REvil, Clop, and Conti, https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital- threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti  247 Bitcoin falls further as China cracks down on crypto-currencies, https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57169726  248 Department of Justice Seises $2.3 Million in Cryptocurrency Paid to the Ransomware Extortionists Darkside,  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seises-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside  249 Monero emerges as crypto of choice for cybercriminals, https://www.ft.com/content/13fb66ed-b4e2-4f5f-926a-7d34dc40d8b6  250 The IRS has seised $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency this fiscal year – here's what happens to it, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seised- 1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html  251 Ransomwhere, https://ransomwhe.re/  https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/ https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-emailing-victim-customers-for-leverage https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-emailing-victim-customers-for-leverage https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57169726 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside https://www.ft.com/content/13fb66ed-b4e2-4f5f-926a-7d34dc40d8b6 https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seized-1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seized-1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html https://ransomwhe.re/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  38  3.1.7 Money laundering is the weak spot  At some point, threat actors want to convert their ransom from cryptocurrency to money. At that point, maintaining  anonymity over the wallet becomes more challenging. Major cryptocurrency exchanges require proof of identity to  keep a record of payments, which makes it difficult for threat actors to cash out their gains easily. This is where money  laundering schemes come into play.  Researchers used interviews and the investigation of police files to investigate ransomware groups’ modus operandi  to launder their profits. Based on the results, two main models were identified; based on the payment of the ransom 1)  via vouchers and 2) via bitcoins. In the crypto-based model, bitcoins are first sent through a mixer, a mechanism that  groups crypto from different sources together and divides it back via random transactions, in time and value, to other  destination wallets. This mixer makes it more difficult to track where and how the original transaction moves. Bitcoins  are then either exchanged via 1) a bitcoin exchange for money, 2) a (human) bitcoin trader in exchange for physical  money, 3) money laundering services, or 4) used directly as bitcoins.252  Ransomware groups are much more intertwined than was assumed. A large concentration is seen at the deposit  address level, where only 199 addresses received 80% of all funds sent by ransomware addresses in 2020. An even  smaller group of 25 addresses accounts for 46%. The key takeaway is that only the owners of a small pool of  addresses support and control the ability to cash out ransomware gains.253 This concentration is also the weakness of  the ransomware groups. Successful operations against the owners of these addresses could impact their gains and  ability to pay all people involved in the ransomware scheme.  The Nemty ransomware group shut down its operations in April 2020. Researchers discovered internal details of their  operations between 2019 and 2020. The interesting part is that the list of affiliates was disclosed. Through the list,  some well-known nicknames are found. These users can be found all over the place, showing that the affiliates of  RaaS are not working exclusively with one provider. This overlap in users suggests that the core RaaS actors are a  small group of people, which is consistent with the previous section regarding the concentration of deposit  addresses.254  When ransomware groups are investigated, those involved in money laundering have more chances of getting  caught. Transferring cryptocurrency to money is a process where true anonymity is hard to maintain. It was the case  for the Clop ransomware group. Six people were arrested and charged with laundering $500 Million for the gang.255  The laundering schemes used are expected to further develop over the years. Only through proper international  coordination of law-enforcement, but also cooperation with the private sector, e.g. exchanges markets, will we stand a  chance to properly investigate money trails, to disrupt the ransomware operations.  252 Laundering the profits of ransomware: money laundering methods for vouchers and cryptocurrencies, July 2020, European Journal of Crime Criminal  Law and Criminal Justice 28(2):121-152  DOI:10.1163/15718174-02802002  253 Chainalysis - Crypto crime report - 2021  254 The Nemty affiliate model, https://medium.com/csis-techblog/the-nemty-affiliate-model-13f5cf7ab66b  255 Clop ransomware is back in business after recent arrests, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business- after-recent-arrests/  https://medium.com/csis-techblog/the-nemty-affiliate-model-13f5cf7ab66b https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  39  3.1.7.1 The average ransom doubled in 2020  Figure 7: Average ransom, based on data from Coveware256  A study257 suggests that in 2019, the average ransom paid was around $80,000. In 2020, this more than doubled to  an average of $170,000. According to the same study, the average in 2021 Q1 and Q2 was around $180.000. Other  research258 finds that the average ransom increased from $115,123 in 2019 to $312,493 in 2020. Both of these  findings show the same trend. For the first half of 2021, we can conclude that the average amount peaked further.  These figures support the idea that small ransom amounts are still worthwhile for threat actors while also easier for  companies to defend paying.  3.1.8 Highest ransom demands are skyrocketing  Another trend is an increase in the ransom demanded by threat actors. This amount is often the starting point for the  ransom to be paid. If companies want to pay, negotiations are held and, usually, only a part of the initial sum is paid.  The highest ransomware demand grew from $15 million in 2019 to $30 million in 2020.259 Since this research, REvil  has stepped up its game, demanding $50 million from Acer in March 2021.260 A month later, in April, the ransomware  group requested the same amount from Quanta Computer, a supplier to Apple.261 In July 2021, after Kaseya got hit,  they demanded a $70 million ransom to publish the universal decryptor to unlock every device affected.262 Over just a  few months, the highest demand of 2020 more than doubled in 2021. It is likely we will hit the cap of a $100 million  ransom demand in 2022.  With record-high demands, we also see record-high pay-outs. The incidents that are publicly disclosed or that receive  media attention are only the tip of the iceberg. There are other public ransomware incidents with high ransoms, where  the actual amount discussed during negotiation leaked, but payment of the ransom was never confirmed, such as  Garmin in 2020263 ($10 million) and CNA in 2021 ($40 million).264 As long as organisations keep paying, there is no  reason for ransomware groups to lower their demands. The highest pay-outs become a goal or even a reference for  existing and future ransomware groups.  256 https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority  257 Group-IB “Ransomware Uncovered 2020 – 2021” Report  258 Unit42 - Ransomware Threat Report - 2021  259 Unit42 - Ransomware Threat Report - 2021  260 Cyberattaque : une rançon de 50 millions de dollars demandée à Acer, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252498175/Cyberattaque-une-rancon-de-50- millions-de-dollars-demandee-a-Acer  261 Hacker Group Mysteriously Removes Stolen Apple Schematics and Extortion Threat From Ransomware Website,  https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/  262 REvil gang asks for $70 million to decrypt systems locked in Kaseya attack, https://therecord.media/revil-gang-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-systems- locked-in-kaseya-attack/  263 Garmin reportedly paid multimillion-dollar ransom after suffering cyberattack, https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware- attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp  264 One of the biggest US insurance companies reportedly paid hackers $40 million ransom after a cyberattack, https://www.businessinsider.com/cna- financial-hackers-40-million-ransom-cyberattack-2021-5  https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252498175/Cyberattaque-une-rancon-de-50-millions-de-dollars-demandee-a-Acer https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252498175/Cyberattaque-une-rancon-de-50-millions-de-dollars-demandee-a-Acer https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/ https://therecord.media/revil-gang-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-systems-locked-in-kaseya-attack/ https://therecord.media/revil-gang-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-systems-locked-in-kaseya-attack/ https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp https://www.businessinsider.com/cna-financial-hackers-40-million-ransom-cyberattack-2021-5 https://www.businessinsider.com/cna-financial-hackers-40-million-ransom-cyberattack-2021-5  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  40  3.1.9 Overall increase in costs and revenue loss due to ransomware  When a ransomware incident happens, organisations are confronted with a lot of cost. These costs include the  amount of ransom, downtime, and the cost of people and actual operational and technical remediation, etc. A survey  conducted across 30 countries showed that the overall cost of remediating a ransomware attack has vastly increased,  from $761,106 in 2020 to $1.85 million in 2021.265 The results suggest that the overall cost of a ransomware incident  more than doubled in only one year.  During a ransomware attack, key infrastructure is often targeted to paralyse the organisation, causing the inability to  provide proper service and run internal operations. The average downtime of organisations has increased over the  last year. Research shows that the average downtime increased from 15 days in Q1 2020 to 23 days in Q2 2021.266  Aside from the costs related to the incident, repercussions on business opportunities and revenues have also been  observed. A survey of 1,263 respondents reported that 66% of their organisations suffered significant revenue losses  due to ransomware attacks, where company sise appears to have minimal impact on revenue loss.267 The results  underline the fact that every industry vertical is vulnerable to a statistically significant chance of revenue loss following  successful ransomware.  3.1.10 The volatility of ransomware groups; shutdowns and arrests  Whether voluntary or based on actions from law-enforcement agencies, we saw large ransomware operations going  offline. In the past, groups have shut down, only to resurface under another name.  In November 2020, the Maze ransomware group announced the end of its operations. Maze published data referring  to more than 300 successful ransomware operations. It is believed that the group behind Maze will eventually reform  as the Egregor group. 268  In January 2021, a Canadian national was charged in relation to NetWalker ransomware attacks in which tens of  millions of dollars were allegedly obtained.269  By the end of January 2021, the FonixCrypter or Fonix Ransomware group announced the shutdown of their  operation and released the master decryption key.270 While not confirmed, there are some indications that the group  were arrested.  The threat actors behind Ziggy ransomware shut down their operation one week later, also releasing the decryption  keys. They sent out a message about feeling guilty for their actions.271 Research on their ransomware sample showed  Gaza, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as white-listed countries.272 Note that white-listing specific countries is a  common practice in malware.  In February 2021, three people from the Egregor ransomware group were arrested in Ukraine following a joint  operation between French and Ukrainian law enforcement.273 Egregor operated a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)  business for affiliates and had around 200 public victims.

After analysing their decryptor,  researchers stated that it caused significant damage due to faulty code, leading to unreliable and sometimes faulty  decryption, destroying the files in the process.276  In May 2021, the DarkSide ransomware group, which also operated with a RaaS model, announced the group’s  shutdown closely after the attack on Colonial Pipeline. After the attack, the group initially announced they would ‘vet’  the targets of their affiliates and explained that their motives were not political or destructive. Another announcement  was later made that they would cease their operations and send out decryptors to all the victims. The statement,  posted in the Russian language, claimed that an unspecified law enforcement agency disrupted part of its  infrastructure.277 It is still uncertain whether this information was factual or part of an exit strategy for the group. Note  that the decryptor used by DarkSide was also not well designed, and the decryption process ran too slow for efficient  recovery of their victims’ operations. Therefore, even after paying for the decryptor, they had to resort to their own  backups to help restore the system.278  In June 2021, a Latvian national faced charges stemming from her alleged role in a transnational cybercrime  organisation responsible for creating and deploying a computer banking trojan and ransomware suite of malware  known as Trickbot.279  Later in June, six members from the Clop ransomware group were detained in Ukraine after a joint operation between  Ukraine, South Korea, and the United States.280 While the authorities claimed to have shut down the group’s  infrastructure successfully, the ransomware operation is still in business and is listing new victims on their data leak  site. The operations targeted the money-laundering side of the operation, while the platform core members were not  apprehended.281  In July 2021, Avaddon, a ransomware group operating a RaaS platform, announced the shutdown of their operation.  Along with the announcement, they released 2,934 decryption keys, one for each of their victims.282 This number of  decryption keys shows that the number of reported ransomware infections is just the tip of the iceberg.  Later in July, REvil/Sodinokibi shut down its operations.283 Note that this is just days after the communication between  the United States and Russia regarding the increase in ransomware attacks. High-profile victims of the group were  Kaseya and its many managed service provider (MSP) customers and JBS Foods.  New groups have mysteriously emerged while these others shut down. Backmatter, for example, is a group that is  actively recruiting affiliates or ‘initial access brokers’.284 However, encryption algorithms found in a decryptor show that  the group is, in fact, a rebrand of the DarkSide ransomware operation. Grief, another new group, is a rebrand of  274 Egregor ransomware affiliates arrested by Ukrainian, French police, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware- affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/  275 Chainanalysis = The 2021 Crypto Crime Report  276 McAfee: Babuk ransomware decryptor causes encryption 'beyond repair', https://www.zdnet.com/article/mcafee-babuk-ransomware-decryptor- causes-encryption-beyond-repair/  277 DarkSide Ransomware Shutdown: An Exit Scam or Running for Hills?, https://www.securityweek.com/darkside-ransomware-shutdown-exit-scam-or- running-hills  278 Colonial Pipeline Paid Hackers Nearly $5 Million in Ransom, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers- nearly-5-million-in-ransom  279 Latvian National Charged for Alleged Role in Transnational Cybercrime Organisation, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged- alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organisation  280 Cuffed: Ukraine police collar six Clop ransomware gang suspects in joint raids with South Korean cops,  https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/clop_ransomware_gang_arrests_ukraine/  281 Clop ransomware is back in business after recent arrests, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business- after-recent-arrests/  282 Avaddon ransomware shuts down and releases decryption keys, https://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down- and-releases-decryption-keys/  283 Ransomware Giant REvil’s Sites Disappear, https://threatpost.com/ransomware-revil-sites-disappears/167745/  284 BlackMatter, a new ransomware group, claims link to DarkSide, REvil, https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2021/07/blackmatter-a-new- ransomware-group-claims-link-to-darkside-revil/  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/mcafee-babuk-ransomware-decryptor-causes-encryption-beyond-repair/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/mcafee-babuk-ransomware-decryptor-causes-encryption-beyond-repair/ https://www.securityweek.com/darkside-ransomware-shutdown-exit-scam-or-running-hills https://www.securityweek.com/darkside-ransomware-shutdown-exit-scam-or-running-hills https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/clop_ransomware_gang_arrests_ukraine/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/ https://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/ https://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/ https://threatpost.com/ransomware-revil-sites-disappears/167745/ https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2021/07/blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-claims-link-to-darkside-revil/ https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2021/07/blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-claims-link-to-darkside-revil/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  42  DoppelPaymer, according to research.285 Other newcomers are AvosLocker286, and Haron. The latter is based on  Avaddon source code and has the same look-and-feel. 287  What this indicates is that these shutdown operations are often nothing more than rebranding operations. The goal is  not always clear, whether to fool or distract law enforcement agencies and researchers or to deal with unhappy  affiliates. The fact remains that all these groups share common malware writers, overlapping source code, and  affiliates that use the platform. Over time, they will all disappear and re-emerge in one way or another. Overall, we see  law enforcement actions taking place, but the impact on the operations of these groups remains limited.  3.1.11 Increased usage of zero-day vulnerabilities  In the past, zero-days were only used for targeted attacks by advanced threat actor groups and nation-states. The  reason is, of course, the cost (value) of such a zero-day. Threat actors can only re-use it as long as the attack vector  and payload are not discovered. Therefore, threat actors will carefully select the target and consider what it is  potentially worth, and whether and when to ‘burn’ an exploit.  In December 2020, Accellion patched a zero-day vulnerability in its legacy File Transfer Appliance product. The  vulnerability turned out to be one in a cascade of vulnerabilities. Four zero-days (CVE-2021-27101,288 CVE-2021-  27102,289 CVE-2021-27103,290 CVE-2021-27104291) were used to extract the data of its customers. The victims then  received extortion e-mails from an actor claiming association with the Clop ransomware team gang. Technically  speaking, no ransomware was deployed, but the actors threatened to expose the stolen data if no ransom was paid.292  REvil used CVE-2021-30116 293 and two other CVEs,294 to target Kaseya VSA management software and its MSP  customers. A side note here is that the mentioned CVE had been discovered previously by security researchers and  had been disclosed internally to Kaseya, which in the strictest of terms means that this wasn’t a zero-day anymore, at  least not for the companies involved.  After the initial publication of a zero-day vulnerability, we generally see an increase in attacks, where threat actors try  to target as many unpatched victims as possible. In June 2021, The PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675295)  was initially discovered. Magniber ransomware was observed quickly adapting and weaponising the PrintNightmare  vulnerability to target victims, mainly in South Korea.296  With the increase in ransoms, we see more zero-days being used to gain a foothold in an organisation and execute a  ransomware attack. It shows that the potential revenue of a ransomware attack is higher than the cost of the exploit.  Especially in operations at scale, this makes a lot of sense. The decrease in the number of attacks and the focus on  large organisations allows for threat actors to ask for high ransoms. This focus on a high pay-out is referred to as big  game hunting (BGH). Instead of targeting a large pool of targets using prevalent malware distribution vectors such as  phishing, victims are carefully studied, and sophisticated methods are used to breach these high-value targets. The  focus and potential of BGH dominated the ecosystem of cybercrime in 2020 and boosted the market for network  access brokers. This way, BGH trends disrupted traditional targeted cybercrime behaviour.297  285 DoppelPaymer ransomware gang rebrands as the Grief group, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang- rebrands-as-the-grief-group/  286 AvosLocker Under The Lens: A New Sophisticated Ransomware Group  , https://blog.cyble.com/2021/07/15/avoslocker-under-the-lens-a-new-sophisticated-ransomware-group/  287 New Haron ransomware gang emerges, borrows from Avaddon and Thanos, https://therecord.media/new-haron-ransomware-gang-emerges- borrowing-from-avaddon-and-thanos/  288 CVE-2021-27101 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27101  289 CVE-2021-27102 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27102  290 CVE-2021-27103 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27103  291 CVE-2021-27104 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27104  292 Accellion FTA Zero-Day Attacks Show Ties to Clop Ransomware, FIN11, https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware- fin11/164150/  293 CVE-2021-20116 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30116  294 Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited in the wild in July 2021, https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE- 2021-30116  295 Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675  296 Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks: 2017 Magniber Ransomware Uses PrintNightmare Vulnerability to Infect Victims in South Korea,  https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/magniber-ransomware-caught-using-printnightmare-vulnerability/  297 Crowdstrike - Global Threat Report - 2021  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/ https://blog.cyble.com/2021/07/15/avoslocker-under-the-lens-a-new-sophisticated-ransomware-group/ https://therecord.media/new-haron-ransomware-gang-emerges-borrowing-from-avaddon-and-thanos/ https://therecord.media/new-haron-ransomware-gang-emerges-borrowing-from-avaddon-and-thanos/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27101 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27102 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27103 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27104 https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware-fin11/164150/ https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware-fin11/164150/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30116 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116 https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675 https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/magniber-ransomware-caught-using-printnightmare-vulnerability/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  43  3.1.12 Insurance fuels the ransomware industry economy  With the general increase in cybersecurity incidents, organisations are more prone to take out cybersecurity  insurance. Taking out insurance is part of a risk strategy in which you transfer the risk to a third party. Being insured  doesn’t mean that the security risks are mitigated. Instead, the risk of associated costs in case of an incident is  reduced. Companies faced with ransomware incidents will more readily pay, knowing that they have insurance  coverage. Research points out that ransomware coverage in insurance policies is not only encouraging threat actors,  but the practice may be fuelling the entire ransomware economy.298 The insurance industry is facing criticism over  this. The largest insurance organisation in the United States defends ransom payment reimbursements.299 One of  Europe’s top five insurers announced in May 2021 it would suspend ransomware crime reimbursement. Note that this  suspension only covered France.300  Ransomware coverage in cybersecurity insurance becomes unsustainable as the ransoms will only increase in value  and numbers.301 A survey showed that in 2020, 26% of the victims paid the ransom to get their data back. This  number rose to 32% for 2021.302 More victims are thus paying their ransom. This rise will impact insurance companies  and the cost of an insurance policy. An insurer with 25.000 small and midsise customers in North America reported  that in 2020, 41% of their customer claims were related to ransomware attacks.303  Insurance companies can play an important role by requiring their customers to improve their IT security. However,  insurance companies often only impose basic risk assessments, including security tests, to validate whether a  baseline is covered within the organisation. A common requirement is to do vulnerability scanning against the external  perimeter of the organisation’s IT infrastructure. While this is certainly a good initiative, it results in a narrow  representation of the company’s security posture and the associated risk. However, an article suggests that  ransomware-related claims dropped by 65% following the insurance’s security scans.304 As previously discussed,  RDP exposure on the external infrastructure has been a preferred way for intrusion for a long time and could explain  why scanning for remote services on the external perimeter does reduce the likelihood of ransomware incidents.  3.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following proposed recommendations provide the basis for the development of a mitigation strategy for the  prevention of and response against ransomware.   Implementation of secure and redundant backup strategies;   Implementation and auditing of identity and access management (least-privilege and separation of duties);   Training and raising the awareness of users (including privileged users);   Separation of development and production environments;   Information sharing on incidents with authorities and the industry;   Restricting access to known ransomware sites;   Identities and credentials should be issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorised devices,  users, and processes;305   Access permissions and authorisations should be managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and  separation of duties;305   Separation of development and production environments;305   Ransomware response and recovery plans should be tested periodically to ensure that risk and response  assumptions and processes are current with respect to the evolving ransomware threats;305   Use of security products or services that block access to known ransomware sites;306  298 https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/occasional-papers/cyber-insurance-and-cyber-security-challenge  299 https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/07/02/621178.htm  300 https://apnews.com/article/europe-france-technology-business-caabb132033ef2aaee9f58902f3e8fba  301 Cyber Insurance and the Cyber Security Challenge Jamie MacColl, Jason R C Nurse and James Sullivan - Royal United Services Institute (RUSI)  302 https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf  303 Cyber Insurance Claims Report – H1 2020 – Coalition - coalitioninc.com  304 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyber-insurers-security-scans-reduced-ransomware-claims-by-65-percent/  305 Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management (Preliminary Draft),  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf  306 NIST Releases Tips and Tactics for Dealing with Ransomware, https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/nist-releases-tips-and-tactics- dealing-ransomware  https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/occasional-papers/cyber-insurance-and-cyber-security-challenge https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/07/02/621178.htm https://apnews.com/article/europe-france-technology-business-caabb132033ef2aaee9f58902f3e8fba https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyber-insurers-security-scans-reduced-ransomware-claims-by-65-percent/ https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/nist-releases-tips-and-tactics-dealing-ransomware https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/nist-releases-tips-and-tactics-dealing-ransomware  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  44   Execution of the Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA), a tool developed by CISA geared towards IT  and ICS (industrial control system) networks, to evaluate their security against varying levels of ransomware  threat readiness;307   Report any attack or attempted attack to the authorities and help restrict its spread;308   Systems’ monitoring for fast identification of infections; and   Keeping up with recent ransomware trends, developments and proposals for prevention.  307 US CISA Introduced Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA), https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/07/06/us-cisa-introduced-ransomware- readiness-assessment-rra-in-its-cset-security-software/  308 StopRansomware.gov – Report Ransomware https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/report-ransomware-0  https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/07/06/us-cisa-introduced-ransomware-readiness-assessment-rra-in-its-cset-security-software/ https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/07/06/us-cisa-introduced-ransomware-readiness-assessment-rra-in-its-cset-security-software/ https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/report-ransomware-0  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  45  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  46  4. MALWARE  Malware is an umbrella term that describes any software, firmware or code intended to perform a malicious  unauthorised process that will have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system.  Examples of malware could be a virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entities that infect a host. Spyware  and some forms of adware are also part of the malware term.309  A malware can have various and different capabilities depending on the goal of the creator. For example RATs (Remote  Access Trojans/Tools) are malware that allow an actor remote control of an infected system. Infostealers or Skimmers  are designed to capture credit card information. Botnets are a robot network of computers infected by malware and  controlled by C&C servers. Trojans, which can be either a banking Trojan or a mobile Trojan depending on the target,  are malware that are often disguised as legitimate software.  The threat of malware appears consistently in the ETL, with new families and strains emerging every year despite the  laudable efforts of law enforcement to take them down. In the following paragraphs, we describe general trends that  emerged during the reporting period. A list of notable malware incidents can be found in Annex B.  In addition, it  needs to be emphasised’ clarified that mitigation vectors are generic in nature and security professionals need to look  for specific mitigation vectors for different malware families.  4.1 TRENDS  4.1.1 Decline of 2020 continues over 2021  Malware attacks decreased heavily during the reporting period. Research has shown that attacks in North America  decreased by 43% in 2020 compared to 2019. This drop was almost same in Europe, while a decrease of 53% was  noticed in Asia.310 One of the key factors for this reduction could be linked to the COVID19 pandemic. Employees  worked more from home and used their consumer ISPs and personal computers for work-related activities. This home  environment and infrastructure doesn’t have the same level of protection and detection, limiting the visibility of malware  infections. The reduction in this visibility can cause a gap when collected statistical data is based only on detecting  infections in the corporate environment.  In 2021, the decrease in malware infections is continuing. Research shows a further reduction of 22% over the first six  months of 2021, compared to this period last year.311 Note that a reduction in total malware volume does not mean that  cybercrime declined. In the past, malware was used to infect a maximum of victims. Today, the focus is less on quantity  and more on the quality of infections. In 2019, the number of malicious Office and PDF files was equal. Throughout  2020, the number of malicious Office files increased heavily until they exceeded PDF files by 150%. In 2021, the share  of malware on both these file types dropped, with executable files gaining the ground they had lost.311  For 2020, the most detected malware categories in corporate environments included botnets (28%), cryptominers  (21%), infostealers (16%), mobile (15%), banking (14%), and ransomware (4%).312 In June 2021, the most common  malware families detected were Trickbot (botnet and banking), XMRig (cryptominer), Formbook (infostealer), Glupteba  (botnet), and Agent Tesla (infostealer).313 Notice that these malware families did not change a lot over the last year.  One noticeable difference is the fact that Emotet was taken down and Trickbot took over its market share314.  309 NIST Special Publication 800-171 Revision 2 (updated 01-28-2021),  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf  310 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report  311 Mid-Year Update: 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report  312 2021 Checkpoint CYBER SECURITY REPORT  313 June 2021’s Most Wanted Malware: Trickbot Remains on Top - Check Point Software  314 https://threatpost.com/trickbot-takes-over-emotet/164710/  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/07/13/june-2021s-most-wanted-malware-trickbot-remains-on-top/ https://threatpost.com/trickbot-takes-over-emotet/164710/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  47  4.1.2 Windows container malware  Malware targeting container environments has become much more prevalent. The technology of containerisation allows  scaling easily. Malware focusing on the cloud-native stack, is in essence, not new. In November 2020, malicious  container images had been already identified, and were used to find and exploit vulnerabilities on a particular victim’s  Kubernetes environment.315 In December 2020, researchers also discovered the existence of file-less malware being  executed from memory.316 Common defence mechanisms or static scanners would not detect this type of infection. In  March 2021, researchers uncovered the first known malware that targets Windows containers.317 Other typical initial  infection vectors include misconfigured container dashboards, APIs or daemons, or security issues in the application  hosted on the container environment.  The most common goal of this type of malware is to escape the container, to infect the whole cluster. Clusters are  generally collections of multiple applications, which increases the impact of such an infection heavily.  Common compromises include the leakage of sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers etc. In  addition, container technology is often used as a best practice during the development lifecycle to spin up separate  environments quickly. Compromise of development environments could result in further supply-chain attacks. Attackers  stay under the radar and build in backdoors through source-code commits. The modified software is spread and used  as an infection vector, targeting the software’s users through genuine installers or the software’s update functionality.  Patch management for container infrastructure is often disregarded because of the short lifespan of container instances.  However, the discovered attacks underline the importance of protecting all exposed infrastructure. Automated tools  execute attacks in a short time, enough to steal files or escape to the cluster. Once the cluster is owned, all data and  code should be considered compromised.  4.1.3 Mobile Malware  In 2020, fake ad blockers, also referred to as adware, were on the rise on Android. This type of malicious application  tempts the user with “add blocking” capabilities, asks for extensive permissions on the operating system, and starts  using all sorts of notifications and browser redirects to present ads and thus generate revenue. A close variant is the  hiddenAds mobile malware. In 2020, detection of this malware type increased from 280.000 to 700.000 compared to  2019.318 The large proportion of adware in mobile malware continues throughout 2021. 45% Of mobile malware was  identified as adware in the first half of 2021.319  Installation of these applications usually happens through third-party  app stores as well as in online forums.  Mobile banking malware saw an increase in 2020. The malware tries to steal online banking credentials and payment  information by showing fake login screens. The malware is then capable of performing transactions on accounts with  financial institutions. The most common malicious banking applications in 2021 include Ghimob, Eventbot, and Thiefbot.  Other common malware is Blackrock, Wroba, and TrickMO.320  In May 2021, Flubot infections increased using SMS as a spreading mechanism. The increase was mainly noticed in  Europe and the UK. In most messages, either government (COVID-19 related) or package delivery brands were  impersonated to lure victims into installing a malicious application.321  Most malware is based on malicious applications that users install. In 2020 and 2021, there have been some cases of  significant vulnerabilities in popular applications allowing remote code execution, but malicious applications were not  reported to target these actively. There have been cases of zero-day vulnerabilities targeting the mobile platform instead  of an application. However, the victims of these attacks are very specific and high profile. The Pegasus spyware for iOS  is used worldwide to target journalists, activists, and politicians. The malware uses two zero-click malware variants: the  315 https://blog.aquasec.com/kubernetes-vulnerability-security-threat  316 https://blog.aquasec.com/fileless-malware-container-security  317 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/siloscape/  318 State of Malware 2021 - Malwarebytes  319 https://press.avast.com/avast-reports-continued-dominance-of-adware-among-android-threats  320 Checkpoint – Cyber Security Report 2021  321 https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/05/17/take-action-now-flubot-malware-may-be-on-its-way/  https://blog.aquasec.com/kubernetes-vulnerability-security-threat https://blog.aquasec.com/fileless-malware-container-security https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/siloscape/ https://press.avast.com/avast-reports-continued-dominance-of-adware-among-android-threats https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/05/17/take-action-now-flubot-malware-may-be-on-its-way/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  48  Kismet exploit in 2020 and the Forcedentry (Megalodon) in 2021.322 In July 2021, a list of 50.000 victims of these  targeted attacks leaked.323  4.1.4 Detection is bypassed using exotic languages  Malware developers resort to relatively new or uncommon programming languages. While not entirely new, this trend  has continued to evolve throughout 2020 and 2021. These uncommon languages include but are not limited to Rust,  Nim, DLang, and Go324. The main motive is to bypass detection capabilities.  As most of the detection capability of malware is based on static indicators, these become irrelevant or ineffective when  the source code is rewritten in a new language.325 From a reverse engineering perspective, it also becomes more  challenging to analyse these new malware samples. Either entire rulesets must be rewritten to match patterns in the  newly written malware, or focus needs to be shifted to the detection of dynamic or behaviour-based signatures. An  example of this trend was reported in May 2021, when the original Buer malware was shown to have been rewritten in  Rust, named RustyBuer. Their similarity is based on nearly identical communication structures between the command-  and-control servers and the infected host.326  Malware written in these emerging programming languages only represents a fraction of all the malware being  developed today. Still, it is an important aspect for the future development of malware detection and code analysis  techniques. Migrating to other languages could mean that the scanners and defenders of today lose effectiveness and  ability to detect the malware of tomorrow.  4.1.5 Malware disruption  Emotet is a strain of computer malware. Initially, the malware acted as a banking trojan. Over the years, the malware  evolved and gained more ground. The functionality shifted from a simple information stealer to malware used to create  an advanced botnet. The malware featured a well-developed command and control (C2) infrastructure, frequent updates  and was very effective in evading detection.  In 2020, the malware used Trickbot and QBot to steal credentials and spread inside networks.327 Throughout 2020,  Emotet had been the most prevalent malware. The victims, part of the botnet, were often sold to other threat actors for  targeted cyber-crime, such as ransomware or information stealing.  In January 2021, Interpol announced a crackdown on the botnet. Law enforcement and judicial authorities worldwide  cooperated and took control of the botnet’s infrastructure in a coordinated international action.328 Through the C2  infrastructure, they delivered ‘updates’ to the malware, which would cause it to uninstall itself in April 2021. The Ukrainian  government arrested two individuals in relation to this investigation.329  The fight against cyber-crime is an ongoing and uneven battle. However, this case shows that through international  cooperation, law enforcement can have an impact.  4.1.6 High-Risk Vulnerabilities Across Major Vendors increase in 2021  At the end of 2020 and on into 2021 a wide spread of products were affected by high-risk vulnerabilities.  Critical, easily exploited vulnerabilities appeared in multiple products from vendors such as Microsoft, Apple, Google,  Adobe, Dell, SonicWall, QNAP, and VMWare. Another example is the vulnerabilities found in Apple software which were  also increasingly exploited in 2021. Attackers, such as the Silver Sparrow malware, have been targeting Apple products.  322 https://citisenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/  323 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus  324 https://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-developers-turn-to-exotic-programming-languages-to-thwart-researchers/  325 OLD DOGS NEW TRICKS:ATTACKERS ADOPT EXOTIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES – https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs- new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages  326 https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/new-variant-buer-loader-written-rust  327 https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2074889/0/en/July-2020-s-Most-Wanted-Malware-Emotet-Strikes-Again-After-Five- Month-Absence.html  328 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action  329 https://www.cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-transnaczionalne-ugrupovannya-xakeriv-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-najnebezpechnishogo-v- sviti-kompyuternogo-virusu-emotet-2504/  https://citisenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus https://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-developers-turn-to-exotic-programming-languages-to-thwart-researchers/ https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs-new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs-new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/new-variant-buer-loader-written-rust https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2074889/0/en/July-2020-s-Most-Wanted-Malware-Emotet-Strikes-Again-After-Five-Month-Absence.html https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2074889/0/en/July-2020-s-Most-Wanted-Malware-Emotet-Strikes-Again-After-Five-Month-Absence.html https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action https://www.cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-transnaczionalne-ugrupovannya-xakeriv-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-najnebezpechnishogo-v-sviti-kompyuternogo-virusu-emotet-2504/ https://www.cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-transnaczionalne-ugrupovannya-xakeriv-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-najnebezpechnishogo-v-sviti-kompyuternogo-virusu-emotet-2504/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  49  This malware is the second known piece of macOS malware to feature a program compiled for the new M1 chip that  Apple introduced in November 2020.330  In many cases these vulnerabilities had already been exploited by the time they were disclosed. Accellion and the  vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange in Q1 2021 were among the most prominent.330  4.1.7 Malware as a business  Malware as a service is not a new trend. The move from static exploit kits to cloud-based rental models were discovered  in the past. We will not focus here on Ransomware-As-A-Service (RaaS), as this is covered in the previous chapter.  4.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  During the reporting period several good practices and mitigation vectors concerning malware were noted, as follows:   Implement malware detection for all inbound/outbound channels, including e-mail, network, web and  application systems in all applicable platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal computers and  mobile devices).   Inspect the SSL/TLS traffic allowing the firewall to decrypt what is being transmitted to and from websites, e-  mail communications, and mobile applications.   Establish interfaces between malware detection functions (intelligence-led threat hunting) and security  incident management to establish efficient response capabilities.   Use the tools available for malware analysis for sharing malware information and malware mitigation (i.e.  MISP).   Develop security policies that specify the processes to be followed in the event of infection.   Understand the capabilities of various security tools and develop new security solutions. Identify gaps and  apply the defence-in-depth principle.   Employ mail filtering (or spam filtering) for malicious e-mails and remove executable attachments.   Regularly monitor the results of antivirus tests.   Use patch management for container infrastructure.   Make use of log monitoring using security incident and event management (SIEM) solutions. Indicative log  sources are anti-virus alerts, endpoint detection and response (EDR), proxy server logs, Windows Event and  Sysmon logs, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs, etc.   Disable or reduce access to PowerShell functions.  330 https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0831.pdf  https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0831.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  50  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  51  5. CRYPTOJACKING  Cryptojacking or hidden cryptomining is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim’s computing  power to generate cryptocurrency. This usually occurs when the victim unwittingly installs a program with malicious  scripts that allow the cybercriminal to access their computer or other Internet-connected devices, e.g. by clicking on an  unknown link in an e-mail or visiting an infected website. Programs called ‘coin miners’ are then used by the criminal to  create or ‘mine’ cryptocurrencies.331  During the reporting period we saw a growing trend in cryptojacking, which could perhaps be associated with the  increasing volatility in the cryptocurrency market that was observed during the same period. Moreover, given that  cryptocurrencies offer (pseudo) anonymity, they become a very attractive and convenient means of exchange by  cybercriminals. Accordingly, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are requested when asking for ransom  in ransomware attacks. A list of notable cryptojaking incidents can be found in Annex B.  5.1 TRENDS  5.1.1 Cryptojacking volume in 2021 is record high  Since 2019, we have witnessed a steady decline in drive-by cryptominers, the dominant type for the past few years332.  The decline, which is aligned to the diminishing value of drive-by mining profitability, was hastened by the shutdown of  Coinhive in March 2019 and JSECoin in April 2020, as described in last year’s ETL report.333 334 However, attackers  have moved on to other types of malicious activities when it comes to cryptojacking/cryptomining, with Cisco reporting  that 69% of its customers had been affected by cryptomining malware in 2020.335 According to the same report,  cryptomining generated the most DNS traffic out of any other malicious activity.  In March of 2020, a spike in infections was seen, after which the infection rate dropped dramatically. From the second  to the last quarter of 2020, the volume of infections increased slowly and this continued in 2021.335 In the first quarter  of 2021, the volume of infections attained a record high compared to the last few years.336 Other statistics confirm this  trend, showing that during the first quarter of 2021, cryptomining malware increased by 117%.337 This last report links  this increase to the growth in 64-bit mining applications.337  We can conclude that financial gain associated with  cryptojacking incentivised the associated threat actors to carry out these attacks. Based on the fluctuating value of  cryptocurrency, we assume this will remain an important attack vector over the coming year.  When comparing the exchange rate of Bitcoin with the volume of cryptominers, we clearly see how both are related. As  mentioned in the ETL 2021 Ransomware report,338 threat actors are shifting from Bitcoin, which provides pseudo-  anonymity, to using strongly private cryptocurrency such as Monero.339 Europol reports that cryptocurrencies continue  to facilitate payments for various forms of cybercrime, as developments evolve with respect to privacy oriented crypto  coins and services.340  331 Interpol, Cybercrime-Cryptojacking September 2020, https://www.interpol.int/content/download/15670/file/Cybercrime-Cryptojacking-EN.pdf  332 https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptojacking-cryptocurrency-million-hits-first-half-2019  333 Check Point - Cyber security report - 2021  334 ENISA Threat Landscape - Cryptojacking 2020  335 https://blogs.cisco.com/security/threat-trends-dns-security-part-1  336 SonicWall - Cyber Threat Report : Mid-Year Update: 2021 |  337 McAfee Labs Threats Report - June 2021  338 ENISA Threat Landscape - Ransomware 2021  339 SonicWall - Cyber Threat Report - 2021  340 IOCTA Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment - 2020.  https://www.interpol.int/content/download/15670/file/Cybercrime-Cryptojacking-EN.pdf https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptojacking-cryptocurrency-million-hits-first-half-2019 https://blogs.cisco.com/security/threat-trends-dns-security-part-1  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  52  5.1.2 XMRig dominates the cryptomining market  In 2020, the global market of cryptomining malware was dominated by XMRig (35%), JSECoin (27%), Lucifer (7%),  WannaMine (6%), RubyMiner (5%), and others (20%).341 JSECoin was an open-source miner that shut down its  services in April 2020 due to financial uncertainties after the COVID-19 pandemic.342  XMRig343, an open-source miner, is used by attackers and most malware to perform cryptomining on victims unwillingly.  Over the first half of 2021, its market share increased to 51%, accounting for more than half of all cryptomining malware.  Other infections are related to Lucifer (10%), LemonDuck (5%), RubyMiner (5%), Wannamine (5%), and other miners  (20%).344 First discovered in May 2020, the Lucifer malware can, amongst other things, execute DDoS attacks, exploit  vulnerable Windows hosts, and perform brute-force attacks. These features allowed the malware to propagate itself  rapidly. Under the hood, the malware drops XMRig to mine.345 The LemonDuck malware strain is already a few years  old and is gaining more ground in 2021. It is also a self-propagating cryptominer, dropping XMRig on the victim to  perform mining tasks. Since April 2021, the malware has been targeting unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers,  suffering back then from multiple zero-days.346 Microsoft reported that cryptominers were some of the first payloads to  target these vulnerabilities actively, illustrating how well these could adapt to use make of new exploits.347  Even though Wannemine and RubyMine are older XMRig dropping malware variants, they still retain a foothold in 2021.  Wannamine further limits its malicious activity on the infected host, focusing solely on the mining.348  5.1.3 Shift from browser to file-based cryptojacking  Research showed that for the first trimester of 2021, desktop or file-based cryptojackers were almost seven times more  frequent than browser-based miners, at 13% for browser-based compared to 87% for file-based.349  Other research confirms that since the shutdown of Coinhive, the share of browser-based cryptomining dropped. This  gap is filled by file-based crypto-jackers, which first compromise the victim’s host and then drop mining software on it.350  In general, cryptojacking accounted for a mere 2.5% of malware used in breaches and only 1.5% of malware in incidents.  Around 10% of organisations received (and blocked) cryptocurrency mining malware at some point throughout the  course of the year351.  5.1.4 Infection methods do not change  The techniques used to spread and deploy cryptominers do not differ much from other malware infection methods. A  drive-by download is a technique used to deliver and install malicious files on a victim’s device without its knowledge.  This happens passively when visiting malicious websites, triggering a download that takes advantage of the operating  system or the web browser, which contain security flaws. Notice that compromised websites are also used as a delivery  vector for cryptominers. Another distribution method is malvertising, the act of spreading malware through  advertisements.  Cryptominers are often delivered as applications that hide their malicious behaviour. Typical examples are mobile  applications.352 While these applications are subject to automated security validation before being published on the  application store, these detections are not always adequate. Alternative stores are also used to spread malicious mobile  applications.  341 Check Point - Cyber security report - 2021  342 JSEcoin Ltd, https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CZLnRC2thW4J:https://jsecoin.com/nl/home/+&cd=2&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=be  343 XMRig, https://xmrig.com/  344 Check Point - Cyber security: Mid year report - 2021  345 Lucifer: New Cryptojacking and DDoS Hybrid Malware Exploiting High and Critical Vulnerabilities to Infect Windows Devices,  https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lucifer-new-cryptojacking-and-ddos-hybrid-malware/  346 Lemon Duck spreads its wings: Actors target Microsoft Exchange servers, incorporate new TTPs, https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/lemon- duck-spreads-wings.html  347 Analyzing attacks taking advantage of the Exchange Server vulnerabilities, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks- taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/  348 INCIBE (National Cybersecurity Institute) - WannaMine analysis study – April 2021  349 ESET - Threat report - T1 2021  350 SonicWall - Cyber Threat Report - 2021  351 Verizon DBIR 2020  352 https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/fake-cryptocurrency-mining-apps-trick-victims-into-watching-ads-.html  https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CZLnRC2thW4J:https://jsecoin.com/nl/home/+&cd=2&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=be https://xmrig.com/ https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lucifer-new-cryptojacking-and-ddos-hybrid-malware/ https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/lemon-duck-spreads-wings.html https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/lemon-duck-spreads-wings.html https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  53  There are also deceptive mobile applications claiming to do cryptomining, but their only functionality is to lure users into  expensive subscriptions.353 Another example is malicious browser add-ons, which leverage JavaScript libraries. These  are distributed through official browser add-on stores and forums.  Cryptomining software like XMRig is often incorporated in other malware and exploit kits.354 Advanced malware can  exploit other machines with known vulnerabilities or, through brute-forcing, can migrate over different machines and act  like a cryptomining worm.355  Interestingly, cryptojacking malware is also reported to actively search and terminate other cryptomining instances  running on their victim’s host. The Kinsing cloud crypto-jacker is such an example. The Linux-based malware installs a  Monero miner and then ensures maximum system resources by killing other processes and even docker containers that  are resource-intensive.356  5.1.5 Cryptomining targeting cloud and container infrastructure  Cloud infrastructure allows processing power to be scaled up when needed. When cloud hosts are infected by crypto-  jacking malware, the costs can become monumental. The cloud providers bill for the consumed CPU cycles, while the  gains resulting from the computing operations only cover a fraction of the costs.357  Container infrastructure is also an interesting target, as these environments will spawn worker nodes based on needs.  Cryptojacking was already seen on Kubernetes in the past but the entry vectors were either vulnerable web applications  or malicious containers already containing mining malware. In June 2020, a large-scale campaign targeted Kubeflow,  a machine learning toolkit, aiming to infect internet-facing Kubernetes instances and use them for cryptomining at the  victims’ expense. After gaining access to the cluster, they deployed a malicious container to run their XMRig-based  miner.358  5.1.6 Disruption of illegal cryptomining operations  In May 2021, in the United Kingdom, law enforcement terminated a cryptomining operation, and the equipment was  confiscated based on a charge of the theft of electricity. The bust happened in the context of a search warrant for a  suspected cannabis farm.359  Later in May, China decided to ban financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to  cryptocurrency transactions. 360  The initial ban targeted three provinces, which according to research, accounted  together for more than 65% of Bitcoin’s hash rate.361  On the first of July, the security services of Ukraine (SBU) shut down a mining operation running on stolen electricity.  The services acted on the threat to the region's critical infrastructure.362 On the eighth of July, the SBU shut down a  cryptomining operation and seized almost 5,000 computers. The seizure included 3800 game consoles and 500 graphic  cards. The suspects were charged with the theft of electricity. The monthly loss was estimated to be up to USD  250.000.363  353 Bogus Cryptomining Apps Infest Google Play, https://threatpost.com/bogus-cryptomining-apps-google-play/168785/  354 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk/threat-encyclopedia/malware/coinminer.win64.xmrig.yxbd2/  355 https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/windows-and-linux-devices-are-under-attack-by-a-new-cryptomining-worm/  356 Threat Report: Kinsing Cloud Cryptojacker, 2021  357 Sophos - Threat report - 2021  358 Misconfigured Kubeflow workloads are a security risk, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a- security-risk/  359 Bitcoin ‘mine’ uncovered during industrial unit raid, https://west-midlands.police.uk/news/bitcoin-mine-uncovered-during-industrial-unit-raid  360 China bans financial, payment institutions from cryptocurrency business, https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies- barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/  361 Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, https://cbeci.org/mining_map  362 СБУ знешкодила криптоферму, через яку без світла і води могла залишитися частина Чернігівської області, https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu- zneshkodyla-kryptofermu-cherez-yaku-bez-svitla-i-vody-mohla-zalyshytysia-chastyna-chernihivskoi-oblasti-video  363 SBU exposes massive crypto mining in Ukraine, https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-naibilshu-kryptofermu-v-ukraini-maizhe-5-tys-kompiuteriv- mainyly-hroshi-na-vinnytsiaoblenerho  https://threatpost.com/bogus-cryptomining-apps-google-play/168785/ https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk/threat-encyclopedia/malware/coinminer.win64.xmrig.yxbd2/ https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/windows-and-linux-devices-are-under-attack-by-a-new-cryptomining-worm/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a-security-risk/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a-security-risk/ https://west-midlands.police.uk/news/bitcoin-mine-uncovered-during-industrial-unit-raid https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/ https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/ https://cbeci.org/mining_map https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zneshkodyla-kryptofermu-cherez-yaku-bez-svitla-i-vody-mohla-zalyshytysia-chastyna-chernihivskoi-oblasti-video https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zneshkodyla-kryptofermu-cherez-yaku-bez-svitla-i-vody-mohla-zalyshytysia-chastyna-chernihivskoi-oblasti-video https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-naibilshu-kryptofermu-v-ukraini-maizhe-5-tys-kompiuteriv-mainyly-hroshi-na-vinnytsiaoblenerho https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-naibilshu-kryptofermu-v-ukraini-maizhe-5-tys-kompiuteriv-mainyly-hroshi-na-vinnytsiaoblenerho  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  54  In July 2021, the Malaysian authorities reported having seised more than 1,000 bitcoin mining devices and arrested six  persons on charges of theft of electricity over the course of six separate raids.364 They destroyed the devices and put  the images on YouTube, sending a message to other mining operators.  We see an increase in law enforcement operations against (illegal) cryptomining. The cost of energy associated with  bitcoins pushes these mine operations to steal electricity. This practice is not new, as it has been used by farms that  cultivate drugs. Disruptions in these operations will make the actors move to other locations and other means to mine  crypto, such as leveraging infrastructure from compromised devices.  5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following mitigation vectors were mentioned regarding cryptomining related attacks and incidents in the reported  period.   Monitor battery usage on users’ devices and, in the case of suspicious spikes in CPU usage, scan for the  presence of file-based miners.   Implement web filtering of common cryptomining protocols, as well as blacklisting the IP addresses and  domains of popular cryptomining IP pools.   Monitor for network anomalies and block mining protocols.   Install endpoint protection by means of anti-virus programs or crypto-miner blocking browser plug-ins.   Conduct regular security audits to detect network anomalies.   Implement robust vulnerability and patch management to protect against emerging threats and  vulnerabilities.   Implement patches and fixes against well-known exploits.   Use whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed at the endpoints.   Use allow-listing to allow only the execution of known executables on the endpoints.   Monitor and block common cryptomining executables.   Invest in raising users’ awareness of cryptojacking, especially with regard to secure browsing behaviour.   Discuss crypto mining in the context of security awareness training.  364 Police Destroy 1,069 Bitcoin Miners With Big Ass Steamroller In Malaysia, https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv739/police-destroy-1069-bitcoin- miners-with-big-ass-steamroller-in-malaysia  https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv739/police-destroy-1069-bitcoin-miners-with-big-ass-steamroller-in-malaysia https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv739/police-destroy-1069-bitcoin-miners-with-big-ass-steamroller-in-malaysia  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  55  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  56  6. E-MAIL RELATED THREATS  E-mail related threats have been consistently ranking high in the list of prime threats in the ETL for a number of  years. This collection of threats exploits weaknesses in human behaviour concerning e-mails and human habits, and  aims at manipulating humans to fall victims to an attack. E-mail related threats are in general less about the technical  vulnerabilities of information systems, but mostly about end-user awareness and exploitation of the inherent trust  people place on their e-mail communications. This threat canvas consists mainly of the following vectors: phishing,  spear-phishing, whaling, smishing, vishing, business e-mail compromise (BEC) and spam.  Phishing aims at stealing important information like credit card numbers and passwords, through e-mails involving  social engineering and deception. Spear-phishing is a more sophisticated version of phishing that targets specific  organisations or individuals. Whaling is a spear-phishing attack aimed at users in high positions (executives,  politicians etc.). Smishing, a term derived as a combination of \"SMS\" and \"phishing”,365 occurs when financial or  personal information of victims are gathered via the use of SMS messages. Another type of threat related to e-mail is  vishing, a combination of phishing and voice that occurs when information is given via phone, where malicious actors  using social engineering techniques extract sensitive information from users.  Business e-mail compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated scam targeting businesses and organisations, whereby  criminals employ social engineering techniques to gain access to an employee’s or executive’s e-mail account to  initiate bank transfers under fraudulent conditions.366 Finally, spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital  communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often spam is sent via e-mail, but it can also be distributed via text  messages, phone calls, or social media367.  As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to this category of threats, since people’s online presence and  need for communication has greatly risen during this period. Moreover, the digitalisation of many traditional services  grew at an unprecedented rate during the pandemic, and given e-mail’s lead role as a communications means, the  increase in e-mail related threats was undeniable. A list of notable incidents related to e-mail threats can be found in  Annex B.  6.1 TRENDS  6.1.1 COVID-19 still the lure in e-mail threat campaigns  Spam campaigns with COVID-19 related lures were major occurrences throughout the reporting period. In general,  COVID-19 was exploited by adversaries to trick end users into falling victims to various types of e-mail related attacks.  Exploiting the angst concerning the pandemic and the trust that people place on their e-mail as a principal means of  communication, adversaries made use of COVID-19 to spread their campaigns. These campaigns ranged from attempts  to trick users into ordering face masks from phony websites to infecting them with malware via malicious attachments.  Three-quarters of attachments in these e-mails contained infostealers – a type of malware that steals sensitive  information (such as passwords or other credentials).368 As the pandemic continued and the vaccine was released the  lure changed to incorporate that. The campaigns included advertisements or offers for early access to a vaccine upon  payment of a deposit or fee and misinformation regarding the vaccines.369  365 Bank Phishing E-mails, https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/4_ceo-bec_fraud.pdf  366 Europol - IOCTA 2020 - https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf  367 What is spam?

The e-mails try to lead users  to phishing websites that capture their credit information. This attempt has already affected at least 26 countries.370  In 2021, postal services were also used in massive SMS spam messages that spread the Flubot Android malware  across Europe. Malware gangs were sending malicious links to users via SMS posing as legitimate package delivery  services.371  6.1.3 QRishing: new version of an old scheme  Social distancing during the pandemic has popularised QR (Quick Response) codes,372 which are simple to use and  may be pretty simple to generate. Identifying a fake QR message is not straightforward and it creates a suitable  environment for malicious activity. A tactic that has been observed is embedding fake QR codes into phishing e-mails  sent by large European banks. Upon scanning the code, users are directed to websites with realistic-looking landing  pages, where the victim may be prompted to login in order to renew their credit cards.373 A fake QR code also has the  potential to connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network or automatically navigate to a malicious link. Codes may also direct  users to websites where malware can be automatically downloaded. Moreover, public QR codes could also cause a  problem as cybercriminals may swap them out by replacing their own QR codes over genuine ones.  6.1.4 BEC has increased, has grown in sophistication and become more targeted  According to publicly available reports, BEC was the most costly cybercrime type in 2020 during which organisations  reported total losses of more than 1.8 billion dollars374. During the reporting period, it was observed that BEC schemes  have evolved, especially regarding credential phishing and the conversion of money into cryptocurrency.375 As EU  Member States report, there have been many cases where Office 365 accounts have been used for BEC scams. This  implies that the actors have also conducted credential phishing operations or password spraying attacks (a technique  similar to brute force attacks) against the victims376.  Moreover, although cybercriminals target all sectors and businesses, BEC actors show an increased focus on small  and medium-sise enterprises377. Historically, BEC actors were based in Nigeria but recent research has identified  BEC actors in 50 different countries.378 Half of the BEC-related cybercriminals are located in Nigeria (the reduction in  this percentage is due to the efforts of law enforcement) and one-quarter of them are based in the United States.  Moreover, the highly lucrative potential of this type of cybercrime has attracted more sophisticated cybercrime groups  such as Cosmic Lynx379.  Our assessment is that cybercriminals will certainly continue to take advantage of compromised business accounts  and use them to make money through BEC scams. It is also likely that this lucrative type of cybercrime will attract  sophisticated cybercrime actors globally, further diversifying the current geography of BEC actors and increasing the  sophistication of BEC scams.  6.1.5 SMShing and Vishing have increased since users lack the awareness  According to security, new sites,380 381 such as various APTs groups, have started using SMShing and Vishing as part  of their highly targeted campaigns. In recent attacks targeting political opponents, APT-C-23 appeared to have used a  new technique, the use of voice-changing software to pose as women  ̶  the group’s members who have been identified  so far are all men  ̶  to engage victims in conversations. As the conversations continue, the group begin sending videos  loaded with malware to infect the target’s system.381  370Post Office Phishing Hits Credit Card Users in 26 Countries  https://www.trendmicro.com/en_se/research/21/a/post-office-phishing-hits-credit-card-users-in-26-countries.html  371 Despite arrests in Spain, FluBot operations explode across Europe and Japan - The Record by Recorded Future  372 https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/ne-pas-toucher-au-temps-du-covid-19-l-heure-de-gloire-du-qr-code_2131853.html  373 https://www.hoxhunt.com/blog/banking-phishing-qr-codes/  374 https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/anchorage/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-internet-crime-report  375 FBI – Internet Crime Report 2020 - https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf  376 Europol - IOCTA 2020 - https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf  377 https://www.comae.com/posts/keep-office-365-safe-from-bec-when-you-are-an-sme/  378 Agari - The Global Reach of Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) - https://agari.com/e-mail-security-blog/business-e-mail-compromise-geography/  379 Agari – Cosmic Lynx: The Rise of Russian BEC - https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/acid-agari-cosmic-lynx.pdf  380 Iranian cyberspies behind major Christmas SMS spear-phishing campaign | ZDNet  381 APT Group Using Voice Changing Software in Spear-Phishing Campaign | SecurityWeek.Com  https://www.trendmicro.com/en_se/research/21/a/post-office-phishing-hits-credit-card-users-in-26-countries.html https://therecord.media/despite-arrests-in-spain-flubot-operations-explode-across-europe-and-japan/ https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/ne-pas-toucher-au-temps-du-covid-19-l-heure-de-gloire-du-qr-code_2131853.html https://www.hoxhunt.com/blog/banking-phishing-qr-codes/ https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/anchorage/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-internet-crime-report https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf https://www.comae.com/posts/keep-office-365-safe-from-bec-when-you-are-an-sme/ https://agari.com/e-mail-security-blog/business-e-mail-compromise-geography/ https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/acid-agari-cosmic-lynx.pdf https://www.zdnet.com/article/iranian-cyberspies-behind-major-christmas-sms-spear-phishing-campaign/?&web_view=true https://www.securityweek.com/apt-group-using-voice-changing-software-spear-phishing-campaign?&web_view=true  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  58  In another instance Charming Kitten, (also known as APT35 or Phosphorus), used the 2021 holiday season to attack  targets from all over the world using a spear-phishing campaign that involved both e-mails and SMS messages. While  the SMS messages posed as Google security alerts, the e-mails used previously hacked accounts. The common  indicator in both campaigns was that Charming Kitten operators managed to successfully hide their attacks behind a  legitimate Google URL.380  In general, users are used to the idea of not clicking on suspicious e-mails, but still are not aware that they can also  be phished via text messages or phone calls.  6.1.6 Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS)  Microsoft’s recent analysis of the Bullet ProofLink campaign suggests that this operation is responsible for many of the  phishing campaigns that have had an impact on organisations. BulletProofLink (also referred to as BulletProftLink or  Anthrax by its operators in various websites, ads, and other promotional materials) is used by multiple malicious  actors in either one-off or monthly subscription-based business models, creating a steady revenue stream for its  operators382.  Similar to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), phishing-as-a-service follows the software-as-a-service model. Attackers  pay an operator to develop and deploy large portions of or complete phishing campaigns from false sign-in page  development, website hosting, and credential parsing and redistribution, outsourcing capabilities that they may be  lacking.  6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following mitigation vectors were discussed regarding e-mail related attacks and incidents during the reporting period.   Provide regular user training on how to identify suspicious links and attachments and how to report them.383 384  385   Implement spam filters at the e-mail gateways; keep signatures and rules updated.389 Whenever possible, use  a secure e-mail gateway with automated maintenance of filters (anti-spam, anti-malware, policy-based filtering).   Put security controls into place on the e-mail gateway to reduce the frequency or possibility of the lures arriving  to your employees’ inboxes.386   Implement a need-to-know access policy to limit the impact of any compromise.387   Consult the MITRE ATT&CK® framework for the tactics of adversaries and techniques pertaining to  cybersecurity threats.388   Ensure e-mails originating from outside the organisation are automatically marked before received.389   Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) to accounts.390   Check the lifespan of a suspected malicious domain and its ownership. If it has been active for less than a year,  it could be a scam.   Whenever possible, apply security solutions that use machine-learning techniques to identify phishing sites in  real-time.   Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at the mail  clients and update them frequently.391  382 https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/21/catching-the-big-fish-analyzing-a-large-scale-phishing-as-a-service-operation/  383 Lessons in Cybersecurity: How education coped in the shift to distance learning, https://www.malwarebytes.com/resources/resource/malwarebytes- labs/lessons-in-cybersecurity-how-education-coped-in-the-shift-to-distance-learning  384 2020 Cyber Threats Report, https://www.netwrix.com/download/collaterals/2020_Cyber_Threats_Report.pdf  385 Attack Landscape H1 2020, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/17142720/F-Secure-attack-landscape-h12020.pdf  386 Cyber Threat Landscape: Monthly Update For CIO/CISO, https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ca/pdf/2020/11/cyber-threat-landscape-report-nov- 2020-en.pdf  387 Cyber Threat Landscape Report 2020, https://www.ensigninfosecurity.com/analysis-insights/content/2020/05/18/cyber-threat-landscape-report-2020  388 Cyberthreats: A 20-Year Retrospective, https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophos-cyberthreats-20-year- retrospective-wp.pdf  389 HHS Cybersecurity Program APT and Cybercriminal Targeting of HCS, https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/apt-and-cybercriminal-targeting-of- hcs.pdf  390 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2021, https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence  391 What is phishing?

Threat actors usually register fake domains that are similar to legitimate ones and use them to ‘phish’ their  targets. Looking only for an HTTPS connection is not enough.396   Use a strong and unique password for every online service. Re-using the same password for various services  is a serious security issue and should be always avoided. Using strong and unique credentials for every online  service limits the risk of a potential account takeover to only the affected service. Using a password manager  software will make managing of the whole set of passwords easier.397   Check how contact, registration, subscription, and feedback forms work on your website and add verification  rules if necessary, so that they cannot be exploited by attackers.398   Implement content filtering to locate unwanted attachments, e-mails with malicious content, spam, and unwanted  network traffic.   Avoid responding to new links received in e-mails or SMS messages by unknown senders and, most of all, do  not enter your credentials when following such links.  392 Guidance Using Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) in your organisation,  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-mail-security-standards/domain-based-message-authentication-reporting-and-conformance-dmarc  393 Sender Policy Framework Project Overview, http://www.open-spf.org/  394 What is DMARC? https://dmarc.org/  395 DomainKeys Identified Mail, http://www.dkim.org/  396 What is a Look-alike Domain? https://www.phishlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-look-alike-domain/  397 How to create a strong password, https://blog.avast.com/strong-password-ideas  398 Tricky 'Forms' of Phishing, https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/i/tricky-forms-of-phishing.html  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/email-security-standards/domain-based-message-authentication-reporting-and-conformance-dmarc http://www.open-spf.org/ https://dmarc.org/ http://www.dkim.org/ https://www.phishlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-look-alike-domain/ https://blog.avast.com/strong-password-ideas https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/i/tricky-forms-of-phishing.html  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  60  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  61  7. THREATS AGAINST DATA  Threats against data form a collection of threats that target data sources with the aim of gaining unauthorised access,  disclosure, misinformation, disinformation, etc. They are mainly referred to as data breaches or data leaks and refer to  the release of sensitive, confidential or protected data to an untrusted environment. Data breaches can occur as a  result of a cyber-attack, an insider job, unintentional loss or exposure of data. Data exfiltration or data theft is a  technique that is used by malicious actors to target, copy, and transfer sensitive data. A particular case of the use of  exfiltrated data is identity theft, where malicious actors use personal identifiable information (PII) to impersonate a  user.  Threats against data consistently rank high among the leading threats of the ETL and this trend continues in the  reporting period of the ETL 2021. Adversaries explore a series of new techniques and exploit the increasing online  presence and use of online services by the general public. Moreover, given the significance of data and in particular of  private and sensitive data, adversaries are combining more sophisticated threats to target data, such as ransomware  or supply chain attacks. It is noteworthy that in the ENISA threat landscape for supply chains,399 for about 58% of the  supply chain incidents analysed, the customer assets targeted were predominantly customer data, including  personally identifiable information (PII) data and intellectual property.  Numerous incidents related to threats against data took place during the reporting period of ETL 2021. Figure 8 shows  the incidents observed based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA for the purposes of situational  awareness.400 The scope of the collection is global and multi-sectorial. Incidents, however, with a direct impact in the  EU area are given priority. We observed an increasing trend in the number of incidents reported during 2021. This  observation relates primarily to the surge of data breaches in the health sector (see trends below). Notable incidents  related to threats against data can be found in Annex B.  Figure 8: Incidents related to threats against data observed by ENISA (April 2020-July 2021)  399399 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-the-increase-in-supply-chain-security-attacks  400 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN )  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-the-increase-in-supply-chain-security-attacks https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  62  7.1 TRENDS  Considering data breaches,401 the industry sectors suffering the most from internal errors are finance and insurance,  public administration, healthcare and information. In the financial sector, 44% of the breaches are caused by internal  actors, whose actions are, most of time, due to errors. It is noteworthy that internal actors have been growing  constantly from 2018 in this industrial sector, while external actors have been decreasing at the same rate, to the  point where the two are very close. In the public administration sector, social engineering is the primary pattern (70%),  with errors the second pattern (15%) where misconfiguration and mis-delivery account for most errors. In the  healthcare sector, errors are the primary cause, with the top three specific errors being mis-delivery, publishing errors  and misconfiguration. Finally, in the information sector, basic web application attacks, errors and system intrusion are  the main patterns, together accounting for 83% of all breaches. Misconfiguration covers the vast majority of all the  breaches caused by errors (>70%).  According to Verizon,401 85% of data breaches involve a human element. This can be easily explained by considering  that both social engineering and miscellaneous errors are among the main patterns. Breaches caused by errors differ  with respect to other breaches in the variety of data being disclosed. Altogether, the most disclosed data are  credentials (60%) and personal data (50%), while in breaches caused by errors the most disclosed are personal data  (80%).  Most of breaches caused by errors are discovered within days or hours.401 This claim can be explained by the fact  that people quickly realise the errors they have made. Taking a more general look, the discovery time for breaches of  every nature, broken down into organisation sise, show that enterprise-sised organisation do perform better than  SMEs, discovering breaches within days in 55% of the cases. SMEs, instead, discover breaches within days in 47%  of the cases. These results show that enterprises have significantly improved their performance, while SMEs have  basically stayed the same as in 2019.  7.1.1 Threat actors shifted their attention towards COVID-19 vaccine information  Vaccine information became the centre of a few cyberespionage campaigns during the reporting period. In July 2020,  the UK foreign secretary issued warnings about active large-scale phishing campaigns which appeared to specifically  target COVID-19 research facilities and were believed to be sponsored by nation-states.402 Later in 2020, phishing  schemes with credential harvesting capabilities were found targeting organisations globally, with the intention to  extract information regarding the transportation and distribution processes of the vaccines.403 At the end of 2020,  AstraZeneca employees where spear-phished404 and the incident was attributed to state-sponsored APT groups.  Lastly, at the end of 2020 the EMA was targeted and documents concerning the validation process of Pfiser and  Moderna vaccines were accessed and leaked to the internet405.  7.1.2 Surge in healthcare sector data breaches  Healthcare data breaches are increasing rapidly (see Figure 14). This can be interpreted in a couple of ways. Due to  the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare sector was put on the spotlight and threat actors took advantage of this crisis  to hit an already suffering sector. In addition, due to the pandemic, a shift towards the online provisioning of  healthcare services, remote eHealth and telemedicine approaches increased and thus the opportunities for  adversaries to exfiltrate medical data increased greatly.  Moreover, the motivation for adversaries to access and exploit medical data is much higher than other types of data. A  credit card for example can be easily cancelled, so the perceived value of having the data related to a card is much  lower compared to medical records, which contain information, such as a patient’s medical and behavioural health  history and demographics, as well as their health insurance and contact information.  401 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  402 UK condemns Russian Intelligence Services over vaccine cyber-attacks, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence- services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks  403 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2021, https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence  404 https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/cyber-attack-on-astrazeneca-COVID-19-vaccine-research/  405 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-6  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence-services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence-services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/cyber-attack-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-research/ https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-6  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  63  The increase in healthcare related incidents is also visible in relevant mandatory reporting in the US406 that require  victims to report the breaches. A similar trend is also observed in ENISA OSINT trend analysis as seen in Figure 9.  Figure 9: Data related incidents in healthcare as observed through OSINT by ENISA via situational awareness  7.1.3 Data breaches in the business environment rise  According to SANS Institute, in the last few years, approximately 74,000 employees, contractors, and suppliers were  impacted by a data breach due to stolen company laptops.407 This was exacerbated by the fact that data were not  encrypted. In a 2021 study of 300 respondents - including top managers at US companies with over 5,000 employees  in the most important business domains408 - 34% of respondents has been the target of a theft of property or supply  chain damage due to insiders abusing their privileges. Among observed physical threats, 27% of the respondents  mentioned “insiders abusing authorised cyber and physical access points” in a list of the top-three physical threats,  26% “supply chain damage and/or disruptions”, and 23% “onsite theft/burglary”.  7.1.4 Motivations and attack vectors remain the same  During the reporting period, trends related to the motivations of adversaries as well as the main attack vectors  remained generally the same. Phishing continues to be on the top causes of breaches (36%), as it has been for the  past two years. It is followed by the use of stolen credentials (25%) and ransomware (10%).409 As in past years,  financially motivated attacks continue to be the most common. Nearly 80% of cyberattacks are for financial gain, such  as stealing money directly from financial accounts, stealing credit card information or other types of data that can be  monetised, or demanding ransom. In second place is espionage, which often involves the theft of intellectual property  or other confidential information409  7.1.5 Identity theft and synthetic identity  Due to the increase in data breaches in previous years, personal and sensitive data has been easily accessible to  malicious actors via online forums and the dark web. This has had a cascading effect on identity theft. According to the  US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), complaints of identity theft rose in 2020 compared to the year before.410 About a  third of these involved US government benefits.

A lot of these incidents could have involved synthetic identities. Synthetic identity theft is a type of fraud in which  criminals combine real and fake information to create a new identity. Incidents with synthetic identities tend to be more  common in the United States because of static personally identifiable information, which is used to verify someone’s  identity, according to the Federal Reserve412.  7.1.6  Actors taking advantage of bad user behaviour in order to commit identity abuse  The Identity Theft Resource Centre reported in early 2021 that the motivation of cybercriminals has shifted and instead  of targeting consumers in order to steal large amounts of personal information they have started taking advantage of  bad user behaviour413 that are then used against organisations. A typical example involves stolen credentials.  As reported by CERT-EU, “identity abuse essentially consists of using valid accounts and legitimate applications to  perpetrate malicious activities in a persistent and stealthy way. Attackers abuse the inherent trust in any action  associated  with authenticated users or authorised applications. Identity abuse can be seen as an extension of the  living-off-the land  (LOTL)  tactic  where  an  attacker  makes  use  of  legitimate  tools  to  remain  undetected,  whereas,  through identity abuse, the attacker will additionally make use of legitimate accounts. Observed tactics  showed  the  unprecedented  level  of  sophistication  the  adversaries  leveraged  to  abuse  their  victims’ identities for  lateral movement and stealthy operations. They remained undetected for more than six months in the network of  hundreds of compromised organisations”. 414 In the SolarWinds Orion campaign, the adversaries abused the high-  privileged accounts the application uses; these accounts ultimately underpin identity in an organisation’s environment.  7.1.7 Rising Impact of Supply Chain Attacks  As reported in ENISA’s dedicated threat landscape for supply chains, based on the trends and patterns observed,  supply chain attacks increased in number and sophistication in the year 2020 and this trend is continuing in 2021,  posing an increasing risk for organisations. It is estimated that there will be four times more supply chain attacks in  2021 than in 2020. With half of the attacks being attributed to Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) actors, their  complexity and resources greatly exceed the more common non-targeted attacks and, therefore, there is an  increasing need for new protective methods that incorporate suppliers in order to guarantee that organisations remain  secure.  Around 58% of the supply chain attacks were aimed at gaining access to data (predominantly customer data,  including personal data and intellectual property) and around 16% at gaining access to people. When it comes to  suppliers’ data, 20% of attacks were aimed at gaining access to that data and 66% to their source code.  7.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following mitigation vectors were mentioned regarding data related attacks and incidents in the reporting period.   Develop and maintain a cybersecurity awareness plan. Provide training and simulation scenarios for  identifying social engineering and phishing campaigns for employees.415   Limit user access privileges under the need-to-know principle. Revoke access privileges to anyone who is not  an employee416.   Establish and maintain an incident response team and evaluate incident response plans frequently.417   Discover and classify sensitive/personal data and apply measures for encrypting such data in transit and at  rest. In other words, deploy data loss prevention capabilities.  411 COVID + Credit: New Scams Put Identity at Risk during the COVID-19 Pandemic, https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/COVID-19/prevent- identity-theft-coronavirus-scams/  412 https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/frs-synthetic-identity-payments-fraud-white-paper-july-2019.pdf  413 https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches-are-up-38-percent-in-q2-2021-the-identity-theft-resource-center-predicts-a-new-all-time-high-by-years- end/  414 https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU-Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf#page=13&zoom=auto,-274,51  415 Discover security awareness trends and best practices for 2021, https://terranovasecurity.com/how-to-build-a-strong-security-awareness-program-in- 2021/  416 Need to Know Access Control Guideline, https://security.berkeley.edu/need-know-access-control-guideline  417 Incident Response Team: What are the Roles and Responsibilities?, https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource-center/ebook/insider-guide-to-incident- response/arming-your-incident-response-team  https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/covid-19/prevent-identity-theft-coronavirus-scams/ https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/covid-19/prevent-identity-theft-coronavirus-scams/ https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/frs-synthetic-identity-payments-fraud-white-paper-july-2019.pdf https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches-are-up-38-percent-in-q2-2021-the-identity-theft-resource-center-predicts-a-new-all-time-high-by-years-end/ https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches-are-up-38-percent-in-q2-2021-the-identity-theft-resource-center-predicts-a-new-all-time-high-by-years-end/ https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU-Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf#page=13&zoom=auto,-274,51 https://terranovasecurity.com/how-to-build-a-strong-security-awareness-program-in-2021/ https://terranovasecurity.com/how-to-build-a-strong-security-awareness-program-in-2021/ https://security.berkeley.edu/need-know-access-control-guideline https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource-center/ebook/insider-guide-to-incident-response/arming-your-incident-response-team https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource-center/ebook/insider-guide-to-incident-response/arming-your-incident-response-team  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  65   Increase investments related to detection, alerting tools and ability to contain and respond to a data breach.   Develop and maintain strong policies enforcing strong passwords (password management) and usage of multi-  factor authentication (MFAs).   Consider models that take the least privileged approach to provide security for both on premises and off  premises resources (i.e. zero-trust).   Invest in and create policies and plans for engaging with governance, risk management and compliance teams.   Store data only on secure IT assets.   Educate and train the personnel periodically.   Use technology tools to avoid possible data leaks, such as vulnerability scans, malware scans and data loss  prevention (DLP) tools. Deploy data and portable system and device encryption, and secure gateways.   A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is critical in the event of a data breach. This plan outlines the type of data  being stored, their location and what potential liabilities could emerge when implementing data security and  recovery actions. A BCP entails an effective incident response, which aims at addressing, managing, and  rectifying the damages due to such an incident.   Apply ‘threat hunting’ within a company to strengthen security plans. Threat hunting is conducted by skilled  members of the Security Operation Centre (SOC) team to proactively identify vulnerabilities and prevent  breaches.   Policies such as velocity-based rules can be used to mitigate identity fraud, especially for payment card  transactions. The machine data of valid transactions can provide sufficient information for the optimal policy  definition.   The Single Sign On (SSO) authentication method, when available, allows a user to access several  applications with the same set of digital credentials. It is highly recommended to minimise the number of user  accounts and stored credentials using SSO.   URLs that are sent via e-mail or are randomly visited should first be checked based on their IP address, the  ASN that associates with the IP, the owner of the domain and the relation between this domain and others,  before any further step is taken.   Organisations that are adopting cloud services should have strong cloud security operations and prefer an  architecture of on-premises storages, private cloud storages and public cloud storages simultaneously to  protect their customer’s personal information.   Use strong and updated encryption methods such as TLS 1.3 (uses ephemeral keys) for sensitive data to  prevent hacking.   Adequately protect all identity documents and copies (physical or digital ones) against unauthorised access.   Identity information should not be disclosed to unsolicited recipients and their requests by phone, e-mail or in  person should not be answered.   Install and use content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, mails with malicious content, spam and  unwanted network traffic.   Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions.

THREATS AGAINST AVAILABILITY  AND INTEGRITY  Availability and integrity are the target of a plethora of threats and attacks, among which the families of Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS) and Web Attacks stand out.  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) targets system and data availability, and though it is not a new threat (it  celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019) it remains a significant threat in the cyber landscape.418 419 Attacks occur  when users of a system or service are not able to access relevant information, services or other resources. This can  be accomplished by exhausting the service or overloading the component of the network infrastructure420.  Web-based attacks mainly target data integrity and availability. They are an attractive method by which threat actors  can delude victims using web systems and services as the threat vector. This covers a vast attack surface, for  instance facilitating malicious URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) or malicious scripts to direct the user or victim to the  desired website or downloading malicious content (watering hole attacks, drive-by attacks) and injecting malicious  code into a legitimate but compromised website to steal information (i.e. formjacking) for financial gain, information  stealing or even extortion via ransomware421.  DDoS and web-based attacks are often coordinated activities. DDoS attacks can be built on a web-based attack, which  are often distributed through web applications. For instance, web-based attacks can be adopted to build a botnet that  is then used to carry out a denial of service attack aimed to make a system unavailable.  8.1 TRENDS  Both web attacks and DDoS attacks have remained stable over the years, while some interesting points on their  evolution may be noted. According to EUROPOL, “the threat potential of DDoS attacks is higher than its current impact  in the EU.”419 Notable incidents for these two types of attacks can found in Annex B.  8.1.1 Ransom Denial of Service (RDoS) is the new trend of DDoS attacks  During 2020, Ransom DDoS (RDDoS) campaigns got a substantial boost from August 2020 onwards, with hacking  groups such as Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear, Lazarus Group, and Armada Collective carrying out these campaigns.  Targeted sectors include e-commerce, finance, and travel on a global scale.422 Extortion attacks have also  experienced a boost in terms of numbers and dimensions, reaching capacities of 500Gbps in 2020.423  Ransom Denial of Service substantially reduces the need of resources to carry out an attack. Cybercriminals analyse  target businesses to find those with weak and vulnerable systems. They then blackmail these businesses by asking a  ransom so as not to attack the system424 425.

Infecting a target with malware or ransomware  would otherwise require more effort in terms of time and planning426.  RDDoS comes in two flavours: i) attack-first, ii) extortion first. In the first case, a DDoS attack is implemented and a  ransom is requested to stop it. In the second case, an extortion letter and proof in the form of a small-scale DoS is  sent with a request to pay a ransom. RDDoS attacks are even more dangerous than traditional DDoS since they can  be completed even if the attacker does not have sufficient resources.427  8.1.2 COVID-19 Pandemic has been used as an amplifier  DDoS attacks were boosted substantially in 2020 due to COVID-19 with more than 10 million attacks428 (1.6 million  more than 2019) and a 22% increase in attack frequency in the last 6 months of 2020. In March 2020, a new norm  began with over 800,000 DDoS attacks registered, an average of 839,083 attacks per month over the year and with  more than 929,000 attacks in May 2020. Global DDoS extortion attacks also increased by 125% becoming one of the  most critical approaches to DDoS.429  In addition, videoconferencing and remote collaboration software, such as Microsoft Teams, Skype or Zoom,  experienced a peak of usage. However, their usage comes with some concerns. First, these tools are often built on  weak communications possibly leading to attacks. Then, their high demand in terms of bandwidth can stress the  network.430 Furthermore, the massive adoption of remote working increased the risk for organisations of becoming a  target of a DDoS attack. In addition, the bandwidth originally devoted to counteracting DDoS is currently used for  remote working, reducing an enterprise’s ability to defend itself against a DDoS attack.431 In this context, the impact of  DDoS attacks against RDPs and virtual private networks (VPNs) increased with the pandemic.422  Due to COVID-19, malicious actors increasingly targeted home networks as a starting point for more complex attacks,  making DNS not only an attack vector but also a target of attacks. According to Neustar (NISC Survey, Q4 2020),  Domain Hijacking (31%) has been the most observed DNS threat, followed by DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning (27%),  DNS Tunnelling (26%), and Zombie Domain Attacks (18%).426  8.1.3 Cybercrime-as-a-Service works as an amplifier of web-based and  DoS attacks  Cybercrime-as-a-Service is becoming a cornerstone for spreading DDoS, opening the door of DDoS to a wider  population of attackers. Illegal online markets providing accesses to attack tools and services, as well as fast internet  connections are further supporting cybercriminals in driving more complex and sophisticated campaigns, and  disruptive attacks.423 State-sponsored actors aim to develop their capabilities to disrupt critical infrastructure and  conduct espionage against businesses, academia, and governments to steal intellectual property.  DDoS is increasingly implemented using cybercrime-as-a-service: a criminal pays for a DDoS attack-as-a-  service and the paid service launches the DDoS attack.432 423 These services reduce the effort needed to manage  high-volume and complex attacks, making DDoS adaptive, lightweight, and heterogeneous. DDoS is increasingly  targeting smaller businesses and requiring less financial and technical resources. Potentially disruptive attacks can  target third-party providers (e.g. financial, energy and telecommunication services), with cascading effects in the  supply chain.419 433  Cybercrime-as-a-Service in fact provides a set of online tools and services that simplify the execution of targeted  attacks.

DDoS-For-Hire-Services are among the  most adopted tools for cyberattacks.432 In general, we may note that DDoS attacks are today mostly multivector and  amplified by COVID-19. They also show a boost in dimension and impact, while impacting almost all businesses’  domains thanks to the rise of extortion attacks.434 Finally, according to research conducted by Digital Shadows, “three  main trends that can be expected to persist throughout 2021 include leveraging IoT devices, offering DDoS service  solutions, and DDoS extortion.”435  8.1.4 Traditional DDoS is moving towards mobile networks and IoT  The success of internet of things (IoT) in conjunction with 5G is resulting in a new wave of DDoS attacks,  possibly inducing victims to pay a ransom.436 On one hand, 5G makes IoT more vulnerable to cyberattacks,  supporting localised DDoS where an attacker interferes with the connectivity of a specific area covered by a slice  through a set of compromised devices.437 On the other hand, IoT can be used as a threat vector for DDoS. Attackers  can build massive botnets to launch DDoS attacks or distribute malware.438 This is particularly critical in Industrial IoT  (IIoT), where device vulnerabilities can disrupt business operations and cause significant damage (e.g. in the health  domain, vulnerable medical devices can affect people’s safety).439  Sensors and devices are in fact a suitable target of DDoS attacks due to their limited resources that often result in  poor security protection. Devices are simple to corrupt, often coming with misconfigurations (e.g. weak passwords).419  At the same time, the increasing complexity of these mobile systems makes users’ shortage of security skills  increasingly pertinent. In this context, DDoS aims to threaten the availability of components, as well as disrupt the  operation of other networks or systems. It also has the potential to threaten the safety of users.  The increasing  number of devices and applications connected to the cloud gives adversaries a larger playing field on which to target  attacks.  Lack of industry standards, network capabilities, and hardware can challenge service uptime and  reliability.440 This problem is exacerbated in IIoT, where vulnerabilities in third-party software components clearly  point to a lack of standardisation and safe coding guidelines.439  8.1.5 New amplifiers and advanced sophistication for DDoS attacks emerge  Sharing of resources in virtualised environments acts as an amplifier of DDoS attacks.437 Physical resource  overloading can cause disruption in communications, services, and access to data.  DDoS attackers are adopting intelligent strategies based on technically advanced and smart attacks. In 2020-21,  smart attacks used publicly available information to monitor the countermeasures adopted by their targets and adapt  their attack strategies at run time.418 In this context, the duration of short attacks decreased, while the duration of long  attacks increased. 441 Focusing on absolute numbers, the number of short attacks had a sharp increase in Q1 2021,  while long attacks decreased though their overall duration increased589. 441 Sharing the same view, Akamai, at the end  of March 2021, observed more attacks over 50 Gbps than during the whole of 2019. Even more important, in the first  quarter of 2021, they recorded three of the six biggest DDoS attacks by volume, including the two largest known  DDoS extortion attacks.442  434 Jai Vijayan, DDoS Attacks Spiked, Became More Complex in 2020, December 2020, https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attacks- spiked-became-more-complex-in-2020/d/d-id/1339814  435 H-ISAC.

Furthermore, some DDoS threats build on TCP-based attacks, including TCP  SYN and fragmented packet floods. NEUSTAR shares the view that the majority of attack vectors for DDoS attacks  focus on UDP protocols, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP), Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access  Protocol (CLDAP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Domain Name System (DNS).  NETSCOUT, with its intelligent threat report, provided a detailed discussion of DDoS threat vectors. It claimed that the  total number of vectors for individual attacks increased substantially, culminating in an attack composed of 26 attack  vectors in 2020. Multi-vector attacks are mostly in the range 15-25 vectors and showed an increase in cardinality  between 9% and 312%, with the most notable growth in the range of 15-21 vectors.444  8.1.7  Smaller organisations are being targeted  DDoS is increasingly targeting small enterprises by building on the rental of skill and tools to implement attacks  (Cybercrime-as-a-Service).445  This finding was previously discussed in IOCTA 2020, claiming that cybercriminals  increasingly target smaller organisations with lower security standards, ensuring successful attacks with smaller  volumes of data and maximum revenue. Public institutions and critical infrastructures remain among the main targets  of DDoS attacks.419  Kaspersky, instead, monitored DDoS activities in 2020-21, focusing on trends in quarters446,447,448. In particular, in Q2  2020 (probably due to the pandemic), the number of attacks were more than the triple the same period of 2019. In Q3  2020, figures came back to normality and the number of attacks dropped around one third compared to Q2 2020 (with  an increase of 50% compared to Q3 2019). In Q4 2020, the number of attacks dropped further by around one third  compared to Q3 2020 (with comparable numbers with respect to Q4 2019). In Q1 2021, the attacks increased by  more than 40% compared to Q4 2020. This increase was mostly observed in January (with peaks of 1,800 attacks per  day) and, according to Kaspersky, was linked to the price of cryptocurrencies. In general, the increase in DDoS  attacks in 2020 and 2021 was also due to COVID-19 and remote working, which provided a plethora of new  vulnerable targets.  8.1.8 Increased combination of web-based and DDoS attacks  Recalling that DDoS and web-based attacks are often coordinated activities, web applications are still vulnerable to  web-related threats, such as injections and cross-site scripting, and can become a vector for DDoS attacks. According  to a recent report449, SQL injection vulnerabilities and PHP injection vulnerabilities are the most commonly exploited,  though XSS is the most discovered vulnerability. According to the Verizon 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report  (DBIR),450 cross-site scripting (XSS) traffic experienced a substantial increase in Q4 2020; blocked cross-site scripting  (XSS) traffic nearly doubled in volume from Q2 2020 to Q4 2020, with more than 15 million attacks, representing 10%  of blocked traffic.451 Furthermore, 43% of all data breaches involved a web application and around 90% of all hacking  443 Neustar Security, Cyber Threats & Trends: Securing Your Network Pandemic-Style, 2020,  https://www.cdn.neustar/resources/whitepapers/security/neustar-cyber-threats-trends-2020-report.pdf  444 NETSCOUT, NETSCOUT THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT, DDoS in a Time of Pandemic, 2020, https://www.netscout.com/threatreport  445 Emma Woollacott, Surge in malware and cyber-attacks set to continue, Europol warns in SOCTA 2021 report, April 2021,  https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/surge-in-malware-and-cyber-attacks-set-to-continue-europol-warns-in-socta-2021-report  446 Oleg Kupreev, Ekaterina Badovskaya, Alexander Gutnikov, DDoS attacks in Q4 2020, February 2021, https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q4- 2020/100650/  447 Oleg Kupreev, Ekaterina Badovskaya, Alexander Gutnikov, DDoS attacks in Q2 2020, August 2020, https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q2- 2020/98077/  448 Oleg Kupreev, Ekaterina Badovskaya, Alexander Gutnikov, DDoS attacks in Q3 2020, October 2020, https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3- 2020/99171/  449 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2020, 2020  450 David Warburton, F5 Labs, DDoS Attack Trends for 2020, May 2021, https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ddos-attack-trends-for-2020  451  Verizon, Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in Q4 2020: Trends and best practices, March 2021, https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/cross- site-scripting-attacks-trends-and-best-practices/  https://www.cdn.neustar/resources/whitepapers/security/neustar-cyber-threats-trends-2020-report.pdf https://www.netscout.com/threatreport https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/surge-in-malware-and-cyber-attacks-set-to-continue-europol-warns-in-socta-2021-report https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q4-2020/100650/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q4-2020/100650/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q2-2020/98077/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q2-2020/98077/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3-2020/99171/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3-2020/99171/ https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ddos-attack-trends-for-2020 https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-attacks-trends-and-best-practices/ https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-attacks-trends-and-best-practices/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  71  vectors targeted web applications.449 The latter data was also confirmed in the Verizon 2021 Data Breach  Investigations Report (DBIR).452  8.1.9 Trends on classifying DDoS attacks  The geographical spread of DDoS attacks in 2020-21 depends on attack classification, though some commonalities  emerge446 447:   China and USA are always mentioned in the first two places both as targets and sources of DDoS attacks.   Netherlands, Germany and France are often at the top places in the EU as targets and sources of DDoS  attacks.   In 2021, Canada, Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Germany, Brazil and Australia had sharp increases as  sources of attacks, with Canada moving to spot #3. Similarly, Great Britain, Germany, France, Brazil and  Australia experienced sharp increase as targets of attacks, with The Netherlands moving to spot #3. Also,  unexpectedly, Poland entered the top ten.   According to Cloudflare, Malaysia and India are the #3 and #4 source countries, while Morocco became the  #3 target country.453  Concerning the sector spread, Akamai monitored data from 2017 to the end of 2020 and observed an increase in the  number of DDoS attacks over the 50 Gbps threshold. Moreover, a general increase in attacks in 7 out of 11 of the  analysed sectors was observed with a sharp increase in Business Services (960%), Education (180%), Financial  Services (190%), Retail & Consumer Goods (445%), and Software & Technology (196%).454  Confirming these results, F5 labs claimed, “the education sector saw a large increase in DDoS attacks in January  2021, with more than 56% of all education incidents for the past 15 months occurring in Q1 2021”. Concerning the  domains attacked, technology, telecommunications, and finance are in the first three places, while if we compare the  number of attacks with the average attack sise, healthcare is the most critical domain.455  8.1.10 Web-based attack main trends persist  Web Attacks includes threats, such as injection and application malfunctioning, affecting IT systems in their entirety.  Modern IT systems are based on services composed at run time, which can be the target of attacks and breaches.  These services often expose a standard API interface (e.g. REST, RPC) and interact on virtual networks or  orchestration platforms, introducing new security challenges to cope with. At the same time, “traditional” (i.e. desktop,  client-side) applications suffer from long-standing issues that are still a source of bugs and attacks. Though web  attacks have remained stable over the years, we can note some interesting points as follows.   Security Misconfiguration. Unpatched software, use of default accounts or unused pages are the preferred  means exploited by attackers to bypass security protections and gain unauthorised access to systems.456  These holes can be found at all layers of a system and are difficult to manage.   Automated brute force, dictionary, and session management attacks are increasingly adopted.456 For  instance, Remote Desktop Protocols (RDPs) are exploited by attackers for malware infection; to do this,  attackers search for specific open ports in order to implement brute force attacks.   Cyber-attackers are turning security defences into weapons. For instance, secure channels can be used  to cover malware distribution, to disrupt secured transactions, and for data exfiltration.456   Untrusted compositions. Composite services are increasingly composed of atomic services to provide  advanced functionalities, while introducing new risks that go beyond the risks faced by atomic services.457  On one hand, composite services can increase the risk of data breaches by combining the different sources  452 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  453 Vivek Ganti, Omer Yoachimik, DDoS attack trends for 2021 Q1, April 2021, https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attack-trends-for-2021-q1/  454 Tom Emmons, PART I: Retrospective 2020: ddos was back -- bigger and badder than ever before, https://blogs.akamai.com/2021/01/part-i- retrospective-2020-ddos-was-back-bigger-and-badder-than-ever-before.html  455 David Warburton, F5 Labs, DDoS Attack Trends for 2020, May 2021, https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ddos-attack-trends-for-2020  456 H2020 EU Project CONCORDIA, Deliverable D4.1 - 1st year report on cybersecurity threats, https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp- content/uploads/2020/06/D4.1_Ready_for_Submission_D4.1-final_revised.pdf  457 M.

On the other hand, the composition of atomic services could entail an endemic risk  related to the fact that the strength of a composite application is the one of its weakest link.458   Many of the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities are due to misconfigurations459, an issue discussed in  Chapter 10 of the ETL 2021. Injection and cross-site scripting (respectively number 1 and number 7 in the list  of the OWASPs most critical web application security risks) exploit system misconfigurations, such as  insufficient data validation. In addition, default configurations are often insecure and cause web-based  attacks. Finally, a lack of server-side verification or access controls introduces a level of risk, especially when  auxiliary services are requested.   According to the OWASP459, web-based attacks exploit components with known vulnerabilities. Also,  they benefit from insufficient logging and monitoring.  8.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  Both DDoS and web-based attacks are long-standing threats and several mitigation measures are well known and  established. In summary, we present in the following some fundamental mitigation vectors for DDoS and web-based  attacks, with a particular focus on trends that emerged during the reporting period.   A denial-of-service response plan is fundamental for organisations where resilience is a priority and should  integrate system checklists, response teams, and efficient communication and escalation procedures.   The security process should be a continuous activity that follows and adapts system and network evolutions  and life cycles.435   Collaboration and coordination between relevant organisations is important to multiply and strengthen  mitigation efforts.   Implement DDoS protection using an on-premises solution, DDoS scrubbing service, or a hybrid solution.455   Use both network and web application firewalls443. The first can be coupled with approaches mitigating  peaked traffic such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN), a load balancer and scalable resources. The latter  is particularly useful in case DDoS is based on injection or XSS.460   Use antivirus solutions to curb malware infections.   Use a network-based intrusion-detection system.   Apply patches promptly, especially when many employees use their personal machines for work.  Organisations should give high priority to system updates and deliver them to users remotely.   Traffic profiling and traffic filtering may assist in providing early warning signs of abnormal traffic patterns that  are an indicator of DDoS attacks.   Use DDoS mitigation services to detect abnormal traffic flows and redirects traffic away from your network,  as well as rate limiting to restrict the volume of incoming traffic.   Protect web-based APIs and monitor for related vulnerabilities.   Fortify DNS or even consider a managed DNS service. Cache poisoning or similar exploits can be prevented  by the use of DNSSEC, or even better a managed DNS vendor supporting the DNSSEC specification.   Consider a multi-layered solution mixing detection, investigation, and response capabilities across multiple  platforms.   Build a threat intelligence program based on a proactive approach that adapts the security posture to the  evolving threat environment.   Use staff training and cybersecurity exercises to increase capacity building and preparedness.  Countermeasures for mitigating web-based attacks are as follows:   Set up a web application firewall (WAF) to identify and filter malicious requests.460 WAF must be kept  updated to protect the system against newly discovered vulnerabilities.   Strengthen the code base (e.g. input sanitisation, parametrised statements) to protect against injection-  based attacks.  458 H2020 EU Project CONCORDIA, Deliverable D4.2 - 2nd year report on cybersecurity threats, https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf  459 OWASP Top Ten, https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/  460 Tripwire, The 10 Most Common Website Security Attacks (and How to Protect Yourself), December 2020, https://www.tripwire.com/state-of- security/featured/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/  https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/ https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  73   Promptly update software to avoid zero-day attacks.   Properly configure and harden web servers and regularly patch all servers exposed on the Internet.   Continuously verify the effectiveness of your security hardening, using attack tools, vulnerability scanners, and  penetration test services.   Enable logging and inspect those logs.

DISINFORMATION -  MISINFORMATION  The rise in the use of digital technologies and social media has changed the way in which people access information  and news. Unlike traditional media (e.g. newspapers, TV), social media guarantees direct access to information with  no filters. The price we pay for such a convenient way of accessing information is the increasing risk of retrieving fake  news and manipulated information.461 In this context, social media assumes the role of preferred amplifier of  information, much more than what happened with the advent of traditional media. This information may be fake  (therefore changing perception of reality in people) or real (information about incidents, errors, losses, opinions, and  reputation regarding a company). The amplification effect of (social) media is an important threat to individuals,  enterprises and even states, because an item of false news can be perceived as real, while an apparently minor  problem might become a major incident in public opinion. In addition, social media can be manipulated to distort the  market or become effective vectors of misinformation/smear campaigns against a company or the reputation of some  of its most representative individuals. The brand reputation, financial solidity of the company, and the trustworthiness  of the management as well as the honesty and trustworthiness of individuals are therefore put at risk.  Media-driven market manipulations and misleading public-opinion campaigns were boosted in recent years thanks to  new technologies that increase the ability to spread fabricated information.456 Two main attacks emerged, namely,  disinformation and misinformation. Though often perceived as similar, since they refer to inaccurate, incorrect, or  misleading information, they entail fundamentally different concepts.462 463 464  Disinformation is an intentional attack that consists of the creation or sharing of false or misleading information.  Disinformation attacks experienced an exponential boost in the COVID-19 pandemic era, for instance, targeting  people’s trust on vaccines.  Misinformation is an unintentional attack, where sharing of information is done inadvertently. Inaccuracy carried by  the information is unintentional and could happen for example when a journalist reports wrong information in good  faith or reports information by mistake. The spread of misinformation also includes scenarios where people believe a  news item regardless of veracity because it supports their worldview.  One may argue about the how these threats relate to cybersecurity. It is important to note that disinformation and  misinformation attacks are among the preparatory activities at the basis of other attacks (e.g. phishing, social  engineering, malware infection). Moreover, such threats are often used in tandem with other cybersecurity threats,  thus leading to advanced hybrid threats. It should also be underlined that the main aim of these threats is to  undermine trust, which is the foundation of cybersecurity. By shattering that foundation, cascading effects ripple  throughout the whole cybersecurity ecosystem and may have severe implications.  The success of these attacks is due to the spread guaranteed by social media, and has both technical and social  foundations.465 466 Social media amplifies news and circulates information independently of its accuracy.

In addition, many sites flourish because  their intent is to make money through advertising. Their goal is not to circulate true or false information but rather to  collect clicks (clickbait), which has the side effect of spreading misleading information.467  The complexity of this scenario is due to the difficulty in distinguishing the real intent of a piece of information or even  its originator. This is even more difficult when information campaigns are analysed in detail. Different campaigns exist  and their boundaries are quite difficult to draw. For instance, the differences between advertising, public relations,  public diplomacy (or public affairs), information operations, and propaganda are quite blurred, since they all represent  information campaigns whose understanding depends on personal interpretation.468  This huge flow of dis- or mis-information is flooding people with the goal of causing uncertainty, apathy towards truth,  exhaustion in trying to find it, and fear. It is becoming increasingly clear that policy-makers should put disinformation  at the core of their agenda, while also including security and privacy implications.469  Social media are the most critical vector for misinformation and disinformation attacks. They permit direct access to  information with no filters, increasing the risk of encountering fake news and manipulated information. Social media  are also the preferred amplifier of misinformation and disinformation attacks, bringing those attacks on a large-scale.  Technical peculiarities of social networks also increase the circulation of (fake) news such as trending topic lists. This  is further amplified when people are in social relations and exchange information with like-minded people sharing the  same beliefs, creating the so called “Echo Chamber” effect.470  Examples of social media-based attack vectors are celebrities or influencers spreading disinformation, social media  groups promoting material for supporters. Traditional approaches are also used to carry out disinformation or  misinformation attacks such as the spread of malicious accounts: bots, spammers, fake domains, and cyborgs.471  Social bots have attracted a huge interest and have been massively adopted.472 Some studies, on Twitter, claimed  that social bots can represent between 5 and 15% of users and are responsible for misinformation campaigns,  phishing attacks, election and market manipulation.473  Starting from the above vectors, two main classes of threat agents are playing the disinformation/misinformation role.  On one hand, we have state-backed groups implementing state-sponsored attacks. On the other hand, we have  cybercriminals, that is, non-state and private commercial organisations benefiting from the increasing availability of  Disinformation-as-a-Service. For instance, conspiracy narratives are distributed by terrorists, extremists and  organised criminal groups to manipulate people. In general, a large part of attacks is managed by non-state domestic  actors, while both types of agents are increasingly targeting the private sector to spread misinformation, and  manipulate the market or attack the reputation of competitors.474 475 Misinformation and disinformation are  increasingly distributed as chains of messages, social media content, deepfakes, and phishing via voice, text, and e-  mail.476  467 Alice E.

They may aim to cause financial  and reputational damage and arouse a lack of trust in society at all levels. An overview is presented in Table 2. 477  Table 2: Misinformation and Disinformation: Target, Means, and Goals  Target Means Goal  People Disinformation, misinformation, fake news  Reduce perceived honesty and  trustworthiness of individuals  Enterprises  Market distortion, misinformation, disinformation,  smear campaigns, fake news, propaganda  Affect brand reputation, financial solidity of  the company, and the trustworthiness of  the management.  Society Disinformation, fake news  Inability to distinguish real and fake news,  apathy, exhaustion in trying to find the  truth, manipulating and misleading public-  opinion  Any  Sharing of inaccurate information Make money based on advertisement  Figure 10 shows incidents based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA for the purposes of  situational awareness.478 The scope of the collection is global and multi-sectorial. Incidents, however, with a direct  impact in the EU area are given priority. Notable misinformation and disinformation incidents are included in Annex B.  More work is needed to better classify cyber incidents related to disinformation and misinformation, since a lot of them  are classified in other categories given that they are commonly used in complex, hybrid attacks. This is the reason why  there is a constant fluctuation throughout the year as evidenced by the figure.  Figure 10: Misinformation and disinformation incidents observed by ENISA (April 2020-July 2021)  477 PwC, The disinformation age has arrived.

According to the GRPS, a  ‘backlash against science’ will heighten the risks of ‘climate action failure’ and ‘infectious diseases’ over the next  decade.” Dissemination of disinformation on elections, humanitarian crises, and public health, security and cultural  issues is expected to increase over the next decade. Political divisiveness acts as an amplifier of disinformation and is  affecting public trust, especially in those countries (e.g. US) where a non-negligible number of individuals primarily  access political news through social media (2020).480  Some interesting and important points emerge and are summarised in the following.   Phishing is at the heart of disinformation attacks and it strongly exploit the beliefs of people.   Human-centric threats are difficult to analyse in pragmatic terms, including the ability to describe,  decompose, classify, and reproduce them to feed quantitative analyses, graphical or numerical simulations,  or coding into algorithms.437   Disinformation attacks benefit from the difficulty of quantifying everything connected with humans. When the  threat involves or depends on people's behaviour (e.g. errors, cognitive bias, skill shortages), measurements  and data collection are complex processes that often result in poor-quality data.437   The problem around disinformation is not the ability to distinguish true or false information; instead it is a  social and epistemic crisis amplified by the evolving media and political context.464   Disinformation that is moving from political/social spheres to the corporate world is growing in scope and  impact thanks to social media platforms and content creation technologies.481  9.1.1 AI-enabled disinformation supports attackers in carrying out their attacks  AI is used to build realistic profiles and images, to vary the content and wording of posts and to get unnoticed.482 483 AI-  powered social media is at the basis of the spread of disinformation, causing social chaos.484  Deepfakes technology is evolving quickly. Supporting technology makes the creation of deepfakes simpler, while  social media help in spreading them485. Additionally, misinformation and disinformation campaigns are becoming  more credible thanks to deepfakes, which cannot yet be fully counteracted.486 487  9.1.2 Coronavirus pandemic used for amplification of attacks  COVID-19 is a top topic for disinformation attacks, resulting in what the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned as  an infodemic of online dis/misinformation.488 464 Disinformation campaigns aim to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt  around the effectiveness of Coronavirus vaccines. This is used as the basis for social engineering attacks. It also  targets the beliefs of individuals, reducing trust in information sources and impacting business brands. Businesses  and individuals are targeted by disinformation campaigns focused on green pass, mandatory vaccination, health  passports, mass immunity testing, and lockdowns.  479 The Global Economic Forum, The Global Risks Report 2021 16th Edition, 2021  http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2021.pdf  480 Miles Parks, Trump Is No Longer Tweeting, But Online Disinformation Isn't Going Away, March 2021,  https://www.npr.org/2021/03/05/971767967/trump-is-no-longer-tweeting-but-online-disinformation-isnt-going-away?t=1624004975614  481 PwC, The disinformation age has arrived.

As an example, during the lockdown imposed to flatten the COVID-19 curve, experts  were competing with substantial campaigns of online misinformation and disinformation464. In more detail, fake shops  related to COVID-19 proliferated, as well as scams targeting people interested in information related to COVID-19. Six  hundred malicious apps proposing COVID-19 services contained trojans/spyware. Avast also reported the rise of  deepfakes especially related to pornographic domains and targeting normal people (e.g. TikTok users). The UK’s  National Cyber Security Centre, in April 2020, removed 2,000 scams, including 471 fake online shops, and 200  phishing sites.490 491 In this context, politicians, policy makers, legislators are pressing social media enterprises (e.g.  Google, Facebook, Twitter) to find countermeasures and limit the proliferation of misinformation/disinformation  campaigns.492  9.1.3 Disinformation-as-a-Service (DaaS)  Professional disinformation is produced on a large scale by major governments, political parties, and public relations  firms.493 Since 2019, a growing number of third parties have been offering disinformation services, providing targeted  attacks on behalf of clients.494 Services are provided in numerous countries and an increasing number of non-state  and private commercial organisations are using them.495 In this context, disinformation has moved from political and  social spheres to the corporate world.496 The University of Oxford monitored the manipulation of public opinion using  social media by governments and political parties, and the various private companies and other organisations they  work with to spread disinformation.497 From a geographical point of view, disinformation and misinformation are  targeting every country in the world.  9.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  Mitigation vectors include both technical and non-technical domains. On one side, mitigation vectors are manual and  human-based approaches targeting training and awareness, fact checking and debunking, regulations, and  communication. On the other side, technical solutions are important to limit the spread of mis/disinformation through  social networks. Co-operation between all actors is important to further limit the impact of mis/disinformation attacks.  In general, the following approaches may be explored to mitigate misinformation and disinformation campaigns.   Training and awareness: is the process preparing employees in managing disinformation attacks, and also in  assessing any e-mail and report.498 499 In this context, following a vaccine-like approach, prebunking aims to  expose users to a small amount of mis/disinformation to prepare them to manage mis/disinformation later on.  Other approaches focus on gamification, where a simulation of social media feeds is used to teach users in  distinguishing real and fake news. For instance, online game, “Go Viral!“500 aimed to prebunk common  misinformation surrounding COVID-19.501  489 Avast, 2020: The Year of Fake News, COVID-related Scams and Ransomware, November 2020, https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2020- the-year-of-fake-news-COVID-related-scams-and-ransomware-301180568.html  490 Paul McEvatt, Fujitsu, 2021 Prediction: The Age of Disinformation Attacks, January 2021, https://blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2021-01-12/2021- prediction-the-age-of-disinformation-attacks/  491 Fujitsu, Top 10 Cyber Security Predictions for 2021, 2021, https://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/security/insights/predictions-2021/  492 Jane Wakefield, Google, Facebook Twitter grilled in US on fake news, March 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56523378  493 Samantha Bradshaw, Hannah Bailey, Philip N.

For instance, examine sources, authors, cross-references, cited data and dates are some examples.502 503   Fact Check and Debunking False Stories: many efforts by both non-profit organisations and government  agencies have been undertaken to reduce the impact of misinformation and disinformation.504 505 These actors  aim to debunk publications and content carrying false information and fake news.506 Many efforts have been  undertaken to counteract the infodemic around COVID-19.507   Regulations: new regulations (such as the proposed EC Digital Services Act508) and punishments for sites,  including social networks, spreading fake news are under way. In the context of the GDPR (General Data  Protection Regulation), it is possible to limit access to information that enables targeted advertising.509  Accordingly, GDPR can help against misinformation by regulating the processing of personal data by online  targeted advertising – which is also a tool used for spreading fake news. So GDPR, by regulating online targeted  advertising, could also indirectly contribute in a broader way to the limitation of misinformation. The Code of  Practice on disinformation provides self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation with the support of industry.510  The EU recently released the Fifth Progress Report on “the implementation of the 2016 Joint Framework on  countering hybrid threats and the 2018 Joint Communication on increasing resilience and bolstering capabilities to  address hybrid threats”. The report discussed the need to protect free and fair elections, the role of strategic  communications and a centre of excellence for countering hybrid threats, the importance of cooperation among  countries and resilience against radicalisation and extremism.511   Strategic and transparent communication: that is factual and separate from political communication.512   Technical countermeasures: 513 514 515 516 517 456  o Rewriting search engine algorithms   Social network detection and mitigation: i) suspension of fake accounts (e.g. accounts that post  duplicate or redundant information), ii) mechanisms to filter and flag fake news, iii) reductions of  automatic activities (e.g. Bots), iv) artificial Intelligence tools and platforms to detect fake news  based on online approaches, v) data science/big data visualisation to identify the large-scale  spread of disinformation, vi) mobile apps and chatbots powered by factcheckers targeting the  general public, vii) web-browser extensions for the general public, viii) digital media information  literacy platforms and tools  o Awareness campaigns through advertisements  o Credibility rating, flagging suspicious behaviour  o Digital watermarking (tagging visual content)  o Creation of protection strategies centred around sentiment tracking and dark web monitoring.  502 Lion Gu, Vladimir Kropotov,

October 2021  82  10. NON-MALICIOUS THREATS  Threats are commonly considered as voluntary and malicious activities carried out by adversaries who have some  incentives to attack a specific target. In these sections, we cover threats where malicious intent is not apparent.  Non-malicious threats are mostly based on human errors and system misconfigurations518 , but they can also refer  to physical disasters that target IT infrastructures. Non-malicious threats can be classified in two categories:  Errors and Misconfigurations are caused by negligence, lack of awareness or, simply, human errors. These  include:   errors when managing an IT system: i) misconfigurations introduced when specific applications and systems  are (re-)configured and updated; ii) erroneous system management including errors in patching and updating a  system; iii) erroneous system administration, for instance, in distributing privileges among users; iv) issues in  the management of traditional systems such as network security, access control, identity management.   development-time errors: i) issues with the management of dependencies; for instance, libraries that are used  without developers even noticing; ii) long-standing issues, for instance, memory safety, unsanitised inputs and,  in general, issues with well-known solutions involving the use of modern tools,519 520 521 522 iii) other forms of  negligence, for instance, storing application credentials on public repositories.523 524 525   application-level errors: i) errors introduced when using an application/system, ii) misconfigured (cloud)  applications and poor password and key management; for instance, publicly available buckets, unencrypted  databases, iii) minor errors, such as sending an e-mail to the wrong recipient.526   physical errors: i) unattended devices, ii) unsecured documents/information, iii) exceptions to physical access  rules.  Physical Disasters can be classified as:   damages to or failures of physical infrastructure, such as inadvertent damage to fibre cables, loss of Internet  connection, fire, unstable power supply,   natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, causing the unavailability of the IT infrastructure and related  services/applications.  For non-malicious threats, we can distinguish between four main actors:   Normal Users interact and use a system with all privileges needed to carry out a specific and limited activity on  it.   Privileged users (Admins) have root privileges on the system and are responsible for system configuration and  management. Intuitively, and confirmed by some reports, the damage caused by an error committed by these  users is typically much higher.527 These also include users responsible for physical IT infrastructure.  518 H2020 EU Project CONCORDIA, Deliverable D4.2 - 2nd year report on cybersecurity threats, https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf  519 JSOF.

This  category can also be broadened to include third-party providers of software libraries and components.  Depending on their role, different types of non-malicious threats can be associated to actors as seen in Table 3:  Table 3: Mapping between non-malicious threats and actors  Threat Category Threat Type Actors  Errors and  Misconfigurations  Errors made when managing an IT system Privileged Users  Development-time errors Developers, Service/Cloud Providers  Application-level errors Users, Privileged Users  Physical errors All  Physical Disasters  Damages to or failures of physical infrastructure Privileged Users, Cloud Providers  Natural disasters None  Non-malicious threats represent a major threat vector for many existing malicious threats. For instance, security  vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, inadequate vulnerability and patch management can open the door to DDoS  attacks, malware and ransomware. At the same time human errors are a major vector for phishing and social  engineering. Notable non-malicious incidents are included in Annex B.  Misconfiguration is the most common attack vector (approximately 50%), followed by misdelivery (approximately  30%), based on a 2021 report by Verizon on data breaches.528 Programming errors account for a very small  percentage, stressing the fact that often security measures do exist and work correctly but are not applied. Cloud  misconfigurations substantially boosted and, according to Palo Alto Networks, can be classified in two main  categories: i) storage and encryption issues, ii) network issues.529 Encryption of data at rest and in transit remains  among the major misconfigurations, as well as permissive policies, lack of sophisticated protections and storage  available publicly.530 Also, non-malicious vectors/threats are rising in the case of the Internet of Things (IoT) with i)  exploitation of device vulnerabilities (41%, including 3% zero-day) and ii) user practices (26%, 13% password-based)  in the top spots.531  Considering non-malicious threat agents and vectors, the statement that points to “humans as the weakest part in a  system” is becoming increasingly relevant. Major threat vectors are lack of training and skills, as well as awareness, in  the users, developers and administrators. Lack of standardised processes, as well as weak configurations by default  (e.g. encryption disabled by default), are increasing the probability of an error/misconfiguration.532 All these vectors  coupled with the increasing complexity of modern systems that mix Cloud, Edge and IoT make current scenarios a  ticking time bomb. At the same time, weak physical infrastructures not ready to face destructive natural events, as  well as lack of proper plans for utility management open the doors to disasters that might impact the availability of the  system.  Major inadvertent threat agents are therefore individuals who have different roles in system life cycles as end users,  privileged users, developers and cloud/services providers. Considering errors and misconfigurations, in virtually all  cases the threat actor is internal, for instance, an employee inadvertently publishing some records, or an IT manager  not securing properly an S3 bucket. In more detail,533 internal actors account for 99% of breaches, the remaining  percentage is divided among partners and a combination thereof. Among internal actors, the three most frequent are  528 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  529 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  530 Aqua Security - Cloud Security Report - Cloud Configuration Risks Exposed  531 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/  532 Aqua Security - Cloud Security Report - Cloud Configuration Risks Exposed  533 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  84  system admin (approximately 50%), developer (approximately 30%), and end user (approximately 20%). However,  the possible damage of such breaches is typically much higher in the first two cases, since i) system admins are the  most powerful users controlling virtually all the systems; ii) developers frequently have privileged access to data.  Regarding physical disaster, threat agents are either the users acting on and managing the physical infrastructure, or  natural events impacting the physical infrastructure.  10.1 TRENDS  In summary, non-malicious threats have historically had an important impact on the working of IT systems and  applications, but their impact is being exacerbated by i) the increasing complexity of the systems and infrastructures;  ii) the increasing migration to cloud environments and integration of IoT devices and edge computing, often with  limited amount of time, skills and resources;534 and iii) the COVID-19 pandemic. On top of this, skills shortages and  well-known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations continue to be an issue.  10.1.1 Errors and system misconfigurations are the most frequent reported root cause  In 2020, out of the incidents with significant impacts reported under the NIS directive535, 17% were flagged as human  errors, while system failures remain the most frequent root cause of reported incidents at a rate of 48%. The causes  these incidents were software bugs and hardware failures. This was a continuing trend as similar figures were  reported in 2019.536  Similar trends are also observed for Telecommunication and Trust services in 2020:   System failures in the telecom sector maintained the widest impact with almost 50% of the total user hours  lost and were the most likely root cause of incidents (61%).537 Faulty software changes/updates accounted  for 41% of the total user hours lost and 24% of the total incidents. Human errors accounted for 41% of the  total user hours lost, and were the root cause of 26% of total incidents (an increasing trend). Third party  failures remain stable at 29%.   System failures accounted for more than half of the incidents in the trust services sector in 2020, and were  the major root cause (53%). Human errors were the root cause of 39% of the incidents.538  10.1.2 COVID-19 increased the number of non-malicious incidents due to migration to the  cloud  The pandemic forced a migration to the cloud, causing a substantial increase in cloud workloads between October  2019 and February 2021 all over the world: 70% in the APAC region, 69% in the EMEA region, 65% in the AMER  region and 58% in Japan539. According to Palo Alto networks,539 the industries with the highest increase in security  incidents (Retail 402%, Manufacturing 230%, Government 205%, and Pharma and Life sciences 127%) were among  those that increased their cloud workloads significantly due to the pandemic.  A huge number of recent data breaches is caused by misconfigured buckets.540 While many of them revealed  personal information, it is also common to find credentials and secrets stored in buckets. Using simple crawling  techniques, Truffle Security built an initial list of 4,000 open S3 buckets which, due to file name patterns, were likely to  contain environmental variables and other secrets. Files matching those patterns contained an average of 2.5 secrets.  Furthermore, some of them also contained credentials to open authenticated buckets and secrets for other services,  from database passwords to PayPal credentials and JWT secrets.  534 Security Today, The IoT Rundown For 2020: Stats, Risks, and Solutions, January 2020, https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT- Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2  535 Annual Report NIS Directive Incidents 2020 CG Publication, to be released. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group  536 Annual Report NIS Directive Incidents 2019, CG Publication 03/20, December 2020. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation- group  537 ENISA, Telecom Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report, July 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting- 2020  538 ENISA, Trust Services Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report, July 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident- 2020-annual-report  539 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  540 Truffle Security, An API Worm in The Making: Thousands of Secrets Found in Open S3 Buckets, August 2021, https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/an-s3- bucket-worm-in-the-making-thousands-of-secrets-found-in-open-s3-buckets  https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2 https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident-2020-annual-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident-2020-annual-report https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/an-s3-bucket-worm-in-the-making-thousands-of-secrets-found-in-open-s3-buckets https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/an-s3-bucket-worm-in-the-making-thousands-of-secrets-found-in-open-s3-buckets  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  85  10.1.3 Vulnerabilities and bugs continue to play a prominent role  In 2020, NIST received more than 18,000 new CVEs (fourth year in a row that this number grows)541, and this trend  seems to be continuing in 2021542.  The 2020 also saw a never-seen-before spike in IoT malware, exploiting devices that are, in most cases, unsecure  and never patched properly. The challenges behind unsecure IoT are well-known and detailed, for instance, the IoT  Top Ten by OWASP contains vulnerabilities such as Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces, Lack of Secure Update  Mechanisms, Use of Insecure or Outdated Components and Lack of Device Management.543 Sonicwall reports an  even faster increase in the first half of 2021.544 In homes due to school reopenings, the rise in COVID-19 cases and  the growth in the number of IoT devices.  On the contrary, the exploitation of vulnerabilities accounts for only 3% of breaches545. When organisations expose  some vulnerable hosts on the Internet, such vulnerabilities are quite old and attackers still actively exploit them.  According to Verizon, 20% of organisations expose vulnerabilities as old as 2010. SonicWall discovered similar old  vulnerabilities still being exploited.546  These findings stress once again how organisations do not deal effectively with patch management. The scenario of  unpatched vulnerabilities and legacy software is particularly critical in the healthcare sector. For instance, 83% of all  imaging devices run on operating systems which are not actively supported, including Windows 7.547 They are also  responsible for a high number of security issues, compared to the number of deployed devices, where the imaging  systems, patient monitoring and medical device gateways (which account for 34% of all devices) are at the basis of  86% of all security issues.  According to a recent report548, the top 30 ecommerce retailers in the US use 1,131 third-party resources each and  23% of them include at least one critical vulnerability. This results in possible cascading effects where a compromise  of a system can open the door to compromises in other domains. The total cost of a breach caused by a third party  is $4.29 million on average. In this context, Verizon claims that web applications are involved in 43% of the  breaches and 80% of organisations experienced an attack from a vulnerability in their third-party software.  According to Aqua Security,549 SMEs do fix issues faster than enterprises, 75 days vs 88 days (on average).  10.1.4 Physical and natural threats affect digital infrastructures and  telecommunications  According to the Annual Report NIS Directive Incidents 2020550, natural phenomena were reported to affect only the  digital infrastructure and the communication sector. About half of the incidents affecting the digital infrastructure sector  (38 incidents – 9%) and one incident affecting the communication sector were reported as natural disasters.  Regarding telecom security incidents in the EU reported in 2020551, natural phenomena come third as the root cause  at almost a tenth of total incidents (9%, 109 incidents in total).  10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  It is important to note that, since non-malicious threats are among the major threat vectors for any type of attack,  mitigation vectors in this section might overlap with the ones in other chapters of this report.

In the latter case,  attacks driven by AI (e.g. deepfakes) can trigger a human error, which is very difficult to prevent in a wholly  technical way. Hence, robust organisational policies are needed to mitigate human errors.557   Adopting a governance-based approach to data and security, allowing data to be thoroughly considered and  followed.558 559 560   A patch management plan to deal with vulnerabilities: a proper plan does not require everything to be  patched but means what is needed must be patched, eventually using priorities coming, for instance, from a  risk management process.561,562   Adopting a wider definition of patch management, it should also refer to organisations pushing for updates  rather than only receiving them (i.e. software and hardware producers). There are many cases of IoT  vulnerabilities that have been around for years and it is difficult to understand who should actually publish the  patches.563 564   Updates should be delivered in a secure way (e.g. Tesla Model X’s lack of code signing565).   Patch management must account for supply chain risk.566,567   Training and awareness for all types of users. Properly trained developers can introduce many security and  safety practices into their products,568 leveraging modern languages and frameworks giving more security  guarantees. This is crucial also for developing secure IoT devices without some long-standing issues such as  those related to memory safety.569 Admins should be trained on the security (and compliance) aspects of  their activities, relying on solutions which ensure security by default. Finally, training and awareness are  fundamental for end users to help them, for instance, in recognising early signs of incidents and making the  right choice at the right moment.570 571 572 573 574 575   Engineering of physical infrastructures to be more robust against natural events, as well as a proper  management of utilities guaranteeing business continuity in case of unexpected events or shortages.   Zero-trust security approach,576 assuming everything is considered malicious and untrusted. This approach  moves from implicitly trusting assets because of their location or ownership towards a dynamic approach  552 Andi Hendrickson, Top 5 Physical Security Considerations, July 2021, https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/top-5-physical-security-considerations/  553 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  554 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  555 Accenture, State of Cybersecurity Report, 2020  556 Booz Allen Hamilton, Supply Chain Vulnerability Trends to Watch Out For, February 2021  557 Sophos Threat Report 2020  558 Anna Larkina, Roman Dedenok, Doxing in the corporate sector, March 2021, https://securelist.com/corporate-doxing/101513/  559 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  560 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  561 Accenture, Cyber Threatscape Report, 2020  562 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  563 Forescount Amnesie:33  564 Lily Hay Newman, Wired, Critical Flaws in Millions of IoT Devices May Never Get Fixed, December 2020, https://www.wired.com/story/amnesia33- iot-vulnerabilitiesmay-never-get-fixed/  565 Andy Greenberg, This Bluetooth Attack Can Steal a Tesla Model X in Minutes, November 2020, https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model-x-hack- bluetooth/  566 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  567 Booz Allen Hamilton, Rethink Cyber Defense After the SolarWinds Hack, June 2021  568 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  569 Forescout Amnesia:33  570 Kaspersky, Financial Cyberthreats in 2020, March 2021, https://securelist.com/financial-cyberthreats-in-2020/101638/  571 Shasya Sharma, Monitor, review, and protect Amazon S3 buckets using Access Analyzer for S3, December 2019,  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/protect-amazon-s3-buckets-using-access-analyzer-for-s3/  572 AWS IAM access analysis features, https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/analyze-access/  573 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  574 Blackberry Threat Report, 2020  575 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  576 NIST SP 800-207.

Despite increasing physical attacks, corporate leaders are reluctant to believe their companies  could be physical threat targets.580   Recovery plans and backups are fundamental to increasing system resilience.   Physical breaches can facilitate attacks. For instance, vulnerabilities in physical access control, tailgaters,  unattended devices can help an adversary in executing an attack.581 582   Errors and malfunctioning in internal equipment (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) can bring on  scenarios in which fire, humidity and unstable power supplies can damage IT infrastructures.583   Climate changes are posing a new set of challenges on system availability and resilience. Flooding, fire, and  earthquakes are happening at an increasing rate with an exponential power and impact on all  infrastructures.584 Risk assessment, disaster recovery techniques, and personnel training are fundamental.  577 Booz Allen Hamilton, Rethink Cyber Defense After the SolarWinds Hack, June 2021  578 Gartner, Top security and risk management trends 2021, 2021  579 Blackberry 2021 Threat Report, 2021  580 The Ontic Center for Protective Intelligence, 2021 Mid-Year Outlook State of Protective Intelligence Report - The Escalating Physical Threat  Landscape: A Clarion Call for Corporate Protective Intelligence https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-failures-regularly-occur-at- large-us-companies-resulting-in-physical-threats-or-harm-and-business-continuity-disruption-study-finds-301334484.html, https://ontic.co/wp- content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Mid-Year-Outlook-State-of-Protective-Intelligence-Report.pdf  581 https://www.boonedam.com/en-us/pillar-page/making-physical-security-part-of-cybersecurity-best-practices  582 Andi Hendrickson, Top 5 Physical Security Considerations, July 2021, https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/top-5-physical-security-considerations/  583 Karoline Gore, Physical threats to Cybersecurity that you must address, October 2019, https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security- essentials/physical-threats-to-cybersecurity-that-you-must-address  584 Warren Cornwall, Europe’s deadly floods leave scientists stunned, July 2021, https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/europe-s-deadly-floods- leave-scientists-stunned  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-failures-regularly-occur-at-large-us-companies-resulting-in-physical-threats-or-harm-and-business-continuity-disruption-study-finds-301334484.html https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-failures-regularly-occur-at-large-us-companies-resulting-in-physical-threats-or-harm-and-business-continuity-disruption-study-finds-301334484.html https://ontic.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Mid-Year-Outlook-State-of-Protective-Intelligence-Report.pdf https://ontic.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Mid-Year-Outlook-State-of-Protective-Intelligence-Report.pdf https://www.boonedam.com/en-us/pillar-page/making-physical-security-part-of-cybersecurity-best-practices https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/top-5-physical-security-considerations/ https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/physical-threats-to-cybersecurity-that-you-must-address https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/physical-threats-to-cybersecurity-that-you-must-address https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/europe-s-deadly-floods-leave-scientists-stunned https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/europe-s-deadly-floods-leave-scientists-stunned  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  88  A ANNEX:  MITRE ATT&CK  RANSOMWARE  The figure illustrated below highlights the techniques in MITRE ATT&CK® Framework associated with ransomware  software, ransomware groups or both according to the legend.585 Notice that this is a dynamic representation,  based on actual observations.

Software is the interaction  layer with information technology. This report focuses on malware in general, which we cannot unambiguously map  to the ATT&CK Framework. Instead, malware is defined as a single building block of Capability Development. MITRE  ATT&CK® describes malware as a means to support the threat actor’s operations, obtaining a means for maintaining  control of remote machines, evading defences, and executing post-compromise behaviours.586 For illustration  purposes, we describe the mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework concerning one notable malware, namely  Emotet, which may be seen to be using a variety of different techniques in different stages.

GRE (1.43%) and HTTP flooding (1.10%) showed modest growth. Linux  botnets continued to account for almost all DDoS traffic (99.90%).  Web application security is a prime threat vector for both large and small organisations590,591,592. F5 Labs classified  DDoS attacks into three categories: volumetric, application, protocol, and analysed their frequency. 73% of all  incidents was due to volumetric attacks; 53% of the attacks built on reflection attacks.591 For example, application  DDoS includes HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS requests to a server.

June 2020,  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53093611  636 Another particular case of DoS incidents includes attacks on Docker APIs, a category of attacks that appeared prominently during the reporting  period. Attacks on Docker APIs give cybercriminals access to the host with root privileges, leading to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks,  remote code execution (RCE), and unauthorised cryptocurrency mining activity. These attacks require some form of misconfiguration or security gap in  the infected system. In particular, the group needed to perform remote code execution on the system by taking advantage of instances of  misconfiguration, weak or stolen credentials, or other vulnerabilities.

It allows attackers to enlarge the amount of malicious traffic and at the same time obscure the attack source.

In the process of constantly improving  our methodology for the development of threat landscapes, this year’s work has been supported by a newly formatted  ENISA ad hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL).  The time span of the ETL 2021 report is April 2020 to July 2021 and is referred to as the \"reporting period\" throughout  the report. During the reporting period, the prime threats identified include:   Ransomware   Malware   Cryptojacking   E-mail related threats   Threats against data   Threats against availability and integrity   Disinformation – misinformation   Non-malicious threats   Supply-chain attacks  In this report we discuss the first 8 cybersecurity threat categories. Supply chain threats, the 9th category, were  analysed in detail, due to their particular prominence, in a dedicated ENISA report “ENISA Threat landscape for  Supply Chain Attacks” 1.  For each of the identified threats, attack techniques, notable incidents and trends are discussed along with proposed  mitigation measures. As regards trends, during the reporting period we highlight the following:   Ransomware has been assessed as the prime threat for 2020-2021.   Governmental organisations have stepped up their game at both national and international level.   Cybercriminals are increasingly motivated by monetisation of their activities, e.g. ransomware.  Cryptocurrency remains the most common pay-out method for threat actors.   Malware decline that was observed in 2020 continues during 2021. In 2021, we saw an increase in threat  actors resorting to relatively new or uncommon programming languages to port their code.   The volume of cryptojacking infections attained a record high in the first quarter of 2021, compared to  recent years. The financial gain associated with cryptojacking incentivised threat actors to carry out these  attacks.   COVID-19 is still the dominant lure in campaigns for e-mail attacks.   There was a surge in healthcare sector related data breaches.   Traditional DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) campaigns in 2021 are more targeted, more persistent  and increasingly multivector. The IoT (Internet of Things) in conjunction with mobile networks is resulting  in a new wave of DDoS attacks.   In 2020 and 2021, we observe a spike in non-malicious incidents, as the COVID-19 pandemic became a  multiplier for human errors and system misconfigurations, up to the point that most of the breaches in  2020 were caused by errors.  Understanding the trends related to threat actors, their motivations and their targets greatly assists in planning  cybersecurity defences and mitigation strategies. This is an integral part of our overall threat assessment, since it  1 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  5  allows security controls to be prioritised and a dedicated strategy to be devised based on the potential impact and  likelihood of threat materialisation. With this in mind, for the purposes of the ETL 2021, the following four categories of  cybersecurity threat actors are considered:   State-sponsored actors   Cybercrime actors   Hacker-for-hire actors   Hacktivists  Through continuous analysis, ENISA derived trends and points of interest for each of the major threats presented in  the ETL 2021. The key findings and judgments in this assessment are based on multiple and publicly available  resources which are provided in the references used for the development of this document. The report is mainly  targeted at strategic decision-makers and policy-makers, but it will also be of interest to the technical cybersecurity  community.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  6  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  7  1. THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW  In its ninth edition, the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) report provides a general overview of the cybersecurity threat  landscape. The ETL report is partly strategic and partly technical, with information relevant to both technical and non-  technical readers. This year’s work has been supported by a newly formatted ENISA ad hoc Working Group on  Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL)2.  Cybersecurity attacks have continued to increase through the years 2020 and 2021, not only in terms of vectors and  numbers but also in terms of their impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has also –expectedly– had an impact on the  cybersecurity threat landscape. One of the more enduring developments that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic is  a lasting shift to a hybrid office model. Therefore, cybersecurity threats related to the pandemic and exploiting the  “new normal” are becoming mainstream. This trend has increased the attack surface and, as a result, we have seen a  rise in the number of cyber-attacks targeting organisations and companies through home offices3.  In general, cybersecurity threats are on the rise. Spurred by an ever-growing online presence, the transitioning of  traditional infrastructures to online and cloud-based solutions, advanced interconnectivity and the exploitation of new  features of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)45, the cybersecurity landscape has grown in terms  of sophistication of attacks, their complexity and their impact. Notably, the threat to supply chains and their  significance due to their potentially catastrophic cascading effects has reached the highest position among major  threats, so much so that ENISA produced a dedicated threat landscape for this category of threat6.  It is worth noting that in this iteration of the ETL, particular focus has been given on the impact of cyber threats in  various sectors, including the ones listed in the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD). Interesting insight  may be drawn from the particularities of each sector when it comes to the threat landscape, as well as potential  interdependencies and areas of significance. Accordingly, sectorial threat landscapes merit further attention.  There have also been some notable steps from the side of defenders in the cyber community this year, as well as the  policy makers. The global community has begun to realise the importance of communication and cooperation in  examining and tracking cybercriminals, with ransomware (the most prominent threat for the reporting period of ETL  2021) in particular becoming a prime item in agendas for meetings on strategy among global leaders.  Dedicated readers of past editions of the ETL 2021 will notice a difference in the mapping of prime threats. This year,  ENISA took a step back and consolidated threat categories in a move towards integration and better representation of  similar threats. This is part of ongoing efforts towards a revamped threat taxonomy and will help in establishing trends  methodologically over the next few years.  The ETL 2021 is based on a variety of open-source information and cyber threat intelligence sources. It identifies  major threats, trends and findings, and provides relevant high-level mitigation strategies. ENISA is currently working  on solidifying the methodology for reporting on the threat landscape to promote transparency and consistency in the  work.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  3 IBM – Cost of a Data Breach Report 2020 - https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/  4 ENISA AI Threat Landscape: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  5 https://www.stealthlabs.com/blog/top-10-cybersecurity-trends-in-2021-and-beyond/  6 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges https://www.stealthlabs.com/blog/top-10-cybersecurity-trends-in-2021-and-beyond/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  8  1.1 PRIME THREATS  A series of cyber threats emerged and materialised in the course of 2020 and 2021. Based on the analysis presented  in this report, the ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 identifies and focuses on the following 8 prime threat groups (See  Figure 1). These 8 threat groups are highlighted because of their prominence during the reporting period, their  popularity and the impact that materialisation of these threats has had.   Ransomware  Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organisation’s data and demand payment to  restore access. Ransomware has been the prime threat during the reporting period, with several high profile and  highly publicised incidents. The significance and impact of the threat of ransomware is also evidenced by a series  of related policy initiatives in the European Union (EU) and worldwide.   Malware  Malware is software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorised process that will have an adverse impact on  the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system. The threat of malware has been consistently ranked high for  many years, albeit at a decreasing rate during the reporting period of ETL 2021. The use of new attach techniques  and some major wins for the law enforcement community have impacted the operations of relevant threat actors.   Cryptojacking  Cryptojacking or hidden cryptomining is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim’s computing  power to generate cryptocurrency. With the proliferation of cryptocurrencies and their ever-increasing uptake by  the wider public, an increase in corresponding cybersecurity incidents has been observed.   E-mail related threats  E-mail related attacks are a bundle of threats that exploit weaknesses in the human psyche and in everyday  habits, rather than technical vulnerabilities in information systems. Interestingly and despite the many awareness  and education campaigns against these types of attacks, the threat persists to a notable degree. In particular, the  compromise of business e-mails and advanced sophisticated techniques in extracting monetary gains are on the  rise.   Threats against data  This category encompasses data breaches/leaks. A data breach or data leak is the release of sensitive,  confidential or protected data to an untrusted environment. Data breaches can occur as a result of a cyber-attack,  an insider job, unintentional loss or exposure of data. The threat continues to be high, since access to data is a  prime target for attackers for numerous reasons, e.g. extortion, ransom, defamation, misinformation, etc.   Threats against availability and integrity  Availability and integrity are the target of a plethora of threats and attacks, among which the families of Denial of  Service (DoS) and Web Attacks stand out. Strictly related to web-based attacks, DDoS is one of the most critical  threats to IT systems, targeting their availability by exhausting resources, causing decreases in performance, loss  of data, and service outages. The treat is consistently ranked high in the ENISA threat landscape, both because of  its manifestation in actual incidents and its potential for high impact.   Disinformation – misinformation  Disinformation and misinformation campaigns are on the rise, spurred by the increased use of social media  platforms and online media, as well as a result of the increase of people’s online presence due to the COVID-19  pandemic. This group of threats is making its first appearance in the ETL; however its importance in the cyber  world is high. Disinformation and misinformation campaigns are frequently used in hybrid attacks to reduce the  overall perception of trust, a major proponent of cybersecurity.   Non-malicious threats  Threats are commonly considered as voluntary and malicious activities brought by adversaries that have some  incentives to attack a specific target. With this category, we cover threats where malicious intent is not apparent.  These are mostly based on human errors and system misconfigurations, but they can also refer to physical  disasters that target IT infrastructures. Also attributed to their nature, these threats have a constant presence in  the annual threat landscape and are a major concern for risk assessments.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  9  Figure 1: ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 - Prime threats  It needs to be noted that the aforementioned threats involve categories and the collection of threats, consolidated into  the eight areas mentioned above. Each of the threat groups is further analysed in a dedicated chapter of this report,  which elaborates on its particularities and provides more specific information, findings, trends, attack techniques and  mitigation vectors.  1.2 KEY TRENDS  The list below summarises the main trends observed in the cyber threat landscape during the reporting period. These  are also reviewed in detail throughout the various chapters comprising the ENISA threat landscape of 2021.   Highly sophisticated and impactful supply chain compromises proliferated, as highlighted by the  dedicated ENISA Threat Landscape on Supply Chain. Managed service providers are high-value targets  for cybercriminals.   COVID-19 drove cyber espionage tasking and created opportunities for cybercriminals.   Governmental organisations have stepped up their game at both national and international level.  Increased efforts have been observed from governments to disrupt and take legal action against state-  sponsored threat actors.   Cybercriminals are increasingly motivated by monetisation of their activities, e.g. ransomware.  Cryptocurrency remains the most common pay-out method for threat actors.   Cybercrime attacks increasingly target and impact critical infrastructure.   Compromise through phishing e-mails, and brute-forcing on Remote Desktop Services (RDP) remain  the two most common ransomware infection vectors.   The focus on Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) type business models has increased over 2021, making  proper attribution of individual threat actors difficult.   The occurrence of triple extortion ransomware schemes increased strongly over the course of 2021.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  10   The malware decline that was observed in 2020 continues during 2021. In 2021, we saw an increase in  threat actors resorting to relatively new or uncommon programming languages to port their code.   Malware targeting container environments have become much more prevalent, with novel evolutions like  file-less malware being executed from memory.   Malware developers keep finding ways to make reverse engineering and dynamic analysis harder.   The volume of cryptojacking infections attained a record high in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the  last few years. The financial gain associated with cryptojacking incentivised the threat actors to carry out  these attacks.   The volume of Crypto mining in 2021 and cryptojacking activities are at a record high.   We can see that a shift from browser to file-based cryptojacking is taking place.   COVID-19 is still the dominant lure in campaigns for e-mail attacks.   Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) has increased, has grown in sophistication and become more  targeted.   The Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) business model is gaining prevalence.   Threat actors shifted their attention towards vaccine information in the context of threats to data and  information.   There was a surge in healthcare sector related data breaches.   Traditional DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are moving towards mobile networks and IoT  (Internet of Things).   Ransom Denial of Service (RDoS) is the new frontier of denial of service attacks.   Sharing of resources in virtualised environments acts as an amplifier of DDoS attacks.   DDoS campaigns in 2021 have become more targeted and much more persistent and increasingly  multivector.   Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled disinformation supports attackers in carrying out their attacks.   Phishing is at the heart of disinformation attacks and strongly exploits people’s beliefs.   Misinformation and disinformation are at the core of cybercrime activities and is increasing at an  unprecedented rate.   Disinformation-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model has grown significantly, spurred by the increasing  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to have more information.   In 2020 and 2021, we observed a spike in non-malicious incidents, as the COVID-19 pandemic became a  multiplier for human errors and system misconfigurations, up to the point that most of the breaches in  2020 were caused by errors.   There has been a spike in cloud security non-malicious incidents.  1.3 EU PROXIMITY OF PRIME THREATS  An important aspect to consider in the context of the ENISA Threat Landscape involves the proximity of a cyber threat  with respect to the European Union (EU). This is particularly important to assist analysts in assessing the significance  of cyber threats, correlate them with potential threat actors and vectors and even to guide the selection of appropriate  targeted mitigation vectors. In line with the proposed classification for the EU Common Security and Defence Policy  (CSDP)7, we classify cyber threats into four categories as illustrated in Table 1.  Table 1: Classification of proximity of cyber threats  Proximity Concerns  NEAR  Affected networks, systems, controlled and assured within EU borders. Affected population within  the borders of the EU.  MID  Networks and systems considered vital for operational objectives within the scope of the EU  digital single market and the NISD sectors, but their control and assurance relies on non-EU  institutional or MS public or private authorities. Affected population in geographical areas close to  EU borders.  7 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603175/EPRS_STU(2017)603175_EN.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  11  Proximity Concerns  FAR  Networks and systems that, if influenced, will have a critical impact on operational objectives  within the scope of the EU digital single market and the NISD sectors. Control and assurance of  those networks and systems lies beyond EU institutional or Member States’ (MS) public or private  authorities. Affected population in geographical areas far from the EU.  GLOBAL All the aforementioned areas  Figure 2 illustrates a timeline of incidents related to the prime threat categories reported in the ETL 2021. It should be  noted that the information in the graph is based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and is a result of work by  ENISA in the area of Situational Awareness8.  Figure 2: Timeline of observed incidents related to major ETL threats (OSINT-based situational  awareness) in terms of their proximity.  As evidenced by the above figure, 2021 has seen a higher number of incidents compared to 2020. In particular, the  category NEAR has a constantly rising number of observed incidents related to prime threats, which implies their  significance in the context of the EU. Unsurprisingly, the monthly trends (not shown in the figure for brevity) are quite  similar among the different classifications since cybersecurity knows no border and in most cases threats materialise  at all levels of proximity. It is noteworthy that, during the last months covered by ETL 2021, a higher EU NEAR  proximity is observed, a trend that ENISA will continue monitoring to see how it evolves and how it relates to the  activities of threat actors and ongoing threat vectors.  1.4 PRIME THREATS PER SECTOR  Cyber threats are usually not restricted to one particular sector and in most cases affect more than one of them. This  is indeed true since in many cases the threats manifest themselves by exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying ICT  systems that are being used in a variety of sectors. However, targeted attacks as well as attacks exploiting the  differences in cybersecurity maturity across sectors and the popularity/prominence of certain sectors, are all factors  that need to be considered. These factors contribute to threats manifesting themselves as incidents in specific sectors  8 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  12  and this is why it is important to look deeply into sectorial aspects of observed incidents and threats. Moreover, trends  noticed in each sector and cross-sector dependencies are observations that may be drawn from such an analysis.  Figure 3 and Figure 4 highlight the affected sectors concerning incidents observed based on OSINT (Open Source  Intelligence) and is a result of work by ENISA in the area of Situational Awareness9. They refer to incidents related to  the prime threats of ETL 2021. This is the first attempt by ENISA to map the impact of threats on specific sectors. In  the coming years and in future iterations of the threat landscape, efforts will be made to align the sectors with the  ones listed in the Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) and the proposal for its review (NISD 2.0).  Figure 3: Timeline of observed incidents related to prime ETL threats in terms of the affected sector.  9 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN)  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  13  Figure 4: Targeted sectors per number of incidents (April 2020-July 2021)  During this reporting period, a large number of incidents targeted public administration and government and digital  service providers. The latter is to be expected given the horizontal provisioning of services for this sector and thus its  impact on many other sectors. We also observed a significant number of incidents targeting end users and not  necessarily a particular sector. The health sector was also targeted significantly, and this activity shows signs of  increasing during the last few months of the reporting period (May-July 2021). Interestingly, the finance sector faces a  consistent number of incidents throughout the year. The supply chain of software also shows an increased number of  incidents during 2021, which is also an observation in the ENISA Supply Chain threat landscape report10.  1.5 METHODOLOGY  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) 2021 report is based on information available from open sources, mainly of a  strategic nature and ENISA’s own Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities, and covers more than one sector,  technology and context. The report attempts to be industry and vendor agnostic and references or cites the work from  various security researchers, security blogs and news media articles throughout the text in multiple footnotes. The  time span of the ETL 2021 report is April 2020 to July 2021 and is referred to as the \"reporting period\" throughout the  report.  For the production of the ETL 2021 report, the following approach was used. Throughout the relevant time period  ENISA, by means of situational awareness, gathered a list of major incidents as they appeared in open sources. This  list served as the foundation for the identification of the list of prime threats, as well as the source material for several  trends and statistics in the report.  Subsequently, an in-depth desk research of available literature from open sources such as news media articles,  expert opinion, intelligence reports, incident analysis and security research reports was conducted by ENISA and  external experts. Through continuous analysis, ENISA derived trends and points of interest for each of the major  threats presented in ETL 2021. The key findings and judgments in this assessment are based on multiple and publicly  available resources which are provided in the references used for the development of this document.  10 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  14  Within the report, we try to differentiate between what has been reported by our sources and what is our assessment.  (We do so by specifically using the phrase “in our assessment”). Finally, when conducting an assessment, we convey  probability by using words that express an estimate of probability (e.g. likely, very likely, certainly)11.  MITRE ATT&CK® framework12 was used in this report to highlight the attack tactics and techniques relevant to a  given threat (see Annex A). For each ATT&CK® tactic, the techniques the adversary used are presented. This can  lead to a list of ATT&CK Mitigations13 that can be applied. MITRE ATT&CK® is a knowledge base, a common  language for adversarial tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge  base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in  government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.  The report was validated by the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes14 that was established in  April 2021, a group that consists of experts from European and international public and private sector entities.  For the future development of Threat Landscapes, ENISA is in the process of formalising a new methodology, to  promote transparency and set the foundations for structured and well-aligned processes. In this endeavour, together  with a revised threat taxonomy, the methodology for threat landscapes will be made public in the future.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) 2021 has maintained the structure of previous ETL reports by using a similar  structure for highlighting the prime cyber threats in 2021. Readers of past iterations will notice that the threat  categories have been consolidated in line with a move towards a new cybersecurity threat taxonomy to be used in the  future.  This report is structured as follows:  Chapter 2 explores the trends related to threat actors (i.e. state-sponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hacker-for-hire  actors and hacktivists).  Chapter 3 discusses major findings, incidents and trends regarding ransomware.  Chapter 4 presents major findings, incidents and trends regarding malware.  Chapter 5 describes major findings, incidents and trends regarding cryptojacking.  Chapter 6 highlights major findings, incidents and trends regarding e-mail related threats.  Chapter 7 discusses major findings, incidents and trends regarding threats to data.  Chapter 8 presents major findings, incidents and trends regarding threats against availability and integrity.  Chapter 9 underlines the importance of hybrid threats and describes major findings, incidents and trends regarding  disinformation and misinformation.  Chapter 10 focuses on major findings, incidents and trends regarding non-malicious threats.  Annex A presents the techniques commonly used for each threat, based on the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.  Annex B includes notable incidents per threat, as observed during the reporting period.  11 CIA - Words of Estimative Probability https://www.cia.gov/static/0aae8f84700a256abf63f7aad73b0a7d/Words-of-Estimative-Probability.pdf  12 MITRE ATT&CK® , https://attack.mitre.org/  13 https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise /  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  https://www.cia.gov/static/0aae8f84700a256abf63f7aad73b0a7d/Words-of-Estimative-Probability.pdf https://attack.mitre.org/ https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  15  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  16  2. THREAT ACTOR TRENDS  Cyber threat actors are an integral component of the threat landscape. They are entities aiming to carry out a  malicious act by taking advantage of existing vulnerabilities, with the intent to do harm to their victims. Understanding  how threat actors think and act, what their motivations and goals are, is an important step towards a stronger cyber  incident response. Monitoring the latest developments with respect to the tactics and techniques used by threat actors  to achieve their objectives, along with staying up-to-date with the long-term trends in motivations and targets, is crucial  for an efficient defence in today’s cybersecurity ecosystem.  Moreover, understanding the trends related to threat actors, their motivations and their targets assist greatly in  planning cybersecurity defences and mitigation strategies. It is an integral part of the overall threat assessment since  it allows security controls to be prioritised and a dedicated strategy based on potential impact and the likelihood that  threats will materialise to be devised. Having no understanding of threat actors and the way they operate creates a  significant knowledge gap in cybersecurity, because one ends up looking and analysing threats without considering  the motivations and goals behind those threats.  In this section, we explore the trends related to threat actors. This assessment does not provide an exhaustive list of  all trends during the reporting period, but rather a high-level view of major trends observed at a strategic level. We  focus on the threat actors’ motives, capabilities and targeting, and their evolution is assessed.  For the purposes of the ETL 2021, the following four categories of cybersecurity threat actors are considered:   State-sponsored actors   Cybercrime actors   Hacker-for-hire actors   Hacktivists  The list of potential threat actors is evidently large and encompasses other categories such as insider actors, etc. The  focus on the particular four categories above does not imply that other categories of threat actors are deemed of  lesser significance. The reasoning behind the focus on the four selected threat actor categories is based on their  relative prominence during the ETL 2021 reporting period.  2.1 STATE-SPONSORED ACTORS  COVID-19 drove cyber espionage tasking. During the reporting period, we observed state-backed groups  conducting cyber espionage operations related to COVID-19 as well as using COVID-19 related lures for social  engineering. Regarding COVID-19 related cyber-espionage, threat actors have been tasked to pursue information  related to recovery and vaccine development efforts15. According to publicly available reports, state-sponsored threat  actors have been observed to be likely seeking data related to infection rates, country-level responses, and  treatments.15,16,17,18,19 Moreover, the collection of scientific information related to the COVID-19 vaccine was a high-  priority requirement and thus the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and medical research sectors have been heavily  targeted.15,17,21  15 FireEye / Mandiant - M-Trends 2021 https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021  16 NCSC-UK - Advisory: APT29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine- development  17 CrowdStrike - 2021 Global Threat Report - https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2021GTR.pdf  18 El Pais - Chinese hackers accused of stealing information from Spanish centers working on COVID-19 vaccine -  https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-COVID-19- vaccine.html  19 US Department of Justice - Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign  Targeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research -  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese- hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion  https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2021GTR.pdf https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-COVID-19-vaccine.html https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-09-18/chinese-hackers-accused-of-stealing-information-from-spanish-centers-working-on-COVID-19-vaccine.html https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  17  Our assessment is that the targeting of the these sectors by state-sponsored actors will certainly continue as long as  the pandemic lasts. In addition, we believe that the targeting of contact tracing systems as well as other COVID-19  related applications deployed by governments whose data can be valuable for intelligence gathering and spear  phishing campaigns is likely.  Finally, threat actors that have been ascribed as acting in the interests of nation states  exploited the concern and confusion related to COVID-19 with spear-phishing lures.17,20,21 In our opinion, cyber  espionage groups will almost certainly continue to conduct (spear-) phishing attacks using COVID-19 themes.22  Highly sophisticated and impactful supply chain compromises. While supply chain compromises by state-backed  threat actors are not new, during the reporting period, this type of attack reached new levels of sophistication and  impact.23,24 One of the major campaigns that took place during the reporting period is the SolarWinds supply chain  compromise.23,25,26,27,28,29,30 The SolarWinds supply chain compromise is a prominent example of how great an impact  a supply chain attack can have. The state-backed group behind this supply chain attack meticulously planned the  attack making almost no operational security mistakes.17 Moreover, the threat actor showed exceptional knowledge of  cloud environments,17 something that highlights the threats and current gaps in our knowledge of cloud  environments.31,32 The threat actor had well-defined and long-term espionage objectives judging from the careful  selection of the targets and subsequent post-compromise activity compared to the circa 18.000 organisations that  have been affected.  Based on ENISA’s analysis,23 on at least 17 occasions between 2020 and 2021, investigations confirm that supply  chain attacks were conducted by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, often state-sponsored, which constitutes  more than 50% of the attributed supply chain attacks during this period. Moreover, software supply chain attacks are  the most frequent type of supply chain attacks while the software services sector is the most targeted. From an  attacker's perspective, the characteristics of the targeted software are usually the following:33 i) cross-network  communication capability, ii) has root/admin-level privileges, iii) cross-platform/cross-operating system, iv) often  whitelisted, and v) acts as a centralised management platform.  Historically, the majority of supply chain attacks resulted, or had the potential to result, in remote code execution.34  According to publicly available reports, various state actors have conducted software supply chain attacks. The most  likely distribution vector of the supply chain attacks conducted by state-backed threat actors is via the hijacking of the  software update process (others include the undermining of software certificates, open-source compromise, and  mobile app store attacks).34 This distribution vector is very sophisticated and is indicative of the complexity and the  careful planning and execution that is needed for such operations (e.g. see SolarWinds campaign timeline35).  Summing up, the diversified and complex world of supply chains offers a wealth of targets for state-backed threat  actors. Moreover, the move to teleworking, exacerbated by COVID-19, led organisations to maintain or even increase  the third-party suppliers they depend on for their operational needs. In our assessment, state-backed threat actors will  certainly continue conducting supply chain attacks (especially targeting software, cloud, and managed service  20 Kaspersky - APT annual review: What the world’s threat actors got up to in 2020 https://securelist.com/apt-annual-review-what-the-worlds-threat- actors-got-up-to-in-2020/99574/  21 Accenture - 2020 Cyber Threatscape Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf  22 Kaspersky - Advanced Threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/apt-predictions-for-2021/99387/  23 ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, July 2021. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  24 Kaspersky - APT  Trends Report Q1 2021 - https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967/  25 Microsoft - Addressing cybersecurity risk in industrial IoT and OT -  https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/10/21/addressing-cybersecurity- risk-in-industrial-iot-and-ot/  26 FireEye - Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor -  https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html  27 Microsoft - Microsoft Internal Solorigate Investigation Update - https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation- update/  28 CrowdStrike - SUNSPOT: An Implant in the Build Process - https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/  29 SolarWinds - SolarWinds Security Advisory - https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory  30 European Commission - Answer given by Mr. Hahn on behalf of the European Commission - https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9- 2021-001112-ASW_EN.pdf  31 Atlantic Council - Broken Trust: Lessons from Sunburst - https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BROKEN-TRUST.pdf  32 CERT-EU - Threat Landscape Report (Volume 1) - https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU- Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf  33 Obscurity Labs – Software supply chain targeting – Who will the APTs target next?

As we have observed in the  past, there have been cases where state-sponsored adversaries have engaged in cybercrime operations.37,38  Moreover, during the reporting period, we identified cases indicating this is an increasing trend among various threat  groups that are linked to nation states:   We observed for the first time that the Lazarus group conducted targeted ransomware intrusions for  financial gain.39 The likely motive behind these activities is monetary gain.   The US Department of Justice has issued indictments against individuals linked with the threat group  APT41/WICKED PANDA for conducting cybercrime operations targeting the video game sector whilst also  conducting cyber espionage operations.40,41 The APT41’s cybercrime operations have been conducted for  personal financial gain, e.g. obtain or generate video game currency via hacking to then sell it for profit.   The PIONEER KITTEN threat group has been identified with advertising and selling corporate network  access on an underground forum.42 This activity has been likely conducted for personal gain.   Various threat groups (Labyrinth Chollima, Stardust Chollima, Velvet Chollima43) have been observed to  deploy malicious cryptocurrency applications, targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing cryptocurrency  wallet credentials, and other currency generation operations. The likely motive behind these activities is  monetary gain.   A member of the Sandworm threat group has been identified conducting spear-phishing campaigns against  real estate companies, auto dealers, and cryptocurrency exchanges for personal gain44 .   According to the US Department of Justice, several Iran-based threat actors conducted both espionage and  criminal operations45. Regarding the actors’ money-making activities for personal gain (likely as a secondary  income), they used the victims’ stolen information to steal financial information and they attempted to extort  the victims after stealing sensitive information from them.   Cybercriminals allegedly acting on behalf of nation states have reportedly conducted cyber operations  (ransomware attacks, cyber-enabled extortion, cryptojacking, and rank theft) for their personal gain46.  It is our assessment that state-backed actors will certainly continue conducting revenue generating cyber intrusions (in  pursuit of strategic objectives or for personal gain) with varying levels of national responsibility47 and thus further blur  the lines between cyberespionage and cybercrime operations. As states leverage cybercrime groups to conduct cyber  operations, we expect this trend to increase and these state-affiliated groups to engage in money-making intrusions  for themselves.  Governmental organisations step up their game. During the reporting period, we observed increased efforts from  governments to disrupt, “name and shame”, and take legal action against state-sponsored threat actors.

Finally, we observed the FBI obtaining court approval to remove web shells from Internet-connected and  compromised Microsoft Exchange servers in the US.57  The goal of the activities described above is to disrupt the operations of adversaries, enable network defenders to  detect and respond to malicious activities, act as a means of signalling to adversaries (potentially deterring them or  influencing their behaviour), and establish a level of cyber norms in cyberspace.58 We assess that it is likely that more  countries will start using indictments, public disclosures and attribution statements as part of their cyber strategy.59 On  the flip side, it is still not yet clear how these activities will deter highly sophisticated and determined state-backed  threat actors in the long term. The hacking of the e-mail accounts of the most prominent federal prosecutors in the US  Department of Justice during the SolarWinds campaign suggests, though, that indictments against foreign cyber  operators can have a deterrent effect60.  Hindering defenders’ efforts. During the past few years, we have observed threat actors monitoring threat  intelligence reporting and attribution disclosures and responses from an operational and strategic perspective. Over  the years, one can claim that state-backed threat actors have been learning from their past mistakes and they have  been improving their operational security and leaving no high fidelity indicators during their intrusions61.  48 FireEye -

Moreover, the  leveraging of cybercriminal contract hackers by states (for deniability) as well as the wide use of common tools and  techniques by cybercrime and state-backed actors undermine credible attribution.67  Finally, the use of false flags can be regarded as an established method related to state-backed threat actors.68  During the reporting period, we observed the cases of MontysThree69 and DeathStalker70 threat actors that utilised  false flags.  In our assessment state-backed groups will certainly be leveraging offensive security tools, living-off-the-land  techniques, published PoCs, false flags, criminal contract hackers, crimeware-as-a-service, and will also be exhibiting  high levels of operational security to conduct cyber operations. All these will further complicate the detection,  response, and especially the defenders’ attribution efforts.71  Increased targeting of ICS networks. Historically, organisations have had less visibility in their ICS networks as  compared to their IT networks. Moreover, digital transformation initiatives, the rise of Industrial IoT,72  the cloud  connectivity of ICS devices, as well as the remote access services for ICS networks provide opportunities for the  threat actors73 (For example, the abuse of valid accounts was the No1 technique used by threat groups targeting ICS  networks74).  During the last 5-10 years, adversaries have increasingly invested resources to target ICS networks. According to  publicly available reports, the number of threat groups targeting ICS networks is growing at a rate three times faster  than they are going dormant74 and, during the reporting period, at least four new groups were discovered: STIBNITE,  TALONITE, KAMACITE, and VANADINITE.75 The objectives of these groups vary from information collection and  long-term persistence to disruption of ICS operations and potential physical destruction.  In our assessment the interest in targeting ICS networks will certainly grow in the near future. While we previously  discussed the opportunities for ICS targeting, the drivers for such operations include the desire for technological  independence, geopolitics (e.g. conflicts, long-term persistence, cyber warfare), as well as testing the capabilities of  threat actors and preparing for future attacks (some threat actors are still learning about ICS domain, experimenting  and developing ICS-targeting capabilities).  62 Intezer – Offensive Security Tools (OST) Map - https://www.intezer.com/ost-map/  63 Accenture - Threats Unmasked 2021 Cyber Threat Intelligence Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-158/Accenture-2021-Cyber- Threat-Intelligence-Report.pdf  Proofpoint -  Cobalt Strike: Favorite Tool from APT to Crimeware - https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/cobalt-strike-favorite-tool-apt- crimeware  64 ZDNet - Cobalt Strike and Metasploit accounted for a quarter of all malware C&C servers in 2020  - https://www.zdnet.com/article/cobalt-strike-and- metasploit-accounted-for-a-quarter-of-all-malware-c-c-servers-in-2020/  65 Symantec/Broadcom - Living off the Land: Attackers Leverage Legitimate Tools for Malicious Ends - https://symantec-enterprise- blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/living-land-legitimate-tools-malicious  66 Accenture - 2020 Cyber Threatscape Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf  67 White House - The United States, Joined by Allies and Partners, Attributes Malicious Cyber Activity and Irresponsible State Behavior to the People’s  Republic of China - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners- attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/  68 VirusBulletin - Wave your false flags!

It is common  knowledge, nowadays, that cyber operations are conducted by most states all over the world to accomplish their  strategic objectives.76 Thus, states are striving to develop, buy or hire cyber offensive capabilities to place themselves  in a favourable position in this cyber arms race. The implementation of such cyber capabilities is important for their  national strategies and their long-term planning. Currently, some of the trends we observe are that a) states with  advanced cyber capabilities are using them to strategically shape global political, military, economic, and ideological  power, b) middle powers are focusing on initiatives related to regulation, cyber norms, and protection of their critical  infrastructure, and c) low-capability cyber powers are enhancing their defensive and offensive postures.77  During the reporting period, we observed that cyber operations were aligned with the strategic objectives of states as  well as with the geopolitical landscape and real-world events. Notably, we observed increased cyber intrusion  activities in regions of trade routes (e.g. between Europe and Asia78), in regions of armed conflict,79,80,81 against  strategic targets such as governmental organisations (e.g. SolarWinds supply chain attack), and cyber operations as  enablers for large-scale espionage, personally identifiable information and the theft of intellectual property (e.g. the  Microsoft Exchange hack82).  State-sponsored groups are increasingly testing and exhibiting their capabilities for disruptive operations. In our  assessment state-backed actors will certainly continue pursuing their strategic objectives via cyber operations for  intelligence gathering for advantages in decision-making, stealing intellectual property, and pre-positioning of military  and critical infrastructure (preparation of the operational environment) for future conflicts.83 It is also our assessment  that state-backed groups will possibly develop (or buy or otherwise procure) and conduct disruptive/destructive  operations masqueraded as ransomware to weaken, demoralise and discredit adversarial governments.84 Finally,  local conflicts will likely include cyber operations paired with drone attacks and media-driven misinformation in order to  amplify impact.85  Information operations as a tool to pursue states’ strategic goals. Information operations dominated the news  headlines during the 2016 US elections. Currently, several states are leveraging information operations as a tool for  hybrid conflicts exploiting societal divisions, undermining trust, and polarising societies over issues that are sensitive  and important in certain countries.96  During the last few years, we observed an evolution in how threat actors are conducting information operations. First,  we observed threat actors conducting more targeted information operations as compared to the “noisy” ones in the  pas.t95 Moreover, currently there are commercial actors that sell Information-Operations-as-a-Service, providing  plausible deniability for their sponsors.86 Threat actors have also adapted their TTPs and exhibit better operational  security as well as platform diversification to survive takedowns87.  76 Ben Buchanan - The Hacker and the State: Cyber-Attacks and the New Normal of Geopolitics - https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-State-Attacks- Normal-Geopolitics/dp/0674987551  77 Control Risks - Geopolitics and cyber in 2021 - https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021  78 Kaspersky - Advanced Threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/apt-predictions-for-2021/99387/  79 Recorded Future - China-linked Group RedEcho Targets the Indian Power Sector Amid Heightened Border Tensions -  https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/  80 Cisco Talos - PoetRAT: Malware targeting public and private sector in Azerbaijan evolves - https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/poetrat- update.html  BBC - Nagorno-Karabakh: The Armenian-Azeri 'information wars' - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54614392  Azerbaycan 24 -  Azerbaijani hackers broke into over 90 Armenian websites - https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/azerbaijani-hackers-broke-into-over- 90-armenian-websites-video/  81 National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine - The NCCC at the NSDC of Ukraine warns of a cyberattack on the document management system  of state bodies - https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4823.html  82 NCSC-UK - UK and allies hold Chinese state responsible for pervasive pattern of hacking - https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese- state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking  83 Control Risks - Geopolitics and cyber in 2021 - https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021  84 Accenture - 2020 Cyber Threatscape Report - https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf  85 Kaspersky - ICS threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/  86 ZDNet - Disinformation for hire: PR firms are the new battleground for Facebook - https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are- the-new-battleground-for-facebook/  87 Facebook - The State of Influence Operations 2017-2020 - https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IO-Threat-Report-May-20-2021.pdf  https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-State-Attacks-Normal-Geopolitics/dp/0674987551 https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-State-Attacks-Normal-Geopolitics/dp/0674987551 https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021 https://securelist.com/apt-predictions-for-2021/99387/ https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/ https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/poetrat-update.html https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/poetrat-update.html https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54614392 https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/azerbaijani-hackers-broke-into-over-90-armenian-websites-video/ https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/azerbaijani-hackers-broke-into-over-90-armenian-websites-video/ https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4823.html https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/geopolitics-and-cyber-in-2021 https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-136/Accenture-2020-Cyber-Threatscape-Full-Report.pdf https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are-the-new-battleground-for-facebook/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are-the-new-battleground-for-facebook/ https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IO-Threat-Report-May-20-2021.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  22  During the reporting period, major topics of information operations included election interference and COVID-19.  During the 2020 US elections88 and the 2021 pre-election period in Germany,89 there were reported cases of  information operations as preparatory work for such operations. According to publicly available reports, intelligence  services have been conducting information operations related to COVID-19 issues.90 The EUvsDisinfo is a European  task force that tracks disinformation threats and has 922 COVID-19 disinformation narratives in its database (as of  31st July 2021).91 These narratives vary from promoting conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19, through  vaccine rollout and disinformation about vaccination strategies, the handling of public health measures, undermining  public trust in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and to fuelling anti-vaccination movements in the EU.92  Our assessment is that threat actors will very likely continue pursuing their strategic objectives by conducting cyber-  enabled information operations for the next decade focusing on important geopolitical issues like elections, public  health, humanitarian crises, human rights, and security.93 Also, in our opinion, threat actors will very likely continue  leveraging the latest technology (e.g. Artificial Intelligence, deep fakes, voice biometrics) to impersonate individuals as  part of their information operations.94 Finally, in our view, it is possible that there will be increased leveraging of  Information-Operations-as-a-Service together with increased competition of these disinformation networks.94  Hack-and-leak operations are an established tactic. Hack-and-leak operations include activities where a threat  actor has unlawfully accessed information via a cyberattack and then leaks this information. This information is usually  leaked in a specific context  ̶  sometimes the information is manipulated  ̶  and at a time that serves the threat actor’s  objectives to achieve the desired effect and influence public debate.95 Targets for these operations can be  businesses, politicians, as well as governmental organisations, and they are information operations impacting the  confidentiality and integrity of the information leaked.96  Hack-and-leak operations are not a new tactic but they gained traction after the hack-and-leak operations during the  2016 US elections. For these operations, their impact, perpetrators (mostly using fake identities), and targets are hard  to predict. However, if the stolen information is not sold on underground forums (showing a financial motivation by the  threat actor) but rather shared with the public, one can assess that these operations likely have a political  motivation.97 Threat actors conducting hack-and-leak operations usually fall within the category of state actors,  hacktivists, or front entities acting on behalf of nation-backed groups such as hacktivists. The latter is also a trend that  has been identified in recent years as state-backed groups are increasingly using hacktivists as cover under which to  conduct their operations; they even co-ordinate with hacktivists so that these operations look like the work of genuine  hacktivists97, 98, 99.  88 The New York Times - Iran and Russia Seek to Influence Election in Final Days, US Officials Warn -  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/iran-russia-election-interference.html  CISA - Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Identified Obtaining Voter Registration Data - https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a  89 Cyberscoop - Hackers target German lawmakers in an election year - https://www.cyberscoop.com/bundestag-germany-hackers-ghostwriter/  Der Taggesspiegel - Angriffswellen russischer Hacker auf Abgeordnete - https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/gefahr-fuer-die-bundestagswahl- angriffswellen-russischer-hacker-auf-abgeordnete/27418978.html  90 APNews - US officials: Russia behind spread of virus disinformation - https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-health-moscow-ap-fact- check-3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1  EU Disinfo Lab - How two information portals hide their ties to the Russian news agency InfoRos - https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/how-two- information-portals-hide-their-ties-to-the-russian-news-agency-inforos/  91 EUvsDisinfo – Disinfo Database (COVID-19 related narratives) - https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation- cases/?disinfo_keywords%5B%5D=106935&disinfo_keywords%5B%5D=88558&date=&per_page=  92 EUvsDisinfo - EEAS SPECIAL REPORT UPDATE: SHORT ASSESSMENT OF NARRATIVES AND DISINFORMATION AROUND THE COVID-19  PANDEMIC (UPDATE DECEMBER 2020 - APRIL 2021) -  https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eeas-special-report-update-short-assessment-of-narratives-and- disinformation-around-the-COVID-19-pandemic-update-december-2020-april-2021/?highlight=COVID  EUvsDisinfo - EEAS SPECIAL REPORT UPDATE: SHORT ASSESSMENT OF NARRATIVES AND DISINFORMATION AROUND THE COVID-19  PANDEMIC (UPDATE MAY - NOVEMBER) - https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eeas-special-report-update-short-assessment-of-narratives-and-disinformation- around-the-COVID-19-pandemic-update-may-november/?highlight=COVID  EUvsDisinfo - WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020?

The stolen information  was made public through the Internet and was picked up by the media.100,101 Based on the EMA’s investigation, not all  the leaked documents were in their original form and this data manipulation could spread doubt about admission  procedures and the safety of COVD-19 vaccines. Another interesting case was the operation conducted by the  Ghostwriter threat group that targeted members of the German Parliament and Polish government officials (among  others).102,103,104,105 According to publicly available reports, documents from the personal e-mail accounts of  government officials were leaked on Telegram103 while the operation against German MPs was likely to be  preparatory work for a future hack-and-leak information (especially taking into account that 2021 is an election year in  Germany).106107  In our assessment hack-and-leak operations by state-backed and state-affiliated groups will very likely continue in the  near future, as these operations require low to medium resource investment by the threat actors compared to their  potential impact. Moreover, we expect these operations to intensify during periods of high interest (e.g. pre-election  periods) and exploit political divisions or instability. Moreover, our assessment is that threat actors will likely conduct  these operations through a series of releases so that they can sustain news media attention.108 The latter highlights  the importance of the target’s response towards the leak operation in order to direct the media narrative more to the  hack element rather than the leak element of the adversary’s operation.  2.2 CYBERCRIMINALS  COVID-19 created opportunities for cybercriminals. Social engineering remains the most prevalent attack  technique.109 The effectiveness of a phishing campaign depends on whether it taps into strong emotions that drive  action from the recipient’s side.110 During the pandemic, cybercriminals have been exploiting people’s interest,  concern, curiosity, and fear by using phishing lures related to COVID-19 for financial gain.111 The COVID-19 lure  themes matched the different stages of the pandemic.112 The major ones used by the cybercriminals have reportedly  been the following:112,113   Exploitation of individuals looking for details on disease tracking, testing, and treatment;   Impersonation of medical bodies, including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and US Centre for  Disease Control and Prevention;   Financial assistance and government stimulus packages;   Tailored attacks against employees working from home;   Scams offering personal protective equipment;   Passing mention of COVID-19 with previously used phishing lure content (e.g. deliveries, invoices, and  purchase orders);   Vaccination-related lures;   Phishing lures related to new variants of COVID-19.  100 European Medicines Agency -

Finally, in our  opinion the targeting of COVID-19 related applications deployed by governments, whose data can be valuable and be  made available for sale in underground markets and phishing campaigns, is likely.120  The exploitation of Work-From-Home technologies. During the pandemic, organisations were forced to change  their strategies and quickly adopt technologies that would support the new reality of remote working. This allowed  cybercrime adversaries to take advantage of the rapid deployment of these teleworking technologies and exploit them  for initial access. Technologies that have been heavily targeted by cybercrime actors are network appliances121 and  remote access services (especially Virtual Private Network122, Citrix123124 and RDP services125). The exploitation of  such technologies involved old, unpatched and newly discovered vulnerabilities as well as initial access via  compromised credentials.126  In our view cybercrime threat actors will certainly continue targeting technologies that support teleworking and  specifically VPN and remote access services. The organisation will be relying on these services as long as the  pandemic lasts and their successful compromise by the adversaries gives the latter the opportunity of remote access  to their victims without even deploying any malware.127 Another interesting point is that the potential return to the  office may leave these teleworking services orphaned and this will provide additional opportunities for adversaries.124  All these highlight the importance of fundamentals such as patch and vulnerability management as well as the  security hardening of these systems and applications.  114 Accenture -

During the reporting period, the frequency and  the complexity of ransomware attacks increased124 (by more than 150% in 2020128) and became one of the greatest  threats that organisations face today regardless of the sector to which they belong. We are observing the golden era  of ransomware  ̶  it has become a national security priority129 ̶  and some argue that it has not yet reached the peak of  its impact.130 Ransomware attacks are such a big issue that the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) issued an  advisory to instruct organisations about the risks of potential sanctions for facilitating ransomware payments.131  It has been observed that cybercriminals are less likely to target payment-related data (e.g. credit cards) and more  likely to target any data that will have an impact on the victims' operations.132 The successful business model of  human-operated ransomware (aka Big Game Hunting) has been increasingly attracting cyber-criminal threat actors  and it is also having an impact on their targeting.133 An indicative example is the FIN11 threat group whose observed  target has changed due to the likely shift of its operations from point-of-sale (POS) campaigns to targeted  ransomware.134  Moreover, the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model is blooming.135 During 2020, two-thirds of  ransomware campaigns were attributed to operators using RaaS.136 This trend sets a relatively low barrier for  conducting this type of cybercrime and allows inexperienced cybercriminals to conduct ransomware attacks.137  Taking into account the increasing number of publicly reported ransom payments, the success of the RaaS business  model, and the active recruitment of new members for the ransomware groups on Dark Web forums.138 139 Our  assessment is that more cybercriminals will very likely be attracted to shifting their targeting to focus on targeted  ransomware operations and replicate these successes.140  Multiple extortion methods. During the reporting period, the tactics that ransomware groups use to put pressure on  their victims and force them to pay the ransom have evolved. In late 2019, the Maze group demonstrated double  extortion tactics141: a) the systems and data of an organisation are encrypted and a ransom is requested, and b) the  organisation’s sensitive data are exfiltrated and Maze operators threaten to publish the exfiltrated data on “public  shaming websites” as extra leverage to demand further ransom payments.  During the reporting period, we have observed further evolutions in the tactics used by ransomware groups:134 142   Monetisation of the stolen information through data auctions in the dark web;143   Media amplification of their victim’s compromise by contacting journalists;144   Cold calling victims if they begin the ransomware recovery process without paying the ransom;145  128 Group-IB - Group-IB: ransomware empire prospers in pandemic-hit world.

Our assessment  is that the extortion methods of cybercriminals will certainly evolve further so they keep succeeding in getting higher  ransom payments from their victims.  Increasing collaboration and professionalisation. During the reporting period, we observed cybercrime groups that  have developed specialised cybercrime services, and cybercriminals that have built relationships within the ecosystem  as well as affiliate models.  The cybercrime ecosystem has a global presence. In this ecosystem, we observed different actors providing and  specialising in different services. This “Cybercrime-as-a-Service” trend lowers the barriers for threat actors that want  to conduct cybercrimes while it enhances the reach of cyberattacks. The different types of services offered in the  cybercrime ecosystem include:152   Main types of services: access brokers, phishing kits, credit/debit card testing services, malware packing  services, web inject kits, hardware for sale, ransomware, loaders, (bulletproof) hosting and infrastructure,  DDoS attack tools, anonymity and encryption, crime-as-a-service, counter antivirus service/checkers,  recruiting for criminal groups;   Distribution services: social network and instant messaging spam, exploit kit development, spam e-mail  distribution, purchasing traffic and/or traffic distribution systems (TDS);   Monetisation services: money mule and cashing services, reshipping fraud networks, dump shops,  collection and sale of payment card information, money laundering, ransom payments and extortion, wire  fraud cryptocurrency services.  Many of the cybercrime groups in this ecosystem provide services that support targeted ransomware operations, but  access brokers play an increasingly critical role.153 We have observed cybercriminal groups that had historically been  operating banking trojans (e.g. Trickbot,154 Qakbot155) capitalise on their access to compromised organisations by  selling it (mostly to ransomware groups and operators). According to publicly available reports, there are at least 10  threat actors that act as access facilitators (or are ransomware affiliates) and sell their access to multiple ransomware  operators156. While there is not a 1:1 relationship between these access-enabling malwares and ransomware  attacks156 there was a unique relationship between Emotet (malware distribution), Ryuk (ransomware), and Trickbot  146 Bleeping Computer - Ransomware gang plans to call victim's business partners about attacks -  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victims-business-partners-about-attacks/  147 Threat Post - Ransomware’s New Swindle: Triple Extortion - https://threatpost.com/ransomwares-swindle-triple-extortion/166149/  148 Bleeping Computer - Ransomware gang urges victims’ customers to demand a ransom payment -  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-urges-victims-customers-to-demand-a-ransom-payment/  149 FireEye / Mandiant - M-Trends 2021 https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021  150 Motherboard - Ransomware Gang Turns to Revenge Porn - https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzby/ransomware-gang-revenge-porn-leaks-nude- images  151 Flashpoint - Facing Five Types of Ransomware and Cyber Extortion - https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/facing-five-types-of-ransomware-and- cyber-extortion/  152 Europol - IOCTA 2020 - https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf  153 Digital Shadows - The Rise Of Initial Access Brokers - https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rise-of-initial-access-brokers/  154 CISA – TrickBot Malware - https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a  155 AT&T – The risk of QakBot - https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/the-rise-of-qakbot  156 Proofpoint - The First Step: Initial Access Leads to Ransomware - https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads- ransomware  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victims-business-partners-about-attacks/ https://threatpost.com/ransomwares-swindle-triple-extortion/166149/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-urges-victims-customers-to-demand-a-ransom-payment/ https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021 https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzby/ransomware-gang-revenge-porn-leaks-nude-images https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzby/ransomware-gang-revenge-porn-leaks-nude-images https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/facing-five-types-of-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion/ https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/facing-five-types-of-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion/ https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/rise-of-initial-access-brokers/ https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/the-rise-of-qakbot https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  27  (backdoor) that suggests that the groups behind these different approaches to attack are either part of a larger  criminal organisation or they increasingly collaborate and depend on each other157.  We have also observed cybercrime groups that have developed affiliate programs where they exclusively sell the  malware to the affiliates and share the money paid.158 Finally, we have observed ransomware groups creating cartels  to enhance collaboration, share tactics and help each other publish their victims’ data on their “public shaming  sites”.159  Our assessment is that botnet operators will very likely capitalise on their infections by selling access to other  cybercriminals.160 It is also our opinion that access brokers and the threat actors behind them will very likely increase  in sophistication and demand, while some of them are likely to abandon cybercrime forums and use private channels.  Finally, state-backed threat actors will likely be buying initial access to organisations of interest from access  brokers161.  Managed service providers as high-value targets for cybercriminals. Nowadays, we observe that organisations  are increasingly outsourcing their IT infrastructure management and are depending on other companies for various  digital services. Managed service providers are high-value targets for cybercriminals since their compromise enables  them to target their clients as well.  The compromise of a service provider introduces the following potential risks for its clients;162   Confidentiality risks related to the clients’ data as they can be exfiltrated and stolen;   Availability risks related to the continuity of the service provider’s business, with a subsequent impact on its  clients;   Risks related to the potential propagation of an infection from the service provider to its clients;   Risks related to the misuse of clients’ service accounts for further malicious activities.  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape on Supply Chain10, attacks against managed service providers are  increasing but it is still unclear whether the scope of the attackers was also to target their clients in all cases. Within  the reporting period, some of the most prominent cybercriminal activities against service providers include the cases  of Blackbaud,163 SendGrid,164 AG165 and Kaseya.166  The cyberattack against Kaseya by the REvil ransomware group was one of the major cyberattacks observed during  the reporting period.167 Kaseya is a vendor that provides Kaseya VSA software that is widely used by Managed  Service Providers to manage IT infrastructure. The impact of this supply chain attack was huge;168 50 Managed  Service Providers (MSPs) had been using Kaseya’s VSA software which was compromised while 800-1500  businesses that were managed by the compromised MSPs were infected with the ransomware. Moreover, about one  157 https://intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot  158 Group-IB - Group-IB: ransomware empire prospers in pandemic-hit world.

It is interesting to note that the threat group demanded ransom payments only from the end  businesses that were impacted and not from the compromised MSPs. While MSPs have been (indirectly) targeted by  supply chain attacks, the fact that they could deploy software (ransomware in this case) to their clients (this is part of  the daily tasks of IT infrastructure management) amplified the effect of this attack.  Our assessment is that cybercriminal actors will certainly continue targeting (directly or indirectly via their suppliers)  managed service providers as a way to target the clients of MSPs, especially with respect to ransomware attacks.170  Cybercriminals transitioning to the cloud. The pandemic fastened the adoption of cloud infrastructure and services  by organisations globally and the “moving to the cloud” trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  However, apart from the apparent benefits of migrating to the cloud, there are also associated risks for  organisations.171 The rapid deployment of cloud infrastructure and services due to the urgent needs of the teleworking  workforce during the pandemic as well as the gap in cloud-specific expertise172 resulted in poorly secured and  managed cloud deployments that provide opportunities for cybercriminals. According to publicly available reports,  misconfigured cloud deployments were a leading cause of breaches173 while external cloud systems were more  common than on-premises assets in data breaches.174  Cybercriminals (as well as state-back actors) have already identified these opportunities and developed capabilities to  breach cloud infrastructure and services. During the reporting period, we observed cybercriminals enumerating cloud  environments,175 deploying the first cryptomining worm to steal AWS credentials,176 cryptomining on Linux servers in  the cloud,177 and targeting Docker and Kubernetes environments.178,179  Moreover, there is an increasing trend of  cloud providers being compromised by ransomware groups such as BlackBaud,180 Swiss Cloud,181 Equinix,182 and  Cloudstar.183. Finally, credential-based attacks against cloud services that are poorly secured or have not enabled  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) proliferate.184  Our assessment is that attacks against cloud environments will almost certainly continue and will likely have a greater  impact as more organisations adopt and implement Cloud-First strategies. Cloud downtimes will likely cause enough  pressure (due to SLAs as well as a lack of tested recovery processes and cloud expertise) to coerce companies into  paying ransoms in cases where they have been victims of ransomware attacks (even if they have backups in some  cases)185.  169 Lawfare Blog - The Kaseya Ransomware Attack Is a Really Big Deal - https://www.lawfareblog.com/kaseya-ransomware-attack-really-big-dea l  170 Canadian Center of Cybersecurity – National Cyberthreat Assessment - https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/national-cyber-threat-assessment-2020  171 CERT-EU - Threat Landscape Report (Volume 1) - https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU- Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf  ZeroFOX -  The Future of Digital Threats: 2020 Insights, 2021 Predictions - https://www.zerofox.com/blog/cyber-threat-trends-report/  172 CloudHealth - The Cloud Management Skills Gap Is Real.

During the reporting period, we  observed increased targeting of critical infrastructure by cybercrime actors. Major critical infrastructure sectors being  impacted are the healthcare, transportation, and energy sectors.  Ransomware attacks have disrupted the operations of public health agencies, hospitals, and emergency services.186  Threat actors have been specifically targeting the healthcare and public health sector despite the promises of some  ransomware gangs to stop doing so during the pandemic.187 They grasped this opportunity during the pandemic since  this sector became extremely significant and highly susceptible.188 Ryuk is a ransomware gang that heavily targeted  the healthcare sector in the USA186 despite the attempts cybersecurity vendors to take them down.189  According to publicly available reports, the transportation industry has faced cybercrime threats related to initial  access offerings, gift card fraud, and ransomware.190 All four major shipping companies have fallen victim to  ransomware attacks during recent years191 while the trucking sector has experienced high-profile ransomware  attacks.192 Because the Courier, Express, and Parcel (CEP) business is blooming it could be regarded as critical  infrastructure during the pandemic. Thus it attracted the attention of cybercriminals who targeted the CEP sector.193  Finally, despite limited flights and air traffic during the pandemic, the aviation industry faced disproportional numbers  of cyberattacks.194  The ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline (a US fuel company) by the Darkside ransomware group had a high  impact as a perceived gas shortage led to stockpiling and panic (although the IT network was impacted, operators  stopped ICS operations for protection).195 Colonial Pipeline’s ransomware attack196 also drove policy initiatives within  the US with Joe Biden signing an Executive Order to strengthen cybersecurity197 and restarting the discussion on the  responsibility of states for cybercrime attacks.198 199 Regarding the targeting of ICS networks, there has been an  increase in public and non-public ransomware events affecting ICS environments.200 Ransomware families like  EKANS,201 Megacortex202 and Clop203 have already developed ICS-aware functionality to stop industrial processes.  It is our opinion that, as our society becomes increasingly dependent on technology and Internet connectivity,  cybercrime attacks against critical infrastructure are very likely to become more disruptive. It is also likely that  186 CISA - Ransomware Activity Targeting the Healthcare and Public Health Sector - https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a  Wired - The untold story of a cyberattack, a hospital, and a dying woman - https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ransomware-hospital-death-germany  HHS - Ransomware Trends 2021 - https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ransomware-trends-2021.pdf  BBC - Cyber-attack on Irish health service 'catastrophic' - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977  187 Bleeping Computer - Ransomware Gangs to Stop Attacking Health Orgs During Pandemic -  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-to-stop-attacking-health-orgs-during-pandemic/  188 CTI League – Darknet Report 2021 - https://cti-league.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CTI-League-Darknet-Report-2021.pdf  189 Microsoft - New action to combat ransomware ahead of US elections - https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/12/trickbot-ransomware- cyberthreat-us-elections/  190 Intel471 - How cybercriminals create turbulence for the transportation industry - https://intel471.com/blog/how-cybercriminals-create-turbulence-for- the-transportation-industry  191 ZDNet - All four of the world's largest shipping companies have now been hit by cyber-attacks - https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-four-of-the-worlds- largest-shipping-companies-have-now-been-hit-by-cyber-attacks/  192 Freight Waves - 5 defining cyberattacks on trucking and logistics in 2020 - https://www.freightwaves.com/news/5-defining-cyberattacks-on-trucking- and-logistics-in-2020  193 SRM - The Courier, Express and Parcel industry is booming.

During the reporting period, we  observed a general trend that applies to many of actors, predominantly to the cybercriminals given the financial  implications. The dark web has become even more connected with the threat actors during the reporting period. In  previous years we observed the growth of both the flow of cryptocurrencies and the anonymising of networks. These  two key developments helped the dark wed become even more accessible due to the anonymisation it provided.205  Marketplaces have given the ability to threat actors to procure services and capabilities that they lack, and to promptly  gain access to breached data.206 Through the markets and underground forums threat actors that lack certain skills,  for example to develop a custom ransomware, are able to identify RaaS providers and procure the necessary skillset.  The providers offer to the customers various services (trading, payment and recovery). In exchange for these tools  and services the providers receive a small portion of the ransoms207. A recent report also showed the average price  listings of the most common requested services.208 We have also seen cases in which the threat actors launched  recruitment campaigns via the dark wed (Revil). 209  In conclusion, the revenue of dark web markets hit a record during the reporting period at a total of 1.7 billion dollars’  worth in cryptocurrency, even though this was mainly to the growth of Hydra.210 This is a prime indicator that the dark  wed has become an integrated part in the ecosystem of the threat actors.  2.3 HACKER-FOR-HIRE ACTORS  Rise of hacker-for-hire services. This category of threat actors refers to actors within the “Access-as-a-Service”  (AaaS) market that is mostly comprised of firms that offer offensive cyber capabilities. Their clients are usually  governments (but also corporations and individuals) and the service categories they offer are (usually bundled  altogether as a single service):211 Vulnerability Research and Exploitation, Malware Payload Development, Technical  Command and Control, Operational Management, and Training and Support.  The hacker-for-hire companies operate legally in their country of operation and the market as a whole is currently  semi-regulated.211 The clients of these companies pay them mostly to conduct cyber espionage operations, get  access to advanced offensive cyber capabilities and enjoy plausible deniability. These hacker-for-hire threat actors  complicate the threat landscape and introduce the following challenges for defenders:212   Their targeting cannot be predicted as it depends on the tasks their clients order; there is no focus on  specific sectors and thus any sector has the potential to be targeted.   These threat actors act as proxies and it is very difficult for defenders to identify their sponsors as well as  their objectives.  204 Kaspersky - ICS threat predictions for 2021 - https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/  205 Five Key Reasons Dark Web Markets Are Booming - https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/23/five-key-reasons-dark-web- markets-are-booming/?sh=378b3b3a6f6f  206 Stolen data on the dark web is being accessed faster than ever - https://siliconangle.com/2021/10/19/stolen-data-dark-web-accessed-quicker-ever/  207 Cybercrime - A Peek at the Cybercriminal Ecosystem - https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/peek-cybercriminal-ecosystem  208  The cost of hiring a hacker on the dark web: report - https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/hiring-hacker-dark-web-report/  209 REvil Ransomware Gang Offers $1 Million As Part Of Recruitment Drive- https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware- gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=2a40595d7bab  210 Russian dark web marketplace Hydra cryptocurrency transactions reached $1.37bn in 2020- https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-dark-web- marketplace-hydra-cryptocurrency-transactions-reached-1-37bn-in-2020/  211 Atlantic Council - Countering Cyber Proliferation – Zeroing in on Access-as-a-Service - https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Offensive-Cyber-Capabilities-Proliferation-Report-1.pdf  212 PwC - Cyber Threats 2020: A Year in Retrospect - https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf  https://securelist.com/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/99613/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/23/five-key-reasons-dark-web-markets-are-booming/?sh=378b3b3a6f6f https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/04/23/five-key-reasons-dark-web-markets-are-booming/?sh=378b3b3a6f6f https://siliconangle.com/2021/10/19/stolen-data-dark-web-accessed-quicker-ever/ https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/peek-cybercriminal-ecosystem https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/hiring-hacker-dark-web-report/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=2a40595d7bab https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=2a40595d7bab https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-dark-web-marketplace-hydra-cryptocurrency-transactions-reached-1-37bn-in-2020/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-dark-web-marketplace-hydra-cryptocurrency-transactions-reached-1-37bn-in-2020/ https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Offensive-Cyber-Capabilities-Proliferation-Report-1.pdf https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Offensive-Cyber-Capabilities-Proliferation-Report-1.pdf https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  31  During the reporting period, the major hacker-for-hire actor under discussion was the NSO Group and a leak that was  related to the targeting of activists, journalists, and political leaders.213 The impact of this leak is evidenced by several  proposals across the globe on managing such a threat.214 215  We also observed the alleged hacker-for-hire group called DeathStalker that has been targeting organisations within  the Financial and Legal services sectors for corporate espionage.216 While the group’s TTPs are evolving (e.g. use of  false flags217), its operations are representative of the fact that these threat actors can accomplish their goals without  using highly sophisticated tools.218  Some groups have focused on cyber espionage activities in specific regions e.g. Bahamut targeted entities in the  Middle East and South Asia, CostaRico mostly focused on targets in South Asia, etc.212 Thus, we observed some  regional targeting from some hacker-for-hire groups, which is likely due to their country of operations as well as their  client base.  Our assessment is that hacker-for-hire companies will certainly continue targeting any sector based on their sponsors’  requirements. While the operations of hacker-for-hire companies are disclosed from time to time, our  assessment is  that these companies will certainly complicate defenders’ efforts in identifying their original clients.219 Finally, in our  opinion, the hacker-for-hire industry will likely experience increased state control and oversight (and potentially more  attention from cybersecurity companies) due to potential national security risks as well as human rights abuse220 213.  2.4 HACKTIVISTS  Hacktivists’ operations remain low in numbers, sophistication, and impact. After 2016, we observed a falloff in  hacktivism following its peak during the period 2010-2015.221  Nowadays, hacktivists act mostly in small groups of  individuals, protesting against regional events and targeting specific organisations.222 Their targets remain their  traditional ones: financial institutions and governmental agencies. Massive public participation is missing.222 This is  likely due to the prosecution of various hacktivists in recent years which has acted as a deterrent.223  Regarding hacktivists’ capabilities, their tactics remain “old school” 224 mostly focusing on DDoS attacks, defacements,  releasing of sensitive data, and account takeovers.222 During the reporting period, the frequency of hacktivists’  operations was low and did not have the impact they had in the past. This is something that can be attributed to the  limited sophistication of their operations and their limited resources as well as the improved security controls that their  target organisations have developed over the years.  It was expected that there would be a rise in hacktivism during the pandemic as more people were staying at home  and this would increase the potential for participating in online protests (and disruptions).223,224 However, this  213 Amnesty International - Massive data leak reveals Israeli NSO Group's spyware used to target activists, journalists, and political leaders globally -  https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/  Google Sheets - Links to articles about Project Pegasus -  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aWl8aTFTsEc2Q66picrIBiv5aXVyNZlmrrhYv10MLfw/edit#gid=0  214 The Guardian - Israel ‘creating task force’ to manage response to Pegasus project - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/21/israel-creating- task-force-to-manage-response-to-pegasus-project  215 Enough is Enough – Joint statement from representatives TOM MALINOWSKI, KATIE PORTER, JOAQUIN CASTRO AND ANNA G.

During the reporting period, some of the most notable hacktivist activities were:   Verkada hack – A group of hackers gained unauthorised access to 150,000 video archives of security  cameras by taking over accounts. The hackers claimed responsibility for the attack and their motivation was  to highlight the dangers of mass video surveillance as well as the insufficiency of security controls for  securing these video recordings.225 A Swiss hacker, who claimed hacktivism motives, was arrested and  charged for this cyberattack.226   Black Lives Matter – During the summer of 2020, the hacktivist group Anonymous re-emerged during the  protests related to the death of George Floyd227. The group focused on DDoS attacks against the  Minneapolis police department website as well as releasing e-mail addresses and credentials allegedly  taken from police servers (but it is likely their source was old data breaches228).   BlueLeaks hack – BlueLeaks was probably the most prominent hacktivist operation conducted during the  reporting period. This anonymous hacktivist group leaked more than 1 million documents stolen from a  Texas firm called Netsential that provided web-hosting services to several US law enforcement agencies.224  The leaks were distributed via the DDoSecrets229 platform whose Twitter account was later suspended for  policy violations related to the distribution of hacked data.230  Our assessment is that the threat posed by hacktivists will very likely remain low in the near future. Our opinion is  based on the number, sophistication, and impact of the hacktivists’ operations during the reporting period. The focus  of hacktivists’ activity will remain regional although new movements are gaining traction (e.g. environmental and anti-  discrimination) that are likely to develop hacktivism side-tactics and attract wider public participation for online protest  (and disruption). Finally, It is our opinion that state-backed groups will almost certainly continue to leverage hacktivism  as a disguise to achieve their strategic goals.  225 ZDNet - Verkada disables accounts after reports its security cameras were breached - https://www.zdnet.com/article/verkada-disables-accounts- after-reports-its-security-cameras-were-breached/  226 The Verge - ‘Anti-capitalist’ Verkada hacker charged by US government with attacks on dozens of companies -  https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339625/tillie-kottmann-swiss-hacker-verkada-charged-us-government-verkada  227 BBC - George Floyd: Anonymous hackers re-emerge amid US unrest - https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52879000  228 Troy Hunt -  Analysing the (Alleged) Minneapolis Police Department \"Hack\" -  https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police- department-hack/  229 Krebs on Security - ‘BlueLeaks’ Exposes Files from Hundreds of Police Departments - https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files- from-hundreds-of-police-departments/  230 ZDNet - Twitter bans DDoSecrets account over 'BlueLeaks' police data dump - https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-over- blueleaks-police-data-dump/  https://www.zdnet.com/article/verkada-disables-accounts-after-reports-its-security-cameras-were-breached/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/verkada-disables-accounts-after-reports-its-security-cameras-were-breached/ https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339625/tillie-kottmann-swiss-hacker-verkada-charged-us-government-verkada https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police-department-hack/ https://www.troyhunt.com/analysing-the-alleged-minneapolis-police-department-hack/ https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files-from-hundreds-of-police-departments/ https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/06/blueleaks-exposes-files-from-hundreds-of-police-departments/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-over-blueleaks-police-data-dump/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bans-ddosecrets-account-over-blueleaks-police-data-dump/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  33  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  34  3. RANSOMWARE  Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organisation’s data and demand payment to  restore access. In some instances, attackers may also steal an organisation’s information and demand additional  payment in return for not disclosing the information to authorities, competitors, or the public.231  Compromise through phishing e-mails and brute-forcing on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services remain the two  most common infection vectors. During the reporting period in 2021, we saw that the Conti and REvil threat actors  dominated the ransomware market from a financial as well as from a volume of infections point of view. Both actors  provide separate ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms through which affiliates can efficiently orchestrate their  attacks. The focus on RaaS-type business models increased during 2021, making proper attribution to individual  threat actors difficult.  The occurrence of multiple extortion schemes also increased strongly during 2021. After initially stealing and  encrypting sensitive data from organisations and threatening to release it publicly unless a payment is made,  attackers also target the organisations’ customers and/or partners for ransom to maximise their profits.  Cryptocurrency remains the most common pay-out method for threat actors. Attackers shifted to Monero as their  cryptocurrency of choice because of its enhanced anonymity and the indistinguishability of transactions.  The average ransom amount doubled over the last year, though small amounts of ransom are still popular with threat  actors. They tend to be paid more easily and result in less public exposure for the threat actor. The higher demands  also increased. Over just a few months, the highest demand made in 2020 more than doubled in 2021.  Some large ransomware operations shut down, whether voluntary or due to actions carried out by law-enforcement  agencies. However, groups have shut down in the past, only to resurface under another operation.  Several ransomware attacks were reported during the ETL reporting period. Figure 5 shows the incidents observed  based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA for the purposes of situational awareness.232 The  scope of the collection is global and multi-sectorial. Incidents, however, with a direct impact in the EU area are given  priority. We have observed a steady increase in ransomware incidents being reported since 2020, and a sharp  increase in May and June 2021. A list of notable ransomware incidents can be found in Annex B.  Figure 5: Ransomware incidents observed by ENISA (April 2020-July 2021)  231 NIST Preliminary Draft NISTIR 8374 - Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management,  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir//draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf  232 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN)  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  35  3.1 TRENDS  3.1.1 Conti and REvil ransomware groups lead the market  Based on crowdsourced ransomware payment data (as illustrated in Figure 6), the ransomware groups with the most  financial gains in 2021 are Conti ($12.7 million), REvil/Sodinokibi ($12 Million), DarkSide ($4.6 Million), MountLocker  ($4.2 Million), Blackmatter ($4.0 Million) and Egregor ($3.1 Million).233  Figure 6: Ransomware data, grouped by family, in 2021. (Source: https://ransomwhe.re/)  When looking at statistics based on trends in responses to ransomware incidents, the ransomware groups with the  most market share in 2021 Q1 are REvil/Sodinokibi (14.2%), Conti V2 (10.2%), Lockbit (7.5%), Clop (7.1%), and  Egregor (5.3%). For 2021 Q2 the top is represented by Sodinokibi (16.5%), Conti V2 (4.4%), Avaddon (5.4%),  Mespinoza (4.9%) and Hello Kitty (4.5%). These last two are newly emerging ransomware variants.234  Both from a financial and an incident perspective, we see that Conti and REvil dominated the ransomware market in  2021. We expect to see no infections from the original REvil/Sodinokibi and Darkside groups in the coming months, as  these have shut down at the time of writing this report. We also waiting to see whether the arrest of Clop members,  involved in money laundering, will impact the rest of their operations.  3.1.2 RDP and phishing remain the most common attack vectors  Initial compromise through RDP has been the major attack vector for the last few years. However, since 2020, we see  that this attack vector is in decline. In contrast, attacks through phishing e-mails rose during 2020.235 In Q2 2020, we  see both vectors as the most used ways to gain an initial foothold. Note that these two vectors are also the cheapest  and thus most profitable methods for threat actors.235  Compromise through RDP is mostly achieved by brute-forcing credentials. The advantage of this method is that threat  actors enter the network using legitimate credentials, allowing them to stay unnoticed. Although organisations with a  higher security maturity will monitor this type of activity, most medium to small businesses will not. Brute-forcing RDP  credentials is possible due to weak credentials, lack of two-factor authentication or a secure tunnel (VPN) to access  the RDP. Compromise of the RDP service itself due to a vulnerability happens but is less common.236  233 Ransomwhere, https://ransomwhe.re  234 Q2 Ransom Payment Amounts Decline as Ransomware becomes a National Security Priority, https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2- ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority  235 Q2 Ransom Payment Amounts Decline as Ransomware becomes a National Security Priority, https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2- ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority  236 Critical RDP Vulnerabilities Continue to Proliferate, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities- continue-to-proliferate/  https://ransomwhe.re/ https://ransomwhe.re/ https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities-continue-to-proliferate/ https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/critical-rdp-vulnerabilities-continue-to-proliferate/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  36  3.1.3 Ransomware-as-a-Service business model  The use of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms during attacks has become the norm. This type of service offers  a platform for other threat actors, groups, and individuals and is based on an affiliate model. The platform facilitates all  the elements needed to cover a ransomware attack, from file encryption and storage to payment.  The RaaS provider takes a cut on the ransom payments received from the victim, while the affiliate stays in control of  the bounty and the communication towards the victim. The platform makes all the tools needed for easy deployment on  the compromised target, and these tools are under continuous development. Like a healthy business, the RaaS  platforms are continuously adapting to changes in the environment in order to stay undetected by endpoint and network  security tools. RaaS has made ransomware attacks available to any malicious actor, even when they lack technical  knowledge.  3.1.4 Recruiting future insider threats  An upcoming trend in more elaborate ransomware attacks is the active recruitment of employees to assist during the  ransomware campaign. In August 2020, a Russian national was convicted for actively targeting and recruiting an  employee at Tesla. The employee needed to execute malware on his company’s computer system, which would  exfiltrate data from the company’s network. He would then threaten to disclose the data online unless the company  paid a ransom demand. The employee would receive $1,000,000 in bitcoins after the malware was installed.237  Lockbit also promises the gain of ‘millions’ in its insider recruitment program.238  3.1.5 Profit maximisation: a shift from double to multiple extortion  Throughout 2020, double extortion was a common theme during ransomware attacks. This type of attack combines  the traditional encryption of files on the victim’s network and systems, as well as the exfiltration of it. The extracted  data is then hosted and held hostage on a leak or dump-site owned by the ransomware group. These are also  referred to as shame sites. While negotiations are ongoing, the files often remained locked. Some RaaS platforms  include the feature of a timer to indicate the time a victim has left to resolve the payment or negotiate the ransom.  Research showed that in Q3 2020, almost half of all ransomware incidents featured the threat of data release.239  Traditional ransomware attacks would only cripple the organisations’ internal operations. By threatening to release the  data, victims are not only pressured to meet the group’s ransom demand but also by the threat to disclose the breach  to their customers and partners. In previous ransomware incidents, this notification was often neglected due to fear of  impacting business and public relations. Due to the public shaming aspect of breaches due to double extortion  ransomware, companies are in a way incentivised to openly communicate about an incident. The threat to leak  exfiltrated data has increased significantly, from 8.7% in 2020 to 81% in 2021 Q2.240  We see the requirement to report breaches to law enforcement agencies becoming an important theme for  cybersecurity lawmakers.241 An interview with a supposed member of the Lockbit ransomware group mentions that  threat actors are aware of this. They predict that payments can become more difficult for United States-based victims.  Supposedly, Europeans pay immediately out of fear for GDPR fines.242  In 2021, we see another evolution in the maximisation of profit: the emergence of the multiple extortion scheme. After  initially stealing and encrypting sensitive data from organisations and threatening to release it publicly unless a  payment is made, attackers now also target the organisations’ customers and/or partners for ransom.243 In April 2021,  REvil targeted Quanta Computer, a notebook manufacturer. When the company refused to pay any ransom, the  attackers turned their attention to Apple, and threatened to release blueprints they stole through the initial attack.

After targeting RaceTrac Petroleum and threatening to release  the companies’ files, the actor moved forward to contact their customers and partners directly and threaten to release  their files.245 Note that some research describes the use of DDoS as the triple extortion vector, and the ransom  towards the victim’s client then becomes the quadruple extortion. However, a DDoS attack is only used to increase  the pressure but adds no actual ransom or extortion to the process, as the company is already locked out at that  time.246 Through a ransomware breach, third parties themselves become exposed. Like a regular company, the  ransomware actors are constantly on the lookout for more business opportunities. These third-party victims are ideal  vectors to request new ransoms or even start new ransomware campaigns using the internal information that was  previously obtained.  3.1.6 Cryptocurrency for ransom payment: a shift from Bitcoin to Monero  For a few years now, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins have been preferred by cyber threat actors to receive ransom  payments. The promise of a fast, secure, and anonymous channel to move the money made it a perfect solution. The  transparent and decentralised structure makes it a reliable channel and protects the money. In addition, due to the  higher computer power necessary to generate new hashes, and stricter regulations,247 the value of bitcoin has  dramatically increased over the last two years. While the wallet can offer anonymity, it is not untraceable. Due to the  transparency of bitcoin transactions and the wallets associated with specific ransomware groups, it becomes possible  to research the affiliation between groups and follow the payments being made. This data gives an insight to estimate  the actual financial gains of threat actor groups more reliably.  In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline fell victim to a ransomware attack orchestrated by ransomware group DarkSide. The  FBI was involved after the victim had already paid the ransom demand of around 75 bitcoins. By reviewing the Bitcoin  public ledger, law enforcement could track multiple bitcoin transfers and identify that the group had transferred  approximately 63.7 bitcoins to a specific wallet address. It turns out that the FBI had the “private key” needed to  access assets from the specific Bitcoin address. With a seizure warrant, the FBI proceeded to seise the coins. It was  not disclosed how the FBI obtained the private key.248 This operation was a success and the first time law  enforcement retrieved the larger part of a ransom in cryptocurrency.  After the seizure, a shift was noticed towards the use of Monero as cryptocurrency. Monero was launched as an open-  source project to add anonymity and indistinguishability of transactions but quickly gained traction among users and  has had stable growth over the last few years. Ransomware group REvil only accepted Monero in 2021. Other groups  such as DarkSide and Babuk left the choice to the victim but added charges when choosing bitcoin to pay the  ransom.249  While not all are originating from cybercrime, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has seised $1.2 billion worth of  cryptocurrency in 2021 alone.250 Typically, seised wallets are auctioned publicly. In addition, crowdsourced projects  give easy visibility to these payments and the malware families.251  244 Hacker Group Mysteriously Removes Stolen Apple Schematics and Extortion Threat From Ransomware Website,  https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/  245 Ransom Gangs E-mailing Victim Customers for Leverage, https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-e-mailing-victim-customers-for- leverage  246 Ransomware Double Extortion and Beyond: REvil, Clop, and Conti, https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital- threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti  247 Bitcoin falls further as China cracks down on crypto-currencies, https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57169726  248 Department of Justice Seises $2.3 Million in Cryptocurrency Paid to the Ransomware Extortionists Darkside,  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seises-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside  249 Monero emerges as crypto of choice for cybercriminals, https://www.ft.com/content/13fb66ed-b4e2-4f5f-926a-7d34dc40d8b6  250 The IRS has seised $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency this fiscal year – here's what happens to it, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seised- 1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html  251 Ransomwhere, https://ransomwhe.re/  https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/ https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-emailing-victim-customers-for-leverage https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-emailing-victim-customers-for-leverage https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57169726 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside https://www.ft.com/content/13fb66ed-b4e2-4f5f-926a-7d34dc40d8b6 https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seized-1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seized-1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html https://ransomwhe.re/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  38  3.1.7 Money laundering is the weak spot  At some point, threat actors want to convert their ransom from cryptocurrency to money. At that point, maintaining  anonymity over the wallet becomes more challenging. Major cryptocurrency exchanges require proof of identity to  keep a record of payments, which makes it difficult for threat actors to cash out their gains easily. This is where money  laundering schemes come into play.  Researchers used interviews and the investigation of police files to investigate ransomware groups’ modus operandi  to launder their profits. Based on the results, two main models were identified; based on the payment of the ransom 1)  via vouchers and 2) via bitcoins. In the crypto-based model, bitcoins are first sent through a mixer, a mechanism that  groups crypto from different sources together and divides it back via random transactions, in time and value, to other  destination wallets. This mixer makes it more difficult to track where and how the original transaction moves. Bitcoins  are then either exchanged via 1) a bitcoin exchange for money, 2) a (human) bitcoin trader in exchange for physical  money, 3) money laundering services, or 4) used directly as bitcoins.252  Ransomware groups are much more intertwined than was assumed. A large concentration is seen at the deposit  address level, where only 199 addresses received 80% of all funds sent by ransomware addresses in 2020. An even  smaller group of 25 addresses accounts for 46%. The key takeaway is that only the owners of a small pool of  addresses support and control the ability to cash out ransomware gains.253 This concentration is also the weakness of  the ransomware groups. Successful operations against the owners of these addresses could impact their gains and  ability to pay all people involved in the ransomware scheme.  The Nemty ransomware group shut down its operations in April 2020. Researchers discovered internal details of their  operations between 2019 and 2020. The interesting part is that the list of affiliates was disclosed. Through the list,  some well-known nicknames are found. These users can be found all over the place, showing that the affiliates of  RaaS are not working exclusively with one provider. This overlap in users suggests that the core RaaS actors are a  small group of people, which is consistent with the previous section regarding the concentration of deposit  addresses.254  When ransomware groups are investigated, those involved in money laundering have more chances of getting  caught. Transferring cryptocurrency to money is a process where true anonymity is hard to maintain. It was the case  for the Clop ransomware group. Six people were arrested and charged with laundering $500 Million for the gang.255  The laundering schemes used are expected to further develop over the years. Only through proper international  coordination of law-enforcement, but also cooperation with the private sector, e.g. exchanges markets, will we stand a  chance to properly investigate money trails, to disrupt the ransomware operations.  252 Laundering the profits of ransomware: money laundering methods for vouchers and cryptocurrencies, July 2020, European Journal of Crime Criminal  Law and Criminal Justice 28(2):121-152  DOI:10.1163/15718174-02802002  253 Chainalysis - Crypto crime report - 2021  254 The Nemty affiliate model, https://medium.com/csis-techblog/the-nemty-affiliate-model-13f5cf7ab66b  255 Clop ransomware is back in business after recent arrests, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business- after-recent-arrests/  https://medium.com/csis-techblog/the-nemty-affiliate-model-13f5cf7ab66b https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  39  3.1.7.1 The average ransom doubled in 2020  Figure 7: Average ransom, based on data from Coveware256  A study257 suggests that in 2019, the average ransom paid was around $80,000. In 2020, this more than doubled to  an average of $170,000. According to the same study, the average in 2021 Q1 and Q2 was around $180.000. Other  research258 finds that the average ransom increased from $115,123 in 2019 to $312,493 in 2020. Both of these  findings show the same trend. For the first half of 2021, we can conclude that the average amount peaked further.  These figures support the idea that small ransom amounts are still worthwhile for threat actors while also easier for  companies to defend paying.  3.1.8 Highest ransom demands are skyrocketing  Another trend is an increase in the ransom demanded by threat actors. This amount is often the starting point for the  ransom to be paid. If companies want to pay, negotiations are held and, usually, only a part of the initial sum is paid.  The highest ransomware demand grew from $15 million in 2019 to $30 million in 2020.259 Since this research, REvil  has stepped up its game, demanding $50 million from Acer in March 2021.260 A month later, in April, the ransomware  group requested the same amount from Quanta Computer, a supplier to Apple.261 In July 2021, after Kaseya got hit,  they demanded a $70 million ransom to publish the universal decryptor to unlock every device affected.262 Over just a  few months, the highest demand of 2020 more than doubled in 2021. It is likely we will hit the cap of a $100 million  ransom demand in 2022.  With record-high demands, we also see record-high pay-outs. The incidents that are publicly disclosed or that receive  media attention are only the tip of the iceberg. There are other public ransomware incidents with high ransoms, where  the actual amount discussed during negotiation leaked, but payment of the ransom was never confirmed, such as  Garmin in 2020263 ($10 million) and CNA in 2021 ($40 million).264 As long as organisations keep paying, there is no  reason for ransomware groups to lower their demands. The highest pay-outs become a goal or even a reference for  existing and future ransomware groups.  256 https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority  257 Group-IB “Ransomware Uncovered 2020 – 2021” Report  258 Unit42 - Ransomware Threat Report - 2021  259 Unit42 - Ransomware Threat Report - 2021  260 Cyberattaque : une rançon de 50 millions de dollars demandée à Acer, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252498175/Cyberattaque-une-rancon-de-50- millions-de-dollars-demandee-a-Acer  261 Hacker Group Mysteriously Removes Stolen Apple Schematics and Extortion Threat From Ransomware Website,  https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/  262 REvil gang asks for $70 million to decrypt systems locked in Kaseya attack, https://therecord.media/revil-gang-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-systems- locked-in-kaseya-attack/  263 Garmin reportedly paid multimillion-dollar ransom after suffering cyberattack, https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware- attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp  264 One of the biggest US insurance companies reportedly paid hackers $40 million ransom after a cyberattack, https://www.businessinsider.com/cna- financial-hackers-40-million-ransom-cyberattack-2021-5  https://www.coveware.com/blog/2021/7/23/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252498175/Cyberattaque-une-rancon-de-50-millions-de-dollars-demandee-a-Acer https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252498175/Cyberattaque-une-rancon-de-50-millions-de-dollars-demandee-a-Acer https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/revil-delists-stolen-apple-schematics-threat/ https://therecord.media/revil-gang-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-systems-locked-in-kaseya-attack/ https://therecord.media/revil-gang-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-systems-locked-in-kaseya-attack/ https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp https://www.businessinsider.com/cna-financial-hackers-40-million-ransom-cyberattack-2021-5 https://www.businessinsider.com/cna-financial-hackers-40-million-ransom-cyberattack-2021-5  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  40  3.1.9 Overall increase in costs and revenue loss due to ransomware  When a ransomware incident happens, organisations are confronted with a lot of cost. These costs include the  amount of ransom, downtime, and the cost of people and actual operational and technical remediation, etc. A survey  conducted across 30 countries showed that the overall cost of remediating a ransomware attack has vastly increased,  from $761,106 in 2020 to $1.85 million in 2021.265 The results suggest that the overall cost of a ransomware incident  more than doubled in only one year.  During a ransomware attack, key infrastructure is often targeted to paralyse the organisation, causing the inability to  provide proper service and run internal operations. The average downtime of organisations has increased over the  last year. Research shows that the average downtime increased from 15 days in Q1 2020 to 23 days in Q2 2021.266  Aside from the costs related to the incident, repercussions on business opportunities and revenues have also been  observed. A survey of 1,263 respondents reported that 66% of their organisations suffered significant revenue losses  due to ransomware attacks, where company sise appears to have minimal impact on revenue loss.267 The results  underline the fact that every industry vertical is vulnerable to a statistically significant chance of revenue loss following  successful ransomware.  3.1.10 The volatility of ransomware groups; shutdowns and arrests  Whether voluntary or based on actions from law-enforcement agencies, we saw large ransomware operations going  offline. In the past, groups have shut down, only to resurface under another name.  In November 2020, the Maze ransomware group announced the end of its operations. Maze published data referring  to more than 300 successful ransomware operations. It is believed that the group behind Maze will eventually reform  as the Egregor group. 268  In January 2021, a Canadian national was charged in relation to NetWalker ransomware attacks in which tens of  millions of dollars were allegedly obtained.269  By the end of January 2021, the FonixCrypter or Fonix Ransomware group announced the shutdown of their  operation and released the master decryption key.270 While not confirmed, there are some indications that the group  were arrested.  The threat actors behind Ziggy ransomware shut down their operation one week later, also releasing the decryption  keys. They sent out a message about feeling guilty for their actions.271 Research on their ransomware sample showed  Gaza, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as white-listed countries.272 Note that white-listing specific countries is a  common practice in malware.  In February 2021, three people from the Egregor ransomware group were arrested in Ukraine following a joint  operation between French and Ukrainian law enforcement.273 Egregor operated a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)  business for affiliates and had around 200 public victims.

After analysing their decryptor,  researchers stated that it caused significant damage due to faulty code, leading to unreliable and sometimes faulty  decryption, destroying the files in the process.276  In May 2021, the DarkSide ransomware group, which also operated with a RaaS model, announced the group’s  shutdown closely after the attack on Colonial Pipeline. After the attack, the group initially announced they would ‘vet’  the targets of their affiliates and explained that their motives were not political or destructive. Another announcement  was later made that they would cease their operations and send out decryptors to all the victims. The statement,  posted in the Russian language, claimed that an unspecified law enforcement agency disrupted part of its  infrastructure.277 It is still uncertain whether this information was factual or part of an exit strategy for the group. Note  that the decryptor used by DarkSide was also not well designed, and the decryption process ran too slow for efficient  recovery of their victims’ operations. Therefore, even after paying for the decryptor, they had to resort to their own  backups to help restore the system.278  In June 2021, a Latvian national faced charges stemming from her alleged role in a transnational cybercrime  organisation responsible for creating and deploying a computer banking trojan and ransomware suite of malware  known as Trickbot.279  Later in June, six members from the Clop ransomware group were detained in Ukraine after a joint operation between  Ukraine, South Korea, and the United States.280 While the authorities claimed to have shut down the group’s  infrastructure successfully, the ransomware operation is still in business and is listing new victims on their data leak  site. The operations targeted the money-laundering side of the operation, while the platform core members were not  apprehended.281  In July 2021, Avaddon, a ransomware group operating a RaaS platform, announced the shutdown of their operation.  Along with the announcement, they released 2,934 decryption keys, one for each of their victims.282 This number of  decryption keys shows that the number of reported ransomware infections is just the tip of the iceberg.  Later in July, REvil/Sodinokibi shut down its operations.283 Note that this is just days after the communication between  the United States and Russia regarding the increase in ransomware attacks. High-profile victims of the group were  Kaseya and its many managed service provider (MSP) customers and JBS Foods.  New groups have mysteriously emerged while these others shut down. Backmatter, for example, is a group that is  actively recruiting affiliates or ‘initial access brokers’.284 However, encryption algorithms found in a decryptor show that  the group is, in fact, a rebrand of the DarkSide ransomware operation. Grief, another new group, is a rebrand of  274 Egregor ransomware affiliates arrested by Ukrainian, French police, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware- affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/  275 Chainanalysis = The 2021 Crypto Crime Report  276 McAfee: Babuk ransomware decryptor causes encryption 'beyond repair', https://www.zdnet.com/article/mcafee-babuk-ransomware-decryptor- causes-encryption-beyond-repair/  277 DarkSide Ransomware Shutdown: An Exit Scam or Running for Hills?, https://www.securityweek.com/darkside-ransomware-shutdown-exit-scam-or- running-hills  278 Colonial Pipeline Paid Hackers Nearly $5 Million in Ransom, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers- nearly-5-million-in-ransom  279 Latvian National Charged for Alleged Role in Transnational Cybercrime Organisation, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged- alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organisation  280 Cuffed: Ukraine police collar six Clop ransomware gang suspects in joint raids with South Korean cops,  https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/clop_ransomware_gang_arrests_ukraine/  281 Clop ransomware is back in business after recent arrests, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business- after-recent-arrests/  282 Avaddon ransomware shuts down and releases decryption keys, https://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down- and-releases-decryption-keys/  283 Ransomware Giant REvil’s Sites Disappear, https://threatpost.com/ransomware-revil-sites-disappears/167745/  284 BlackMatter, a new ransomware group, claims link to DarkSide, REvil, https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2021/07/blackmatter-a-new- ransomware-group-claims-link-to-darkside-revil/  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-affiliates-arrested-by-ukrainian-french-police/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/mcafee-babuk-ransomware-decryptor-causes-encryption-beyond-repair/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/mcafee-babuk-ransomware-decryptor-causes-encryption-beyond-repair/ https://www.securityweek.com/darkside-ransomware-shutdown-exit-scam-or-running-hills https://www.securityweek.com/darkside-ransomware-shutdown-exit-scam-or-running-hills https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/clop_ransomware_gang_arrests_ukraine/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/ https://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/ https://bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/ https://threatpost.com/ransomware-revil-sites-disappears/167745/ https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2021/07/blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-claims-link-to-darkside-revil/ https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2021/07/blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-claims-link-to-darkside-revil/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  42  DoppelPaymer, according to research.285 Other newcomers are AvosLocker286, and Haron. The latter is based on  Avaddon source code and has the same look-and-feel. 287  What this indicates is that these shutdown operations are often nothing more than rebranding operations. The goal is  not always clear, whether to fool or distract law enforcement agencies and researchers or to deal with unhappy  affiliates. The fact remains that all these groups share common malware writers, overlapping source code, and  affiliates that use the platform. Over time, they will all disappear and re-emerge in one way or another. Overall, we see  law enforcement actions taking place, but the impact on the operations of these groups remains limited.  3.1.11 Increased usage of zero-day vulnerabilities  In the past, zero-days were only used for targeted attacks by advanced threat actor groups and nation-states. The  reason is, of course, the cost (value) of such a zero-day. Threat actors can only re-use it as long as the attack vector  and payload are not discovered. Therefore, threat actors will carefully select the target and consider what it is  potentially worth, and whether and when to ‘burn’ an exploit.  In December 2020, Accellion patched a zero-day vulnerability in its legacy File Transfer Appliance product. The  vulnerability turned out to be one in a cascade of vulnerabilities. Four zero-days (CVE-2021-27101,288 CVE-2021-  27102,289 CVE-2021-27103,290 CVE-2021-27104291) were used to extract the data of its customers. The victims then  received extortion e-mails from an actor claiming association with the Clop ransomware team gang. Technically  speaking, no ransomware was deployed, but the actors threatened to expose the stolen data if no ransom was paid.292  REvil used CVE-2021-30116 293 and two other CVEs,294 to target Kaseya VSA management software and its MSP  customers. A side note here is that the mentioned CVE had been discovered previously by security researchers and  had been disclosed internally to Kaseya, which in the strictest of terms means that this wasn’t a zero-day anymore, at  least not for the companies involved.  After the initial publication of a zero-day vulnerability, we generally see an increase in attacks, where threat actors try  to target as many unpatched victims as possible. In June 2021, The PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675295)  was initially discovered. Magniber ransomware was observed quickly adapting and weaponising the PrintNightmare  vulnerability to target victims, mainly in South Korea.296  With the increase in ransoms, we see more zero-days being used to gain a foothold in an organisation and execute a  ransomware attack. It shows that the potential revenue of a ransomware attack is higher than the cost of the exploit.  Especially in operations at scale, this makes a lot of sense. The decrease in the number of attacks and the focus on  large organisations allows for threat actors to ask for high ransoms. This focus on a high pay-out is referred to as big  game hunting (BGH). Instead of targeting a large pool of targets using prevalent malware distribution vectors such as  phishing, victims are carefully studied, and sophisticated methods are used to breach these high-value targets. The  focus and potential of BGH dominated the ecosystem of cybercrime in 2020 and boosted the market for network  access brokers. This way, BGH trends disrupted traditional targeted cybercrime behaviour.297  285 DoppelPaymer ransomware gang rebrands as the Grief group, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang- rebrands-as-the-grief-group/  286 AvosLocker Under The Lens: A New Sophisticated Ransomware Group  , https://blog.cyble.com/2021/07/15/avoslocker-under-the-lens-a-new-sophisticated-ransomware-group/  287 New Haron ransomware gang emerges, borrows from Avaddon and Thanos, https://therecord.media/new-haron-ransomware-gang-emerges- borrowing-from-avaddon-and-thanos/  288 CVE-2021-27101 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27101  289 CVE-2021-27102 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27102  290 CVE-2021-27103 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27103  291 CVE-2021-27104 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27104  292 Accellion FTA Zero-Day Attacks Show Ties to Clop Ransomware, FIN11, https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware- fin11/164150/  293 CVE-2021-20116 Detail, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30116  294 Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited in the wild in July 2021, https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE- 2021-30116  295 Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675  296 Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks: 2017 Magniber Ransomware Uses PrintNightmare Vulnerability to Infect Victims in South Korea,  https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/magniber-ransomware-caught-using-printnightmare-vulnerability/  297 Crowdstrike - Global Threat Report - 2021  https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/ https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/ https://blog.cyble.com/2021/07/15/avoslocker-under-the-lens-a-new-sophisticated-ransomware-group/ https://therecord.media/new-haron-ransomware-gang-emerges-borrowing-from-avaddon-and-thanos/ https://therecord.media/new-haron-ransomware-gang-emerges-borrowing-from-avaddon-and-thanos/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27101 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27102 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27103 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27104 https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware-fin11/164150/ https://threatpost.com/accellion-zero-day-attacks-clop-ransomware-fin11/164150/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30116 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116 https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675 https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/magniber-ransomware-caught-using-printnightmare-vulnerability/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  43  3.1.12 Insurance fuels the ransomware industry economy  With the general increase in cybersecurity incidents, organisations are more prone to take out cybersecurity  insurance. Taking out insurance is part of a risk strategy in which you transfer the risk to a third party. Being insured  doesn’t mean that the security risks are mitigated. Instead, the risk of associated costs in case of an incident is  reduced. Companies faced with ransomware incidents will more readily pay, knowing that they have insurance  coverage. Research points out that ransomware coverage in insurance policies is not only encouraging threat actors,  but the practice may be fuelling the entire ransomware economy.298 The insurance industry is facing criticism over  this. The largest insurance organisation in the United States defends ransom payment reimbursements.299 One of  Europe’s top five insurers announced in May 2021 it would suspend ransomware crime reimbursement. Note that this  suspension only covered France.300  Ransomware coverage in cybersecurity insurance becomes unsustainable as the ransoms will only increase in value  and numbers.301 A survey showed that in 2020, 26% of the victims paid the ransom to get their data back. This  number rose to 32% for 2021.302 More victims are thus paying their ransom. This rise will impact insurance companies  and the cost of an insurance policy. An insurer with 25.000 small and midsise customers in North America reported  that in 2020, 41% of their customer claims were related to ransomware attacks.303  Insurance companies can play an important role by requiring their customers to improve their IT security. However,  insurance companies often only impose basic risk assessments, including security tests, to validate whether a  baseline is covered within the organisation. A common requirement is to do vulnerability scanning against the external  perimeter of the organisation’s IT infrastructure. While this is certainly a good initiative, it results in a narrow  representation of the company’s security posture and the associated risk. However, an article suggests that  ransomware-related claims dropped by 65% following the insurance’s security scans.304 As previously discussed,  RDP exposure on the external infrastructure has been a preferred way for intrusion for a long time and could explain  why scanning for remote services on the external perimeter does reduce the likelihood of ransomware incidents.  3.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following proposed recommendations provide the basis for the development of a mitigation strategy for the  prevention of and response against ransomware.   Implementation of secure and redundant backup strategies;   Implementation and auditing of identity and access management (least-privilege and separation of duties);   Training and raising the awareness of users (including privileged users);   Separation of development and production environments;   Information sharing on incidents with authorities and the industry;   Restricting access to known ransomware sites;   Identities and credentials should be issued, managed, verified, revoked, and audited for authorised devices,  users, and processes;305   Access permissions and authorisations should be managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and  separation of duties;305   Separation of development and production environments;305   Ransomware response and recovery plans should be tested periodically to ensure that risk and response  assumptions and processes are current with respect to the evolving ransomware threats;305   Use of security products or services that block access to known ransomware sites;306  298 https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/occasional-papers/cyber-insurance-and-cyber-security-challenge  299 https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/07/02/621178.htm  300 https://apnews.com/article/europe-france-technology-business-caabb132033ef2aaee9f58902f3e8fba  301 Cyber Insurance and the Cyber Security Challenge Jamie MacColl, Jason R C Nurse and James Sullivan - Royal United Services Institute (RUSI)  302 https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf  303 Cyber Insurance Claims Report – H1 2020 – Coalition - coalitioninc.com  304 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyber-insurers-security-scans-reduced-ransomware-claims-by-65-percent/  305 Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management (Preliminary Draft),  https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf  306 NIST Releases Tips and Tactics for Dealing with Ransomware, https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/nist-releases-tips-and-tactics- dealing-ransomware  https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/occasional-papers/cyber-insurance-and-cyber-security-challenge https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2021/07/02/621178.htm https://apnews.com/article/europe-france-technology-business-caabb132033ef2aaee9f58902f3e8fba https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyber-insurers-security-scans-reduced-ransomware-claims-by-65-percent/ https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/nistir/draft/documents/NIST.IR.8374-preliminary-draft.pdf https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/nist-releases-tips-and-tactics-dealing-ransomware https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/nist-releases-tips-and-tactics-dealing-ransomware  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  44   Execution of the Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA), a tool developed by CISA geared towards IT  and ICS (industrial control system) networks, to evaluate their security against varying levels of ransomware  threat readiness;307   Report any attack or attempted attack to the authorities and help restrict its spread;308   Systems’ monitoring for fast identification of infections; and   Keeping up with recent ransomware trends, developments and proposals for prevention.  307 US CISA Introduced Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA), https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/07/06/us-cisa-introduced-ransomware- readiness-assessment-rra-in-its-cset-security-software/  308 StopRansomware.gov – Report Ransomware https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/report-ransomware-0  https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/07/06/us-cisa-introduced-ransomware-readiness-assessment-rra-in-its-cset-security-software/ https://latesthackingnews.com/2021/07/06/us-cisa-introduced-ransomware-readiness-assessment-rra-in-its-cset-security-software/ https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/report-ransomware-0  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  45  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  46  4. MALWARE  Malware is an umbrella term that describes any software, firmware or code intended to perform a malicious  unauthorised process that will have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system.  Examples of malware could be a virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entities that infect a host. Spyware  and some forms of adware are also part of the malware term.309  A malware can have various and different capabilities depending on the goal of the creator. For example RATs (Remote  Access Trojans/Tools) are malware that allow an actor remote control of an infected system. Infostealers or Skimmers  are designed to capture credit card information. Botnets are a robot network of computers infected by malware and  controlled by C&C servers. Trojans, which can be either a banking Trojan or a mobile Trojan depending on the target,  are malware that are often disguised as legitimate software.  The threat of malware appears consistently in the ETL, with new families and strains emerging every year despite the  laudable efforts of law enforcement to take them down. In the following paragraphs, we describe general trends that  emerged during the reporting period. A list of notable malware incidents can be found in Annex B.  In addition, it  needs to be emphasised’ clarified that mitigation vectors are generic in nature and security professionals need to look  for specific mitigation vectors for different malware families.  4.1 TRENDS  4.1.1 Decline of 2020 continues over 2021  Malware attacks decreased heavily during the reporting period. Research has shown that attacks in North America  decreased by 43% in 2020 compared to 2019. This drop was almost same in Europe, while a decrease of 53% was  noticed in Asia.310 One of the key factors for this reduction could be linked to the COVID19 pandemic. Employees  worked more from home and used their consumer ISPs and personal computers for work-related activities. This home  environment and infrastructure doesn’t have the same level of protection and detection, limiting the visibility of malware  infections. The reduction in this visibility can cause a gap when collected statistical data is based only on detecting  infections in the corporate environment.  In 2021, the decrease in malware infections is continuing. Research shows a further reduction of 22% over the first six  months of 2021, compared to this period last year.311 Note that a reduction in total malware volume does not mean that  cybercrime declined. In the past, malware was used to infect a maximum of victims. Today, the focus is less on quantity  and more on the quality of infections. In 2019, the number of malicious Office and PDF files was equal. Throughout  2020, the number of malicious Office files increased heavily until they exceeded PDF files by 150%. In 2021, the share  of malware on both these file types dropped, with executable files gaining the ground they had lost.311  For 2020, the most detected malware categories in corporate environments included botnets (28%), cryptominers  (21%), infostealers (16%), mobile (15%), banking (14%), and ransomware (4%).312 In June 2021, the most common  malware families detected were Trickbot (botnet and banking), XMRig (cryptominer), Formbook (infostealer), Glupteba  (botnet), and Agent Tesla (infostealer).313 Notice that these malware families did not change a lot over the last year.  One noticeable difference is the fact that Emotet was taken down and Trickbot took over its market share314.  309 NIST Special Publication 800-171 Revision 2 (updated 01-28-2021),  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf  310 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report  311 Mid-Year Update: 2021 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report  312 2021 Checkpoint CYBER SECURITY REPORT  313 June 2021’s Most Wanted Malware: Trickbot Remains on Top - Check Point Software  314 https://threatpost.com/trickbot-takes-over-emotet/164710/  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/07/13/june-2021s-most-wanted-malware-trickbot-remains-on-top/ https://threatpost.com/trickbot-takes-over-emotet/164710/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  47  4.1.2 Windows container malware  Malware targeting container environments has become much more prevalent. The technology of containerisation allows  scaling easily. Malware focusing on the cloud-native stack, is in essence, not new. In November 2020, malicious  container images had been already identified, and were used to find and exploit vulnerabilities on a particular victim’s  Kubernetes environment.315 In December 2020, researchers also discovered the existence of file-less malware being  executed from memory.316 Common defence mechanisms or static scanners would not detect this type of infection. In  March 2021, researchers uncovered the first known malware that targets Windows containers.317 Other typical initial  infection vectors include misconfigured container dashboards, APIs or daemons, or security issues in the application  hosted on the container environment.  The most common goal of this type of malware is to escape the container, to infect the whole cluster. Clusters are  generally collections of multiple applications, which increases the impact of such an infection heavily.  Common compromises include the leakage of sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers etc. In  addition, container technology is often used as a best practice during the development lifecycle to spin up separate  environments quickly. Compromise of development environments could result in further supply-chain attacks. Attackers  stay under the radar and build in backdoors through source-code commits. The modified software is spread and used  as an infection vector, targeting the software’s users through genuine installers or the software’s update functionality.  Patch management for container infrastructure is often disregarded because of the short lifespan of container instances.  However, the discovered attacks underline the importance of protecting all exposed infrastructure. Automated tools  execute attacks in a short time, enough to steal files or escape to the cluster. Once the cluster is owned, all data and  code should be considered compromised.  4.1.3 Mobile Malware  In 2020, fake ad blockers, also referred to as adware, were on the rise on Android. This type of malicious application  tempts the user with “add blocking” capabilities, asks for extensive permissions on the operating system, and starts  using all sorts of notifications and browser redirects to present ads and thus generate revenue. A close variant is the  hiddenAds mobile malware. In 2020, detection of this malware type increased from 280.000 to 700.000 compared to  2019.318 The large proportion of adware in mobile malware continues throughout 2021. 45% Of mobile malware was  identified as adware in the first half of 2021.319  Installation of these applications usually happens through third-party  app stores as well as in online forums.  Mobile banking malware saw an increase in 2020. The malware tries to steal online banking credentials and payment  information by showing fake login screens. The malware is then capable of performing transactions on accounts with  financial institutions. The most common malicious banking applications in 2021 include Ghimob, Eventbot, and Thiefbot.  Other common malware is Blackrock, Wroba, and TrickMO.320  In May 2021, Flubot infections increased using SMS as a spreading mechanism. The increase was mainly noticed in  Europe and the UK. In most messages, either government (COVID-19 related) or package delivery brands were  impersonated to lure victims into installing a malicious application.321  Most malware is based on malicious applications that users install. In 2020 and 2021, there have been some cases of  significant vulnerabilities in popular applications allowing remote code execution, but malicious applications were not  reported to target these actively. There have been cases of zero-day vulnerabilities targeting the mobile platform instead  of an application. However, the victims of these attacks are very specific and high profile. The Pegasus spyware for iOS  is used worldwide to target journalists, activists, and politicians. The malware uses two zero-click malware variants: the  315 https://blog.aquasec.com/kubernetes-vulnerability-security-threat  316 https://blog.aquasec.com/fileless-malware-container-security  317 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/siloscape/  318 State of Malware 2021 - Malwarebytes  319 https://press.avast.com/avast-reports-continued-dominance-of-adware-among-android-threats  320 Checkpoint – Cyber Security Report 2021  321 https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/05/17/take-action-now-flubot-malware-may-be-on-its-way/  https://blog.aquasec.com/kubernetes-vulnerability-security-threat https://blog.aquasec.com/fileless-malware-container-security https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/siloscape/ https://press.avast.com/avast-reports-continued-dominance-of-adware-among-android-threats https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/05/17/take-action-now-flubot-malware-may-be-on-its-way/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  48  Kismet exploit in 2020 and the Forcedentry (Megalodon) in 2021.322 In July 2021, a list of 50.000 victims of these  targeted attacks leaked.323  4.1.4 Detection is bypassed using exotic languages  Malware developers resort to relatively new or uncommon programming languages. While not entirely new, this trend  has continued to evolve throughout 2020 and 2021. These uncommon languages include but are not limited to Rust,  Nim, DLang, and Go324. The main motive is to bypass detection capabilities.  As most of the detection capability of malware is based on static indicators, these become irrelevant or ineffective when  the source code is rewritten in a new language.325 From a reverse engineering perspective, it also becomes more  challenging to analyse these new malware samples. Either entire rulesets must be rewritten to match patterns in the  newly written malware, or focus needs to be shifted to the detection of dynamic or behaviour-based signatures. An  example of this trend was reported in May 2021, when the original Buer malware was shown to have been rewritten in  Rust, named RustyBuer. Their similarity is based on nearly identical communication structures between the command-  and-control servers and the infected host.326  Malware written in these emerging programming languages only represents a fraction of all the malware being  developed today. Still, it is an important aspect for the future development of malware detection and code analysis  techniques. Migrating to other languages could mean that the scanners and defenders of today lose effectiveness and  ability to detect the malware of tomorrow.  4.1.5 Malware disruption  Emotet is a strain of computer malware. Initially, the malware acted as a banking trojan. Over the years, the malware  evolved and gained more ground. The functionality shifted from a simple information stealer to malware used to create  an advanced botnet. The malware featured a well-developed command and control (C2) infrastructure, frequent updates  and was very effective in evading detection.  In 2020, the malware used Trickbot and QBot to steal credentials and spread inside networks.327 Throughout 2020,  Emotet had been the most prevalent malware. The victims, part of the botnet, were often sold to other threat actors for  targeted cyber-crime, such as ransomware or information stealing.  In January 2021, Interpol announced a crackdown on the botnet. Law enforcement and judicial authorities worldwide  cooperated and took control of the botnet’s infrastructure in a coordinated international action.328 Through the C2  infrastructure, they delivered ‘updates’ to the malware, which would cause it to uninstall itself in April 2021. The Ukrainian  government arrested two individuals in relation to this investigation.329  The fight against cyber-crime is an ongoing and uneven battle. However, this case shows that through international  cooperation, law enforcement can have an impact.  4.1.6 High-Risk Vulnerabilities Across Major Vendors increase in 2021  At the end of 2020 and on into 2021 a wide spread of products were affected by high-risk vulnerabilities.  Critical, easily exploited vulnerabilities appeared in multiple products from vendors such as Microsoft, Apple, Google,  Adobe, Dell, SonicWall, QNAP, and VMWare. Another example is the vulnerabilities found in Apple software which were  also increasingly exploited in 2021. Attackers, such as the Silver Sparrow malware, have been targeting Apple products.  322 https://citisenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/  323 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus  324 https://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-developers-turn-to-exotic-programming-languages-to-thwart-researchers/  325 OLD DOGS NEW TRICKS:ATTACKERS ADOPT EXOTIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES – https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs- new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages  326 https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/new-variant-buer-loader-written-rust  327 https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2074889/0/en/July-2020-s-Most-Wanted-Malware-Emotet-Strikes-Again-After-Five- Month-Absence.html  328 https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action  329 https://www.cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-transnaczionalne-ugrupovannya-xakeriv-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-najnebezpechnishogo-v- sviti-kompyuternogo-virusu-emotet-2504/  https://citisenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus https://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-developers-turn-to-exotic-programming-languages-to-thwart-researchers/ https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs-new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/old-dogs-new-tricks-attackers-adopt-exotic-programming-languages https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/new-variant-buer-loader-written-rust https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2074889/0/en/July-2020-s-Most-Wanted-Malware-Emotet-Strikes-Again-After-Five-Month-Absence.html https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2074889/0/en/July-2020-s-Most-Wanted-Malware-Emotet-Strikes-Again-After-Five-Month-Absence.html https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action https://www.cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-transnaczionalne-ugrupovannya-xakeriv-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-najnebezpechnishogo-v-sviti-kompyuternogo-virusu-emotet-2504/ https://www.cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vykryla-transnaczionalne-ugrupovannya-xakeriv-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-najnebezpechnishogo-v-sviti-kompyuternogo-virusu-emotet-2504/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  49  This malware is the second known piece of macOS malware to feature a program compiled for the new M1 chip that  Apple introduced in November 2020.330  In many cases these vulnerabilities had already been exploited by the time they were disclosed. Accellion and the  vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange in Q1 2021 were among the most prominent.330  4.1.7 Malware as a business  Malware as a service is not a new trend. The move from static exploit kits to cloud-based rental models were discovered  in the past. We will not focus here on Ransomware-As-A-Service (RaaS), as this is covered in the previous chapter.  4.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  During the reporting period several good practices and mitigation vectors concerning malware were noted, as follows:   Implement malware detection for all inbound/outbound channels, including e-mail, network, web and  application systems in all applicable platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal computers and  mobile devices).   Inspect the SSL/TLS traffic allowing the firewall to decrypt what is being transmitted to and from websites, e-  mail communications, and mobile applications.   Establish interfaces between malware detection functions (intelligence-led threat hunting) and security  incident management to establish efficient response capabilities.   Use the tools available for malware analysis for sharing malware information and malware mitigation (i.e.  MISP).   Develop security policies that specify the processes to be followed in the event of infection.   Understand the capabilities of various security tools and develop new security solutions. Identify gaps and  apply the defence-in-depth principle.   Employ mail filtering (or spam filtering) for malicious e-mails and remove executable attachments.   Regularly monitor the results of antivirus tests.   Use patch management for container infrastructure.   Make use of log monitoring using security incident and event management (SIEM) solutions. Indicative log  sources are anti-virus alerts, endpoint detection and response (EDR), proxy server logs, Windows Event and  Sysmon logs, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs, etc.   Disable or reduce access to PowerShell functions.  330 https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0831.pdf  https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0831.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  50  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  51  5. CRYPTOJACKING  Cryptojacking or hidden cryptomining is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim’s computing  power to generate cryptocurrency. This usually occurs when the victim unwittingly installs a program with malicious  scripts that allow the cybercriminal to access their computer or other Internet-connected devices, e.g. by clicking on an  unknown link in an e-mail or visiting an infected website. Programs called ‘coin miners’ are then used by the criminal to  create or ‘mine’ cryptocurrencies.331  During the reporting period we saw a growing trend in cryptojacking, which could perhaps be associated with the  increasing volatility in the cryptocurrency market that was observed during the same period. Moreover, given that  cryptocurrencies offer (pseudo) anonymity, they become a very attractive and convenient means of exchange by  cybercriminals. Accordingly, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are requested when asking for ransom  in ransomware attacks. A list of notable cryptojaking incidents can be found in Annex B.  5.1 TRENDS  5.1.1 Cryptojacking volume in 2021 is record high  Since 2019, we have witnessed a steady decline in drive-by cryptominers, the dominant type for the past few years332.  The decline, which is aligned to the diminishing value of drive-by mining profitability, was hastened by the shutdown of  Coinhive in March 2019 and JSECoin in April 2020, as described in last year’s ETL report.333 334 However, attackers  have moved on to other types of malicious activities when it comes to cryptojacking/cryptomining, with Cisco reporting  that 69% of its customers had been affected by cryptomining malware in 2020.335 According to the same report,  cryptomining generated the most DNS traffic out of any other malicious activity.  In March of 2020, a spike in infections was seen, after which the infection rate dropped dramatically. From the second  to the last quarter of 2020, the volume of infections increased slowly and this continued in 2021.335 In the first quarter  of 2021, the volume of infections attained a record high compared to the last few years.336 Other statistics confirm this  trend, showing that during the first quarter of 2021, cryptomining malware increased by 117%.337 This last report links  this increase to the growth in 64-bit mining applications.337  We can conclude that financial gain associated with  cryptojacking incentivised the associated threat actors to carry out these attacks. Based on the fluctuating value of  cryptocurrency, we assume this will remain an important attack vector over the coming year.  When comparing the exchange rate of Bitcoin with the volume of cryptominers, we clearly see how both are related. As  mentioned in the ETL 2021 Ransomware report,338 threat actors are shifting from Bitcoin, which provides pseudo-  anonymity, to using strongly private cryptocurrency such as Monero.339 Europol reports that cryptocurrencies continue  to facilitate payments for various forms of cybercrime, as developments evolve with respect to privacy oriented crypto  coins and services.340  331 Interpol, Cybercrime-Cryptojacking September 2020, https://www.interpol.int/content/download/15670/file/Cybercrime-Cryptojacking-EN.pdf  332 https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptojacking-cryptocurrency-million-hits-first-half-2019  333 Check Point - Cyber security report - 2021  334 ENISA Threat Landscape - Cryptojacking 2020  335 https://blogs.cisco.com/security/threat-trends-dns-security-part-1  336 SonicWall - Cyber Threat Report : Mid-Year Update: 2021 |  337 McAfee Labs Threats Report - June 2021  338 ENISA Threat Landscape - Ransomware 2021  339 SonicWall - Cyber Threat Report - 2021  340 IOCTA Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment - 2020.  https://www.interpol.int/content/download/15670/file/Cybercrime-Cryptojacking-EN.pdf https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptojacking-cryptocurrency-million-hits-first-half-2019 https://blogs.cisco.com/security/threat-trends-dns-security-part-1  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  52  5.1.2 XMRig dominates the cryptomining market  In 2020, the global market of cryptomining malware was dominated by XMRig (35%), JSECoin (27%), Lucifer (7%),  WannaMine (6%), RubyMiner (5%), and others (20%).341 JSECoin was an open-source miner that shut down its  services in April 2020 due to financial uncertainties after the COVID-19 pandemic.342  XMRig343, an open-source miner, is used by attackers and most malware to perform cryptomining on victims unwillingly.  Over the first half of 2021, its market share increased to 51%, accounting for more than half of all cryptomining malware.  Other infections are related to Lucifer (10%), LemonDuck (5%), RubyMiner (5%), Wannamine (5%), and other miners  (20%).344 First discovered in May 2020, the Lucifer malware can, amongst other things, execute DDoS attacks, exploit  vulnerable Windows hosts, and perform brute-force attacks. These features allowed the malware to propagate itself  rapidly. Under the hood, the malware drops XMRig to mine.345 The LemonDuck malware strain is already a few years  old and is gaining more ground in 2021. It is also a self-propagating cryptominer, dropping XMRig on the victim to  perform mining tasks. Since April 2021, the malware has been targeting unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers,  suffering back then from multiple zero-days.346 Microsoft reported that cryptominers were some of the first payloads to  target these vulnerabilities actively, illustrating how well these could adapt to use make of new exploits.347  Even though Wannemine and RubyMine are older XMRig dropping malware variants, they still retain a foothold in 2021.  Wannamine further limits its malicious activity on the infected host, focusing solely on the mining.348  5.1.3 Shift from browser to file-based cryptojacking  Research showed that for the first trimester of 2021, desktop or file-based cryptojackers were almost seven times more  frequent than browser-based miners, at 13% for browser-based compared to 87% for file-based.349  Other research confirms that since the shutdown of Coinhive, the share of browser-based cryptomining dropped. This  gap is filled by file-based crypto-jackers, which first compromise the victim’s host and then drop mining software on it.350  In general, cryptojacking accounted for a mere 2.5% of malware used in breaches and only 1.5% of malware in incidents.  Around 10% of organisations received (and blocked) cryptocurrency mining malware at some point throughout the  course of the year351.  5.1.4 Infection methods do not change  The techniques used to spread and deploy cryptominers do not differ much from other malware infection methods. A  drive-by download is a technique used to deliver and install malicious files on a victim’s device without its knowledge.  This happens passively when visiting malicious websites, triggering a download that takes advantage of the operating  system or the web browser, which contain security flaws. Notice that compromised websites are also used as a delivery  vector for cryptominers. Another distribution method is malvertising, the act of spreading malware through  advertisements.  Cryptominers are often delivered as applications that hide their malicious behaviour. Typical examples are mobile  applications.352 While these applications are subject to automated security validation before being published on the  application store, these detections are not always adequate. Alternative stores are also used to spread malicious mobile  applications.  341 Check Point - Cyber security report - 2021  342 JSEcoin Ltd, https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CZLnRC2thW4J:https://jsecoin.com/nl/home/+&cd=2&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=be  343 XMRig, https://xmrig.com/  344 Check Point - Cyber security: Mid year report - 2021  345 Lucifer: New Cryptojacking and DDoS Hybrid Malware Exploiting High and Critical Vulnerabilities to Infect Windows Devices,  https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lucifer-new-cryptojacking-and-ddos-hybrid-malware/  346 Lemon Duck spreads its wings: Actors target Microsoft Exchange servers, incorporate new TTPs, https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/lemon- duck-spreads-wings.html  347 Analyzing attacks taking advantage of the Exchange Server vulnerabilities, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks- taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/  348 INCIBE (National Cybersecurity Institute) - WannaMine analysis study – April 2021  349 ESET - Threat report - T1 2021  350 SonicWall - Cyber Threat Report - 2021  351 Verizon DBIR 2020  352 https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/fake-cryptocurrency-mining-apps-trick-victims-into-watching-ads-.html  https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CZLnRC2thW4J:https://jsecoin.com/nl/home/+&cd=2&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=be https://xmrig.com/ https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lucifer-new-cryptojacking-and-ddos-hybrid-malware/ https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/lemon-duck-spreads-wings.html https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/lemon-duck-spreads-wings.html https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  53  There are also deceptive mobile applications claiming to do cryptomining, but their only functionality is to lure users into  expensive subscriptions.353 Another example is malicious browser add-ons, which leverage JavaScript libraries. These  are distributed through official browser add-on stores and forums.  Cryptomining software like XMRig is often incorporated in other malware and exploit kits.354 Advanced malware can  exploit other machines with known vulnerabilities or, through brute-forcing, can migrate over different machines and act  like a cryptomining worm.355  Interestingly, cryptojacking malware is also reported to actively search and terminate other cryptomining instances  running on their victim’s host. The Kinsing cloud crypto-jacker is such an example. The Linux-based malware installs a  Monero miner and then ensures maximum system resources by killing other processes and even docker containers that  are resource-intensive.356  5.1.5 Cryptomining targeting cloud and container infrastructure  Cloud infrastructure allows processing power to be scaled up when needed. When cloud hosts are infected by crypto-  jacking malware, the costs can become monumental. The cloud providers bill for the consumed CPU cycles, while the  gains resulting from the computing operations only cover a fraction of the costs.357  Container infrastructure is also an interesting target, as these environments will spawn worker nodes based on needs.  Cryptojacking was already seen on Kubernetes in the past but the entry vectors were either vulnerable web applications  or malicious containers already containing mining malware. In June 2020, a large-scale campaign targeted Kubeflow,  a machine learning toolkit, aiming to infect internet-facing Kubernetes instances and use them for cryptomining at the  victims’ expense. After gaining access to the cluster, they deployed a malicious container to run their XMRig-based  miner.358  5.1.6 Disruption of illegal cryptomining operations  In May 2021, in the United Kingdom, law enforcement terminated a cryptomining operation, and the equipment was  confiscated based on a charge of the theft of electricity. The bust happened in the context of a search warrant for a  suspected cannabis farm.359  Later in May, China decided to ban financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to  cryptocurrency transactions. 360  The initial ban targeted three provinces, which according to research, accounted  together for more than 65% of Bitcoin’s hash rate.361  On the first of July, the security services of Ukraine (SBU) shut down a mining operation running on stolen electricity.  The services acted on the threat to the region's critical infrastructure.362 On the eighth of July, the SBU shut down a  cryptomining operation and seized almost 5,000 computers. The seizure included 3800 game consoles and 500 graphic  cards. The suspects were charged with the theft of electricity. The monthly loss was estimated to be up to USD  250.000.363  353 Bogus Cryptomining Apps Infest Google Play, https://threatpost.com/bogus-cryptomining-apps-google-play/168785/  354 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk/threat-encyclopedia/malware/coinminer.win64.xmrig.yxbd2/  355 https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/windows-and-linux-devices-are-under-attack-by-a-new-cryptomining-worm/  356 Threat Report: Kinsing Cloud Cryptojacker, 2021  357 Sophos - Threat report - 2021  358 Misconfigured Kubeflow workloads are a security risk, https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a- security-risk/  359 Bitcoin ‘mine’ uncovered during industrial unit raid, https://west-midlands.police.uk/news/bitcoin-mine-uncovered-during-industrial-unit-raid  360 China bans financial, payment institutions from cryptocurrency business, https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies- barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/  361 Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, https://cbeci.org/mining_map  362 СБУ знешкодила криптоферму, через яку без світла і води могла залишитися частина Чернігівської області, https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu- zneshkodyla-kryptofermu-cherez-yaku-bez-svitla-i-vody-mohla-zalyshytysia-chastyna-chernihivskoi-oblasti-video  363 SBU exposes massive crypto mining in Ukraine, https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-naibilshu-kryptofermu-v-ukraini-maizhe-5-tys-kompiuteriv- mainyly-hroshi-na-vinnytsiaoblenerho  https://threatpost.com/bogus-cryptomining-apps-google-play/168785/ https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk/threat-encyclopedia/malware/coinminer.win64.xmrig.yxbd2/ https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/windows-and-linux-devices-are-under-attack-by-a-new-cryptomining-worm/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a-security-risk/ https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/10/misconfigured-kubeflow-workloads-are-a-security-risk/ https://west-midlands.police.uk/news/bitcoin-mine-uncovered-during-industrial-unit-raid https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/ https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/ https://cbeci.org/mining_map https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zneshkodyla-kryptofermu-cherez-yaku-bez-svitla-i-vody-mohla-zalyshytysia-chastyna-chernihivskoi-oblasti-video https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zneshkodyla-kryptofermu-cherez-yaku-bez-svitla-i-vody-mohla-zalyshytysia-chastyna-chernihivskoi-oblasti-video https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-naibilshu-kryptofermu-v-ukraini-maizhe-5-tys-kompiuteriv-mainyly-hroshi-na-vinnytsiaoblenerho https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-naibilshu-kryptofermu-v-ukraini-maizhe-5-tys-kompiuteriv-mainyly-hroshi-na-vinnytsiaoblenerho  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  54  In July 2021, the Malaysian authorities reported having seised more than 1,000 bitcoin mining devices and arrested six  persons on charges of theft of electricity over the course of six separate raids.364 They destroyed the devices and put  the images on YouTube, sending a message to other mining operators.  We see an increase in law enforcement operations against (illegal) cryptomining. The cost of energy associated with  bitcoins pushes these mine operations to steal electricity. This practice is not new, as it has been used by farms that  cultivate drugs. Disruptions in these operations will make the actors move to other locations and other means to mine  crypto, such as leveraging infrastructure from compromised devices.  5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following mitigation vectors were mentioned regarding cryptomining related attacks and incidents in the reported  period.   Monitor battery usage on users’ devices and, in the case of suspicious spikes in CPU usage, scan for the  presence of file-based miners.   Implement web filtering of common cryptomining protocols, as well as blacklisting the IP addresses and  domains of popular cryptomining IP pools.   Monitor for network anomalies and block mining protocols.   Install endpoint protection by means of anti-virus programs or crypto-miner blocking browser plug-ins.   Conduct regular security audits to detect network anomalies.   Implement robust vulnerability and patch management to protect against emerging threats and  vulnerabilities.   Implement patches and fixes against well-known exploits.   Use whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed at the endpoints.   Use allow-listing to allow only the execution of known executables on the endpoints.   Monitor and block common cryptomining executables.   Invest in raising users’ awareness of cryptojacking, especially with regard to secure browsing behaviour.   Discuss crypto mining in the context of security awareness training.  364 Police Destroy 1,069 Bitcoin Miners With Big Ass Steamroller In Malaysia, https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv739/police-destroy-1069-bitcoin- miners-with-big-ass-steamroller-in-malaysia  https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv739/police-destroy-1069-bitcoin-miners-with-big-ass-steamroller-in-malaysia https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv739/police-destroy-1069-bitcoin-miners-with-big-ass-steamroller-in-malaysia  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  55  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  56  6. E-MAIL RELATED THREATS  E-mail related threats have been consistently ranking high in the list of prime threats in the ETL for a number of  years. This collection of threats exploits weaknesses in human behaviour concerning e-mails and human habits, and  aims at manipulating humans to fall victims to an attack. E-mail related threats are in general less about the technical  vulnerabilities of information systems, but mostly about end-user awareness and exploitation of the inherent trust  people place on their e-mail communications. This threat canvas consists mainly of the following vectors: phishing,  spear-phishing, whaling, smishing, vishing, business e-mail compromise (BEC) and spam.  Phishing aims at stealing important information like credit card numbers and passwords, through e-mails involving  social engineering and deception. Spear-phishing is a more sophisticated version of phishing that targets specific  organisations or individuals. Whaling is a spear-phishing attack aimed at users in high positions (executives,  politicians etc.). Smishing, a term derived as a combination of \"SMS\" and \"phishing”,365 occurs when financial or  personal information of victims are gathered via the use of SMS messages. Another type of threat related to e-mail is  vishing, a combination of phishing and voice that occurs when information is given via phone, where malicious actors  using social engineering techniques extract sensitive information from users.  Business e-mail compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated scam targeting businesses and organisations, whereby  criminals employ social engineering techniques to gain access to an employee’s or executive’s e-mail account to  initiate bank transfers under fraudulent conditions.366 Finally, spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital  communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often spam is sent via e-mail, but it can also be distributed via text  messages, phone calls, or social media367.  As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to this category of threats, since people’s online presence and  need for communication has greatly risen during this period. Moreover, the digitalisation of many traditional services  grew at an unprecedented rate during the pandemic, and given e-mail’s lead role as a communications means, the  increase in e-mail related threats was undeniable. A list of notable incidents related to e-mail threats can be found in  Annex B.  6.1 TRENDS  6.1.1 COVID-19 still the lure in e-mail threat campaigns  Spam campaigns with COVID-19 related lures were major occurrences throughout the reporting period. In general,  COVID-19 was exploited by adversaries to trick end users into falling victims to various types of e-mail related attacks.  Exploiting the angst concerning the pandemic and the trust that people place on their e-mail as a principal means of  communication, adversaries made use of COVID-19 to spread their campaigns. These campaigns ranged from attempts  to trick users into ordering face masks from phony websites to infecting them with malware via malicious attachments.  Three-quarters of attachments in these e-mails contained infostealers – a type of malware that steals sensitive  information (such as passwords or other credentials).368 As the pandemic continued and the vaccine was released the  lure changed to incorporate that. The campaigns included advertisements or offers for early access to a vaccine upon  payment of a deposit or fee and misinformation regarding the vaccines.369  365 Bank Phishing E-mails, https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/4_ceo-bec_fraud.pdf  366 Europol - IOCTA 2020 - https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf  367 What is spam?

The e-mails try to lead users  to phishing websites that capture their credit information. This attempt has already affected at least 26 countries.370  In 2021, postal services were also used in massive SMS spam messages that spread the Flubot Android malware  across Europe. Malware gangs were sending malicious links to users via SMS posing as legitimate package delivery  services.371  6.1.3 QRishing: new version of an old scheme  Social distancing during the pandemic has popularised QR (Quick Response) codes,372 which are simple to use and  may be pretty simple to generate. Identifying a fake QR message is not straightforward and it creates a suitable  environment for malicious activity. A tactic that has been observed is embedding fake QR codes into phishing e-mails  sent by large European banks. Upon scanning the code, users are directed to websites with realistic-looking landing  pages, where the victim may be prompted to login in order to renew their credit cards.373 A fake QR code also has the  potential to connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network or automatically navigate to a malicious link. Codes may also direct  users to websites where malware can be automatically downloaded. Moreover, public QR codes could also cause a  problem as cybercriminals may swap them out by replacing their own QR codes over genuine ones.  6.1.4 BEC has increased, has grown in sophistication and become more targeted  According to publicly available reports, BEC was the most costly cybercrime type in 2020 during which organisations  reported total losses of more than 1.8 billion dollars374. During the reporting period, it was observed that BEC schemes  have evolved, especially regarding credential phishing and the conversion of money into cryptocurrency.375 As EU  Member States report, there have been many cases where Office 365 accounts have been used for BEC scams. This  implies that the actors have also conducted credential phishing operations or password spraying attacks (a technique  similar to brute force attacks) against the victims376.  Moreover, although cybercriminals target all sectors and businesses, BEC actors show an increased focus on small  and medium-sise enterprises377. Historically, BEC actors were based in Nigeria but recent research has identified  BEC actors in 50 different countries.378 Half of the BEC-related cybercriminals are located in Nigeria (the reduction in  this percentage is due to the efforts of law enforcement) and one-quarter of them are based in the United States.  Moreover, the highly lucrative potential of this type of cybercrime has attracted more sophisticated cybercrime groups  such as Cosmic Lynx379.  Our assessment is that cybercriminals will certainly continue to take advantage of compromised business accounts  and use them to make money through BEC scams. It is also likely that this lucrative type of cybercrime will attract  sophisticated cybercrime actors globally, further diversifying the current geography of BEC actors and increasing the  sophistication of BEC scams.  6.1.5 SMShing and Vishing have increased since users lack the awareness  According to security, new sites,380 381 such as various APTs groups, have started using SMShing and Vishing as part  of their highly targeted campaigns. In recent attacks targeting political opponents, APT-C-23 appeared to have used a  new technique, the use of voice-changing software to pose as women  ̶  the group’s members who have been identified  so far are all men  ̶  to engage victims in conversations. As the conversations continue, the group begin sending videos  loaded with malware to infect the target’s system.381  370Post Office Phishing Hits Credit Card Users in 26 Countries  https://www.trendmicro.com/en_se/research/21/a/post-office-phishing-hits-credit-card-users-in-26-countries.html  371 Despite arrests in Spain, FluBot operations explode across Europe and Japan - The Record by Recorded Future  372 https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/ne-pas-toucher-au-temps-du-covid-19-l-heure-de-gloire-du-qr-code_2131853.html  373 https://www.hoxhunt.com/blog/banking-phishing-qr-codes/  374 https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/anchorage/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-internet-crime-report  375 FBI – Internet Crime Report 2020 - https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf  376 Europol - IOCTA 2020 - https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf  377 https://www.comae.com/posts/keep-office-365-safe-from-bec-when-you-are-an-sme/  378 Agari - The Global Reach of Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) - https://agari.com/e-mail-security-blog/business-e-mail-compromise-geography/  379 Agari – Cosmic Lynx: The Rise of Russian BEC - https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/acid-agari-cosmic-lynx.pdf  380 Iranian cyberspies behind major Christmas SMS spear-phishing campaign | ZDNet  381 APT Group Using Voice Changing Software in Spear-Phishing Campaign | SecurityWeek.Com  https://www.trendmicro.com/en_se/research/21/a/post-office-phishing-hits-credit-card-users-in-26-countries.html https://therecord.media/despite-arrests-in-spain-flubot-operations-explode-across-europe-and-japan/ https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/ne-pas-toucher-au-temps-du-covid-19-l-heure-de-gloire-du-qr-code_2131853.html https://www.hoxhunt.com/blog/banking-phishing-qr-codes/ https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/anchorage/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-internet-crime-report https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/internet_organised_crime_threat_assessment_iocta_2020.pdf https://www.comae.com/posts/keep-office-365-safe-from-bec-when-you-are-an-sme/ https://agari.com/e-mail-security-blog/business-e-mail-compromise-geography/ https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/whitepapers/acid-agari-cosmic-lynx.pdf https://www.zdnet.com/article/iranian-cyberspies-behind-major-christmas-sms-spear-phishing-campaign/?&web_view=true https://www.securityweek.com/apt-group-using-voice-changing-software-spear-phishing-campaign?&web_view=true  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  58  In another instance Charming Kitten, (also known as APT35 or Phosphorus), used the 2021 holiday season to attack  targets from all over the world using a spear-phishing campaign that involved both e-mails and SMS messages. While  the SMS messages posed as Google security alerts, the e-mails used previously hacked accounts. The common  indicator in both campaigns was that Charming Kitten operators managed to successfully hide their attacks behind a  legitimate Google URL.380  In general, users are used to the idea of not clicking on suspicious e-mails, but still are not aware that they can also  be phished via text messages or phone calls.  6.1.6 Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS)  Microsoft’s recent analysis of the Bullet ProofLink campaign suggests that this operation is responsible for many of the  phishing campaigns that have had an impact on organisations. BulletProofLink (also referred to as BulletProftLink or  Anthrax by its operators in various websites, ads, and other promotional materials) is used by multiple malicious  actors in either one-off or monthly subscription-based business models, creating a steady revenue stream for its  operators382.  Similar to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), phishing-as-a-service follows the software-as-a-service model. Attackers  pay an operator to develop and deploy large portions of or complete phishing campaigns from false sign-in page  development, website hosting, and credential parsing and redistribution, outsourcing capabilities that they may be  lacking.  6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following mitigation vectors were discussed regarding e-mail related attacks and incidents during the reporting period.   Provide regular user training on how to identify suspicious links and attachments and how to report them.383 384  385   Implement spam filters at the e-mail gateways; keep signatures and rules updated.389 Whenever possible, use  a secure e-mail gateway with automated maintenance of filters (anti-spam, anti-malware, policy-based filtering).   Put security controls into place on the e-mail gateway to reduce the frequency or possibility of the lures arriving  to your employees’ inboxes.386   Implement a need-to-know access policy to limit the impact of any compromise.387   Consult the MITRE ATT&CK® framework for the tactics of adversaries and techniques pertaining to  cybersecurity threats.388   Ensure e-mails originating from outside the organisation are automatically marked before received.389   Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) to accounts.390   Check the lifespan of a suspected malicious domain and its ownership. If it has been active for less than a year,  it could be a scam.   Whenever possible, apply security solutions that use machine-learning techniques to identify phishing sites in  real-time.   Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at the mail  clients and update them frequently.391  382 https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/21/catching-the-big-fish-analyzing-a-large-scale-phishing-as-a-service-operation/  383 Lessons in Cybersecurity: How education coped in the shift to distance learning, https://www.malwarebytes.com/resources/resource/malwarebytes- labs/lessons-in-cybersecurity-how-education-coped-in-the-shift-to-distance-learning  384 2020 Cyber Threats Report, https://www.netwrix.com/download/collaterals/2020_Cyber_Threats_Report.pdf  385 Attack Landscape H1 2020, https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/17142720/F-Secure-attack-landscape-h12020.pdf  386 Cyber Threat Landscape: Monthly Update For CIO/CISO, https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ca/pdf/2020/11/cyber-threat-landscape-report-nov- 2020-en.pdf  387 Cyber Threat Landscape Report 2020, https://www.ensigninfosecurity.com/analysis-insights/content/2020/05/18/cyber-threat-landscape-report-2020  388 Cyberthreats: A 20-Year Retrospective, https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophos-cyberthreats-20-year- retrospective-wp.pdf  389 HHS Cybersecurity Program APT and Cybercriminal Targeting of HCS, https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/apt-and-cybercriminal-targeting-of- hcs.pdf  390 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2021, https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence  391 What is phishing?

Threat actors usually register fake domains that are similar to legitimate ones and use them to ‘phish’ their  targets. Looking only for an HTTPS connection is not enough.396   Use a strong and unique password for every online service. Re-using the same password for various services  is a serious security issue and should be always avoided. Using strong and unique credentials for every online  service limits the risk of a potential account takeover to only the affected service. Using a password manager  software will make managing of the whole set of passwords easier.397   Check how contact, registration, subscription, and feedback forms work on your website and add verification  rules if necessary, so that they cannot be exploited by attackers.398   Implement content filtering to locate unwanted attachments, e-mails with malicious content, spam, and unwanted  network traffic.   Avoid responding to new links received in e-mails or SMS messages by unknown senders and, most of all, do  not enter your credentials when following such links.  392 Guidance Using Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) in your organisation,  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-mail-security-standards/domain-based-message-authentication-reporting-and-conformance-dmarc  393 Sender Policy Framework Project Overview, http://www.open-spf.org/  394 What is DMARC? https://dmarc.org/  395 DomainKeys Identified Mail, http://www.dkim.org/  396 What is a Look-alike Domain? https://www.phishlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-look-alike-domain/  397 How to create a strong password, https://blog.avast.com/strong-password-ideas  398 Tricky 'Forms' of Phishing, https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/i/tricky-forms-of-phishing.html  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/email-security-standards/domain-based-message-authentication-reporting-and-conformance-dmarc http://www.open-spf.org/ https://dmarc.org/ http://www.dkim.org/ https://www.phishlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-look-alike-domain/ https://blog.avast.com/strong-password-ideas https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/i/tricky-forms-of-phishing.html  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  60  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  61  7. THREATS AGAINST DATA  Threats against data form a collection of threats that target data sources with the aim of gaining unauthorised access,  disclosure, misinformation, disinformation, etc. They are mainly referred to as data breaches or data leaks and refer to  the release of sensitive, confidential or protected data to an untrusted environment. Data breaches can occur as a  result of a cyber-attack, an insider job, unintentional loss or exposure of data. Data exfiltration or data theft is a  technique that is used by malicious actors to target, copy, and transfer sensitive data. A particular case of the use of  exfiltrated data is identity theft, where malicious actors use personal identifiable information (PII) to impersonate a  user.  Threats against data consistently rank high among the leading threats of the ETL and this trend continues in the  reporting period of the ETL 2021. Adversaries explore a series of new techniques and exploit the increasing online  presence and use of online services by the general public. Moreover, given the significance of data and in particular of  private and sensitive data, adversaries are combining more sophisticated threats to target data, such as ransomware  or supply chain attacks. It is noteworthy that in the ENISA threat landscape for supply chains,399 for about 58% of the  supply chain incidents analysed, the customer assets targeted were predominantly customer data, including  personally identifiable information (PII) data and intellectual property.  Numerous incidents related to threats against data took place during the reporting period of ETL 2021. Figure 8 shows  the incidents observed based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA for the purposes of situational  awareness.400 The scope of the collection is global and multi-sectorial. Incidents, however, with a direct impact in the  EU area are given priority. We observed an increasing trend in the number of incidents reported during 2021. This  observation relates primarily to the surge of data breaches in the health sector (see trends below). Notable incidents  related to threats against data can be found in Annex B.  Figure 8: Incidents related to threats against data observed by ENISA (April 2020-July 2021)  399399 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-the-increase-in-supply-chain-security-attacks  400 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN )  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-the-increase-in-supply-chain-security-attacks https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  62  7.1 TRENDS  Considering data breaches,401 the industry sectors suffering the most from internal errors are finance and insurance,  public administration, healthcare and information. In the financial sector, 44% of the breaches are caused by internal  actors, whose actions are, most of time, due to errors. It is noteworthy that internal actors have been growing  constantly from 2018 in this industrial sector, while external actors have been decreasing at the same rate, to the  point where the two are very close. In the public administration sector, social engineering is the primary pattern (70%),  with errors the second pattern (15%) where misconfiguration and mis-delivery account for most errors. In the  healthcare sector, errors are the primary cause, with the top three specific errors being mis-delivery, publishing errors  and misconfiguration. Finally, in the information sector, basic web application attacks, errors and system intrusion are  the main patterns, together accounting for 83% of all breaches. Misconfiguration covers the vast majority of all the  breaches caused by errors (>70%).  According to Verizon,401 85% of data breaches involve a human element. This can be easily explained by considering  that both social engineering and miscellaneous errors are among the main patterns. Breaches caused by errors differ  with respect to other breaches in the variety of data being disclosed. Altogether, the most disclosed data are  credentials (60%) and personal data (50%), while in breaches caused by errors the most disclosed are personal data  (80%).  Most of breaches caused by errors are discovered within days or hours.401 This claim can be explained by the fact  that people quickly realise the errors they have made. Taking a more general look, the discovery time for breaches of  every nature, broken down into organisation sise, show that enterprise-sised organisation do perform better than  SMEs, discovering breaches within days in 55% of the cases. SMEs, instead, discover breaches within days in 47%  of the cases. These results show that enterprises have significantly improved their performance, while SMEs have  basically stayed the same as in 2019.  7.1.1 Threat actors shifted their attention towards COVID-19 vaccine information  Vaccine information became the centre of a few cyberespionage campaigns during the reporting period. In July 2020,  the UK foreign secretary issued warnings about active large-scale phishing campaigns which appeared to specifically  target COVID-19 research facilities and were believed to be sponsored by nation-states.402 Later in 2020, phishing  schemes with credential harvesting capabilities were found targeting organisations globally, with the intention to  extract information regarding the transportation and distribution processes of the vaccines.403 At the end of 2020,  AstraZeneca employees where spear-phished404 and the incident was attributed to state-sponsored APT groups.  Lastly, at the end of 2020 the EMA was targeted and documents concerning the validation process of Pfiser and  Moderna vaccines were accessed and leaked to the internet405.  7.1.2 Surge in healthcare sector data breaches  Healthcare data breaches are increasing rapidly (see Figure 14). This can be interpreted in a couple of ways. Due to  the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare sector was put on the spotlight and threat actors took advantage of this crisis  to hit an already suffering sector. In addition, due to the pandemic, a shift towards the online provisioning of  healthcare services, remote eHealth and telemedicine approaches increased and thus the opportunities for  adversaries to exfiltrate medical data increased greatly.  Moreover, the motivation for adversaries to access and exploit medical data is much higher than other types of data. A  credit card for example can be easily cancelled, so the perceived value of having the data related to a card is much  lower compared to medical records, which contain information, such as a patient’s medical and behavioural health  history and demographics, as well as their health insurance and contact information.  401 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  402 UK condemns Russian Intelligence Services over vaccine cyber-attacks, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence- services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks  403 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2021, https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence  404 https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/cyber-attack-on-astrazeneca-COVID-19-vaccine-research/  405 https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-6  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence-services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russian-intelligence-services-over-vaccine-cyber-attacks https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/cyber-attack-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-research/ https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/cyberattack-ema-update-6  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  63  The increase in healthcare related incidents is also visible in relevant mandatory reporting in the US406 that require  victims to report the breaches. A similar trend is also observed in ENISA OSINT trend analysis as seen in Figure 9.  Figure 9: Data related incidents in healthcare as observed through OSINT by ENISA via situational awareness  7.1.3 Data breaches in the business environment rise  According to SANS Institute, in the last few years, approximately 74,000 employees, contractors, and suppliers were  impacted by a data breach due to stolen company laptops.407 This was exacerbated by the fact that data were not  encrypted. In a 2021 study of 300 respondents - including top managers at US companies with over 5,000 employees  in the most important business domains408 - 34% of respondents has been the target of a theft of property or supply  chain damage due to insiders abusing their privileges. Among observed physical threats, 27% of the respondents  mentioned “insiders abusing authorised cyber and physical access points” in a list of the top-three physical threats,  26% “supply chain damage and/or disruptions”, and 23% “onsite theft/burglary”.  7.1.4 Motivations and attack vectors remain the same  During the reporting period, trends related to the motivations of adversaries as well as the main attack vectors  remained generally the same. Phishing continues to be on the top causes of breaches (36%), as it has been for the  past two years. It is followed by the use of stolen credentials (25%) and ransomware (10%).409 As in past years,  financially motivated attacks continue to be the most common. Nearly 80% of cyberattacks are for financial gain, such  as stealing money directly from financial accounts, stealing credit card information or other types of data that can be  monetised, or demanding ransom. In second place is espionage, which often involves the theft of intellectual property  or other confidential information409  7.1.5 Identity theft and synthetic identity  Due to the increase in data breaches in previous years, personal and sensitive data has been easily accessible to  malicious actors via online forums and the dark web. This has had a cascading effect on identity theft. According to the  US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), complaints of identity theft rose in 2020 compared to the year before.410 About a  third of these involved US government benefits.

A lot of these incidents could have involved synthetic identities. Synthetic identity theft is a type of fraud in which  criminals combine real and fake information to create a new identity. Incidents with synthetic identities tend to be more  common in the United States because of static personally identifiable information, which is used to verify someone’s  identity, according to the Federal Reserve412.  7.1.6  Actors taking advantage of bad user behaviour in order to commit identity abuse  The Identity Theft Resource Centre reported in early 2021 that the motivation of cybercriminals has shifted and instead  of targeting consumers in order to steal large amounts of personal information they have started taking advantage of  bad user behaviour413 that are then used against organisations. A typical example involves stolen credentials.  As reported by CERT-EU, “identity abuse essentially consists of using valid accounts and legitimate applications to  perpetrate malicious activities in a persistent and stealthy way. Attackers abuse the inherent trust in any action  associated  with authenticated users or authorised applications. Identity abuse can be seen as an extension of the  living-off-the land  (LOTL)  tactic  where  an  attacker  makes  use  of  legitimate  tools  to  remain  undetected,  whereas,  through identity abuse, the attacker will additionally make use of legitimate accounts. Observed tactics  showed  the  unprecedented  level  of  sophistication  the  adversaries  leveraged  to  abuse  their  victims’ identities for  lateral movement and stealthy operations. They remained undetected for more than six months in the network of  hundreds of compromised organisations”. 414 In the SolarWinds Orion campaign, the adversaries abused the high-  privileged accounts the application uses; these accounts ultimately underpin identity in an organisation’s environment.  7.1.7 Rising Impact of Supply Chain Attacks  As reported in ENISA’s dedicated threat landscape for supply chains, based on the trends and patterns observed,  supply chain attacks increased in number and sophistication in the year 2020 and this trend is continuing in 2021,  posing an increasing risk for organisations. It is estimated that there will be four times more supply chain attacks in  2021 than in 2020. With half of the attacks being attributed to Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) actors, their  complexity and resources greatly exceed the more common non-targeted attacks and, therefore, there is an  increasing need for new protective methods that incorporate suppliers in order to guarantee that organisations remain  secure.  Around 58% of the supply chain attacks were aimed at gaining access to data (predominantly customer data,  including personal data and intellectual property) and around 16% at gaining access to people. When it comes to  suppliers’ data, 20% of attacks were aimed at gaining access to that data and 66% to their source code.  7.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  The following mitigation vectors were mentioned regarding data related attacks and incidents in the reporting period.   Develop and maintain a cybersecurity awareness plan. Provide training and simulation scenarios for  identifying social engineering and phishing campaigns for employees.415   Limit user access privileges under the need-to-know principle. Revoke access privileges to anyone who is not  an employee416.   Establish and maintain an incident response team and evaluate incident response plans frequently.417   Discover and classify sensitive/personal data and apply measures for encrypting such data in transit and at  rest. In other words, deploy data loss prevention capabilities.  411 COVID + Credit: New Scams Put Identity at Risk during the COVID-19 Pandemic, https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/COVID-19/prevent- identity-theft-coronavirus-scams/  412 https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/frs-synthetic-identity-payments-fraud-white-paper-july-2019.pdf  413 https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches-are-up-38-percent-in-q2-2021-the-identity-theft-resource-center-predicts-a-new-all-time-high-by-years- end/  414 https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU-Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf#page=13&zoom=auto,-274,51  415 Discover security awareness trends and best practices for 2021, https://terranovasecurity.com/how-to-build-a-strong-security-awareness-program-in- 2021/  416 Need to Know Access Control Guideline, https://security.berkeley.edu/need-know-access-control-guideline  417 Incident Response Team: What are the Roles and Responsibilities?, https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource-center/ebook/insider-guide-to-incident- response/arming-your-incident-response-team  https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/covid-19/prevent-identity-theft-coronavirus-scams/ https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/covid-19/prevent-identity-theft-coronavirus-scams/ https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/wp-content/uploads/frs-synthetic-identity-payments-fraud-white-paper-july-2019.pdf https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches-are-up-38-percent-in-q2-2021-the-identity-theft-resource-center-predicts-a-new-all-time-high-by-years-end/ https://www.idtheftcenter.org/data-breaches-are-up-38-percent-in-q2-2021-the-identity-theft-resource-center-predicts-a-new-all-time-high-by-years-end/ https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2021/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU-Threat_Landscape_Report-Volume1.pdf#page=13&zoom=auto,-274,51 https://terranovasecurity.com/how-to-build-a-strong-security-awareness-program-in-2021/ https://terranovasecurity.com/how-to-build-a-strong-security-awareness-program-in-2021/ https://security.berkeley.edu/need-know-access-control-guideline https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource-center/ebook/insider-guide-to-incident-response/arming-your-incident-response-team https://cybersecurity.att.com/resource-center/ebook/insider-guide-to-incident-response/arming-your-incident-response-team  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  65   Increase investments related to detection, alerting tools and ability to contain and respond to a data breach.   Develop and maintain strong policies enforcing strong passwords (password management) and usage of multi-  factor authentication (MFAs).   Consider models that take the least privileged approach to provide security for both on premises and off  premises resources (i.e. zero-trust).   Invest in and create policies and plans for engaging with governance, risk management and compliance teams.   Store data only on secure IT assets.   Educate and train the personnel periodically.   Use technology tools to avoid possible data leaks, such as vulnerability scans, malware scans and data loss  prevention (DLP) tools. Deploy data and portable system and device encryption, and secure gateways.   A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is critical in the event of a data breach. This plan outlines the type of data  being stored, their location and what potential liabilities could emerge when implementing data security and  recovery actions. A BCP entails an effective incident response, which aims at addressing, managing, and  rectifying the damages due to such an incident.   Apply ‘threat hunting’ within a company to strengthen security plans. Threat hunting is conducted by skilled  members of the Security Operation Centre (SOC) team to proactively identify vulnerabilities and prevent  breaches.   Policies such as velocity-based rules can be used to mitigate identity fraud, especially for payment card  transactions. The machine data of valid transactions can provide sufficient information for the optimal policy  definition.   The Single Sign On (SSO) authentication method, when available, allows a user to access several  applications with the same set of digital credentials. It is highly recommended to minimise the number of user  accounts and stored credentials using SSO.   URLs that are sent via e-mail or are randomly visited should first be checked based on their IP address, the  ASN that associates with the IP, the owner of the domain and the relation between this domain and others,  before any further step is taken.   Organisations that are adopting cloud services should have strong cloud security operations and prefer an  architecture of on-premises storages, private cloud storages and public cloud storages simultaneously to  protect their customer’s personal information.   Use strong and updated encryption methods such as TLS 1.3 (uses ephemeral keys) for sensitive data to  prevent hacking.   Adequately protect all identity documents and copies (physical or digital ones) against unauthorised access.   Identity information should not be disclosed to unsolicited recipients and their requests by phone, e-mail or in  person should not be answered.   Install and use content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, mails with malicious content, spam and  unwanted network traffic.   Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions.

THREATS AGAINST AVAILABILITY  AND INTEGRITY  Availability and integrity are the target of a plethora of threats and attacks, among which the families of Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS) and Web Attacks stand out.  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) targets system and data availability, and though it is not a new threat (it  celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019) it remains a significant threat in the cyber landscape.418 419 Attacks occur  when users of a system or service are not able to access relevant information, services or other resources. This can  be accomplished by exhausting the service or overloading the component of the network infrastructure420.  Web-based attacks mainly target data integrity and availability. They are an attractive method by which threat actors  can delude victims using web systems and services as the threat vector. This covers a vast attack surface, for  instance facilitating malicious URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) or malicious scripts to direct the user or victim to the  desired website or downloading malicious content (watering hole attacks, drive-by attacks) and injecting malicious  code into a legitimate but compromised website to steal information (i.e. formjacking) for financial gain, information  stealing or even extortion via ransomware421.  DDoS and web-based attacks are often coordinated activities. DDoS attacks can be built on a web-based attack, which  are often distributed through web applications. For instance, web-based attacks can be adopted to build a botnet that  is then used to carry out a denial of service attack aimed to make a system unavailable.  8.1 TRENDS  Both web attacks and DDoS attacks have remained stable over the years, while some interesting points on their  evolution may be noted. According to EUROPOL, “the threat potential of DDoS attacks is higher than its current impact  in the EU.”419 Notable incidents for these two types of attacks can found in Annex B.  8.1.1 Ransom Denial of Service (RDoS) is the new trend of DDoS attacks  During 2020, Ransom DDoS (RDDoS) campaigns got a substantial boost from August 2020 onwards, with hacking  groups such as Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear, Lazarus Group, and Armada Collective carrying out these campaigns.  Targeted sectors include e-commerce, finance, and travel on a global scale.422 Extortion attacks have also  experienced a boost in terms of numbers and dimensions, reaching capacities of 500Gbps in 2020.423  Ransom Denial of Service substantially reduces the need of resources to carry out an attack. Cybercriminals analyse  target businesses to find those with weak and vulnerable systems. They then blackmail these businesses by asking a  ransom so as not to attack the system424 425.

Infecting a target with malware or ransomware  would otherwise require more effort in terms of time and planning426.  RDDoS comes in two flavours: i) attack-first, ii) extortion first. In the first case, a DDoS attack is implemented and a  ransom is requested to stop it. In the second case, an extortion letter and proof in the form of a small-scale DoS is  sent with a request to pay a ransom. RDDoS attacks are even more dangerous than traditional DDoS since they can  be completed even if the attacker does not have sufficient resources.427  8.1.2 COVID-19 Pandemic has been used as an amplifier  DDoS attacks were boosted substantially in 2020 due to COVID-19 with more than 10 million attacks428 (1.6 million  more than 2019) and a 22% increase in attack frequency in the last 6 months of 2020. In March 2020, a new norm  began with over 800,000 DDoS attacks registered, an average of 839,083 attacks per month over the year and with  more than 929,000 attacks in May 2020. Global DDoS extortion attacks also increased by 125% becoming one of the  most critical approaches to DDoS.429  In addition, videoconferencing and remote collaboration software, such as Microsoft Teams, Skype or Zoom,  experienced a peak of usage. However, their usage comes with some concerns. First, these tools are often built on  weak communications possibly leading to attacks. Then, their high demand in terms of bandwidth can stress the  network.430 Furthermore, the massive adoption of remote working increased the risk for organisations of becoming a  target of a DDoS attack. In addition, the bandwidth originally devoted to counteracting DDoS is currently used for  remote working, reducing an enterprise’s ability to defend itself against a DDoS attack.431 In this context, the impact of  DDoS attacks against RDPs and virtual private networks (VPNs) increased with the pandemic.422  Due to COVID-19, malicious actors increasingly targeted home networks as a starting point for more complex attacks,  making DNS not only an attack vector but also a target of attacks. According to Neustar (NISC Survey, Q4 2020),  Domain Hijacking (31%) has been the most observed DNS threat, followed by DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning (27%),  DNS Tunnelling (26%), and Zombie Domain Attacks (18%).426  8.1.3 Cybercrime-as-a-Service works as an amplifier of web-based and  DoS attacks  Cybercrime-as-a-Service is becoming a cornerstone for spreading DDoS, opening the door of DDoS to a wider  population of attackers. Illegal online markets providing accesses to attack tools and services, as well as fast internet  connections are further supporting cybercriminals in driving more complex and sophisticated campaigns, and  disruptive attacks.423 State-sponsored actors aim to develop their capabilities to disrupt critical infrastructure and  conduct espionage against businesses, academia, and governments to steal intellectual property.  DDoS is increasingly implemented using cybercrime-as-a-service: a criminal pays for a DDoS attack-as-a-  service and the paid service launches the DDoS attack.432 423 These services reduce the effort needed to manage  high-volume and complex attacks, making DDoS adaptive, lightweight, and heterogeneous. DDoS is increasingly  targeting smaller businesses and requiring less financial and technical resources. Potentially disruptive attacks can  target third-party providers (e.g. financial, energy and telecommunication services), with cascading effects in the  supply chain.419 433  Cybercrime-as-a-Service in fact provides a set of online tools and services that simplify the execution of targeted  attacks.

DDoS-For-Hire-Services are among the  most adopted tools for cyberattacks.432 In general, we may note that DDoS attacks are today mostly multivector and  amplified by COVID-19. They also show a boost in dimension and impact, while impacting almost all businesses’  domains thanks to the rise of extortion attacks.434 Finally, according to research conducted by Digital Shadows, “three  main trends that can be expected to persist throughout 2021 include leveraging IoT devices, offering DDoS service  solutions, and DDoS extortion.”435  8.1.4 Traditional DDoS is moving towards mobile networks and IoT  The success of internet of things (IoT) in conjunction with 5G is resulting in a new wave of DDoS attacks,  possibly inducing victims to pay a ransom.436 On one hand, 5G makes IoT more vulnerable to cyberattacks,  supporting localised DDoS where an attacker interferes with the connectivity of a specific area covered by a slice  through a set of compromised devices.437 On the other hand, IoT can be used as a threat vector for DDoS. Attackers  can build massive botnets to launch DDoS attacks or distribute malware.438 This is particularly critical in Industrial IoT  (IIoT), where device vulnerabilities can disrupt business operations and cause significant damage (e.g. in the health  domain, vulnerable medical devices can affect people’s safety).439  Sensors and devices are in fact a suitable target of DDoS attacks due to their limited resources that often result in  poor security protection. Devices are simple to corrupt, often coming with misconfigurations (e.g. weak passwords).419  At the same time, the increasing complexity of these mobile systems makes users’ shortage of security skills  increasingly pertinent. In this context, DDoS aims to threaten the availability of components, as well as disrupt the  operation of other networks or systems. It also has the potential to threaten the safety of users.  The increasing  number of devices and applications connected to the cloud gives adversaries a larger playing field on which to target  attacks.  Lack of industry standards, network capabilities, and hardware can challenge service uptime and  reliability.440 This problem is exacerbated in IIoT, where vulnerabilities in third-party software components clearly  point to a lack of standardisation and safe coding guidelines.439  8.1.5 New amplifiers and advanced sophistication for DDoS attacks emerge  Sharing of resources in virtualised environments acts as an amplifier of DDoS attacks.437 Physical resource  overloading can cause disruption in communications, services, and access to data.  DDoS attackers are adopting intelligent strategies based on technically advanced and smart attacks. In 2020-21,  smart attacks used publicly available information to monitor the countermeasures adopted by their targets and adapt  their attack strategies at run time.418 In this context, the duration of short attacks decreased, while the duration of long  attacks increased. 441 Focusing on absolute numbers, the number of short attacks had a sharp increase in Q1 2021,  while long attacks decreased though their overall duration increased589. 441 Sharing the same view, Akamai, at the end  of March 2021, observed more attacks over 50 Gbps than during the whole of 2019. Even more important, in the first  quarter of 2021, they recorded three of the six biggest DDoS attacks by volume, including the two largest known  DDoS extortion attacks.442  434 Jai Vijayan, DDoS Attacks Spiked, Became More Complex in 2020, December 2020, https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attacks- spiked-became-more-complex-in-2020/d/d-id/1339814  435 H-ISAC.

Furthermore, some DDoS threats build on TCP-based attacks, including TCP  SYN and fragmented packet floods. NEUSTAR shares the view that the majority of attack vectors for DDoS attacks  focus on UDP protocols, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP), Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access  Protocol (CLDAP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Domain Name System (DNS).  NETSCOUT, with its intelligent threat report, provided a detailed discussion of DDoS threat vectors. It claimed that the  total number of vectors for individual attacks increased substantially, culminating in an attack composed of 26 attack  vectors in 2020. Multi-vector attacks are mostly in the range 15-25 vectors and showed an increase in cardinality  between 9% and 312%, with the most notable growth in the range of 15-21 vectors.444  8.1.7  Smaller organisations are being targeted  DDoS is increasingly targeting small enterprises by building on the rental of skill and tools to implement attacks  (Cybercrime-as-a-Service).445  This finding was previously discussed in IOCTA 2020, claiming that cybercriminals  increasingly target smaller organisations with lower security standards, ensuring successful attacks with smaller  volumes of data and maximum revenue. Public institutions and critical infrastructures remain among the main targets  of DDoS attacks.419  Kaspersky, instead, monitored DDoS activities in 2020-21, focusing on trends in quarters446,447,448. In particular, in Q2  2020 (probably due to the pandemic), the number of attacks were more than the triple the same period of 2019. In Q3  2020, figures came back to normality and the number of attacks dropped around one third compared to Q2 2020 (with  an increase of 50% compared to Q3 2019). In Q4 2020, the number of attacks dropped further by around one third  compared to Q3 2020 (with comparable numbers with respect to Q4 2019). In Q1 2021, the attacks increased by  more than 40% compared to Q4 2020. This increase was mostly observed in January (with peaks of 1,800 attacks per  day) and, according to Kaspersky, was linked to the price of cryptocurrencies. In general, the increase in DDoS  attacks in 2020 and 2021 was also due to COVID-19 and remote working, which provided a plethora of new  vulnerable targets.  8.1.8 Increased combination of web-based and DDoS attacks  Recalling that DDoS and web-based attacks are often coordinated activities, web applications are still vulnerable to  web-related threats, such as injections and cross-site scripting, and can become a vector for DDoS attacks. According  to a recent report449, SQL injection vulnerabilities and PHP injection vulnerabilities are the most commonly exploited,  though XSS is the most discovered vulnerability. According to the Verizon 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report  (DBIR),450 cross-site scripting (XSS) traffic experienced a substantial increase in Q4 2020; blocked cross-site scripting  (XSS) traffic nearly doubled in volume from Q2 2020 to Q4 2020, with more than 15 million attacks, representing 10%  of blocked traffic.451 Furthermore, 43% of all data breaches involved a web application and around 90% of all hacking  443 Neustar Security, Cyber Threats & Trends: Securing Your Network Pandemic-Style, 2020,  https://www.cdn.neustar/resources/whitepapers/security/neustar-cyber-threats-trends-2020-report.pdf  444 NETSCOUT, NETSCOUT THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT, DDoS in a Time of Pandemic, 2020, https://www.netscout.com/threatreport  445 Emma Woollacott, Surge in malware and cyber-attacks set to continue, Europol warns in SOCTA 2021 report, April 2021,  https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/surge-in-malware-and-cyber-attacks-set-to-continue-europol-warns-in-socta-2021-report  446 Oleg Kupreev, Ekaterina Badovskaya, Alexander Gutnikov, DDoS attacks in Q4 2020, February 2021, https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q4- 2020/100650/  447 Oleg Kupreev, Ekaterina Badovskaya, Alexander Gutnikov, DDoS attacks in Q2 2020, August 2020, https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q2- 2020/98077/  448 Oleg Kupreev, Ekaterina Badovskaya, Alexander Gutnikov, DDoS attacks in Q3 2020, October 2020, https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3- 2020/99171/  449 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2020, 2020  450 David Warburton, F5 Labs, DDoS Attack Trends for 2020, May 2021, https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ddos-attack-trends-for-2020  451  Verizon, Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in Q4 2020: Trends and best practices, March 2021, https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/cross- site-scripting-attacks-trends-and-best-practices/  https://www.cdn.neustar/resources/whitepapers/security/neustar-cyber-threats-trends-2020-report.pdf https://www.netscout.com/threatreport https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/surge-in-malware-and-cyber-attacks-set-to-continue-europol-warns-in-socta-2021-report https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q4-2020/100650/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q4-2020/100650/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q2-2020/98077/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q2-2020/98077/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3-2020/99171/ https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3-2020/99171/ https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ddos-attack-trends-for-2020 https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-attacks-trends-and-best-practices/ https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-attacks-trends-and-best-practices/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  71  vectors targeted web applications.449 The latter data was also confirmed in the Verizon 2021 Data Breach  Investigations Report (DBIR).452  8.1.9 Trends on classifying DDoS attacks  The geographical spread of DDoS attacks in 2020-21 depends on attack classification, though some commonalities  emerge446 447:   China and USA are always mentioned in the first two places both as targets and sources of DDoS attacks.   Netherlands, Germany and France are often at the top places in the EU as targets and sources of DDoS  attacks.   In 2021, Canada, Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Germany, Brazil and Australia had sharp increases as  sources of attacks, with Canada moving to spot #3. Similarly, Great Britain, Germany, France, Brazil and  Australia experienced sharp increase as targets of attacks, with The Netherlands moving to spot #3. Also,  unexpectedly, Poland entered the top ten.   According to Cloudflare, Malaysia and India are the #3 and #4 source countries, while Morocco became the  #3 target country.453  Concerning the sector spread, Akamai monitored data from 2017 to the end of 2020 and observed an increase in the  number of DDoS attacks over the 50 Gbps threshold. Moreover, a general increase in attacks in 7 out of 11 of the  analysed sectors was observed with a sharp increase in Business Services (960%), Education (180%), Financial  Services (190%), Retail & Consumer Goods (445%), and Software & Technology (196%).454  Confirming these results, F5 labs claimed, “the education sector saw a large increase in DDoS attacks in January  2021, with more than 56% of all education incidents for the past 15 months occurring in Q1 2021”. Concerning the  domains attacked, technology, telecommunications, and finance are in the first three places, while if we compare the  number of attacks with the average attack sise, healthcare is the most critical domain.455  8.1.10 Web-based attack main trends persist  Web Attacks includes threats, such as injection and application malfunctioning, affecting IT systems in their entirety.  Modern IT systems are based on services composed at run time, which can be the target of attacks and breaches.  These services often expose a standard API interface (e.g. REST, RPC) and interact on virtual networks or  orchestration platforms, introducing new security challenges to cope with. At the same time, “traditional” (i.e. desktop,  client-side) applications suffer from long-standing issues that are still a source of bugs and attacks. Though web  attacks have remained stable over the years, we can note some interesting points as follows.   Security Misconfiguration. Unpatched software, use of default accounts or unused pages are the preferred  means exploited by attackers to bypass security protections and gain unauthorised access to systems.456  These holes can be found at all layers of a system and are difficult to manage.   Automated brute force, dictionary, and session management attacks are increasingly adopted.456 For  instance, Remote Desktop Protocols (RDPs) are exploited by attackers for malware infection; to do this,  attackers search for specific open ports in order to implement brute force attacks.   Cyber-attackers are turning security defences into weapons. For instance, secure channels can be used  to cover malware distribution, to disrupt secured transactions, and for data exfiltration.456   Untrusted compositions. Composite services are increasingly composed of atomic services to provide  advanced functionalities, while introducing new risks that go beyond the risks faced by atomic services.457  On one hand, composite services can increase the risk of data breaches by combining the different sources  452 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  453 Vivek Ganti, Omer Yoachimik, DDoS attack trends for 2021 Q1, April 2021, https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attack-trends-for-2021-q1/  454 Tom Emmons, PART I: Retrospective 2020: ddos was back -- bigger and badder than ever before, https://blogs.akamai.com/2021/01/part-i- retrospective-2020-ddos-was-back-bigger-and-badder-than-ever-before.html  455 David Warburton, F5 Labs, DDoS Attack Trends for 2020, May 2021, https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/ddos-attack-trends-for-2020  456 H2020 EU Project CONCORDIA, Deliverable D4.1 - 1st year report on cybersecurity threats, https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp- content/uploads/2020/06/D4.1_Ready_for_Submission_D4.1-final_revised.pdf  457 M.

On the other hand, the composition of atomic services could entail an endemic risk  related to the fact that the strength of a composite application is the one of its weakest link.458   Many of the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities are due to misconfigurations459, an issue discussed in  Chapter 10 of the ETL 2021. Injection and cross-site scripting (respectively number 1 and number 7 in the list  of the OWASPs most critical web application security risks) exploit system misconfigurations, such as  insufficient data validation. In addition, default configurations are often insecure and cause web-based  attacks. Finally, a lack of server-side verification or access controls introduces a level of risk, especially when  auxiliary services are requested.   According to the OWASP459, web-based attacks exploit components with known vulnerabilities. Also,  they benefit from insufficient logging and monitoring.  8.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  Both DDoS and web-based attacks are long-standing threats and several mitigation measures are well known and  established. In summary, we present in the following some fundamental mitigation vectors for DDoS and web-based  attacks, with a particular focus on trends that emerged during the reporting period.   A denial-of-service response plan is fundamental for organisations where resilience is a priority and should  integrate system checklists, response teams, and efficient communication and escalation procedures.   The security process should be a continuous activity that follows and adapts system and network evolutions  and life cycles.435   Collaboration and coordination between relevant organisations is important to multiply and strengthen  mitigation efforts.   Implement DDoS protection using an on-premises solution, DDoS scrubbing service, or a hybrid solution.455   Use both network and web application firewalls443. The first can be coupled with approaches mitigating  peaked traffic such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN), a load balancer and scalable resources. The latter  is particularly useful in case DDoS is based on injection or XSS.460   Use antivirus solutions to curb malware infections.   Use a network-based intrusion-detection system.   Apply patches promptly, especially when many employees use their personal machines for work.  Organisations should give high priority to system updates and deliver them to users remotely.   Traffic profiling and traffic filtering may assist in providing early warning signs of abnormal traffic patterns that  are an indicator of DDoS attacks.   Use DDoS mitigation services to detect abnormal traffic flows and redirects traffic away from your network,  as well as rate limiting to restrict the volume of incoming traffic.   Protect web-based APIs and monitor for related vulnerabilities.   Fortify DNS or even consider a managed DNS service. Cache poisoning or similar exploits can be prevented  by the use of DNSSEC, or even better a managed DNS vendor supporting the DNSSEC specification.   Consider a multi-layered solution mixing detection, investigation, and response capabilities across multiple  platforms.   Build a threat intelligence program based on a proactive approach that adapts the security posture to the  evolving threat environment.   Use staff training and cybersecurity exercises to increase capacity building and preparedness.  Countermeasures for mitigating web-based attacks are as follows:   Set up a web application firewall (WAF) to identify and filter malicious requests.460 WAF must be kept  updated to protect the system against newly discovered vulnerabilities.   Strengthen the code base (e.g. input sanitisation, parametrised statements) to protect against injection-  based attacks.  458 H2020 EU Project CONCORDIA, Deliverable D4.2 - 2nd year report on cybersecurity threats, https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf  459 OWASP Top Ten, https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/  460 Tripwire, The 10 Most Common Website Security Attacks (and How to Protect Yourself), December 2020, https://www.tripwire.com/state-of- security/featured/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/  https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/ https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  73   Promptly update software to avoid zero-day attacks.   Properly configure and harden web servers and regularly patch all servers exposed on the Internet.   Continuously verify the effectiveness of your security hardening, using attack tools, vulnerability scanners, and  penetration test services.   Enable logging and inspect those logs.

DISINFORMATION -  MISINFORMATION  The rise in the use of digital technologies and social media has changed the way in which people access information  and news. Unlike traditional media (e.g. newspapers, TV), social media guarantees direct access to information with  no filters. The price we pay for such a convenient way of accessing information is the increasing risk of retrieving fake  news and manipulated information.461 In this context, social media assumes the role of preferred amplifier of  information, much more than what happened with the advent of traditional media. This information may be fake  (therefore changing perception of reality in people) or real (information about incidents, errors, losses, opinions, and  reputation regarding a company). The amplification effect of (social) media is an important threat to individuals,  enterprises and even states, because an item of false news can be perceived as real, while an apparently minor  problem might become a major incident in public opinion. In addition, social media can be manipulated to distort the  market or become effective vectors of misinformation/smear campaigns against a company or the reputation of some  of its most representative individuals. The brand reputation, financial solidity of the company, and the trustworthiness  of the management as well as the honesty and trustworthiness of individuals are therefore put at risk.  Media-driven market manipulations and misleading public-opinion campaigns were boosted in recent years thanks to  new technologies that increase the ability to spread fabricated information.456 Two main attacks emerged, namely,  disinformation and misinformation. Though often perceived as similar, since they refer to inaccurate, incorrect, or  misleading information, they entail fundamentally different concepts.462 463 464  Disinformation is an intentional attack that consists of the creation or sharing of false or misleading information.  Disinformation attacks experienced an exponential boost in the COVID-19 pandemic era, for instance, targeting  people’s trust on vaccines.  Misinformation is an unintentional attack, where sharing of information is done inadvertently. Inaccuracy carried by  the information is unintentional and could happen for example when a journalist reports wrong information in good  faith or reports information by mistake. The spread of misinformation also includes scenarios where people believe a  news item regardless of veracity because it supports their worldview.  One may argue about the how these threats relate to cybersecurity. It is important to note that disinformation and  misinformation attacks are among the preparatory activities at the basis of other attacks (e.g. phishing, social  engineering, malware infection). Moreover, such threats are often used in tandem with other cybersecurity threats,  thus leading to advanced hybrid threats. It should also be underlined that the main aim of these threats is to  undermine trust, which is the foundation of cybersecurity. By shattering that foundation, cascading effects ripple  throughout the whole cybersecurity ecosystem and may have severe implications.  The success of these attacks is due to the spread guaranteed by social media, and has both technical and social  foundations.465 466 Social media amplifies news and circulates information independently of its accuracy.

In addition, many sites flourish because  their intent is to make money through advertising. Their goal is not to circulate true or false information but rather to  collect clicks (clickbait), which has the side effect of spreading misleading information.467  The complexity of this scenario is due to the difficulty in distinguishing the real intent of a piece of information or even  its originator. This is even more difficult when information campaigns are analysed in detail. Different campaigns exist  and their boundaries are quite difficult to draw. For instance, the differences between advertising, public relations,  public diplomacy (or public affairs), information operations, and propaganda are quite blurred, since they all represent  information campaigns whose understanding depends on personal interpretation.468  This huge flow of dis- or mis-information is flooding people with the goal of causing uncertainty, apathy towards truth,  exhaustion in trying to find it, and fear. It is becoming increasingly clear that policy-makers should put disinformation  at the core of their agenda, while also including security and privacy implications.469  Social media are the most critical vector for misinformation and disinformation attacks. They permit direct access to  information with no filters, increasing the risk of encountering fake news and manipulated information. Social media  are also the preferred amplifier of misinformation and disinformation attacks, bringing those attacks on a large-scale.  Technical peculiarities of social networks also increase the circulation of (fake) news such as trending topic lists. This  is further amplified when people are in social relations and exchange information with like-minded people sharing the  same beliefs, creating the so called “Echo Chamber” effect.470  Examples of social media-based attack vectors are celebrities or influencers spreading disinformation, social media  groups promoting material for supporters. Traditional approaches are also used to carry out disinformation or  misinformation attacks such as the spread of malicious accounts: bots, spammers, fake domains, and cyborgs.471  Social bots have attracted a huge interest and have been massively adopted.472 Some studies, on Twitter, claimed  that social bots can represent between 5 and 15% of users and are responsible for misinformation campaigns,  phishing attacks, election and market manipulation.473  Starting from the above vectors, two main classes of threat agents are playing the disinformation/misinformation role.  On one hand, we have state-backed groups implementing state-sponsored attacks. On the other hand, we have  cybercriminals, that is, non-state and private commercial organisations benefiting from the increasing availability of  Disinformation-as-a-Service. For instance, conspiracy narratives are distributed by terrorists, extremists and  organised criminal groups to manipulate people. In general, a large part of attacks is managed by non-state domestic  actors, while both types of agents are increasingly targeting the private sector to spread misinformation, and  manipulate the market or attack the reputation of competitors.474 475 Misinformation and disinformation are  increasingly distributed as chains of messages, social media content, deepfakes, and phishing via voice, text, and e-  mail.476  467 Alice E.

They may aim to cause financial  and reputational damage and arouse a lack of trust in society at all levels. An overview is presented in Table 2. 477  Table 2: Misinformation and Disinformation: Target, Means, and Goals  Target Means Goal  People Disinformation, misinformation, fake news  Reduce perceived honesty and  trustworthiness of individuals  Enterprises  Market distortion, misinformation, disinformation,  smear campaigns, fake news, propaganda  Affect brand reputation, financial solidity of  the company, and the trustworthiness of  the management.  Society Disinformation, fake news  Inability to distinguish real and fake news,  apathy, exhaustion in trying to find the  truth, manipulating and misleading public-  opinion  Any  Sharing of inaccurate information Make money based on advertisement  Figure 10 shows incidents based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA for the purposes of  situational awareness.478 The scope of the collection is global and multi-sectorial. Incidents, however, with a direct  impact in the EU area are given priority. Notable misinformation and disinformation incidents are included in Annex B.  More work is needed to better classify cyber incidents related to disinformation and misinformation, since a lot of them  are classified in other categories given that they are commonly used in complex, hybrid attacks. This is the reason why  there is a constant fluctuation throughout the year as evidenced by the figure.  Figure 10: Misinformation and disinformation incidents observed by ENISA (April 2020-July 2021)  477 PwC, The disinformation age has arrived.

According to the GRPS, a  ‘backlash against science’ will heighten the risks of ‘climate action failure’ and ‘infectious diseases’ over the next  decade.” Dissemination of disinformation on elections, humanitarian crises, and public health, security and cultural  issues is expected to increase over the next decade. Political divisiveness acts as an amplifier of disinformation and is  affecting public trust, especially in those countries (e.g. US) where a non-negligible number of individuals primarily  access political news through social media (2020).480  Some interesting and important points emerge and are summarised in the following.   Phishing is at the heart of disinformation attacks and it strongly exploit the beliefs of people.   Human-centric threats are difficult to analyse in pragmatic terms, including the ability to describe,  decompose, classify, and reproduce them to feed quantitative analyses, graphical or numerical simulations,  or coding into algorithms.437   Disinformation attacks benefit from the difficulty of quantifying everything connected with humans. When the  threat involves or depends on people's behaviour (e.g. errors, cognitive bias, skill shortages), measurements  and data collection are complex processes that often result in poor-quality data.437   The problem around disinformation is not the ability to distinguish true or false information; instead it is a  social and epistemic crisis amplified by the evolving media and political context.464   Disinformation that is moving from political/social spheres to the corporate world is growing in scope and  impact thanks to social media platforms and content creation technologies.481  9.1.1 AI-enabled disinformation supports attackers in carrying out their attacks  AI is used to build realistic profiles and images, to vary the content and wording of posts and to get unnoticed.482 483 AI-  powered social media is at the basis of the spread of disinformation, causing social chaos.484  Deepfakes technology is evolving quickly. Supporting technology makes the creation of deepfakes simpler, while  social media help in spreading them485. Additionally, misinformation and disinformation campaigns are becoming  more credible thanks to deepfakes, which cannot yet be fully counteracted.486 487  9.1.2 Coronavirus pandemic used for amplification of attacks  COVID-19 is a top topic for disinformation attacks, resulting in what the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned as  an infodemic of online dis/misinformation.488 464 Disinformation campaigns aim to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt  around the effectiveness of Coronavirus vaccines. This is used as the basis for social engineering attacks. It also  targets the beliefs of individuals, reducing trust in information sources and impacting business brands. Businesses  and individuals are targeted by disinformation campaigns focused on green pass, mandatory vaccination, health  passports, mass immunity testing, and lockdowns.  479 The Global Economic Forum, The Global Risks Report 2021 16th Edition, 2021  http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2021.pdf  480 Miles Parks, Trump Is No Longer Tweeting, But Online Disinformation Isn't Going Away, March 2021,  https://www.npr.org/2021/03/05/971767967/trump-is-no-longer-tweeting-but-online-disinformation-isnt-going-away?t=1624004975614  481 PwC, The disinformation age has arrived.

As an example, during the lockdown imposed to flatten the COVID-19 curve, experts  were competing with substantial campaigns of online misinformation and disinformation464. In more detail, fake shops  related to COVID-19 proliferated, as well as scams targeting people interested in information related to COVID-19. Six  hundred malicious apps proposing COVID-19 services contained trojans/spyware. Avast also reported the rise of  deepfakes especially related to pornographic domains and targeting normal people (e.g. TikTok users). The UK’s  National Cyber Security Centre, in April 2020, removed 2,000 scams, including 471 fake online shops, and 200  phishing sites.490 491 In this context, politicians, policy makers, legislators are pressing social media enterprises (e.g.  Google, Facebook, Twitter) to find countermeasures and limit the proliferation of misinformation/disinformation  campaigns.492  9.1.3 Disinformation-as-a-Service (DaaS)  Professional disinformation is produced on a large scale by major governments, political parties, and public relations  firms.493 Since 2019, a growing number of third parties have been offering disinformation services, providing targeted  attacks on behalf of clients.494 Services are provided in numerous countries and an increasing number of non-state  and private commercial organisations are using them.495 In this context, disinformation has moved from political and  social spheres to the corporate world.496 The University of Oxford monitored the manipulation of public opinion using  social media by governments and political parties, and the various private companies and other organisations they  work with to spread disinformation.497 From a geographical point of view, disinformation and misinformation are  targeting every country in the world.  9.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  Mitigation vectors include both technical and non-technical domains. On one side, mitigation vectors are manual and  human-based approaches targeting training and awareness, fact checking and debunking, regulations, and  communication. On the other side, technical solutions are important to limit the spread of mis/disinformation through  social networks. Co-operation between all actors is important to further limit the impact of mis/disinformation attacks.  In general, the following approaches may be explored to mitigate misinformation and disinformation campaigns.   Training and awareness: is the process preparing employees in managing disinformation attacks, and also in  assessing any e-mail and report.498 499 In this context, following a vaccine-like approach, prebunking aims to  expose users to a small amount of mis/disinformation to prepare them to manage mis/disinformation later on.  Other approaches focus on gamification, where a simulation of social media feeds is used to teach users in  distinguishing real and fake news. For instance, online game, “Go Viral!“500 aimed to prebunk common  misinformation surrounding COVID-19.501  489 Avast, 2020: The Year of Fake News, COVID-related Scams and Ransomware, November 2020, https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2020- the-year-of-fake-news-COVID-related-scams-and-ransomware-301180568.html  490 Paul McEvatt, Fujitsu, 2021 Prediction: The Age of Disinformation Attacks, January 2021, https://blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2021-01-12/2021- prediction-the-age-of-disinformation-attacks/  491 Fujitsu, Top 10 Cyber Security Predictions for 2021, 2021, https://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/security/insights/predictions-2021/  492 Jane Wakefield, Google, Facebook Twitter grilled in US on fake news, March 2021, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56523378  493 Samantha Bradshaw, Hannah Bailey, Philip N.

For instance, examine sources, authors, cross-references, cited data and dates are some examples.502 503   Fact Check and Debunking False Stories: many efforts by both non-profit organisations and government  agencies have been undertaken to reduce the impact of misinformation and disinformation.504 505 These actors  aim to debunk publications and content carrying false information and fake news.506 Many efforts have been  undertaken to counteract the infodemic around COVID-19.507   Regulations: new regulations (such as the proposed EC Digital Services Act508) and punishments for sites,  including social networks, spreading fake news are under way. In the context of the GDPR (General Data  Protection Regulation), it is possible to limit access to information that enables targeted advertising.509  Accordingly, GDPR can help against misinformation by regulating the processing of personal data by online  targeted advertising – which is also a tool used for spreading fake news. So GDPR, by regulating online targeted  advertising, could also indirectly contribute in a broader way to the limitation of misinformation. The Code of  Practice on disinformation provides self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation with the support of industry.510  The EU recently released the Fifth Progress Report on “the implementation of the 2016 Joint Framework on  countering hybrid threats and the 2018 Joint Communication on increasing resilience and bolstering capabilities to  address hybrid threats”. The report discussed the need to protect free and fair elections, the role of strategic  communications and a centre of excellence for countering hybrid threats, the importance of cooperation among  countries and resilience against radicalisation and extremism.511   Strategic and transparent communication: that is factual and separate from political communication.512   Technical countermeasures: 513 514 515 516 517 456  o Rewriting search engine algorithms   Social network detection and mitigation: i) suspension of fake accounts (e.g. accounts that post  duplicate or redundant information), ii) mechanisms to filter and flag fake news, iii) reductions of  automatic activities (e.g. Bots), iv) artificial Intelligence tools and platforms to detect fake news  based on online approaches, v) data science/big data visualisation to identify the large-scale  spread of disinformation, vi) mobile apps and chatbots powered by factcheckers targeting the  general public, vii) web-browser extensions for the general public, viii) digital media information  literacy platforms and tools  o Awareness campaigns through advertisements  o Credibility rating, flagging suspicious behaviour  o Digital watermarking (tagging visual content)  o Creation of protection strategies centred around sentiment tracking and dark web monitoring.  502 Lion Gu, Vladimir Kropotov,

October 2021  82  10. NON-MALICIOUS THREATS  Threats are commonly considered as voluntary and malicious activities carried out by adversaries who have some  incentives to attack a specific target. In these sections, we cover threats where malicious intent is not apparent.  Non-malicious threats are mostly based on human errors and system misconfigurations518 , but they can also refer  to physical disasters that target IT infrastructures. Non-malicious threats can be classified in two categories:  Errors and Misconfigurations are caused by negligence, lack of awareness or, simply, human errors. These  include:   errors when managing an IT system: i) misconfigurations introduced when specific applications and systems  are (re-)configured and updated; ii) erroneous system management including errors in patching and updating a  system; iii) erroneous system administration, for instance, in distributing privileges among users; iv) issues in  the management of traditional systems such as network security, access control, identity management.   development-time errors: i) issues with the management of dependencies; for instance, libraries that are used  without developers even noticing; ii) long-standing issues, for instance, memory safety, unsanitised inputs and,  in general, issues with well-known solutions involving the use of modern tools,519 520 521 522 iii) other forms of  negligence, for instance, storing application credentials on public repositories.523 524 525   application-level errors: i) errors introduced when using an application/system, ii) misconfigured (cloud)  applications and poor password and key management; for instance, publicly available buckets, unencrypted  databases, iii) minor errors, such as sending an e-mail to the wrong recipient.526   physical errors: i) unattended devices, ii) unsecured documents/information, iii) exceptions to physical access  rules.  Physical Disasters can be classified as:   damages to or failures of physical infrastructure, such as inadvertent damage to fibre cables, loss of Internet  connection, fire, unstable power supply,   natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, causing the unavailability of the IT infrastructure and related  services/applications.  For non-malicious threats, we can distinguish between four main actors:   Normal Users interact and use a system with all privileges needed to carry out a specific and limited activity on  it.   Privileged users (Admins) have root privileges on the system and are responsible for system configuration and  management. Intuitively, and confirmed by some reports, the damage caused by an error committed by these  users is typically much higher.527 These also include users responsible for physical IT infrastructure.  518 H2020 EU Project CONCORDIA, Deliverable D4.2 - 2nd year report on cybersecurity threats, https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Deliverables_D4.2.pdf  519 JSOF.

This  category can also be broadened to include third-party providers of software libraries and components.  Depending on their role, different types of non-malicious threats can be associated to actors as seen in Table 3:  Table 3: Mapping between non-malicious threats and actors  Threat Category Threat Type Actors  Errors and  Misconfigurations  Errors made when managing an IT system Privileged Users  Development-time errors Developers, Service/Cloud Providers  Application-level errors Users, Privileged Users  Physical errors All  Physical Disasters  Damages to or failures of physical infrastructure Privileged Users, Cloud Providers  Natural disasters None  Non-malicious threats represent a major threat vector for many existing malicious threats. For instance, security  vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, inadequate vulnerability and patch management can open the door to DDoS  attacks, malware and ransomware. At the same time human errors are a major vector for phishing and social  engineering. Notable non-malicious incidents are included in Annex B.  Misconfiguration is the most common attack vector (approximately 50%), followed by misdelivery (approximately  30%), based on a 2021 report by Verizon on data breaches.528 Programming errors account for a very small  percentage, stressing the fact that often security measures do exist and work correctly but are not applied. Cloud  misconfigurations substantially boosted and, according to Palo Alto Networks, can be classified in two main  categories: i) storage and encryption issues, ii) network issues.529 Encryption of data at rest and in transit remains  among the major misconfigurations, as well as permissive policies, lack of sophisticated protections and storage  available publicly.530 Also, non-malicious vectors/threats are rising in the case of the Internet of Things (IoT) with i)  exploitation of device vulnerabilities (41%, including 3% zero-day) and ii) user practices (26%, 13% password-based)  in the top spots.531  Considering non-malicious threat agents and vectors, the statement that points to “humans as the weakest part in a  system” is becoming increasingly relevant. Major threat vectors are lack of training and skills, as well as awareness, in  the users, developers and administrators. Lack of standardised processes, as well as weak configurations by default  (e.g. encryption disabled by default), are increasing the probability of an error/misconfiguration.532 All these vectors  coupled with the increasing complexity of modern systems that mix Cloud, Edge and IoT make current scenarios a  ticking time bomb. At the same time, weak physical infrastructures not ready to face destructive natural events, as  well as lack of proper plans for utility management open the doors to disasters that might impact the availability of the  system.  Major inadvertent threat agents are therefore individuals who have different roles in system life cycles as end users,  privileged users, developers and cloud/services providers. Considering errors and misconfigurations, in virtually all  cases the threat actor is internal, for instance, an employee inadvertently publishing some records, or an IT manager  not securing properly an S3 bucket. In more detail,533 internal actors account for 99% of breaches, the remaining  percentage is divided among partners and a combination thereof. Among internal actors, the three most frequent are  528 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  529 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  530 Aqua Security - Cloud Security Report - Cloud Configuration Risks Exposed  531 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/  532 Aqua Security - Cloud Security Report - Cloud Configuration Risks Exposed  533 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  84  system admin (approximately 50%), developer (approximately 30%), and end user (approximately 20%). However,  the possible damage of such breaches is typically much higher in the first two cases, since i) system admins are the  most powerful users controlling virtually all the systems; ii) developers frequently have privileged access to data.  Regarding physical disaster, threat agents are either the users acting on and managing the physical infrastructure, or  natural events impacting the physical infrastructure.  10.1 TRENDS  In summary, non-malicious threats have historically had an important impact on the working of IT systems and  applications, but their impact is being exacerbated by i) the increasing complexity of the systems and infrastructures;  ii) the increasing migration to cloud environments and integration of IoT devices and edge computing, often with  limited amount of time, skills and resources;534 and iii) the COVID-19 pandemic. On top of this, skills shortages and  well-known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations continue to be an issue.  10.1.1 Errors and system misconfigurations are the most frequent reported root cause  In 2020, out of the incidents with significant impacts reported under the NIS directive535, 17% were flagged as human  errors, while system failures remain the most frequent root cause of reported incidents at a rate of 48%. The causes  these incidents were software bugs and hardware failures. This was a continuing trend as similar figures were  reported in 2019.536  Similar trends are also observed for Telecommunication and Trust services in 2020:   System failures in the telecom sector maintained the widest impact with almost 50% of the total user hours  lost and were the most likely root cause of incidents (61%).537 Faulty software changes/updates accounted  for 41% of the total user hours lost and 24% of the total incidents. Human errors accounted for 41% of the  total user hours lost, and were the root cause of 26% of total incidents (an increasing trend). Third party  failures remain stable at 29%.   System failures accounted for more than half of the incidents in the trust services sector in 2020, and were  the major root cause (53%). Human errors were the root cause of 39% of the incidents.538  10.1.2 COVID-19 increased the number of non-malicious incidents due to migration to the  cloud  The pandemic forced a migration to the cloud, causing a substantial increase in cloud workloads between October  2019 and February 2021 all over the world: 70% in the APAC region, 69% in the EMEA region, 65% in the AMER  region and 58% in Japan539. According to Palo Alto networks,539 the industries with the highest increase in security  incidents (Retail 402%, Manufacturing 230%, Government 205%, and Pharma and Life sciences 127%) were among  those that increased their cloud workloads significantly due to the pandemic.  A huge number of recent data breaches is caused by misconfigured buckets.540 While many of them revealed  personal information, it is also common to find credentials and secrets stored in buckets. Using simple crawling  techniques, Truffle Security built an initial list of 4,000 open S3 buckets which, due to file name patterns, were likely to  contain environmental variables and other secrets. Files matching those patterns contained an average of 2.5 secrets.  Furthermore, some of them also contained credentials to open authenticated buckets and secrets for other services,  from database passwords to PayPal credentials and JWT secrets.  534 Security Today, The IoT Rundown For 2020: Stats, Risks, and Solutions, January 2020, https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT- Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2  535 Annual Report NIS Directive Incidents 2020 CG Publication, to be released. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group  536 Annual Report NIS Directive Incidents 2019, CG Publication 03/20, December 2020. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation- group  537 ENISA, Telecom Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report, July 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting- 2020  538 ENISA, Trust Services Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report, July 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident- 2020-annual-report  539 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  540 Truffle Security, An API Worm in The Making: Thousands of Secrets Found in Open S3 Buckets, August 2021, https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/an-s3- bucket-worm-in-the-making-thousands-of-secrets-found-in-open-s3-buckets  https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2 https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident-2020-annual-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident-2020-annual-report https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/an-s3-bucket-worm-in-the-making-thousands-of-secrets-found-in-open-s3-buckets https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/an-s3-bucket-worm-in-the-making-thousands-of-secrets-found-in-open-s3-buckets  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  85  10.1.3 Vulnerabilities and bugs continue to play a prominent role  In 2020, NIST received more than 18,000 new CVEs (fourth year in a row that this number grows)541, and this trend  seems to be continuing in 2021542.  The 2020 also saw a never-seen-before spike in IoT malware, exploiting devices that are, in most cases, unsecure  and never patched properly. The challenges behind unsecure IoT are well-known and detailed, for instance, the IoT  Top Ten by OWASP contains vulnerabilities such as Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces, Lack of Secure Update  Mechanisms, Use of Insecure or Outdated Components and Lack of Device Management.543 Sonicwall reports an  even faster increase in the first half of 2021.544 In homes due to school reopenings, the rise in COVID-19 cases and  the growth in the number of IoT devices.  On the contrary, the exploitation of vulnerabilities accounts for only 3% of breaches545. When organisations expose  some vulnerable hosts on the Internet, such vulnerabilities are quite old and attackers still actively exploit them.  According to Verizon, 20% of organisations expose vulnerabilities as old as 2010. SonicWall discovered similar old  vulnerabilities still being exploited.546  These findings stress once again how organisations do not deal effectively with patch management. The scenario of  unpatched vulnerabilities and legacy software is particularly critical in the healthcare sector. For instance, 83% of all  imaging devices run on operating systems which are not actively supported, including Windows 7.547 They are also  responsible for a high number of security issues, compared to the number of deployed devices, where the imaging  systems, patient monitoring and medical device gateways (which account for 34% of all devices) are at the basis of  86% of all security issues.  According to a recent report548, the top 30 ecommerce retailers in the US use 1,131 third-party resources each and  23% of them include at least one critical vulnerability. This results in possible cascading effects where a compromise  of a system can open the door to compromises in other domains. The total cost of a breach caused by a third party  is $4.29 million on average. In this context, Verizon claims that web applications are involved in 43% of the  breaches and 80% of organisations experienced an attack from a vulnerability in their third-party software.  According to Aqua Security,549 SMEs do fix issues faster than enterprises, 75 days vs 88 days (on average).  10.1.4 Physical and natural threats affect digital infrastructures and  telecommunications  According to the Annual Report NIS Directive Incidents 2020550, natural phenomena were reported to affect only the  digital infrastructure and the communication sector. About half of the incidents affecting the digital infrastructure sector  (38 incidents – 9%) and one incident affecting the communication sector were reported as natural disasters.  Regarding telecom security incidents in the EU reported in 2020551, natural phenomena come third as the root cause  at almost a tenth of total incidents (9%, 109 incidents in total).  10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  It is important to note that, since non-malicious threats are among the major threat vectors for any type of attack,  mitigation vectors in this section might overlap with the ones in other chapters of this report.

In the latter case,  attacks driven by AI (e.g. deepfakes) can trigger a human error, which is very difficult to prevent in a wholly  technical way. Hence, robust organisational policies are needed to mitigate human errors.557   Adopting a governance-based approach to data and security, allowing data to be thoroughly considered and  followed.558 559 560   A patch management plan to deal with vulnerabilities: a proper plan does not require everything to be  patched but means what is needed must be patched, eventually using priorities coming, for instance, from a  risk management process.561,562   Adopting a wider definition of patch management, it should also refer to organisations pushing for updates  rather than only receiving them (i.e. software and hardware producers). There are many cases of IoT  vulnerabilities that have been around for years and it is difficult to understand who should actually publish the  patches.563 564   Updates should be delivered in a secure way (e.g. Tesla Model X’s lack of code signing565).   Patch management must account for supply chain risk.566,567   Training and awareness for all types of users. Properly trained developers can introduce many security and  safety practices into their products,568 leveraging modern languages and frameworks giving more security  guarantees. This is crucial also for developing secure IoT devices without some long-standing issues such as  those related to memory safety.569 Admins should be trained on the security (and compliance) aspects of  their activities, relying on solutions which ensure security by default. Finally, training and awareness are  fundamental for end users to help them, for instance, in recognising early signs of incidents and making the  right choice at the right moment.570 571 572 573 574 575   Engineering of physical infrastructures to be more robust against natural events, as well as a proper  management of utilities guaranteeing business continuity in case of unexpected events or shortages.   Zero-trust security approach,576 assuming everything is considered malicious and untrusted. This approach  moves from implicitly trusting assets because of their location or ownership towards a dynamic approach  552 Andi Hendrickson, Top 5 Physical Security Considerations, July 2021, https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/top-5-physical-security-considerations/  553 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  554 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  555 Accenture, State of Cybersecurity Report, 2020  556 Booz Allen Hamilton, Supply Chain Vulnerability Trends to Watch Out For, February 2021  557 Sophos Threat Report 2020  558 Anna Larkina, Roman Dedenok, Doxing in the corporate sector, March 2021, https://securelist.com/corporate-doxing/101513/  559 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  560 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  561 Accenture, Cyber Threatscape Report, 2020  562 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  563 Forescount Amnesie:33  564 Lily Hay Newman, Wired, Critical Flaws in Millions of IoT Devices May Never Get Fixed, December 2020, https://www.wired.com/story/amnesia33- iot-vulnerabilitiesmay-never-get-fixed/  565 Andy Greenberg, This Bluetooth Attack Can Steal a Tesla Model X in Minutes, November 2020, https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model-x-hack- bluetooth/  566 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  567 Booz Allen Hamilton, Rethink Cyber Defense After the SolarWinds Hack, June 2021  568 Palo Alto Networks, Unit 42 - Cloud Threat Report, 1H 2021  569 Forescout Amnesia:33  570 Kaspersky, Financial Cyberthreats in 2020, March 2021, https://securelist.com/financial-cyberthreats-in-2020/101638/  571 Shasya Sharma, Monitor, review, and protect Amazon S3 buckets using Access Analyzer for S3, December 2019,  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/protect-amazon-s3-buckets-using-access-analyzer-for-s3/  572 AWS IAM access analysis features, https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/analyze-access/  573 Verizon, Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 2021, 2021  574 Blackberry Threat Report, 2020  575 Booz Allen Hamilton, Securing the Data Supply Chain, May 2021  576 NIST SP 800-207.

Despite increasing physical attacks, corporate leaders are reluctant to believe their companies  could be physical threat targets.580   Recovery plans and backups are fundamental to increasing system resilience.   Physical breaches can facilitate attacks. For instance, vulnerabilities in physical access control, tailgaters,  unattended devices can help an adversary in executing an attack.581 582   Errors and malfunctioning in internal equipment (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) can bring on  scenarios in which fire, humidity and unstable power supplies can damage IT infrastructures.583   Climate changes are posing a new set of challenges on system availability and resilience. Flooding, fire, and  earthquakes are happening at an increasing rate with an exponential power and impact on all  infrastructures.584 Risk assessment, disaster recovery techniques, and personnel training are fundamental.  577 Booz Allen Hamilton, Rethink Cyber Defense After the SolarWinds Hack, June 2021  578 Gartner, Top security and risk management trends 2021, 2021  579 Blackberry 2021 Threat Report, 2021  580 The Ontic Center for Protective Intelligence, 2021 Mid-Year Outlook State of Protective Intelligence Report - The Escalating Physical Threat  Landscape: A Clarion Call for Corporate Protective Intelligence https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-failures-regularly-occur-at- large-us-companies-resulting-in-physical-threats-or-harm-and-business-continuity-disruption-study-finds-301334484.html, https://ontic.co/wp- content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Mid-Year-Outlook-State-of-Protective-Intelligence-Report.pdf  581 https://www.boonedam.com/en-us/pillar-page/making-physical-security-part-of-cybersecurity-best-practices  582 Andi Hendrickson, Top 5 Physical Security Considerations, July 2021, https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/top-5-physical-security-considerations/  583 Karoline Gore, Physical threats to Cybersecurity that you must address, October 2019, https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security- essentials/physical-threats-to-cybersecurity-that-you-must-address  584 Warren Cornwall, Europe’s deadly floods leave scientists stunned, July 2021, https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/europe-s-deadly-floods- leave-scientists-stunned  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-failures-regularly-occur-at-large-us-companies-resulting-in-physical-threats-or-harm-and-business-continuity-disruption-study-finds-301334484.html https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-failures-regularly-occur-at-large-us-companies-resulting-in-physical-threats-or-harm-and-business-continuity-disruption-study-finds-301334484.html https://ontic.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Mid-Year-Outlook-State-of-Protective-Intelligence-Report.pdf https://ontic.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Mid-Year-Outlook-State-of-Protective-Intelligence-Report.pdf https://www.boonedam.com/en-us/pillar-page/making-physical-security-part-of-cybersecurity-best-practices https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/top-5-physical-security-considerations/ https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/physical-threats-to-cybersecurity-that-you-must-address https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/physical-threats-to-cybersecurity-that-you-must-address https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/europe-s-deadly-floods-leave-scientists-stunned https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/europe-s-deadly-floods-leave-scientists-stunned  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE 2021  October 2021  88  A ANNEX:  MITRE ATT&CK  RANSOMWARE  The figure illustrated below highlights the techniques in MITRE ATT&CK® Framework associated with ransomware  software, ransomware groups or both according to the legend.585 Notice that this is a dynamic representation,  based on actual observations.

Software is the interaction  layer with information technology. This report focuses on malware in general, which we cannot unambiguously map  to the ATT&CK Framework. Instead, malware is defined as a single building block of Capability Development. MITRE  ATT&CK® describes malware as a means to support the threat actor’s operations, obtaining a means for maintaining  control of remote machines, evading defences, and executing post-compromise behaviours.586 For illustration  purposes, we describe the mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK® Framework concerning one notable malware, namely  Emotet, which may be seen to be using a variety of different techniques in different stages.

GRE (1.43%) and HTTP flooding (1.10%) showed modest growth. Linux  botnets continued to account for almost all DDoS traffic (99.90%).  Web application security is a prime threat vector for both large and small organisations590,591,592. F5 Labs classified  DDoS attacks into three categories: volumetric, application, protocol, and analysed their frequency. 73% of all  incidents was due to volumetric attacks; 53% of the attacks built on reflection attacks.591 For example, application  DDoS includes HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS requests to a server.

June 2020,  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53093611  636 Another particular case of DoS incidents includes attacks on Docker APIs, a category of attacks that appeared prominently during the reporting  period. Attacks on Docker APIs give cybercriminals access to the host with root privileges, leading to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks,  remote code execution (RCE), and unauthorised cryptocurrency mining activity. These attacks require some form of misconfiguration or security gap in  the infected system. In particular, the group needed to perform remote code execution on the system by taking advantage of instances of  misconfiguration, weak or stolen credentials, or other vulnerabilities.

It allows attackers to enlarge the amount of malicious traffic and at the same time obscure the attack source.

    "abstract": "This is the ninth edition of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) report, an annual report on the status of the cybersecurity threat landscape that identifies prime threats, major trends observed with respect to threats, threat actors and attack techniques, and also describes relevant mitigation measures. In the process of constantly improving our methodology for the development of threat landscapes, this year’s work has been supported by a newly formatted ENISA ad hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL). In this report we discuss the first 8 cybersecurity threat categories. Supply chain threats, the 9th category, were analysed in detail, in a dedicated ENISA report."

According to an annual security report, at least 900 international cases of  identity theft or identity-related crimes were detected 1 . The most  significant incidents reported were:   the exposure of nearly 106 million American and Canadian bank  customers’ personal information from the Capital One data breach  incident in March 2019 2 ;   the exposure of 170 million usernames and passwords used by digital  game developer Zynga in September 2019;   the stealing of 20 million accounts from the British audio streaming  service Mixcloud 3 ;   the compromise of 600,000 drivers and 57 million users personal  information from Uber’s data breach incident in November 2019; 3   and the theft of 9 million personal records from EasyJet customers  including identity cards and credit cards.  The trend of identity theft is reflected to a great part in data breaches,  which, compared with 2018, saw a record number of 3.800 publicly  disclosed cases, 4,1 billion records exposed and an increase of 54% in the  number of breaches reported. 4  2  3  $493,093  The average cost for  credential theft  The frequency of incidents  per company in 2019  3.2  $2,79M  The annual cost for  credential theft  Percentage of incidents  relating to negligence  63% Source: From a IBM Security Study – Cost of Insider Threats: Global Report13  __Findings  _The identity theft threat  In 2019, some malicious actors behind major incidents from the past years  were brought to justice. In June, the New York Police Department, in  collaboration with the FBI, brought to justice the members of the ‘Fraud  Ring’, who operated inside and outside the United States and managed in  2012 to steal credentials from iPhones worth of US $1million (ca.  €846.000) in a large-scale identity theft operation. Until the group was  stopped, the total amount stolen reached US $19 million (ca. €16 million) 4 .  A month later, the ‘Equifax settlement’ was publicly announced5. Equifax  was forced to agree to compensate the United States Federal Trade  Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 48 states, District  of Columbia and Puerto Rico over its 2017 data breach at the cost of at  least US $575 million (ca. €487 million). Because of that data breach, which  was ruled as ‘entirely preventable’, nearly 148 million American addresses  and social security numbers were leaked. At the end of the year, Brazil  fined Facebook in US $1,6 million (ca. €1,35 million) on behalf of Brazilian  citizens for the Cambridge Analytica data leak. 3  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Identity theft  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Trends  _Brand impersonation attacks  Consistent with the trend in 2018, certain brands are preferred in  impersonation attacks because of their strong reputation. Although these  brands - such as Microsoft (44%) and Amazon (17%) - continue to lead in  the rankings of 2019 brand impersonation attacks, new additions such as  the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are notable. 7  The sensitive  information included in the Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) has always  been appealing to impostors, who used an IRS impersonation in 10% of  identity deception-based e-mails in this reporting year. As a result, valid W-  2 forms and standard US Individual Tax Return (1040) forms are available  on the dark web at a cost ranging between US $1 and US $52.  This material, combined with the Social Security Numbers (SSN) and birth  dates, which are also available, allows any inexperienced hacker willing to  invest an amount of US $1,000 (ca. €846) to legally access a United States-  based bank account, file a false tax return, claim a refund and cash-out an  investment that has doubled or tripled. According to the IRS Criminal  Investigation, more than 10.000 individual tax returns with claims for  refund of more than US $83 million (ca. €70 million) were potentially  fraudulent. 9  7  __The cycle of steps for the tax scam “Dirty Dozen”  Source: BDO 19  “Dirty Dozen”  Tax Scam  Access a US- based bank  account  File a false tax  return  Claim IRS  refund into the  US-based  account  Transfer the  refund to  cryptocurrency  Use the  cryptocurrency  on the dark  web  Cash-out into  an EU-based  account  8  Trends  This technique has been used since 2016, targeting cryptocurrency  holders. However, in 2019 the same technique was used against high-  profile individuals or accounts with the intention of stealing the victim’s  identity. A number of victims of SIM-swapping were recorded, such as Jack  Dorsey (Twitter’s CEO), Jessica Alba (actor), Shane Dawson (actor), Amanda  Cerny (actor, twice a victim), Matthew Smith (actor, four times victim) and  King Bach (artist). 10  SIM-swapping was also used massively in two cases; at  Mozambique’s largest bank, where up to US $50.000 (ca. €42.300) were  stolen from high profile business accounts, and in Brazil where 5.000  victims, mainly politicians, ministers and governors had their accounts  hacked by an organized gang. 11  _SIM-Swapping identities  _Gift cards used as a business e-mail  compromise (BEC) trojan horse  BEC attacks caused losses of billions of euros in 2019. In such incidents,  the attackers impersonate a trusted individual, usually within the  company, and the victim is tricked into making a financial transaction or  divulging sensitive information, personal or corporate. In more than half  of BEC attacks, the victim was lured into purchasing a gift card. During the  purchase process, sensitive information such as bank account credentials  was intercepted. The victim was also forced to send the gift card to the  attacker, as an anonymous, irreversible and direct cash-out option. The  average amount stolen per gift card reached US $1.500 (ca. €1.269). 12  9  __Findings  20%_of identity deception attacks used  compromised accounts7  30%_of the attacks targeting C-level executives  accounts were compromised using display name  deception7  65%_of BEC attacks lured victims to purchase  gift cards12  €3,32_ million average cost of a data breach  95%_of the responders to a Eurobarometer  survey saw identity theft as a serious crime  10  Trends  The anti-fraud technique ‘digital masks’ was exposed when more than  60.000 stolen digital identities appeared as a trading product on the  darknet marketplace Genesis in April 2019. These doppelgangers were  readily available to purchase at US $5 - $200 each. The owner of a  doppelganger can more easily mimic a real user in an online shop or  payment service, especially if this is combined with stolen logins and  passwords. Apart from purchasing digital doppelgangers, new tools to  assist the potential impersonator have appeared, such as the Tenebris  browser, which embeds a generator allowing the unique fingerprints and  digital masks to be developed.11  In recent years, skimmers, dumpster divers, hackers, administrator  impersonators and phishers have been identified as the main groups  behind the identity theft attacks. That list expanded in 2019 with the  addition of vishers and smishers. Vishers phish via phone calls. Unlike  telephone impersonators, vishers pretend to represent a well-known  organisation and offer to assist the victim with a service, for example  managing computer software, finances or a tax refund. Smishers send  false SMS messages and, if the receiver replies, their device is directly  hijacked or redirected to a phishing website.  The figure below shows the top data types lost in 2019, where e-mail data  accounts for the highest number of records lost or stolen. These numbers  reveals the seriousness of the situation when considering that e-mails  may contain personal, corporate and governmental sensitive information.  _Digital doppelgangers  11  __Top data types lost in 2019  65%  59%  26%  18%  13%  12%  10%  Email  Password  Name  Miscellaneous  Address  Credit Card  Account  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%  Source: RiskBased SECURITY 8  12  Attack vectors   THE CLOUD AS AN ATTACK INTERFACE FOR CUSTOMERS’ DATA. In the  reporting year, Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN),  was compromised.14 The websites hosted or linked to libraries on  Amazon’s infrastructure were exposed, revealing externally loaded  content, including credit card data.   PHISHING URL. The common malware URL techniques16 of domain  squatting, domain shadowing and URL shorteners were used once  again in 2019. In the last quarter of 2019, it was noted that 26% of the  malicious domains used a secure certificate and one in three of those  certificates was SSL. This trick interfered with the judgement of visitor’s  who used to rely on the padlock icon in their browsers as a sign of  security.15   W2 SCAM. Another attack that targets companies and organisations’  records to access sensitive information is the W2 scam. The scam starts  by spoofing an executive member of the finance or human resources  department to obtain employees’ records. These records are then used  for identity theft. The scam is named after the American W2 tax form  used to report employee’s wages. This social engineering scam,  although old (first reported in 2016 by IRS), has been consistently rising  by 10% every year in recent years.9,17   NIMCY. In 2019, a spear-phishing tool, Nimcy was introduced by the  group responsible for the Zebrocy malware family. It was developed  using the Nim (formerly Nimrod) programming language, created by the  same group of hackers. This new downloader and backdoor was used to  steal login credentials, keystrokes, communications and files from  diplomats, defence officials and ministry staff in the foreign affairs  sector. The attackers seemed to focus on Central Asian governments,  with a preference for Pakistan and India.14  _ How  13   MOBILE THREATS. A rise in malicious mobile apps was noticed in 2019  and continued in 2020. Even widely used and trusted platforms such as  Google Play were hosting apps aiming to steal credentials (e.g. Acesse  SantaMobile, Modulo ID). However, the number of downloads was  extremely low, showing that the potential victims were not fooled.20   TROJAN-BANKER.ANDROIDOS.SVPENG.AK The eighth most popular  mobile trojan and most popular mobile banking trojan, responsible for  1,75% and 16,85% of unique attacks respectively, mostly target victims’  bank credentials and two-factor authorization codes. The majority of  this trojan’s victims are located in Russia, making it the top country in  terms of share of users attacked by mobile banking trojans.21   FORMJACKING. Formjacking was extremely common in 2018 but the  number of attacks seemed to decrease considerably in the first quarter  of 2019. However, starting in May with the attack an American  healthcare provider and the theft of login credentials, the number of  attacks continued to rise throughout the rest of the year. In that month  an all-time high number of 1,1 million detections was recorded. The five  countries with the most formjacking detections in 2019 were the United  States (51,8%), Australia (8,1%), India (5,7%), the United Kingdom (4,1%)  and Brazil (3,5%). The Megacart hacker group is strongly associated with  most of the development of formjacking tools and the attacks on British  Airways, Newegg, Feedify and Ticketmaster.22  _Proposed actions  14  Mitigation   Avoid using the password manager provided by the browser. If one is  needed, use an offline protected password manager.23   Authenticate any sender of a request to transfer money by telephone  or in person.19   Do not share sensitive information such as patient records in  handwritten notes to prevent their loss or misplacement. Digital files  are better for data with a short lifetime and then they should be  completely destroyed.   Use ‘threat hunting’ within your company to strengthen security plans.  Threat hunting is conducted by skilled members of the security  operation centre (SOC) team to proactively identify vulnerabilities and  prevent threats exploiting them.   Use policies such as velocity-based rules to mitigate identity fraud,  especially for payment card transactions. The machine data of valid  transactions can provide sufficient information for optimal policy  definition.   Use single-sign-on (SSO) authentication method, when available, which  allows a user to access several applications with the same set of digital  credentials. Its use is highly recommended to minimise the number of  user accounts and stored credentials.   Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs but also  block execution of files appropriately (e.g. block execution in the temp  folder).   Multi-factor authentication is a security measure to overcome  password hacking or loss and to ensure the success of the  authentication process with multiple keys. Introducing adaptive Multi-  factor authentication optimise the authentication process based on the  user’s behaviour and on the associated context.  15   Check URLs that are sent by e-mail or randomly visited based on their IP  address, the ASN associated with the IP, the owner of the domain and  the relation between this domain and others, before any further steps  are taken.   Organisations using cloud services should have strong cloud security  operations and preferably use an architecture of on-premises storage,  private cloud storage and public cloud storage simultaneously to  protect their customer’s personal information.   Enforce the use of strong and updated encryption methods such as TLS  1.3 (using ephemeral keys) for sensitive data to prevents hacking.   Adequately protect all identity documents and copies (physical or  digital) against unauthorised access.   Do not disclose identity information to unsolicited recipients and  requests by phone or e-mail or in person should not be answered.   Enforce the use of password protected devices, ensuring good quality of  credentials, and secure methods for their storage.   Ensure good quality of credentials and secure methods for their storage  in all used media.   Pay close attention when using public Wi-Fi networks, as fraudsters  hack or mimic them. If one is used, avoid accessing sensitive  applications and data. Use a trusted VPN service to connect to public  Wi-Fi networks.   Check transactions documented by bank statements or received  receipts regularly for irregularities.   Install content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, mails with  malicious content, spam and unwanted network traffic.   Enforce the use of data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.  16  References  1. “2019 identity theft report released” July 31, 2019.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Identity Theft  From January 2019 to April 2020  Identity  theft ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  Identity theft or identify fraud is the illicit use of a victim’s personal  identifiable information (PII) by an impostor to impersonate that person  and gain a financial advantage and other benefits.  According to an annual security report, at least 900 international cases of  identity theft or identity-related crimes were detected 1 . The most  significant incidents reported were:   the exposure of nearly 106 million American and Canadian bank  customers’ personal information from the Capital One data breach  incident in March 2019 2 ;   the exposure of 170 million usernames and passwords used by digital  game developer Zynga in September 2019;   the stealing of 20 million accounts from the British audio streaming  service Mixcloud 3 ;   the compromise of 600,000 drivers and 57 million users personal  information from Uber’s data breach incident in November 2019; 3   and the theft of 9 million personal records from EasyJet customers  including identity cards and credit cards.  The trend of identity theft is reflected to a great part in data breaches,  which, compared with 2018, saw a record number of 3.800 publicly  disclosed cases, 4,1 billion records exposed and an increase of 54% in the  number of breaches reported. 4  2  3  $493,093  The average cost for  credential theft  The frequency of incidents  per company in 2019  3.2  $2,79M  The annual cost for  credential theft  Percentage of incidents  relating to negligence  63% Source: From a IBM Security Study – Cost of Insider Threats: Global Report13  __Findings  _The identity theft threat  In 2019, some malicious actors behind major incidents from the past years  were brought to justice. In June, the New York Police Department, in  collaboration with the FBI, brought to justice the members of the ‘Fraud  Ring’, who operated inside and outside the United States and managed in  2012 to steal credentials from iPhones worth of US $1million (ca.  €846.000) in a large-scale identity theft operation. Until the group was  stopped, the total amount stolen reached US $19 million (ca. €16 million) 4 .  A month later, the ‘Equifax settlement’ was publicly announced5. Equifax  was forced to agree to compensate the United States Federal Trade  Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 48 states, District  of Columbia and Puerto Rico over its 2017 data breach at the cost of at  least US $575 million (ca. €487 million). Because of that data breach, which  was ruled as ‘entirely preventable’, nearly 148 million American addresses  and social security numbers were leaked. At the end of the year, Brazil  fined Facebook in US $1,6 million (ca. €1,35 million) on behalf of Brazilian  citizens for the Cambridge Analytica data leak. 3  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Identity theft  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Trends  _Brand impersonation attacks  Consistent with the trend in 2018, certain brands are preferred in  impersonation attacks because of their strong reputation. Although these  brands - such as Microsoft (44%) and Amazon (17%) - continue to lead in  the rankings of 2019 brand impersonation attacks, new additions such as  the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are notable. 7  The sensitive  information included in the Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) has always  been appealing to impostors, who used an IRS impersonation in 10% of  identity deception-based e-mails in this reporting year. As a result, valid W-  2 forms and standard US Individual Tax Return (1040) forms are available  on the dark web at a cost ranging between US $1 and US $52.  This material, combined with the Social Security Numbers (SSN) and birth  dates, which are also available, allows any inexperienced hacker willing to  invest an amount of US $1,000 (ca. €846) to legally access a United States-  based bank account, file a false tax return, claim a refund and cash-out an  investment that has doubled or tripled. According to the IRS Criminal  Investigation, more than 10.000 individual tax returns with claims for  refund of more than US $83 million (ca. €70 million) were potentially  fraudulent. 9  7  __The cycle of steps for the tax scam “Dirty Dozen”  Source: BDO 19  “Dirty Dozen”  Tax Scam  Access a US- based bank  account  File a false tax  return  Claim IRS  refund into the  US-based  account  Transfer the  refund to  cryptocurrency  Use the  cryptocurrency  on the dark  web  Cash-out into  an EU-based  account  8  Trends  This technique has been used since 2016, targeting cryptocurrency  holders. However, in 2019 the same technique was used against high-  profile individuals or accounts with the intention of stealing the victim’s  identity. A number of victims of SIM-swapping were recorded, such as Jack  Dorsey (Twitter’s CEO), Jessica Alba (actor), Shane Dawson (actor), Amanda  Cerny (actor, twice a victim), Matthew Smith (actor, four times victim) and  King Bach (artist). 10  SIM-swapping was also used massively in two cases; at  Mozambique’s largest bank, where up to US $50.000 (ca. €42.300) were  stolen from high profile business accounts, and in Brazil where 5.000  victims, mainly politicians, ministers and governors had their accounts  hacked by an organized gang. 11  _SIM-Swapping identities  _Gift cards used as a business e-mail  compromise (BEC) trojan horse  BEC attacks caused losses of billions of euros in 2019. In such incidents,  the attackers impersonate a trusted individual, usually within the  company, and the victim is tricked into making a financial transaction or  divulging sensitive information, personal or corporate. In more than half  of BEC attacks, the victim was lured into purchasing a gift card. During the  purchase process, sensitive information such as bank account credentials  was intercepted. The victim was also forced to send the gift card to the  attacker, as an anonymous, irreversible and direct cash-out option. The  average amount stolen per gift card reached US $1.500 (ca. €1.269). 12  9  __Findings  20%_of identity deception attacks used  compromised accounts7  30%_of the attacks targeting C-level executives  accounts were compromised using display name  deception7  65%_of BEC attacks lured victims to purchase  gift cards12  €3,32_ million average cost of a data breach  95%_of the responders to a Eurobarometer  survey saw identity theft as a serious crime  10  Trends  The anti-fraud technique ‘digital masks’ was exposed when more than  60.000 stolen digital identities appeared as a trading product on the  darknet marketplace Genesis in April 2019. These doppelgangers were  readily available to purchase at US $5 - $200 each. The owner of a  doppelganger can more easily mimic a real user in an online shop or  payment service, especially if this is combined with stolen logins and  passwords. Apart from purchasing digital doppelgangers, new tools to  assist the potential impersonator have appeared, such as the Tenebris  browser, which embeds a generator allowing the unique fingerprints and  digital masks to be developed.11  In recent years, skimmers, dumpster divers, hackers, administrator  impersonators and phishers have been identified as the main groups  behind the identity theft attacks. That list expanded in 2019 with the  addition of vishers and smishers. Vishers phish via phone calls. Unlike  telephone impersonators, vishers pretend to represent a well-known  organisation and offer to assist the victim with a service, for example  managing computer software, finances or a tax refund. Smishers send  false SMS messages and, if the receiver replies, their device is directly  hijacked or redirected to a phishing website.  The figure below shows the top data types lost in 2019, where e-mail data  accounts for the highest number of records lost or stolen. These numbers  reveals the seriousness of the situation when considering that e-mails  may contain personal, corporate and governmental sensitive information.  _Digital doppelgangers  11  __Top data types lost in 2019  65%  59%  26%  18%  13%  12%  10%  Email  Password  Name  Miscellaneous  Address  Credit Card  Account  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%  Source: RiskBased SECURITY 8  12  Attack vectors   THE CLOUD AS AN ATTACK INTERFACE FOR CUSTOMERS’ DATA. In the  reporting year, Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN),  was compromised.14 The websites hosted or linked to libraries on  Amazon’s infrastructure were exposed, revealing externally loaded  content, including credit card data.   PHISHING URL. The common malware URL techniques16 of domain  squatting, domain shadowing and URL shorteners were used once  again in 2019. In the last quarter of 2019, it was noted that 26% of the  malicious domains used a secure certificate and one in three of those  certificates was SSL. This trick interfered with the judgement of visitor’s  who used to rely on the padlock icon in their browsers as a sign of  security.15   W2 SCAM. Another attack that targets companies and organisations’  records to access sensitive information is the W2 scam. The scam starts  by spoofing an executive member of the finance or human resources  department to obtain employees’ records. These records are then used  for identity theft. The scam is named after the American W2 tax form  used to report employee’s wages. This social engineering scam,  although old (first reported in 2016 by IRS), has been consistently rising  by 10% every year in recent years.9,17   NIMCY. In 2019, a spear-phishing tool, Nimcy was introduced by the  group responsible for the Zebrocy malware family. It was developed  using the Nim (formerly Nimrod) programming language, created by the  same group of hackers. This new downloader and backdoor was used to  steal login credentials, keystrokes, communications and files from  diplomats, defence officials and ministry staff in the foreign affairs  sector. The attackers seemed to focus on Central Asian governments,  with a preference for Pakistan and India.14  _ How  13   MOBILE THREATS. A rise in malicious mobile apps was noticed in 2019  and continued in 2020. Even widely used and trusted platforms such as  Google Play were hosting apps aiming to steal credentials (e.g. Acesse  SantaMobile, Modulo ID). However, the number of downloads was  extremely low, showing that the potential victims were not fooled.20   TROJAN-BANKER.ANDROIDOS.SVPENG.AK The eighth most popular  mobile trojan and most popular mobile banking trojan, responsible for  1,75% and 16,85% of unique attacks respectively, mostly target victims’  bank credentials and two-factor authorization codes. The majority of  this trojan’s victims are located in Russia, making it the top country in  terms of share of users attacked by mobile banking trojans.21   FORMJACKING. Formjacking was extremely common in 2018 but the  number of attacks seemed to decrease considerably in the first quarter  of 2019. However, starting in May with the attack an American  healthcare provider and the theft of login credentials, the number of  attacks continued to rise throughout the rest of the year. In that month  an all-time high number of 1,1 million detections was recorded. The five  countries with the most formjacking detections in 2019 were the United  States (51,8%), Australia (8,1%), India (5,7%), the United Kingdom (4,1%)  and Brazil (3,5%). The Megacart hacker group is strongly associated with  most of the development of formjacking tools and the attacks on British  Airways, Newegg, Feedify and Ticketmaster.22  _Proposed actions  14  Mitigation   Avoid using the password manager provided by the browser. If one is  needed, use an offline protected password manager.23   Authenticate any sender of a request to transfer money by telephone  or in person.19   Do not share sensitive information such as patient records in  handwritten notes to prevent their loss or misplacement. Digital files  are better for data with a short lifetime and then they should be  completely destroyed.   Use ‘threat hunting’ within your company to strengthen security plans.  Threat hunting is conducted by skilled members of the security  operation centre (SOC) team to proactively identify vulnerabilities and  prevent threats exploiting them.   Use policies such as velocity-based rules to mitigate identity fraud,  especially for payment card transactions. The machine data of valid  transactions can provide sufficient information for optimal policy  definition.   Use single-sign-on (SSO) authentication method, when available, which  allows a user to access several applications with the same set of digital  credentials. Its use is highly recommended to minimise the number of  user accounts and stored credentials.   Install end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs but also  block execution of files appropriately (e.g. block execution in the temp  folder).   Multi-factor authentication is a security measure to overcome  password hacking or loss and to ensure the success of the  authentication process with multiple keys. Introducing adaptive Multi-  factor authentication optimise the authentication process based on the  user’s behaviour and on the associated context.  15   Check URLs that are sent by e-mail or randomly visited based on their IP  address, the ASN associated with the IP, the owner of the domain and  the relation between this domain and others, before any further steps  are taken.   Organisations using cloud services should have strong cloud security  operations and preferably use an architecture of on-premises storage,  private cloud storage and public cloud storage simultaneously to  protect their customer’s personal information.   Enforce the use of strong and updated encryption methods such as TLS  1.3 (using ephemeral keys) for sensitive data to prevents hacking.   Adequately protect all identity documents and copies (physical or  digital) against unauthorised access.   Do not disclose identity information to unsolicited recipients and  requests by phone or e-mail or in person should not be answered.   Enforce the use of password protected devices, ensuring good quality of  credentials, and secure methods for their storage.   Ensure good quality of credentials and secure methods for their storage  in all used media.   Pay close attention when using public Wi-Fi networks, as fraudsters  hack or mimic them. If one is used, avoid accessing sensitive  applications and data. Use a trusted VPN service to connect to public  Wi-Fi networks.   Check transactions documented by bank statements or received  receipts regularly for irregularities.   Install content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, mails with  malicious content, spam and unwanted network traffic.   Enforce the use of data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.  16  References  1. “2019 identity theft report released” July 31, 2019.

In addition to this consolidated and remote control of the home, a smart home may also be  able to “learn” the preferences of its inhabitants and adapt to them. Examples of smart home devices  include: smart fridges, smart electricity meters, smart blinds, and automatic pet feeders. Important  components of the integrated smart home are converged media - media characterised by the merging  of traditional broadcast services with the Internet - in particular in the form of smart TVs and related  devices such as media centres. Home automation has increased over the years due to the fact that  the various smart home components, devices and systems have reached a level of technological  development and maturity suitable for entry into the market. Furthermore, smart home devices have  nowadays become more affordable. Due to the proliferation of interconnectivity and intelligence  related to living habits, coupled with the digitalization of important utilities, smart homes constitute  an attractive field for developments and future deployments.  Smart home technology aims to increase efficiency and quality of life, for example through assisted  living for ageing populations. However, besides benefits, smart home also bears cyber security risks.  This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media provides an  overview of the current state of cyber security in this domain. In particular it identifies commonly used  assets, exposure of these assets to cyber threats, threat agents, vulnerabilities and risks, as well as  available good practices in the field. In addition to the input from the members of the ENISA informal  Expert Group (EG) created for this effort, existing assessments and publicly available information have  been taken into account.  The study identifies threats to all asset classes, across the several alternative design pathways to smart  homes. As it develops, the smart home will exhibit a high cyber security risk profile for the individual  context, with additional systematic effects on broader information security. Highlights of this study  are:   Not all smart homes are created equally. There are multiple design pathways that lead to  functional smart homes, ranging between localised and integrated home-automation systems.  These pathways have their own security and privacy peculiarities, but also have shared issues and  vulnerabilities.   Smart homes will have significant privacy and data protection impacts. The increased number of  interlinked sensors and activity logs present and active in the smart home will be a source of close,  granular and intimate data on the activities and behaviour of inhabitants and visitors.   Several economic factors may lead to poor security in smart home devices. Companies involved  in the smart home market include home appliance companies, small start-up companies, and even  crowd-funded efforts. These groups are likely to lack security expertise, security budgets and  access to security research networks and communities.   The interests of different asset owners in the smart home are not necessarily aligned and may  even be in conflict. This creates a complex environment for security activity.   Just as in many other areas of ICT, applying basic information security would significantly  increase overall security in the smart home domain.  The smart home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and physical  space. This will create new yet unknown threat and vulnerability models that are result of bringing  together both the virtual and physical contexts.

Threat landscapes can  be broad, including the entire range of cyber threats, or targeted at a particular sector, such as the  financial sector, critical infrastructure or smart homes.  Threat landscapes can also vary by the particular time horizon involved, including current threat  landscapes, emergent threat landscapes and future threat landscapes. Emerging threat landscapes  reflect threat exposure of deployments of new technology, often characterised by a low maturity  regarding technical vulnerabilities. Emerging threat landscapes also involve mapping existing threats  onto emerging technologies to better understand how the particular context is exposed to these  threats.  The scope of this threat landscape is smart home environments, with a particular focus on converged  media and television.  Smart homes can be considered a sub-category of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently been  identified as an emerging digital battlefield for information security 1 . Smart homes are also an  emergent technology, which has reached a level of technological development suitable for entry onto  the market and are therefore a relevant subject for an emergent threat landscape. The popularity and  affordability of smart homes has been increasing in recent years due to reductions in costs and  integration with mobile phones and tablets2. Converged media devices are likely to be some of the  first consumer smart home devices introduced to many homes, and will therefore be the terrain for  the initial playing out of many of the identified smart home security issues.  Goal  This threat landscape deepens the generic threat assessment of the ENISA Threat Landscapes 20123  and 20134, by taking into account the specificities of the area of smart home environments, with a  particular focus on converged media and television. It does so by following the same approach  adopted by ENISA for other thematic threat landscapes, such as the Smart Grid Threat Landscape and  1 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats, European Network  and Information Security Agency, Heraklion, 11 December 2013, p.iii.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats [accessed 27 October 2014}  2 Booton, J., “Why the ‘Smart Home’ Market is about to Take Off”, Foxbusiness, 21 January 2014.  http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2014/01/21/why-smart-homes-might-actually-be-here-to-stay/  [accessed 27 October 2014]; Warman, M., “Everything Connected: the smart home in 2014”, The Telegraph, 31  December 2013. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/Internet/10542550/Everything-connected-the- smart-home-in-2014.html [accessed 27 October 2014]  3 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2012: Responding to the Evolving Threat Environment, European Network  and Information Security Agency, Heraklion, 08 January 2013. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape [accessed 27 October 2014]  4 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats, Op. cit.. p.7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2014/01/21/why-smart-homes-might-actually-be-here-to-stay/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10542550/Everything-connected-the-smart-home-in-2014.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10542550/Everything-connected-the-smart-home-in-2014.html http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 2  Good Practice Guide from 20135  and Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for the Internet  Infrastructure6, a work conducted by ENISA in parallel in 2014. This Threat Landscape and Good  Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media is one of the deliverables (Work Package 1.1 -  Deliverable 2) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 2014 under the Work Stream “Support EU  policy building”7.  The purpose of ENISA’s work on threat landscapes is to provide stakeholders with information about  developments in the cyber-threat landscape and to identify threat trends for the near future. This is  in support of the EU Cyber Security Strategy8. In this context, this report aims to:   Identify security challenges, associated risks and required countermeasures, for emerging  technologies in smart homes, in particular, for converged media and television9.   Consider political, social, economic and technical threats, in addition to technical threats.   Take into account input from experts and the members of the ENISA informal Expert Group  (EG) established to support the compilation of the current Threat Landscape for Smart Home  and Converged Media.   Take into account existing assessments, publicly available information sources and the  perspectives of involved stakeholders.  Policy context  The EU Cyber Security Strategy10 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging trends in  cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged  Media contributes towards the achievement of objectives formulated in this Communication, in  particular, to the identification of emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution  of cyber-crime (regarding the proposed role of ENISA, see in particular section 2.4 of this  Communication).  Moreover, the ENISA Regulation11 mentions in its Recital (24) the necessity to analyse current and  emerging risks (and their components), stating that for this purpose the Agency should, “in  5 ENISA, Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide, European Network and Information Security  Agency, Heraklion, 9 December 2013. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving- threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide [accessed 27 October 2014]  6 ENISA, Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for the Internet Infrastructure, European  Network and Information Security Agency, Heraklion, 19 December 2014.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl  [accessed 19 December 2014]  7 ENISA, Work Programme 2014, 29 November 2013. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes- reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014 [accessed 27 October 2014]  8 Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee  and the Committee of the Regions, JOIN(2013) 1 final, of 7 February 2013, on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the  European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 [accessed 20 October 2014].  9 ENISA Work Programme 2014. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014, p. 19 [accessed 27 October 2014]  10 Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions, JOIN(2013) 1 final, of 7 February 2013, on the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 [accessed 20 October 2014].  11 European Parliament and the Council, Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013, Concerning the European Union  Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004, 21 May  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 3  cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collect  relevant information”. In particular, Article. 3 (Tasks), d), ii), states that one of the tasks to be  performed by the Agency is to “support research and development […] by […] advising the Union and  the Member States on research needs in the area of network and information security with a view to  enabling effective responses to current and emerging network and information security risks and  threats, including with respect to new and emerging information and communications technologies  […]”.The ENISA Threat Landscape is contribution to the EU Cyber Security Strategy, by streamlining  and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and their evolution. Detailing the ENISA  Threat Landscape for various emerging areas, such as smart homes, should contribute to existing  policy measures established by the European Commission.  Furthermore, the Commission has issued a recommendation12 regarding energy efficiency by means  of intelligent buildings encompassing “ICT-based innovations that may provide one of the potentially  most cost-effective means to help Member States achieve the 2020 (energy) targets”. Although being  an indirect consequence of this recommendation, such innovations will be the catalyst for the  introduction of smart home environments, as they play an important role in increasing energy  efficiency of buildings. This is an indirect, rather than a direct context. But it will result in smart  functionality being introduced in smart buildings and smart homes. This study is a first contribution  towards cyber-security issues of these environments.  Target audience  The target groups of this document are specialists and individuals who are concerned with the  development and evolution of threats in cyber space, primarily security experts interested in assessing  the “external environment” and “internal environments” in the framework of threat and risk  assessments. This information might be interesting when formulating security policies or creating  protection profiles. Interested decision makers and users of IT components may find information of  help in defining their risk appetite and in making informed investment decisions and for the protection  of potentially valuable assets and of help. This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart  Home and Converged Media provides non-security experts with information to better understand  dependencies and developments in the area of cyber-security.  The document will also be of interest to policy-makers as, in addition to providing an overview of the  threat landscape and good practices in smart home and coverged media, it identifies existing policy  measures supporting smart home security and further action that may be required for various  stakeholders.  Finally, the document is intended to serve as a basis and a resource for further research in the area of  smart home security.  2013, OJ.

Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 5  2 Smart home infrastructure including converged media and television  The fundamental concept of a smart home is one fitted or equipped with a range of interconnected  sensors (light, temperature, motion, moisture, pressure, etc.), systems (heating, lighting, security,  etc.), and devices (media devices, appliances, washing machines, fridges, home robotics, etc.), which  can be automated, monitored and controlled, e.g., through a computer or smart phone, including  from outside the home, or via the Internet. Smart homes can either be the result of integrated design,  or the accumulation of interconnected components over time, perhaps in response to changing needs  or availability of technology13. The intent is to provide the occupants with sophisticated information  about the state of their home, and to allow them to control the connected devices. In addition to  consolidated and remote control of the home, a smart home may also be able to “learn” the  preferences of its inhabitants and adapt to them. In this case, the control interfaces may fade into the  background. This shift is seen as critical to avoid overloading the household with the task of monitoring  and programming the smart home14. A smart-home-connected refrigerator might be able to monitor  its contents, and use this information to suggest potential menus or to order replacements. A smart  electricity meter connected to the smart grid might be able to respond to fluctuations in the per-unit  cost of energy by slightly adjusting the temperature of the house, or by starting the washing machine  at a later time15. A smart home might respond to the presence of certain occupants by changing  desired lighting levels. Smart homes have also been identified as particularly beneficial for assisted  living for ageing populations16.  Smart homes combine a set of currently developing technologies. Whilst the development of these  technologies is not fixed, trends are discernible. This threat landscape report focuses on the most  likely patterns of development in smart homes17.  Early approaches to home automation assumed a cohesive and harmonised model, in which a single  system would provide automation of a building, most likely provided by a single supplier, and  potentially integrated with the building at the time of its construction. Current approaches suggest a  more complex smart home environment, composed of multiple technologies from multiple  manufacturers and service providers, and often integrated on an ad-hoc basis with existing legacy  technologies and systems. This complex environment may take a range of models.  In a fully decentralised smart home, each device is autonomous, making use of the existing home  network to connect to the Internet, and transmits data to the service provider in the cloud. This is the  model adopted, for instance, by the NEST smart thermostat 18 . Each device has its own control  interface or app. The home network provides secure transmission of data in the home. Any integration  or interaction between services is accomplished by communication between different service  providers, either through a central service (such as IFTTT19), or through direct peer-to-peer integration.  13 Edwards, W.K., and Grinter, R.E., “At home with ubiquitous computing: Seven challenges” in Abowd, G.D.,  Brumitt, B., and Schafer, S.A.N., (eds.), Ubicomp, 2001, pp. 256-272.  14 Davidoff, S., Lee, M.K., Yiu, C., Zimmerman, J., and Dey, A. K., “Principles of Smart Home Control” in Dourish,  P., and Friday A. (eds.), Ubicomp 2006, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006, pp. 19-34.  15 In this manner, smart homes are closely linked to the concept of the smart grid, especially those  implementations of smart grids that intend to reduce energy used through variable pricing schemes.  16 Arcelus, A., Jones M. H., Goubran, R., and Knoefel, F., “Integration of Smart Home Technologies in Health  Monitoring System for the Elderly”, 21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and  Applications Workshop (AINAW’07), 2007.  17 For information on the identification and collection of sources, see Section 3: Methodology.  18 https://nest.com/uk/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  19 https://ifttt.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  https://nest.com/uk/ https://ifttt.com/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 6  In this context, security and privacy are not guaranteed by a single manufacturer but rather the whole  network has to be considered.  An alternative option enables local connectivity between smart devices, without the use of  connections to cloud services and without a central gateway. In this model, all devices are able to  discover each other and automatically form a smart solution by recognising their peers and their  capabilities. This model faces strong technological barriers and suffers from the absence of shared  protocols and communication standards, as well as ways of incorporating individual devices designed  to connect to the Internet.  A third alternative is a system based around a central hub or gateway of some form. A central software  system (deployed on a home desktop, a set-top-box, a smart TV) co-ordinates all the devices,  integrating their services in order to provide added value, more complex services. In this case, as the  data is confined to the home itself, security and privacy can be protected. Many approaches to home  automation adopt a home gateway (such as the GIRA Homeserver20, the QIVICON Home Base21, the  Insteon Hub22, the SmartThings Hub23, the Revolv Hub24 and the Ninja Sphere25). In addition to these  fixed devices, other devices such as smart phones, tablets, laptops and wearable technology enter and  leave the house.  We consider that the most likely and feasible scenario for the common installation of smart homes  will not be a pure form of one of these three models. One potential location for smart home gateway  or hub will be the smart media device, typically a converged media device such as a smart television.  Smart televisions have a number of attributes that contribute towards this role, which are discussed  in more detail in Section 9, Subsection: Particular issues raised for converged media. Smart phones,  which should also be considered as media devices in this context, will also play a role in controlling  the smart home.  We can gain additional insights into the likely smart home infrastructure from parallel infrastructure.  For example, hotels worldwide have been installing a range of room-automation, entertainment and  management systems for the comfort of their customers as well as for their own management, billing  and profit maximisation (for example, selling premium media content). Smart TVs are often a key  element of these systems, allowing visitors to the hotel to order services, access entertainment, and  view billing details. This can include TV over IP26. These systems are of a larger scale than the typical  home automation set-up, but utilise many of the same technologies. The large transient population  of hotels, including international business travellers and other high-value customers, makes them a  tempting target for fraudsters and for espionage, and therefore potentially exposes a large number of  people to victimise through the exploitation of information security vulnerabilities in these systems.  Hotels can be seen as leading the way in introducing these systems, and provide a perspective on how  these issues might play out as smart home technology becomes more diffuse and dispersed.  Digital convergence is the coming together of the media, telecommunications and consumer  electronics sectors, driven by several trends, including increases in processing speed, storage capacity,  20 http://www.gira.com/en/gebaeudetechnik/systeme/knx-eib_system/knx-produkte/server/homeserver.html  [accessed 20 October 2014]  21 https://www.qivicon.com/qivicon-prinzip/qivicon-home-base/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  22 http://www.insteon.com/2242-222-insteon-hub.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  23 http://www.smartthings.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  24 http://revolv.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  25 http://ninjablocks.com/pages/home [accessed 20 October 2014]  26Leyden, J., “Hotel hacking could pump smut into every room”, The Register, 22 August 2005.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/22/hotel_hacking_reloaded/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.gira.com/en/gebaeudetechnik/systeme/knx-eib_system/knx-produkte/server/homeserver.html https://www.qivicon.com/qivicon-prinzip/qivicon-home-base/ http://www.insteon.com/2242-222-insteon-hub.html http://www.smartthings.com/ http://revolv.com/ http://ninjablocks.com/pages/home http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/22/hotel_hacking_reloaded/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 7  transmission speed, compression techniques and standardisation27. Despite the increasing popularity  of consuming media through other devices such as smart phones and tablets, television remains an  important media channel for European citizens. This is expanded by the increased uptake of smart  TVs, which offer Internet connectivity, as well as other devices (such as Google Chromecast, Apple TV,  Roku streaming devices and games consoles such as the PlayStation and Xbox) that connect to non- smart TVs to grant them certain elements of smart functionality. Smart TVs are capable of  broadcasting both linear (traditional broadcast television) and non-linear (downloaded or streamed)  audio-visual content, bringing about a convergence between traditional and online media. The smart  TV offers the potential for a device, which replicates the functionality of existing TV, media player,  home cinema, music and gaming systems, connected to the Internet and a range of online services,  and may well be integrated with home automation systems as part of a smart home. Internet  connectivity and home networking also allow a range of media devices within the home to share  content with each other, streaming media to different devices28. This general convergence of media  creates a dynamic situation in which the information processed and produced by converged home  media centres will be significant, will run through a shifting set of publishers, broadcasters, search  providers, connection providers, etc., and will be highly applicable to the profiling of individuals within  the household. As networked forms of interactive communication become pervasive, they enhance  and expand monitoring practices as they can gather information about user activity29. Whilst this  convergence brings advantages to the consumer in terms of access to a wide variety of media content  on flexible terms, these systems may well not be under the full control of the user. For example, in  2013, a tech blogger reported that he discovered that some smart TVs were transmitting unencrypted  information on viewing habits, as well as the names of files stored on an external USB drive30. In  addition to social issues around privacy, access and copyright, converged media and television raise  related security issues to smart homes in terms of connectivity, embedded functionality, opaque  systems and incompatibility with traditional information security approaches, and can be understood  as a particular instance of the principles behind smart homes.  Smart homes raise security concerns. First, small, low cost, interconnected devices may not have  mature security functions, having been designed primarily for ease of set-up, use and interconnection  and having relatively low processing capability. Communication within the smart home may use a  range of protocols (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, ZigBee and others), and therefore have a number of open  vectors for exploitation. Devices which were previously considered secure (or not even within the  ambit of information security) may become vulnerable to attack, either against the device itself, or to  harness the device to propagate further malicious attacks. Your smart kettle might, without your  knowledge, participate in a botnet31. Furthermore, many current information security approaches  have been developed in the context of enterprise computing, and may not be perfectly applicable to  the context of a distributed smart home, set up and inhabited by individual consumers. Second, smart  homes will be a key point of intersection between people and technology, and as such an approach to  27 Van Oranje, C., Cave, J., Van der Mandele, M., Shindler, H.

Privacy issues in smart home are  not limited to confidentiality and access control. Smart home sensors in particular will generate a large  amount of highly personal data about activities within the home. The multiple streams of data  combined together in a smart home system create the possibility of deeper contextual background  and reveal patterns of behaviour of the inhabitants32. The visibility of the smart home occupant is  increased by the large network of third parties who may be involved in providing smart home  functionality. Smart home functions may have serious impacts upon privacy of the person, privacy of  behaviour and action, privacy of communication, privacy of data and image, privacy of location, and  privacy of association33. The role of an information industry becomes particularly important in the  shift to ubiquitous computing34. Smart home systems may include embedded features that are opaque  to the user, and do not inform the user about the status of their operation. They may also be difficult  to update and patch in response to identified vulnerabilities. Smart homes may include sensitive  systems related to the occupants’ healthcare, finances and systems related to the physical security of  the home35, which may be open to dangerous manipulation by attackers.  Responses to the security and privacy risks of smart homes will include layering effective privacy  controls, and user-centric solutions on top of other effective information security measures, adapted  to the domestic context of smart homes36. Security services, such as authentication and access control,  have to be non-intrusive, intelligent and able to adapt to the rapidly changing contexts of the spaces37.  Smart home control and management systems will have to take security into consideration. This is  likely to include decisions about the architecture of smart home systems, as well as the broader policy  and legal context.  32 Davies, N., and Langheinrich, M., “Privacy by Design”, IEEE Pervasive Computing, vol. 12, No. 3, April-June  2013, pp. 2-4.  33 Finn, R.

In addition, ENISA established  an informal expert group to collect input at various stages of the project. The group comprised five  experts in the field who, on a voluntary basis, provided their expertise, e.g., for the identification of  the relevant assets, associated risks, past incidents and existing good practices. The expert group  contributed to the finalisation of this report. This section provides an overview of the methods of  collection and the information collected as well as some of the issues encountered during this process.  Documentary sources  This report identifies the majority of sources consulted; the details of all documentary sources  consulted during the study are available on request by contacting resilience@enisa.europa.eu. 166  documentary sources were identified through a number of search methods, including specialist search  engines for academic sources and journal articles. The sources collected are primarily in English, but  also include documents in other European languages.  Interviews and groups discussion with the expert group  The study team conducted a series of semi-structured expert interviews with each of the members of  the study’s expert group. The aim of these interviews was to access these experts’ knowledge of the  field of smart home security and to identify additional documentary material for the study. The  interviews also allowed for the cross-checking of information from the documentary sources. A semi- structured approach starts with initial questions and topics for discussion but does not use a fixed  standardised question schedule. This allows the interviews to address emergent and unexpected  topics, whilst still covering the necessary material. The interviews lasted between thirty minutes and  one hour and allowed for detailed examination of specific issues and threats. The study team  supplemented individual interviews with expert group discussions and answers to written questions.  The study team provided the expert group with drafts of the report, as well as key components, such  as the valuable assets diagram, for consultation throughout the drafting process.  Issues in data collection on the specific topic  Security issues in smart homes, and those focused upon converged media and television, overlap with  other areas of research, in particular, information security, the Internet of Things, home automation,  communications, cloud security, privacy and data protection. The Internet of Things is an area  attracting attention from the general and specialist press. In some cases, relatively minor press  releases, reports or studies on smart home security have been taken up by numerous other blogs and  content aggregators, creating something of an echo-chamber, where the same basic claim is repeated  by several sources, and later appears as fact without citation. As is common with other areas of  information security, data on vulnerabilities and potential technical exploits are much more easily  available than verifiable information on actually occurring threats.  mailto:resilience@enisa.europa.eu  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 10  4 Valuable assets in smart homes and converged media  The figure below (Figure 1: Overview of Smart Home and Converged Media Assets) provides an  overview of smart home assets. An asset is anything that has value and therefore requires  protection38. Owners value assets and wish to minimise risks to those assets. Threat agents wish to  abuse, co-opt and/or damage assets, and thereby give rise to threats that increase risk to assets.  Any such typology or categorisation exercise is variable, reflecting the purpose behind the  categorisation. As such, several different approaches to categories could have been identified, with  individual assets potentially placed within multiple categories. When such a decision was required, it  was guided by the exposure of the assets to related threat families. This categorisation therefore  serves to underpin the following threat landscape. Many of these assets could be further decomposed  into components and sub-processes, and the categorisation here attempts to strike a balance between  covering key significant categories and relevant detail.  In this threat landscape the following assets groups have been identified: Sensors, Software, Human- machine interface devices, Home networking, Audio/Visual, Information Storage, Home appliances,  Integrated Home services, Robotics, Tags and markers, Building security, connected transportation,  Medical, Information, Management/operation, and People/living. Identified assets and sub-assets are  categorised and listed under these assets groups. E.g., under the asset group Sensors, the assets  Temperature, Lights, Microphones, etc. are listed.  This asset list has been developed from an examination of common models of actual and potential  smart homes, guided by the development scenarios outline in the previous section. Given the modular  and potentially idiosyncratic nature of real-world smart home set-ups, the study team does not  suggest that all smart homes will necessarily contain all of these assets. Individual set-ups will be  determined by a mixture of occupant or owner choices and requirements, budgets, available  technology, and compatibility with existing or legacy systems. Smart homes might be understood as  sitting somewhere on a continuum from those with a small number of such assets to those that include  the full range. Regardless, the different classes of assets result in complex environments even within  a single home, since they are produced by different manufacturers and may be installed in an ad hoc  manner.  Smart home technology, including converged media and television, is still developing, and new  applications are being developed. The study team hopes this categorisation of assets will remain  relevant for some years due to the selected level of abstraction and the capacity of several categories  to accept new assets.  The asset list includes non-ICT assets where these assets are exposed to potential harm from ICT assets  and where those assets may be a potential route to attack ICT assets.  38 ISO/IEC 27005:2011 Information technology – security techniques – Information security risk management.

The threats included in this collection of threats are all applicable to the smart home assets presented  in the previous section. The presented threat taxonomy covers mainly cyber-security threats, that is,  threats applying to information and communication technology assets. Some additional non-IT threats  have been assumed in order to cover threats to physical assets that are necessary to operate the  considered ICT-assets. This threat taxonomy draws upon the threat taxonomies developed for the  ENISA Threat Landscape 201339 and the Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide40.  Please note that the use of colour is to distinguish between threat categories, and does not signify any  correlation between threats in this figure and assets in the previous figure.  In this threat landscape the following threats groups have been identified: Physical attacks,  Unintentional damage (accidental), Disasters, Damage/Loss (IT assets), Failures/Malfunctions,  Outages, Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking, Nefarious activity/Abuse, and Legal.  Identified threats and sub-threats are categorised and listed under these threat groups. E.g., under  the threat group Unintentional damage (accidental), the threats Information leakage or sharing,  Erroneous use or administration of devices and systems, Using information from an unreliable source,  etc. are listed.  The specific smart home threats are described in Section 6.  39 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats, Op. cit, 2013.

Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 14  6 Specific smart home threats  By analysing existing literature on smart home and converged media security (See Section 3:  Methodology), we have identified specific threats that have been taken into account in existing  assessments. These threats include some widely applicable cyber security threats, which manifest in  particular ways in the smart home environment, as well as threats that emerged from the specific  smart home research.  The threats analysed include those that are applicable to the specific smart home with a focus upon  converged media infrastructure, as set out in Section 2. The specific smart home threats encountered  in the analysed literature are structured below, according to the categories mentioned in Figure 2:  Overview of Threats Assumed for Smart Home Assets. They are presented by means of threat details  of particular threats and threat groups.  The sequence of the specific smart home threats presented below is not prioritised because the  analysed material has not provided any information that would allow prioritising threats. Given the  fact that no significant experience exists in this domain from existing implementations (i.e., through  incident statistics in this area), no attempt has been made to introduce any priorities for these threats.  Threat Group: Physical attacks  The majority of smart home assets are physically located objects, which can be physically damaged,  and many have a financial value motivating theft. These smart home assets are therefore potentially  vulnerable to physical attacks, which may remove or damage the assets, degrading or preventing their  functionality. Physical attacks can also disrupt the communications between smart home  components.  Some smart home assets, such as smart phones, tablets, removable storage media and computers,  may physically move in and out of the home making them more vulnerable when outside. Smart  homes may feature sensors on the exterior of the building, which may make them more vulnerable to  sabotage or damage than internal components.  Physical access to smart home assets is important as many manufacturers assume that only the device  owner will have physical access to the device, thus ensuring security. Physical access to smart home  devices can allow for uploading new software 41 , adding hardware components, changing device  settings, and even extracting encryption keys42.  Threat Group: Unintentional damage (accidental)  Threat: Information leakage or sharing  Smart homes are complex networks of sensors and collect significant information on inhabitants.  Inhabitants and visitors may reveal more information to the smart home sensors than they intend or  anticipate, and may further share information through incorrect security settings43.  41 Lawler, R., “Nest Learning Thermostat has its security cracked open by GTV Hacker”, June 23rd 2014.  http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/23/nest-thermostat-rooted/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  42 Bowers, B., “ZigBee Wireless Security: A New Age Penetration Tester's Toolkit”, 9 January 2012.  http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1823368&seqNum=4 [accessed 20 October 2014]  43 Ward, M., “Why your washing machine is a security risk”, BBC, 4 August 2014.  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479  [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/23/nest-thermostat-rooted/ http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1823368&seqNum=4 http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 15  Many smart home and converged media devices lack dedicated security software and secure  encrypted communications (due to a lack of processing or electrical power, the added cost and  decreased convenience of adding encryption, or the difficulty of correctly establishing secure  communications). This increases the likelihood of unintentional information leakage.  The way the smart home is organised impacts upon the probability of information leakage. For  example, smart home technologies that make use of cloud services for information storage are reliant  upon the security of those services to prevent information leakage, in addition to securing information  inside the smart home. The greater the number of external connections, the greater the chance of  information leakage.  Additionally, the service providers that collect and process smart home data may be acquired by other  companies in a way that is unanticipated by the data subject. These companies may then process the  data collected in unanticipated ways, and potentially against the interests and wishes of the data  subject44.  Threat: Erroneous use or administration of devices or systems  Smart homes are complex systems with multiple devices and technologies, and with complex  interoperability between them, through different protocols, which can make administration a difficult  task. Smart homes are further complicated through any form of automation or learning, which can be  hard to anticipate. Smart home systems can be powerful (heating, lighting, water, physical access) and  erroneous use of these can therefore cause physical damage to the systems themselves or to the  home environment generally. Despite attempts to make smart home interaction “natural”, many of  the design techniques and cues that simplify interaction with a graphical user interface are not  available with sensor-based systems 45 . For example, multiple errors can occur through voice- controlled smart home systems46.  Threat: Using information from an unreliable source  Automated smart home systems that respond to the behaviour of inhabitants (for example, heating  that comes on when an inhabitant arrives home) may be activated on the basis of unreliable sensor  readings, leading to un-required activation. Compromised devices can be redirected towards  unreliable sources. Smart TVs that allow the broadcaster control over the purported origin of web  content would allow a malicious broadcaster to inject any script of his choice into websites accessed  through the TV47 48.  44Davies, S., “Google takes a dangerous stride from your hear to your home”.  http://www.privacysurgeon.org/blog/incision/google-takes-a-bold-stride-from-your-head-to-your-home/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  45 Bellotti, V., Back, M.

Threat: Inadequate design and planning or a lack of adaptation  Inadequate design and planning are key issues for smart homes as they can cause security and privacy  problems. Inadequate design can occur at the level of smart home components and services, and at  the level of the general installation and integration of the smart home as a whole.  At the component level, poor security design can range from a lack of security methods to poor  implementation of security. For example, incorrectly set up Secure Sockets Layer certificates may  mean that information is transmitted without encryption49. Or a device might ship with unchangeable  default passwords50. Smart home components may be developed by manufacturers with limited  experience of security design, as they add connectivity to their existing products. Alternatively,  security features may be limited in order to keep the cost of the devices affordable. Smart TVs may  have a combination of over-the-air updates, and a lack of firewalls51.  With the increase in stand-alone smart gadgets that connect to existing Wi-Fi networks, smart home  functionality can be created piece-by-piece in an ad-hoc manner by inexperienced users. These users  may not plan for the security of the smart home as a whole. The absence of privacy-by-design52  measures in the smart home also exposes the smart home to unwanted information leakage and its  potential misuse.  Threat Group: Disasters (natural, environmental)  Threats from disasters are not particularly prevalent in the current literature on smart home security,  with the exception of the potential role of flood detection systems and general emergency alert  systems. However, physical smart home assets are as vulnerable to these threats as any other physical  device. Smart home components are often integrated into the structure of a building, or otherwise  installed in appropriate locations within it (for example, wall mounted sensors). They can also be quite  large (e.g., integrated smart heating system) and are therefore difficult to move in response to a  disaster. Smart home and converged media systems are sensitive electronics networked together in a  complicated arrangement and are therefore vulnerable to changes in the environment. Fire, flood,  pollution, dust, corrosion, lightning53, water, violent physical movement and unfavourable climatic  conditions are likely to significantly degrade or prevent smart home functionality and decrease the  49 Wisniewski, C., Smart meter hacking can disclose which TV shows and movies you watch, 8 January 2012.  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/01/08/28c3-smart-meter-hacking-can-disclose-which-tv-shows-and- movies-you-watch/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  50 Chirgwin, R., “SmartTV, dumb vuln: Philips hard-codes Miracast passwords”, The Register, 2 Apr 2014.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/04/02/smarttv_dumb_vuln_philips_hardcodes_miracast_passwords/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  51 Roberts, P., “Samsung Smart TV: Like A Web App Riddled With Vulnerabilities”, 1 August 2013.  https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with-vulnerabilities/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  52 About “privacy-by-design”, see, for instance, Privacy and data protection by design --- bridging policy and  technology (provisional title), a work conducted by ENISA in 2014, to be published on the ENISA website.

Building management systems may be placed under particular  strain from extreme changes in climate and environment. Natural disasters are likely to cause outages  in services necessary for the smart home, including Internet connection and electrical power54 55.  Additionally, natural disasters can have long lasting impacts56.  In contrast with physical components, virtual assets in a connected smart home with converged  media, can be better protected from physical threats due to external storage in the cloud. The specific  location of threat is important for determining the vulnerability of an asset. For example, external  information storage is not vulnerable to natural disaster in the location of smart home, but is  vulnerable to natural disaster in the location of the server.  Threat Group: Damages or loss (IT assets)  Threat: Damage caused by a third-party  (Similar to Threat Group: Physical attack, see above).  Threat: Loss from DRM (Digital rights management) conflicts  Media content use in the smart home and converged media environment may be protected by digital  rights management methods, both in software and in hardware. Hardware devices can be protected  against tampering through certificates and tamper-switches. Improperly implemented DRM might  result in the blocking or deletion of legitimately owned media content or in extreme cases to damage  to hardware (“bricking”) 57. DRM policies may also prevent access to desired functions58.  Threat: Loss of (integrity of) sensitive information  Smart homes and converged media devices potentially collect and store large amount of sensitive  information and this increases the attack surface and the opportunity for information leakage. This  can be exacerbated by poor security design, implementation or management and by a lack of  encrypted communication59. Additionally, it may not be immediately obvious to smart home users  what information can be collected by the smart home, and how sensitive this information might be  (and therefore what is the appropriate level of protection). Many smart home and converged media  devices lack dedicated security software and secure encrypted communications (due to a lack of  54 Heidemann, J., Quan, L., and Pradki, J., “A Preliminary Analysis of Network Outages during Hurricane Sandy”,  USC/ISI Technical Report, ISI-TR-685b, February 2013. ftp://ftp.isi.edu/isi-pubs/tr-685.pdf [accessed 27 October  2014]  55 Erjongmanee, S., Chuanyi, J., Stokely J. and Hightower N., “Interference of Network-Service Disruption upon  Natural Disasters”, Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data, Springer, 2010.  http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  56 ENISA, Annual Incident Reports 2013, 16 September 2014. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience- and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013, p. iii.  57 North, D., Using piracy devices could brick your Nintendo 3DS, 3 July 2011.  http://www.destructoid.com/using-piracy-devices-could-brick-your-nintendo-3ds-195895.phtml [accessed 20  October 2014]  58 Cushing, T., \"LG Will Take the 'Smart' Out Of Your Smart TV If You Don't Agree To Share Your Viewing And  Search Data With Third Parties”, 20 May 2014. https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg- will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third- parties.shtml [accessed 20 October 2014]  59 Goodin, D., “Crypto weakness in smart LED lightbulbs exposes Wi-Fi passwords”, 7 July 2014.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  ftp://ftp.isi.edu/isi-pubs/tr-685.pdf http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013 http://www.destructoid.com/using-piracy-devices-could-brick-your-nintendo-3ds-195895.phtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 18  processing or electrical power, the added cost and decreased convenience of adding encryption, or  the difficulty of correctly establishing secure communications). This increases the likelihood of  unintentional information leakage.  Threat: Loss or destruction of devices, storage media, and documents  Smart home and converged media systems are likely to store significant media and documents. Unless  stored in external cloud storage systems, these are likely to be retained in the home itself. Documents  and media in the smart home may include both physical and digital media. Some smart home devices  are mobile and may be exposed to damage or loss outside the smart home, where data leakage  resulting from device loss of threat is one of the highest risks60.  Threat: Loss of information in the cloud  Loss of smart home-related information (sensor records, activity, preferences and settings, account  details) stored in the cloud can lead to the loss of functionality of cloud-based services61, or the system  to return to factory default. Information in the cloud also likely includes media content, documents  and files, which are valuable, and may be either costly, or impossible to replace. Cloud service  providers themselves may go out of business, making stored information inaccessible62.  Threat: Information leakage  The smart home offers significant opportunities for surveillance, espionage, law enforcement, social  surveillance (voyeurism) and other potential invasions of privacy. In addition to the nefarious  activity/abuse threats described below, information could leak from improper destruction of smart  home components, particularly memory and storage63.  Threat Group: Failures/malfunctions  Smart homes and converged media devices are complex systems, reliant upon a number of different  inputs, and are vulnerable to failures and malfunctions64. In many cases failure or malfunction will  result in the smart home service being unavailable. In some cases this will be a minor nuisance, for  example being unable to access media, but in others could result in costly damage, for example, a  defrosted freezer, or doors that cannot be opened without repair. Impacts will be dependent upon  the failure states of the devices and how they are designed to deal with disruption of service, power  supply or communication links. Cloud-based smart home and media services are reliant upon the  Internet connection for services and may be nearly useless without it. Recovery from failure can be  60 See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-applications/smartphone-security- 1/top-ten-risks [accessed 20 October 2014]  61 Dabbs, A., “Cloud computing is FAIL and here’s why”, The Register, 16 May 2014.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/16/cloud_computing_is_fail_and_heres_why/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  62 Lawton, S., “When Cloud Providers Fail: Creating A Cloud Storage Backup Plan”, 7 January 2014.  http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/cloud-storage-backup-plan,1-1529.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  63 Doner, K., “Information Security and Computer Disposal”, Property Professional.  https://www.npma.org/Archives/Vol.18-1-Donner.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  64 Kapitanova, K., Hoque, E., Stankovic, J.

For example, a device might have to be physically reset or  rebooted by the user, who may be physically remote.  A particular issue for smart home services, and for devices in general, is that if the service or vendor  company goes out of business then the device may no longer be supported and updated, and spare  parts may not be available. This may leave vulnerabilities un-patched or remove particular  functionality from the smart home. This may be a particular risk in a relatively emergent market with  a large number of start-up companies, which may be at high risk of failure and leave users without  services65.  As with other areas of electronics, the quality of smart home components may be variable and some  devices may be more likely to malfunction than others within a category66. Smart gadgets might be  appealing to counterfeit manufacturers.  Exploiting failure states can facilitate other threats. For example, if a component that has lost network  connectivity it may search for other networks to connect to, which may allow it to be hijacked.  Threat Group: Outages  Smart homes are reliant upon a range of resources and services to provide sophisticated functionality.  Outages in these inputs can have a negative impact upon the functionality of the smart home.  Threat: Lack of resources/electricity  Smart home and converged media systems require electricity. Whilst some of the smaller components  can operate on battery power, the larger systems, including integrated home services, and most  audio-visual and home networking, will require mains power. Functionality of these devices will be  significantly degraded or stop entirely, with a loss of electricity. Major home integrated services such  as heating and plumbing also require input from external services to function.  In some cases short term outages will be a minor nuisance, for example being unable to access media,  but in others could result in costly damage, for example, a defrosted freezer. The level of disruption is  dependent upon the failure states of the devices and how they are designed to deal with disruption  of service, power supply or communication links. Recovery from outages can be complicated by the  design of the system. For example, a device might have to be physically reset or rebooted by the user,  who may be physically remote or unaware of the problem.  Threat: Internet outage  Internet outage to the smart home will prevent any remote access to the smart home systems from  outside, and will prevent the smart home from accessing an external resources dependent upon an  active Internet connection. In particular for converged media, this will include any media content  delivered over IP or stored in the cloud.  Threat: Loss of support services  Support services includes any cloud services, any monitoring, security or analytics services not locally  hosted, and support services (including call centres and helplines) for audio-visual services. This can  65 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU [accessed 20 October 2014]  66 Hnat, T. W., Srinivasan, V., Lu, J., Sookoor, T.

Loss of support services may make the routine operation of the smart home more difficult, but are  likely to be particularly problematic in the event of another failure or problem, as the absence of  support services will complicate recovery, as advice, guidance, and potential service replacement, may  not be available.  Threat: Absence of personnel  In the domestic smart home context described in section two, the knowledge and skills required to  manage the smart home are likely to be unevenly distributed amongst the inhabitants; for instance,  some members of a family may not know how to operate the smart home, or may not be allowed to.  The absence of the owner/controller of the smart home, or other knowledgeable inhabitants, may  complicate general operation, recovery from error, or response to attacks and threats.  Threat: Strikes  In this context, strikes as a threat are most likely to manifest as outages in electricity, support services,  or other resources, with impacts as above. Some warning may be available.  Threat: Network outages  Network outages in the smart home with converged media may occur as a result of hardware failure  or software error, interference, deliberate attack, or power failure. The result would include a loss of  local connectivity between smart home components, with a resulting near total loss of smart home  functionality. Additionally, network outages outside the home might degrade functionality, depending  upon what services, capabilities or information are stored or provided externally.  Threat Group: Eavesdropping/interception/hijacking  Eavesdropping, interception and hijacking are key threats to smart homes and converged media. The  large number of sensors, as well as devices that log fine-grained details of the behaviour of people in  the home, produces significant information on the inhabitants such as their regular habits, consumer  activity, presence or absence, health, and preferences. This information is valuable for several actors,  both illegal and illegal. Secondly, smart homes feature high levels of communication between different  devices over a range of protocols and technologies. These increasingly include wireless protocols such  as Wi-Fi, Z-wave67, Zigbee, Bluetooth and others.  End devices do not have the processing power (or energy if on batteries) for encryption in the home,  which makes them very vulnerable to sniffing, replay attacks, man in the middle and taking control of  the gadgets when in physical proximity. Smart TVs and other converged media devices may  themselves log viewing habits, and may transmit these logs to the manufacturer, or to a service  provider68. The physical location of the smart TV, often in the centre of a home, provides a good  position for monitoring a location and the activity within it69.  67 Fouladi, B., and Ghanoun, S., “Security Evaluation of the Z-wave Wireless Protocol.”  http://research.sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20 Z-Wave_WP.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  68 McAllister, N., “You THINK you're watching your LG smart TV - but IT's WATCHING YOU, baby  Phones home with the names of videos you watch, too”, The Register, 20 Nov 2013.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/20/lg_smart_tv_data_collection/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  69 Ferrante D., Auriemma, L., Smart TV INsecurity, 2014,  http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://research.sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20Z-Wave_WP.pdf http://research.sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20Z-Wave_WP.pdf http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/20/lg_smart_tv_data_collection/ http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 21  Lifestyle data gathered from the smart home is likely to be very attractive to advertisers and data- miners70.  Threat: War driving  War driving involves seeking out vulnerable wireless communications in a mobile manner (for example  from a moving vehicle or walking with a portable device). The wireless communications protocols in  the smart home may extend some distance from the house itself, making them vulnerable to war  driving. It is likely that multiple smart homes will be located in the same area, making these areas an  attractive target for war driving. If wireless networks are accessed through war driving, then the  attackers may be able to effect physical and visible changes to the smart home (e.g. turn lights on/off)  that will confirm the physical location of the identified network. War driving may serve as a relatively  slow way of identifying unsecured building automation systems71. War driving has been demonstrated  for the ZigBee protocol72.  Threat: Interception of compromising emissions  It is possible to detect what TV programme is being watched based upon monitoring the electricity  consumption of a smart TV73.  Threat: Interception of information  As threats for the general category of Eavesdropping/Interception/hijacking. Smart home and  converged media environments contain large amounts of information, which is communicated  through multiple protocols with differing levels of security. For example, signals from video-over-IP  cameras can be intercepted and received by an attacker74.  It is difficult to learn that much about individual behaviour from a single smart device, but with  multiple devices and some contextual knowledge it becomes easier to make inferences about  behaviour. At least sufficient to support aggressive advertising, reminders, deals etc. and this can  influence the inhabitants’ way of living.  Threat: Interfering radiation  Multiple smart home devices from different manufacturers, using different wireless communication  protocols may potentially interfere with each other, or compete for bandwidth. Multiple smart homes  in close proximity may experience interference between Wi-Fi on the same channel causing the signal  70 Ward, M., Op. cit., http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 [accessed 20 October 2014]  71 Storm, D., “Botnets coming soon to a smart home or automated building near you”, Computerworld, 4 June  2014. http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a- smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  72 Goodsspeed, T., “Wardriving for Zigbee”, 23February 2012.  http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/wardriving-for-zigbee.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  73 Brinkhaus, S., Carluccio, D., Greveler, U., Justus, B., Löhr, D., Wegener, C., “Smart Hacking For Privacy”.  http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/1968_28c3-abstract- smart_hacking_for_privacy.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  74 Larose, C., Veness, A., “Internet Peeping Toms and The Internet of Things Face New Hurdles: FTC Settles with  TRENDnet, Inc.”, 10September 2013. http://www.privacyandsecuritymatters.com/2013/09/Internet-peeping- toms-and-the-Internet-of-things-face-new-hurdles-ftc-settles-with-trendnet-inc/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a-smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a-smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/wardriving-for-zigbee.html http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/1968_28c3-abstract-smart_hacking_for_privacy.pdf http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/1968_28c3-abstract-smart_hacking_for_privacy.pdf http://www.privacyandsecuritymatters.com/2013/09/internet-peeping-toms-and-the-internet-of-things-face-new-hurdles-ftc-settles-with-trendnet-inc/ http://www.privacyandsecuritymatters.com/2013/09/internet-peeping-toms-and-the-internet-of-things-face-new-hurdles-ftc-settles-with-trendnet-inc/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 22  quality to degrade. Deliberate jamming of smart home communications may also be possible75, and  jamming devices designed for common smart home frequencies are available for sale76.  Threat: Replay of messages  Replay attacks involve replaying captured packets back to a smart home network in order to replay  the previous activity. Smart home wireless communications protocols, including ZigBee have minimal  protection against replay attacks77. These can attack wireless communication components from within  radio range of the smart home78. Replaying control signals in smart homes may allow for the bypassing  of locks and other security systems.  Threat: Network reconnaissance and information gathering  Network reconnaissance in the smart home and converged media context involves building up a  model of the smart home network, its systems and services, and its vulnerabilities. Network  reconnaissance may be the precursor to other forms of attack. Internet connected devices with poor  security (including smart TVs79) may facilitate reconnaissance of other devices connected to the same  network.  Threat: Man-in-the-middle/session hijacking  Man-in-the-middle attacks involve an attacker making independent connections with two parties or  devices and relaying communications between them. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on  communications and control other elements of the communication. In this smart home context this  might include common devices which lack properly implemented encrypted communications80 81and  end point authentication, such as unencrypted wireless access points, and baby monitors 82 .  Vulnerabilities that could allow man-in-the-middle attacks have been identified in the ZigBee and Z- Wave protocols83.  75 Mpitziopoulos, A., Gavalas, D., Konstantopoulos, C., Pantziou, G., \"A survey on jamming attacks and  countermeasures in WSNs\", Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE, vol.11, no.4, pp.42, 56, Fourth Quarter  2009.  76 See for instance: http://www.jammer-store.com/868mhz-car-remote-control-jammer.html [accessed 20  October 2014]  77 Bowers, B., “ZigBee Wireless Security: A New Age Penetration Tester's Toolkit”, 9 January 2012.  http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1823368&seqNum=4 [accessed 20 October 2014]  78 Reuter, T., Security analysis of wireless communication standards for home automation, Der Technischen  Universität München, 15 November 2013, p.5  https://www.sec.in.tum.de/assets/Uploads/MAThomasReuter.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  79 Oren Y., and Keromytis, A.

Threat: Repudiation of actions  Repudiation of actions involves the malicious manipulation or falsification of the identification of  actions, often involving the deletion of logs. Within the smart home and converged media this would  allow for attackers to cover their involvement in an action, including access to smart home services,  or to attribute actions to others, including smart home inhabitants85 86.  Threat Group: Nefarious activity/abuse  Threat: Identity fraud  Smart homes systems may store and manage credentials for various functions and services which the  home provides and makes use of. These credentials may be for use internally (identity, user accounts,  permissions, preferences and settings or access conditions) or externally (media accounts, cloud  storage, billing and home delivery, security alarms, external management or analytics). These  credentials are likely to include payment details (credit card or account numbers) which are desirable  targets for financially motivated cyber criminals87. Information about user behaviour, preferences,  habits, travel, media consumption etc., collected and stored in the smart home, may assist more  detailed forms of impersonation fraud. A more local form of identity fraud can include the  unauthorised use of smart home user accounts belonging to other inhabitants.  Threat: Unsolicited and infected email  Smart home devices may have their own email accounts (this is common for web-connected printers  and for e-reader devices) and this can be exploited to send messages to these devices, potentially as  a form of spam88, but also as a delivery vector for malware.  Threat: Denial of service  Traditional denial of service and distributed denial or service attacks on information systems can be  threats to the smart home, given Internet-connected components89. Such attacks may be the first step  84 Upton, L., “Rickmote: Rickrolling Chromecast users”, 16 July 2014. http ://www.raspberrypi.org/rickmote- rickrolling-chromecast-users/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  85 Mantas, G., Lymberopoulos, D., and Komninos, N., “Security in the Smart Home Environment”, Wireless  Technologies for Ambient Assisted Living and Healthcare, 2011. http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless- technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 [accessed 27 October 2014]  86 Krishnamurthy, P., Kabara, J., and Anusasamornkul, T., (2002).

The physical elements in the smart home environment also offer the possibility of physical denial of  service attacks90. If an attacker can gain control of smart home components then she could activate  these in order to deny access and use to legitimate users (for example, repeatedly turning lights on  and off, lock all access to and from the building91, turning off heating, changing media source, playing  loud music, etc.).  Threat: Malicious code/software activity  Malicious code and software activity underpin many of the other threats to the smart home and  converged media. Many smart home devices are essentially computers, often running a variant of  Linux and with the capacity to perform other functions92 93. They can therefore be reprogrammed by  an attacker with access to run software that the attacker desires. This generative functionality has  been demonstrated on multiple devices from large manufacturers94 and is likely to also affect home- built or custom smart environments. This opens up a wider range of threats, including monitoring  network traffic, controlling other devices, and extracting information stored in the system (including  both sensitive personal data and media content). In addition to accessing the information systems in  the smart home, the Internet connected devices can potentially be used for external functions desired  by the attacker, for example, hosting malware or illegal websites, operating as part of a botnet, or  sending spam emails95 96. For some smart home devices, physical access is advantageous for installing  malicious code.  Threat: Abuse of information leakage  See also “Information leakage” under “Physical attacks”, and “Unintentional damage”. Information  leakage can be exploited for further nefarious activity including crime and surveillance97.  90 Wendzel, S., Zwanger, V., Meier, M., and Szlósarczyk, S., “Envisioning Smart Building Botnets”, Sicherheit  2014. http://www.wendzel.de/dr.org/files/Papers/EnvisioningSmartBuildings.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  91 Storm, D., “Botnets coming soon to a smart home or automated building near you”, Computerworld, 4 June  2014, http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a- smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  92 Stross C., Trust Me (I’m a kettle), December 12, 2013, http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog- static/2013/12/trust-me.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  93 Leyden, J., “Patch Bash NOW: ‘Shellshock’ bug blasts OS X, Linux systems wide open”, The Register, 24  September 2014, http ://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/09/24/bash_shell_vuln/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  94 HP, Internet of Things Research Study, July 2014. http ://fortifyprotect.com/HP_IoT_Research_Study.pdf  [accessed 20 October 2014]  95Proofpoint Inc., “Your Fridge is Full of SPAM, part II: Details”, 21 January 2014.  http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/your-fridge-is-full-of-spam-part-ll-details.php ; Goodin, D., “Is  your refrigerator really part of a massive spam-sending botnet?”, 17 January 2014.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/is-your-refrigerator-really-part-of-a-massive-spam-sending-botnet/ ;  Thomas, P., “Despite the News, Your Refrigerator is Not Yet Sending Spam”, 23 January 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/despite-news-your-refrigerator-not-yet-sending-spam [All accessed  20 October 2014]  96 Hussein, E., Talmat, S., “Behind ADSL Lines: How to Bankrupt ISPs While Making Money”, 28 March 2013.  http://blog.ioactive.com/2013/03/behind-adsl-lines-how-to-bankrupt-isps.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  97 Titlow, J.

This can then be used to force updates,  potentially containing malware or undesired functionality, to smart home components.  Threat: Manipulation of hardware and software  Vulnerabilities have been identified in many smart TV systems from different manufacturers, which  allow for the software running on the TV set to be altered99. Smart home hardware may potentially  be pre-manipulated during production to include undesired functions, spyware, or hardware  backdoors100. Smart home inhabitants many manipulate their own hardware (for example, hacking a  set-top box to receive additional TV services101), which may violate license conditions if this hardware  is not fully owned, or is required to be in a particular state to receive services.  Threat: Manipulation of information  Smart home sensors could be fed false information, which could be particularly important for access  or for bypassing security measures (biometric sensors or facial recognition). Falsification of records  could be part of blackmail, fraud or escalation of privileges. Smart home audio-visual systems could  be used to display false data. HbbTV broadcasts allow for an attacker to insert malicious content over  a large geographical footprint102.  Threat: Misuse of audit tools  Audit tools, such as system logs103 will collate a large amount of information on behaviour in the smart  home from which information on the inhabitants could be extrapolated.  Threat: Falsification of records  Falsification of records could be used to plant false records in order to embarrass or blackmail  inhabitants, as well as to hide other nefarious behaviour (theft, illegal access, etc.) from the system  owner. This is necessary for long-term misuse of smart home assets and is a component of rootkits104.  98 Bodnar, C., Op. cit. https://blog.kaspersky.co.uk/dont-shop-or-bank-with-a-smart-tv/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  99 “European HbbTV Smart TV Holes Make Sets Hackable”,  http ://it.slashdot.org/story/13/06/05/1216232/european-hbbtv-smart-tv-holes-make-sets-hackable [accessed  20 October 2014]  100 Sharwood, S., “Don’t Brew That Cuppa!

These provide access to control over the smart  home’s functions. Exploitation of app-based control methods for smart devices is possible to gain  access to and control over the device106. In some contexts, for example elder-care and medical devices,  administration tools might be located off-site to administer a number of smart homes together.  Gaining access to these administrative credentials would allow an attacker to control multiple smart  homes at the same time.  Threat: Unauthorised access to the information system/network  Unauthorised access to the information system in the smart home context allows for the extraction  of information about the inhabitants, including their behaviours, preferences, and credentials. It  allows the attacker to change settings, and install or manipulate software. Unauthorised access allows  the user to replicate all the activity available to the legitimate user, and therefore for act as an  inhabitant. They can then access media and other information, cause operations and effect physical  changes107 (including remotely), and can cause downloads, purchases etc., feed false information to  sensors, and access information and records. Depending upon the extent to which the smart home  design has integrated different accounts and services, then access to the smart home administration  potentially offers access to a number of different services. Access can be facilitated by poorly set-up  access controls108.  Threat: Unauthorised use of software  Unauthorised use of software that is legitimately installed on smart home components could include  remote activation, as well as event logging, identification/authentication methods, use of any installed  apps, visualisation tools or web-based control panels. Unauthorised use of existing software could  include the exploitation of very common pieces of software109 110.  105 Emspak, J., “A Phone That Lies for You”, 1 June 2014. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-phone- that-lies-for-you-an-android-hack-allows-users-to-put-decoy-data-on-a-smartphone/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  106 Ward, M., Op. cit. http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 [accessed 20 October 2014]  107 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/13/wave_goodbye_to_security_with_zwave/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  108 Ray, B., “Revealed: Simple ‘open sesame’ to unlock your home by radiowave”, 13 Aug 2013.  http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access- 5926.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  109 Heilman, D., “Hackers Exploit Shellshock, Much More Trouble Awaits”, 29 September 2014.  http://www.toptechnews.com/article/index.php?story_id=00100018PJ5T [accessed 20 October 2014]  110 Zolfagharifard E., Woollaston, V.,“Bash bug could be worse than Heartbleed’: ‘Catastrophic’ flaw may  threaten the security of millions of internet-connected devices”, 24 September 2014.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2769514/Bash-bug-worse-Heartbleed-Catastrophic-flaw- threaten-security-millions-Internet-connected-devices.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-phone-that-lies-for-you-an-android-hack-allows-users-to-put-decoy-data-on-a-smartphone/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-phone-that-lies-for-you-an-android-hack-allows-users-to-put-decoy-data-on-a-smartphone/ http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/13/wave_goodbye_to_security_with_zwave/ http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.toptechnews.com/article/index.php?story_id=00100018PJ5T http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2769514/Bash-bug-worse-Heartbleed-Catastrophic-flaw-threaten-security-millions-internet-connected-devices.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2769514/Bash-bug-worse-Heartbleed-Catastrophic-flaw-threaten-security-millions-internet-connected-devices.html  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 27  Threat: Unauthorised installation of software  See “Badware” (below) for likely threats emerging from unauthorised installation of software.  Unauthorised installation of software by inhabitants might compromise licensing agreements or might  expose the system to trojans or backdoors included in cracked versions of software111.  Threat: Compromising confidential information  The sensors in the smart home (microphones, video, face recognition, biometrics) in physical space,  as well as the activity logging through various devices and accounts allows for the collection of highly  granular confidential information on inhabitants and visitors112 113. This information may be stored  locally, or transmitted over local networks, and even into cloud storage. This also applies to  confidential documents that might be stored on the home network. Attackers could compromise this  confidential information through access to any of the relevant components, but particularly through  access to physical and remote storage, the network router, or the smart home hub. Attackers may  also compromise this confidential information by undermining security measures, including  encryption.  Threat: Abuse of authorizations  The smart home and converged media context offers a large number of potential user accounts for  media services, as well as external smart home services. This increases the number of authorizations  that could be misused. This would include the sharing of accounts within or between households when  this is not authorised by the content provider. A common example in converged media is the use of  one streaming media account by multiple people in different locations114.  Threat: Abuse of personal data  The significant personal data on inhabitants and visitors that could be collected by the sensors and  system logs in a smart home115 could be valuable for a range of purposes that may not be desired by  the smart home owner. These purposes include targeted advertising, profiling and categorisation,  identity fraud, disclosure of personal information, espionage, journalism, law-enforcement, and  general invasions of privacy.  Threat: Hoax  The smart home with converged media can support hoax activity in three ways. Firstly, it contains a  number of information sources, which could be fed false information, in order to propagate a hoax.  111 Reisinger, D., “Could your printer be a Trojan horse? Researchers say yes!”, 29 November 2011.  http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/could-your-printer-be-a-trojan-horse-researchers-say-yes/ accessed 20  October 2014 [accessed 27 October 2014]  112 O’Hara, K., “Privacy and the Internet of Things”, Internet of Things Ecosystem – the Next 40 Billion Devices,  NESTA, 3 June 2014.  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf [accessed  27 October 2014]  113 http://readwrite.com/2013/03/18/smart-homes-our-next-digital-privacy-nightmare [accessed 20 October  2014]  114 http ://gigaom.com/2012/02/13/tv-everywhere-password-sharing/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  115 Haowen, C., and Perrig, A., “Security and Privacy in Sensor Networks”, IEEE Computer, 36(10), October  2003. https ://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/group/pub/chan_perrig_secure_sensor_article.pdf [accessed 27 October  2014]  http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/could-your-printer-be-a-trojan-horse-researchers-say-yes/ http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf http://readwrite.com/2013/03/18/smart-homes-our-next-digital-privacy-nightmare http://gigaom.com/2012/02/13/tv-everywhere-password-sharing/ https://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/group/pub/chan_perrig_secure_sensor_article.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 28  For instance, the system that inserts adverts into streamed content on a smart TV could be exploited  to push hoax content to the viewer, or web-enabled displays in the home could display false  information. Secondly, an attacker could falsely trigger alarm systems in the home116; alarms for  invisible, odourless dangers such as carbon monoxide would be particularly effective for this. Thirdly,  attackers with access to the smart home components could fake a system crash or error, or virus, and  then offer to repair this as a method of gaining physical access to the home or further access to other  components.  Threat: Badware  As many smart home components are functional computers, they can be affected by the full range of  malicious software, although some may need to be customised to take full advantage of the smart  home context. This can include spyware, adware, ransomware, key and activity logging, traffic  monitoring software117 118. As many smart home components lack the capacity to run security software  and even lack a graphical display, the presence and activity of this malicious software can remain  undetected for long periods of time. It may be possible to utilise the broadcast network to place  badware on smart TVs through the HbbTv protocol119.  Threat: Remote activity (execution)  Part of the core selling point of many smart home applications is the ability to remotely activate  integrated home systems (heating, lighting, irrigation, etc.) from outside the home. This functionality,  if unsecured, or attacked, can allow physically distant attackers to potentially activate any of the  remote functions in the smart home120. Unwanted activation could be used for denial of service  attacks and harassment.  Threat: Targeted attacks (including Advanced Persistent Threat)  If attackers are seeking to attack a particular target, rather than any available unsecured victim, then  the smart home is highly useful for this. It will often physically surround the target with a sensor  infrastructure, collects sensitive information on them, manages permissions for other accounts and  services belonging to the target, and potentially allows for control of their environment. Access to the  smart home will provide targeted attackers with information on their target useful for reconnaissance  as well as potential ways to influence the target’s behaviour. The sensors in a smart home, if  compromised, could be particularly useful for the reconnaissance component of Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT), whilst the greater attack surface presented by multiple devices could facilitate an  attacker gaining presence121.  116 http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/24/home-alarm-hacking [accessed 20 October 2014]  117 http://www.wired.com/2011/08/hacking-home-automation/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  118 Wendzel et al, Op. cit. http://www.wendzel.de/dr.org/files/Papers/EnvisioningSmartBuildings.pdf  119 Oren Y., Keromytis A.

Software controlled systems must remain  compliant with these requirements.  Third-party data processing services for the smart home must be compliant with data protection law.  This is required for all parties collecting and processing personal data, but in the smart home and  converged media context it is particularly significant for cloud services and information storage  companies. Part of the requirements of data protection law with the EU is that appropriate security  measures must be taken122 123.  Threat: Failure to meet contractual requirements  Smart home, converged media, and related services offered by third-party companies, may fail to  meet contractual requirements promised to the subscriber. This is a particular problem given the small  and under-resourced nature of many smart home start-up companies124. Smart home inhabitants may  themselves fail to meet their contractual requirements in relation to these services, most likely  through failure of payment, but also by breaking conditions of use (for example, using HDMI splitters  to circumvent a TV provider’s single-room license arrangement, or by “jailbreaking” or “rooting”  devices).  Smart home technology, presented as a closed-source “black box”, may include additional functions  and capabilities and they might represent legal risks of which the user may be unaware.  Threat: Unauthorised use of copyrighted material  The converged media environment may allow inhabitants to make unauthorised use of copyrighted  material such as audio and visual media (films, TV, music, sport) and software125. Unauthorised use  might include downloading and storing streamed media, storing and displaying pirated content, or  accessing content with geographical access restrictions over a virtual private network or proxy126 127.  Some smart home communication protocols are proprietary. Manufacturers may include  compatibility with these protocols without obtaining the appropriate licensing agreement.  122 Whitehouse, O., Security Of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for the Internet of Things  Devices and Beyond, NCC Group, 2014, p.6. https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_- _security_of_things_- _an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf [accessed 27  October 2014]  123 EU Media Futures Forum, Fast-forward Europe: 8 Solutions to thrive in the digital world, final report,  September 2012. http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1753  124 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU [accessed 20 October 2014]  125 http://inside.org.au/convergence-only-one-part-of-the-media-problem/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  126 De Kosnik, A., Piracy is the Future of Television, C3 Research Memo, 2010.  http://www.convergenceculture.org/weblog/2010/12/c3_research_memo_2010_piracy_i.php [accessed 27  October 2014]  127 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/forum_final_report_en.pdf [accessed 20  October 2014]  https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1753 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU http://inside.org.au/convergence-only-one-part-of-the-media-problem/ http://www.convergenceculture.org/weblog/2010/12/c3_research_memo_2010_piracy_i.php http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/forum_final_report_en.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 30  7 Smart home assets exposure to cyber threats  This section presents the threat exposure of smart home assets. The following table (Table 1:  Association between Threats and Smart Home Assets) shows the association between the assumed  threats from Figure 2: Overview of Threats Assumed for Smart Home Assets and the smart home and  converged media assets from Figure 1: Overview of Smart Home and Converged Media Assets.  The table below establishes the relationship between threats and the assets to which these threats  apply. To this extent, the table shows the exposure of smart home assets to the assessed threats.  Threat groups are listed in the first column of the following table. Related threats in the second  column. Associated assets groups are in the third column. The last column, only when relevant,  provides information on some particular assets or some more details on some specific issue. E.g.,  under the threat group Unintentional damage (accidental) (first column), the threat Information  leakage or sharing is listed (second column). An association is made between such threat and the  following asset groups (third column): Human-machine interface devices, Information storage,  Integrated home services, Information, and Management/operation. The Asset/Detail field (fourth  column) is empty here because in this specific case no furher detailed information needed to be  mentioned.  This information contained in the table below is important in the process of identification of  countermeasures that will reduce the exposure surface of assets. This threat-to-assets association is  made on the basis of an initial assessment done within the project. More detailed assessments can  follow when additional asset details and/or new threats are being considered. To this extent, the  association performed in this report is non-exhaustive and subject to refinements, according to  particular smart home and threat environments.  The table below details threats identified in the preceding literature review. Threats that can be  logically assumed to apply to smart homes, but for which we did not identify evidence, are not  included in this table, but are included in a fuller table available by contacting  resilience@enisa.europe.eu . The fuller table has been created as a side-product of this work and may  be used as basis for detailed risk assessments in the area of smart homes.

It is important for smart home and converged media  asset owners to know which threats emerge from which threat agent group. This information is  significant to decide on the kind of risks that should be mitigated: threat agent groups are indicative  of the energy behind launched attacks and capability level. The smart home environment, as depicted  in our initial scenarios, differs in some significant ways from other cyber security contexts, and this  has implications for the nature of the threat agents. The typology of threat agents draws upon but  adapts the typology presented in previous ENISA threat landscape reports128.  Corporations  Corporations are private legal entities, generally motivated by the pursuit of profit and organised  accordingly, but this category can include not-for-profits and charitable organisations. The sources of  threat from corporate actors can range from the impacts of poor implementation or design of smart  home technologies, business models that are not aligned with the interests of smart home inhabitants,  through to illegal practices. Corporate actors can be potentially well resourced and competent if the  threat emerges from the deliberate actions of the organisation, but corporations can also include  elements of insider threat from employees who may have their own divergent agendas. Corporate  threat agents can be sub-divided into three categories. The categories are not mutually exclusive and  can overlap.  Data miners and advertisers  These threat agents operate with business models that are reliant upon the collection and processing  of data from smart home technology, which can also include personal data of individuals. They  therefore have an interest in the information that a smart home can produce about its inhabitants  and how this can inform the creation and promotion of advertised products and services. They may  themselves be service providers, or may be interested in data produced by service providers. The  primary threats from these actors include the use and abuse of intentionally shared or unintentionally  leaked information from the smart home. Inhabitants may be unaware of how such information may  be utilised by corporate actors, and these actors may therefore have strong impacts upon privacy and  data protection. These actors may also collect significant personal data, which may then become a  valuable asset itself in need of security protection.  Technology vendors and service providers  Service providers and technology developers for the smart home may themselves become threat  agents to other smart home assets. The key sources of threat here are in the unintentional category,  such as errors in design, installation, administration, maintenance of devices and systems as well as  obsolescence of technology over time, and the possibility of these agents being unable to fulfil their  commitments (loss of service, a smart home service provider going bankrupt or stopping support for  a widely installed product). Failures and malfunctions (including unintended information leakage) can  result from design decisions on the part of these actors. Technology vendors and services providers  are in an influential position in the smart home context and their actions can have significant impacts  upon smart home assets, including their security capabilities. In the context of smart media, threats  to smart home assets can emerge from digital rights management or revenue-protection actions.  128 ENISA, Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide, Op. cit..  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat- landscape-and-good-practice-guide [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 36  Journalists and media  These agents are primarily motivated by the information on people available from the smart home.  Their interests are likely to focus upon smart home inhabitants who are in some way notable  (celebrities, politicians).  Cyber criminals  Cyber criminals are the largest and most significant hostile threat category in relation to smart homes  with a special focus upon converged media.  Financial criminals  Cyber criminals are primarily motivated by financial interest, and threats to smart home assets arise  from criminal attempts to extract value from these assets. The full range of potential cyber-criminal  activity directed at other types of information systems are also applicable to the smart home, including  identity and credential theft, ransomware, malware, using smart home assets to conduct other illegal  activity (spam, bot nets, etc.).  Content pirates  In the particular context of converged media and television, media piracy and related types of crime  are highly relevant.  Other actors may overstep their legal boundaries and technically become cyber criminals, but their  motivations will vary. Cybercriminals can be organised on a local, national or even international level.  It should be taken as given, that a certain degree of networking between cybercriminals is being  maintained.  Traditional criminals  Traditional criminals are criminal actors that conduct crimes that are not primarily mediated through  information technology, but may increasingly contain a technological aspect, and this aspect makes  them a threat to smart home assets. For example, a physical burglar, who makes use of a method for  circumventing a smart lock, or jamming a video-over-IP system, fits into this category. In the smart  home context, traditional criminals are most likely relatively local, and their activity is categorically  defined by their physical interaction with the smart home. Their primary motivation is financial, but  this category can include other types of socially-motivated crime such as assault, voyeurism or  harassment. Threats to smart home assets from this category of threat agent primarily emerge from  circumvention of smart home security measures, exploitation of smart home systems to gain  information about the home, or theft of valuable smart home components themselves.  Inhabitants  Inhabitants of a smart home may be considered threat agents to assets, which may be located in the  smart home, but which the inhabitants themselves do not control or own. Examples of such assets  might include licensed audio-visual media, proprietary software in smart home devices, or smart  home devices on lease or license. Threats to assets from inhabitants can also be the result of mistakes  and errors in set-up and use. Furthermore, the interests of all inhabitants in a single smart home may  not necessarily coincide. Inhabitants may use the information gathering capability of the smart home  to invade the privacy of other inhabitants, or attempt to overcome content or access restrictions  placed on particular media content.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 37  Nation states  Threats to smart home assets from nation states can arise from the state where a smart home is  located, as would be the case in law enforcement, or from other countries, in the case of espionage  or cyber warfare. Depending upon national context, nation states threat to smart home may be  restricted by legal frameworks. Nation states can have offensive cyber capabilities and use them  against an adversary. Nation states are becoming a prominent threat agent due to the deployment of  sophisticated attacks that are considered as cyber weapons. From the sophistication of these malware  it can be confirmed that some nation states have a plethora of resources and they have a high level of  skills and expertise. It is too early to determine if smart homes (rather than for example critical  national infrastructure) would be perceived as either an effective or legal target for offensive cyber  operations.  Hacktivists  Hacktivists are politically and socially motivated individuals who use computer systems in order to  protest and promote their cause (but stopping short of terror-provoking violence). Moreover, they  usually target high profile websites, corporations, intelligence agencies and military institutions.  Threats to smart home assets from hacktivists may include intelligence and information gathering,  sabotage, destruction of information, or denial of service attacks.  Terrorists  There is little evidence for a terrorist-conducted cyber attack having occurred, and much terrorist use  of the Internet is in the realm of communications activity. It is debatable if cyber attacks would be an  effective means for politically or religiously motivated terrorists to achieve their goals. However, it is  feasible that terrorist groups or individuals might be motivated to attempt to attack smart home  assets. The extent to which this would result in fear-related behaviour change is relatively minimal as  the smart home context provides little opportunity for wide-spread damage, injury or destruction.  Non-violent actions against smart home assets in this context can be treated as activity by hacktivists.  Threat agents and threat categories  Based on these short threat agent profiles, the threats presented in this document can be assigned to  relevant groups. This assignment is based on the threat agent group profile and in particular on  assumed motives. The table below (Table 2: Involvement of Threat Agents in the Threats) presents  the potential involvement of threat agent groups in the threats considered for smart grid assets.

Risks are understood as emerging when threats abuse the vulnerabilities of  assets to generate harm.  It should be noted that the smart home environment is at a relatively early stage of development and  adoption. This has implications for mapping vulnerabilities and risks. It is possible to draw from  experiences of vulnerabilities and risk in related fields such as home automation and media content  provision, however, the nature of the current smart home environment is likely to re-cast some of  these risks and vulnerabilities. This section therefore includes consideration of the sources of  vulnerabilities in smart home security.  Vulnerabilities  There have been many demonstrations of vulnerabilities in individual smart home components. These  have been identified across most of the relevant asset categories in Figure 1: Overview of Smart Home  and Converged Media Assets, including IoT devices129  130 , home automation technologies 131  132 ,  television133 134 135 and media136 137, and in several widely used communications protocols138. The  majority of these vulnerabilities have been demonstrated by security researchers in lab-based  contexts, rather than culled from “real-world” examples. Researchers have then used their  judgement, and experiences in other contexts, to extrapolate from these vulnerabilities to the  potential harms and impacts that could result from their exploitation. As smart homes are comprised  of multiple types of technology (including radio communications, networking, software, hardware,  operating systems, protocols, Internet and cloud services, audio/visual etc.), known and unknown  vulnerabilities in all these areas are relevant to smart home security.  129 HP, Op. cit. http://fortifyprotect.com/HP_IoT_Research_Study.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  130 Goodin,D., http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi- fi-passwords/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  131 Chirgwin, R., “Nasty holes found in Belkin's home automation kit”, 19 Feb 2014.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/19/wemo_home_automation_is_insecure_ioactive/ [accessed 20  October 2014]  132 Botezatu, L., “Vulnerability in Vaillant Heating Systems Allows Unauthorized Access”,  April 16, 2013. http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows- unauthorized-access-5926.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  133 Kuipers, R., Starck, E., Heikkinen, E., “Smart TV Hacking: Crash Testing Your Home Entertainment”.  http://www.codenomicon.com/resources/whitepapers/codenomicon-wp-smart-tv-fuzzing.pdf [accessed 20  October 2014]  134 Mocana Corporation, Vulnerability Assessment of [redacted] Internet-Connected HDTVs, 14 December 2010.  storage.pardot.com/7062/128784/tv.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  135 Darren, P., “Samsung TVs, Blu-ray vulnerable to eternal boot loop”, 20 April 2012.  http://www.itnews.com.au/News/297710,samsung-tvs-blu-ray-vulnerable-to-eternal-boot-loop.aspx  [accessed 20 October 2014]  136 “DRM Security Issues DRM system cracks: DRM security software & hardware solutions”,  http://www.locklizard.com/drm_security_issues.htm [accessed 20 October 2014]  137 Doctorow, C., “What happens with digital rights management in the real world?”, 5 February 2014.  http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management [accessed 20 October  2014]  138 Fouladi B., Ghanoun, S., Op. cit. http://research.sensepost.com/conferences/2013/bh_zwave [accessed 20  October 2014]  http://fortifyprotect.com/HP_IoT_Research_Study.pdf http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/ http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/ http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/19/wemo_home_automation_is_insecure_ioactive/ http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.codenomicon.com/resources/whitepapers/codenomicon-wp-smart-tv-fuzzing.pdf http://www.itnews.com.au/News/297710,samsung-tvs-blu-ray-vulnerable-to-eternal-boot-loop.aspx http://www.locklizard.com/drm_security_issues.htm http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management http://research.sensepost.com/conferences/2013/bh_zwave  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 40  Vulnerabilities arising from business models and economic incentives  Several sources of vulnerability arise from the way that the smart home market is currently configured.  The traditional model for home automation was based around a single technology from a single  provider, with components integrated through a bus or hub. In this model the main security concerns  arise from the security or vulnerability of this hub. A newer model involves connecting together  multiple types of devices, often on an existing home network, and making use of cloud services to  provide mobile access to these smart systems. This model is gaining popularity because the reduction  in cost of low-power processors, memory and networking components has reduced the costs of entry  to the smart home market. The cost of adding network connectivity capacity to a device is now around  €20 but current customer demand does not yet allow for substantial prices increases for “smart”  connectivity. This has brought new entrants to the smart home market, both in terms of large  appliance manufacturers adding connectivity to existing home appliances (fridges, washing machines,  TVs) as well as smaller start-up companies producing new types of devices. However, these developers  may have little experience in security engineering, and/or little budget to devote to security139. They  are likely to adopt standard, generic hardware and firmware, which may have well-known but  unpatched vulnerabilities, or unknown vulnerabilities which, when discovered, will apply to a huge  range of different devices.  Secondly, the heavy use of cloud computing resources, for storage and the provision of services,  introduces new vulnerabilities140 141 142. Hacking the cloud server becomes a very effective way of  getting access to large numbers of smart homes, and could be done through relatively simply methods  of social engineering, phishing, etc. The use of cloud services may include transfers of data across  national and jurisdictional boundaries, with resulting implications for data protection and privacy  regulation143. Although cloud providers are putting effort into cloud security,144 domestic consumers,  or smart home services marketed at consumers, may not adopt more costly cloud security methods  and services, or be able to scrutinise the security methods of cloud providers145.  Vulnerabilities arising from ownership and administration models  Smart homes have an administrative model much closer to that of the home PC and home network  than that of enterprise IT. They are unlikely to have dedicated IT or IT security personal, but rather  this will be the responsibility of a likely untrained occupant with limited attention and capacity to  identify security risks to the smart home or to take action against them. An increased number of non- integrated smart devices connected to cloud services may also increase problems with authentication  139 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU [accessed 20 October 2014]  140 ENISA Op. cit., 2013, p.49 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats [accessed 27  October 2014]  141 Subashini, S., and Kavitha, V., “A survey on security issues in service delivery models of cloud computing”,  Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 34(1), January 2011.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804510001281 [accessed 27 October 2014]  142 Svantesson, D., and Roger Clarke (2010) “Privacy and consumer risks in cloud computing”, Computer Law  and Security Review, 26 (4), 391-397.  143 Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, Opinion 05/2012 on Cloud Computing, WP196, 1 July 2012.  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion- recommendation/files/2012/wp196_en.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  144 Pucher, A., and Dimopoulos, S., “A Survey on Cloud Provider Security Measures”,  http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  145 http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-customers/d/d-id/1139143  Accessed 20 October 2014 [accessed 27 October 2014]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804510001281 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp196_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp196_en.pdf http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-customers/d/d-id/1139143  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 41  and password management in this context. For many users, the security models and activity of smart  home technology, including devices they may bring into their homes, will be opaque146. Many smart  devices lack graphical users interfaces, or have limited display capability, making it hard to determine  if they are functioning incorrectly or have been compromised. Additionally, smart home technology,  particularly sensors, can itself be low profile and not particularly visible. Therefore, occupants will be  interacting with smart home devices even when they are not consciously using them147.  The marketing models of smart homes create a picture of smart homes being organised by and for  their inhabitants, in order to increase the quality of life of the latter and respond to their needs and  problems (such as security, convenience, comfort, entertainment and home administration). This is  not the only model for the home automation and monitoring functions of smart homes. Other models  may be primarily of benefit to landlords and building owners wishing to mandate or prescribe certain  types of behaviour from their tenants. Smart buildings are also likely to be used in business contexts  where functions might be used for cost-reduction, environmental sustainability or physical security,  but have implications for the privacy of employees.  Many smart home devices and components are vulnerable to an attacker with physical access to the  device. Often this will allow the attacker to access stored passwords or cryptographic keys, changes  settings, access data, and upload new software. The working assumption appears to be that only asset  owners will have this level of physical access, or that the interests of all smart home occupants are the  same, and therefore devices do not need to be secured against physical attacks. Physical access to one  device of a type (which can be quite affordable) may also be highly advantageous for an attacker  targeting that whole range of devices.  In addition, ownership (and therefore responsibility for security) in the smart home context is not  always clear. Common beliefs about ownership may not match the legal model. Depending upon  particular ownership models, some of the assets in the home may be owned by third-parties (cable  and set-top boxes are physical examples of this, and digital media can be rented or supplied with  access controls and use limitations). This complicates vulnerability mapping. In some context the  inhabitants may be a security risk to the externally owned asset (for example copying and distributing  pirated media content), and in others, the external party may be a security risk to the smart home  inhabitants. This situation may change the economic incentives to take security action to the extent  that additional security vulnerabilities are created.  Pervasive and persistent insecurity  Smart homes increase the number of vulnerable devices within an environment. This is particularly  true in comparison with a non-smart home, but also in comparison with a more traditional home  network supporting a small number of dedicated computers. This proliferation of devices increases  the attack surface for the home. Further, a single compromised device in a smart home may be able  to eavesdrop on network traffic and be used as a starting point to compromise other devices. The  smart home is therefore as vulnerable as its most vulnerable component and every additional device  might introduce a security vulnerability.  146 O’Hara, Op. cit.,  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf  147 Nixon, P.A., Wagealla, W., English, C., Terzis, S., Security, Privacy and Trust Issues in Smart Environments,  p.2. http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf [accessed 20 October  2014]  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 42  Given this proliferation of devices, smart home device designers may be tempted to over-rely upon  security through obscurity148, assuming that the range of available targets will obscure their own  devices from attackers. The existence of methods for finding and identifying Internet of Things  devices, such as the Shodan search engine, suggest this is unwise. Shodan is a search engine for  Internet connected devices, including searches based upon known software exploits149 150.  As embedded hardware, smart home components can potentially have long service life-spans.151 They  may also be difficult to update or patch if vulnerabilities are discovered152. This can leave assets  vulnerable for long periods of time. This can be exacerbated by developers no longer supporting an  embedded device, going out of business, and having no requirement or economic incentive to  continue to update and produce patches153.  Risks  Understanding risks in the smart home requires an understanding of context and the position of the  inhabitants and asset owners. It also requires understanding of the potential harms that can arise from  the exploitation of smart home assets.  Crime risks  As set out in Section 5, smart home assets are exposed to threats which can either facilitate criminal  actions, or are themselves be a form of crime (e.g. physical damage or theft, unauthorised access to  smart home assets). Whilst smart homes may be at risk of crime, it was not possible to  comprehensively assess this risk based upon documentation collected. Interviewed experts believe  that the current risk of criminal activity directed at the smart home is currently relatively low, given  the relatively small number of smart homes. However the increasing number of homes with some  kind of Internet connected smart functionality, as well as the corresponding value of identity  information, financial tokens and credentials stored in the smart home, may increase financial  motivations for crime.  Privacy, surveillance and data protection risks  Smart homes are intended to exploit combinations of small distributed sensing and computational  nodes, to identify and deliver personalised services to the users, when they are interacting and  exchanging information with the environment154. Internet of Things data is high in quantity, quality  148 Ferrante D., Auriemma, L., Op. cit. http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf  [accessed 20 October 2014]  149 http://www.shodanhq.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  150 Hill, K., “The Terrifying Search Engine That Finds Internet-Connected Cameras, Traffic Lights, Medical  Devices, Baby Monitors and Power Plants”, 9 April 2013.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/04/shodan-terrifying-search-engine/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  151 Grossman, W., “Software is forever”, 30 May 2014.  http://www.pelicancrossing.net/netwars/2014/05/software_is_forever.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  152 Roberts, P., “Beware the next circle of hell: Unpatchable systems”, 2June 2014  http://www.infoworld.com/article/2606438/endpoint-protection/beware-the-next-circle-of-hell-- unpatchable-systems.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  153 Fleishman, G., “Security cruft means every exploit lives forever”, 25 September 2014.  http://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/security-cruft-means-every-exp.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  154 Nixon et al, Op. cit.,, http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf  [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf http://www.shodanhq.com/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/04/shodan-terrifying-search-engine/ http://www.pelicancrossing.net/netwars/2014/05/software_is_forever.html http://www.infoworld.com/article/2606438/endpoint-protection/beware-the-next-circle-of-hell--unpatchable-systems.html http://www.infoworld.com/article/2606438/endpoint-protection/beware-the-next-circle-of-hell--unpatchable-systems.html http://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/security-cruft-means-every-exp.html http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 43  and sensitivity155. Given the depth and variety of personal information that can be captured and  processed within the smart home, and the potential for privacy violations, potential harms are far  from purely technical matters and social context therefore becomes particularly important in  assessing risk. Many of the risks presented by the smart home will be of this socio-technical type.  Smart homes will produce data on previously unrecorded activities and have a close link between  people and their environments156. The data produced by activity within a smart home is likely to be  perceived as valuable to a number of actors and additional applications may be found, not initially  envisaged by designers, service providers or asset owners157. This expansion of the uses of smart home  data can be understood as a form of “function creep”. It complicates understanding potential risks  because new uses of previously captured data also produce new risks that were not considered at the  time of either device installation, or the point of data capture. Precisely because of the personal,  behavioural and granular nature of the data, smart home data is likely to be seen as having predictive  value for applications including market segmentation, risk classification, assessments of insurability,  and policing and crime control158. This type of data processing, can lead to what is known as “social  sorting”, where people are assigned to different categories, assigned worth or risk, in ways which have  significant impacts upon their life chances 159 . These practices can have collective social justice  implications as well as individual privacy risks.  Particular issues raised for converged media  From the threat analysis conducted in this study, converged media can be understood as a particular  instance of the principles behind smart homes. To the extent that the converged media devices can  be understood as a computer, the security and risk profile of converged media resembles that of  computing more broadly. The security differences therefore arise from implementation,  administration and use models as much as from the underlying technological principles. This section  presents specific reflections upon threats, vulnerabilities and other security issues in relation to  converged media. In addition to issues around privacy, access and copyright, converged media and  television raise related security issues to smart homes in terms of connectivity, embedded  functionality, opaque systems and incompatibility with traditional information security approaches.  Converged media devices are likely to be some of the first consumer smart home devices introduced  to many homes, and will therefore be the terrain for the initial playing out of many of the identified  smart home security issues. Internet-connected smart televisions in particular have a number of  attributes which contribute towards their envisaged role in the smart home.   Commonly present. Televisions are a common feature in many homes and other buildings.  They are also often centrally located in commonly used areas of the building.  155 Kohnstamm, J., and Madhub, D., Mauritius Declaration on the Internet of Things, 36th International  Conference of Data protection and Privacy Commissioners, 14 October 2014.  http://www.privacyconference2014.org/media/16421/Mauritius-Declaration.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  156 O’Hara, Op. cit.,  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf [accessed  27 October 2014]  157 Higginbotham , S., “The Internet of things isn’t about things.

In contrast to many other smart devices and home appliances, televisions  have larger and higher quality screens which may be better suited to the management and  control of other devices, as well as the display of information.   Capacity and processing power. In comparison with smaller, dedicated devices, a larger  gateway can support increased processing power, memory and storage capacity. The  additional capacity offers some potential to support additional security software.   Multi-functionality. Smart TV offers the potential for a device which replicates the  functionality of existing TV, media play, home cinema, music and gaming systems, is  connected to the Internet and a range of online services, and may well be integrated with  home automation systems as part of a smart home.   Integration with other devices. Smart TVs are capable of being linked to a range of devices  (set top boxes, media players, games consoles, external memory) that could potentially be  expanded. Internet connectivity and home networking also allow a range of media devices  within the home to share content with each other, streaming media to different devices160.   Manufacturer interest. Smart TV manufacturers have exhibited interest in a broad range of  functionalities, including the use of the smart TV as a home gateway161 162. This interest is  linked to the potential for the smart TV (including set-top boxes) to provide the broadcaster  with greater control over quality and content, and for positive branding163. The ability to  distinguish new TVs from previous models is also of interest to manufacturers.  The corollary of these attributes is that if smart TV becomes a common coordinating hub for the smart  home, as well as supporting multiple media services and account credentials, then it will become a  likely target for cyber crime. If this is the case then it should therefore equally be a focus for security  efforts164. Data on media consumption is particularly attractive for business in this field, both for  advertising and revenue purposes.  Specific vulnerabilities have been identified in converged media devices 165  166 . These have been  highlighted in Section 6: Vulnerabilities, but include incorrect security implementation, (for example  hard coded passwords167), backdoors, mechanisms for the insertion of content168, remote reporting  160 Arabo, Abdullahi and Fadi El-Mousa, “Security Framework for Smart Devices”, International Conference on  Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare and Digital Forensic (CyberSec), 28 June 2012.

Many smart TVs, for example,  use custom user interfaces and operating systems which may allow little security control to the user,  or may have undiscovered vulnerabilities. For example, an on screen web-browser might obscure the  URL of a visited webpage, allowing for easier spoofing. If smart media devices have the capacity to  install third-party applications then this raises the danger of spyware hidden in malicious apps, as has  been experienced on smart phones.  The field of converged media is a point of contention between different actors in the smart home with  potentially different security interests and incentives. Converged media is typified by a wide and  shifting set of publishers, content producers, content providers, distribution channels, and hardware  manufacturers172. Security conflicts can emerge between the industry and users, with digital rights  management and revenue protection activities being a particular source of contention if these are not  handled sensitively, and with an eye to general security. The result of this environment is that the  converged media device is unlikely to be under the full control of the user173. This raises the question  of who carries responsibility for security in this environment, and the extent to which converged media  actors can and should act in this role.  169 Ferrante D., Auriemma, L., Op. cit. http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf  [accessed 23 October 2014]  170 Roberts, P., https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with- vulnerabilities/ [accessed 23 October 2014]  171 http://blog.kaspersky.com/dont-shop-or-bank-with-a-smart-tv/ [accessed 23 October 2014]  172 OECD, “Connected Televisions: Convergence and Emerging Business Models”, OECD Digital Economy  Papers, No. 231, OECD Publishing, 2014. http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/connected- televisions_5jzb36wjqkvg-en [accessed 27 October 2014]  173 https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you- dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml [accessed 23 October 2014]  http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with-vulnerabilities/ https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with-vulnerabilities/ http://blog.kaspersky.com/dont-shop-or-bank-with-a-smart-tv/ http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/connected-televisions_5jzb36wjqkvg-en http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/connected-televisions_5jzb36wjqkvg-en https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 46  10 Good practices in smart home and converged media security measures  The following section presents good practices in smart home and converged media security measures  that have been identified in the literature search and in discussion with the expert group. This report  has not independently evaluated these measures and so cannot necessarily recommend these  measures. Rather, the report presents an overview of efforts and recommendations in the field. The  good practices are structured according to the type of security measure.  Smart home and converged media design and architecture choices  Several good practices for security measures involve making good choices and decisions at the level  of the design of the smart home as a system, including how the various components are to be  integrated together. These good practices suggest ways in which the smart home might be designed  in order to increase security and reduce impacts upon privacy. They are therefore directed at smart  home designers and owners.  Design considerations include: careful consideration of the security of cloud-based smart home  designs, and maximising the extent to which automation and data storage can remain local and under  control of the smart home owner; reducing the number of external services used in the smart home  design may decrease the attack surface; using a single type of smart home technology may minimise  the points of vulnerability that arise from mixing together multiple technologies and protocols; the  choice of Open Source protocols over closed-source or proprietary protocols so that the  implementation can be inspected and the communications behaviour understood; better interface  design so that smart home users can better understand the operation of their devices and exert better  control over their activity; and limiting the proliferation of passwords that results from multiple  services and accounts.  Another architectural choice can include an application isolation framework (as is developed in smart  cars174), to keep critical software separate from non-critical apps. In the context of the car, this keeps  the music player or climate control from running on the same system as the brakes or steering; in the  smart home it might separate media and music systems from security or integrated appliances.  Architectural choices can also include the adoption of privacy-by-design approaches to developing the  smart home and converged media. These approaches have been detailed for smart grids 175  and  approaches may also be applicable in the smart home context. The NCC Group report, Implementers  guide to cyber security of Internet of things devices, provides design and implementation advice,  including considerations for smart homes176.  174 Dietzel, S., Kost, M., Schaub, F. and Kargl, F., “CANE: A Controlled Application Environment for Privacy  Protection in ITS“, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems  Telecommunications, 2012. http://www.dbis.informatik.hu- berlin.de/fileadmin/research/papers/conferences/2012_11_Dietzel_Kost_Schaub_Kargl_ITST.pdf [accessed 27  October 2014]  175 Cavoukian, A., Smart Meters in Europe: Privacy by Design at its Best, April 2012.  http://www.privacybydesign.ca/content/uploads/2012/04/pbd-smartmeters-europe.pdf [accessed 27 October  2014]  176 Whitehouse, O.

Architecture and design good practices may contribute towards mitigating threats from physical  attack, unintentional damage, Failures and malfunctions, eavesdropping/interception/hijacking,  nefarious activity, outages and disaster. They may contribute in particular to threats from information  leakage, loss of support services, inadequate design and planning, or lack of adaption.  Device security measures  A second set of good practices in security measures involve measures at the level of the individual  smart device. These measures are directed towards the device manufacturers, but can also guide the  selection of devices by smart home designers and owners. Given the Internet-connected nature of  many smart home devices, these practices overlap somewhat with network and communications  security measures below, and also involve measures on the part of the device vendor and associated  service providers. An example of this is HP’s account of its activity in protecting Internet-connected  printers from spam. In this context this includes restricted access to the printer, deletion of printer  content, and activity monitoring conducted by the service provider as well as management tasks  delegated to the user, such as not publicly posting the email address of the printer and keeping the  printer physically secure177. Security measures at the device level can also include improved user  interfaces, as well as activity and state alerting (for example, an alert when a device has failed). Many  of these good practices include the application of basic information security measures to smart home  components178, including:   Design with security in mind   No fixed, default passwords   No storage of default passwords in the device firmware   Use encrypted communication with proper implementation   Secure IP gateways   End-to-end authentication, no http access without authentication   Strong key implementation   Apply updates to apps and firmware as available179   Message authentication180  Device security measures may mitigate against threats from unintentional damage,  failures/malfunctions, eavesdropping/interception/hijacking, nefarious activity/abuse, and  damage/loss of IT assets.  177 HP, “Protecting Your Web-Connected Printer from Unwanted Email”,  http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&lc=en&docname=c03600177#N55 [accessed 20  October 2014]  178 Ward, M., “How to hack and crack the connected home”, 17 August 2014.  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27373328 [accessed 20 October 2014]  179 “Belkin fixes WeMo security holes, updates firmware and app”, 19 February 2014.  http://www.networkworld.com/article/2226374/microsoft-subnet/belkin-fixes-wemo-security-holes-- updates-firmware-and-app.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  180 Brown, J., Bagci, I.

These good practices relate to how the various smart home assets  are interconnected, and how they communicate and are therefore addressed to both smart home  technology manufacturers and vendors, as well as to smart home installers, designers and owners.  Several sources emphasise the importance of ensuring that security measures provide for the  maintenance of the following essential properties181 182:   Confidentiality   Integrity   Authentication   Authorisation   Non-repudiation   Availability  Similarly, Duo Security identified the following security areas as starting points for Internet of Things  security183:   Proper encoding of web service credentials   Secured local video streaming   Easy-to-manage firmware upgrades   Mobile device access and authentication   Strong password policies for device authentication   Strong WiFi security   Secured 3rd party service connections   Encrypted storage of customer data   Customer data segmentation with back end systems  Some sources recommend that given the proliferation of connected devices in the smart home, the  focus of security should be upon the control of key access points such as the residential gateway,  home hub, or smart TV if performing this function. The argument is that security may be better  performed at the network level rather than at the end point due to the variety of devices of different  types and the limited support for end point security functions on those devices184.  Various network security measures have been identified as appropriate for increasing security in the  smart home, such as white lists for external access to smart home devices, and secure profile  management185. Remote logging of activity on smart home components and event management  software to detect and prevent anomalous or undesired activity may be desirable.  181 Mantas, G., Lymberopoulos, D., and Komninos, N., Op. cit. http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless- technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 [accessed 20 October 2014]  182 Whitehouse, O., Op. cit. https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_- _an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf [accessed 20  October 2014]  183 Martins, F., “How PKI Can Fix Security in the Internet of Things”, August 13, 2014.  https://blog.digicert.com/how-security-can-fix-Internet-of-things/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  184 Spencer, L., “IoT security under scrutinity as Apple looks at smart home systems”, 27 May 2014.  http://www.zdnet.com/iot-security-under-scrutiny-as-apple-looks-at-smart-home-system-7000029859/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  185 Ziegler, M., Mueller, W., Schaefer, R. and Loeser, C., “ Secure Profile Management in Smart Home  Networks“, Sixteenth International Workshop on Database and Exert Systems Applications, 2005.  http://adt.cs.upb.de/wolfgang/sun2005a.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://blog.digicert.com/how-security-can-fix-internet-of-things/ http://www.zdnet.com/iot-security-under-scrutiny-as-apple-looks-at-smart-home-system-7000029859/ http://adt.cs.upb.de/wolfgang/sun2005a.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 49  Various specific security models for smart homes have been proposed, particularly in the academic  literature. Examples include product-based security models186 , and context-aware approaches to  authentication and access control187. The uTRUSTit project aimed to test user trust perception in the  Internet of Things and provide guidance on producing trusted IoT. The project created a set of  collected threat and control objectives which are applicable to smart homes188.  Finally, there are measures which propose to take advantage of the smart home assets and  infrastructure to increase privacy. In one case, this involves using the smart home as privacy proxy for  the individual, acting as an intermediary and enforcing the use of desired privacy policies189.  Network and communication security measures may primarily mitigate threats from  eavesdropping/interception/hijacking and nefarious activity/abuse, as well as from legal;  failures/malfunctions; and unintentional damage.  Policy measures, including standardisation  In addition to the technological and design best practices, several policy measures have been  identified that seek to improve smart home and converged media security. Many of these are  certification or standardisation approaches that seek to make good practices more widespread  through the smart home industry, but others are political or economic activities. The latter case  includes the argument for placing economic pressure upon Internet service providers to increase  security190.  The Consumer Electronics Association and Computer Technology Industry Association introduced a  new “Digital Home Technology Integrators” certification for individuals and companies installing home  networks and connecting consumer electronics devices to a central PC, which has particular relevance  to audio-visual installation191.  CENELEC (The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) established a SmartHouse  Roadmap project, to provide strategic direction and co-ordination for the standardisation activities of  the European standards organisations (ETSI, CEN and CENELEC), in relation to smart homes192. The  intent of this roadmap is to identify relevant standards in the area and encourage interoperability.

CENELEC has developed, in cooperation with the  European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTR), a Code of Practice  for Smart Houses. Section 3.4 of the Code of Practice engages with system security, and the Code of  Practice recommends that security services and model should be selected according to threats, needs,  knowledge and costs, and that users should read and adopt user security guidelines. Following the  project the coordination of the standardisation activities around SmartHouse were taken over by  CLC/TC 205 “Home and Building Electronic Systems (HBES)” Working Group 2, which was tasked with  coordinating the introduction of the output of the SmartHouse Roadmap project into the regular  standardisation work of CENELEC.  Similarly, the ICTSB (the Information & Communications Standards Board) has conducted a review of  existing standards, which may be applicable to smart homes. For the ICTSB, standards for smart homes  should be seen in conjunction with standards for digital broadcasting, mobile communications,  Internet, PCs, Protected distribution systems, and voice services195.  IEC Technical Specification IEC TS 62045-1 Multimedia Security – Guidelines for privacy protection of  equipment and systems in and out of use196, is intended to respond to the increase in consumer  multimedia products that store users’ private information, which should be protected from  unauthorised or illegal use. The technical specification describes the system model and general  methods for the user’s privacy protection of data storage, equipment and systems, both in and out of  use.  Finally, good practices have been identified that relate to the structure of the smart home industry  and how this can be better coordinated in order to improve security. BuildItSecure.ly is a US-based  initiative, which aims to improve the interaction between small Internet of things developers and  vendors on one hand, and the security research community on the other. The initiative aims to create  mechanisms that allow for security researchers to communicate security vulnerabilities that they have  identified, to the vendors, and to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two communities197.  Policy measures, including standardisation, may mitigate threats from unintentional damage,  failures/malfunctions, eavesdropping/interception/hijacking, legal, nefarious activity/abuse, outages,  damage/loss, and disaster.  193 Ibid.  194 CENELEC Work Shop - Smart House, Final Report, July 2003.  http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Smart_House/Documents/Annex_Authent.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  195 ICTSB, Design for All – Final Background Report, 15 May 2000,  http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Design_for_All/Documents/15%20Smart%20Housing.pdf  196 IEC, Technical Specification IEC TS 62045-1 “Multimedia Security – Guidelines for privacy protection of  equipment and systems in and out of use”. http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045- 1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  197 For more information, see: http://builditsecure.ly/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Smart_House/Documents/Annex_Authent.pdf http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Design_for_All/Documents/15%20Smart%20Housing.pdf http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf http://builditsecure.ly/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 51  Design and  architecture  Device  security  measures  Network and  communications  Policy  measures/  Standardisation  Physical attacks √  Unintional damage √ √ √ √  Disaster  (natural/environmental)  √  √  Damage/loss of IT assets  √  √  Failures/malfunctions √ √ √ √  Outages √  √  Eavesdropping/interception/ hijacking  √ √ √ √  Nefarious activity/abuse √ √ √ √  Legal  √ √  Table 3: Good Practice Measures against Threat Categories  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 52  11 Gap analysis  The study has identified the follow areas of smart home threats, security, and good practice where  further research and investigation is required.   The role of the smart home in emergency response. To what extent can the capabilities of  smart homes be harnessed to support emergency responses, either in the context of an  individual location, or across locations in the case of a larger incident? To what extent can  information from the smart home be securely shared with incident responders whilst  respecting occupant privacy? Might smart home systems cause additional difficulties for  emergency response, and would this require additional training or design consideration?   The impacts of natural disasters upon the smart home. As complicated electronics, smart  home components are likely to be vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters, however  more research may be necessary to determine the particular impacts and to increase the  resilience of smart homes. This research should also consider the way in which smart homes  may contribute towards mitigating the impacts of natural disasters.   The criminology of the smart home. In a similar manner to how computing opens up the  potential for new types of crime as well as new approaches to traditional crimes, the smart  home will have impacts upon criminal behaviour in relation to the home. Understanding the  changes in criminal behaviour (and associated policing practices) will reduce the negative  impacts of smart home crime and allow designers to take mitigating steps.   The role of the smart home in critical infrastructure. Smart homes will be associated with  smart grids, but will also be connected to other elements of critical infrastructure. Can the  smart home play a role in contributing to the protection of critical infrastructure, or will the  differential demands of the smart home place new pressures upon critical infrastructure that  was designed around the needs and requirements of the non-smart home?   Liability and insurance issues related to the smart home. Liability is a particular issue for  smart homes involving automation and learning behaviour, where systems are likely to make  decisions or act as proxies for their owners. Given that smart homes might include electricity,  heating, lighting, and water services which can be damaging and costly, the implications might  be significant. Insurance policies might encourage the adoption of particular smart home  technologies (for example connected fire, smoke or flooding alarms) in order to reduce policy  costs. The implications, processes and extent to which alternative approaches are available  should be considered. Related to liability, are questions of contract law, lock-in, and the ability  to change service providers for smart home functions.   Law, policy and the smart home. The extent to which existing laws and policies are impacted  by developments in the smart home, and the bearing these laws and policies have upon smart  home security, should be considered. Of particular interest is the extent to which existing  cyber security policies, including national cyber security strategies, encompass smart homes.  As international law on cyber conflict develops, consideration should be given to increasingly  smart homes.   Baseline requirements for manufacturers should be explored, to ensure that smart home  components meet existing and newly developed standards for home appliances and  infrastructures. To what extent would product, device, protocol, or service certification  improve the standards of smart home security? What should be the contents of such  certification and where can it best be targeted? The content of standards should be regularly  revised as technology develops. The possibility of technology forcing through standards and  regulation should be investigated.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 53   User education for the smart home. As complex interconnected systems, smart homes may  require users to be educated in home to operate their smart home safely, securely, and  maintain their desired level of privacy and data protection. User education approaches may  need to differ from those addressed to home PCs or enterprise IT and these requirements  should be explored and addressed. What are the limits of user education in relation to smart  home privacy, and what behaviour can be reasonable expected?   Training at various levels. To what extent are existing information security training  approaches applicable to and relevant to the smart home, and in particular to the design of  smart home components and appliances? Do new training approaches need to be developed,  and if so, for whom? What training is available for smart home vendors and installers and is  this training creating an adequate level of smart home security?   Further development of good practices. The previously identified good practices address  some areas of smart home security, and if applied more widely would have significant impact.  However these practices should be further developed and explored. Mechanisms for sharing  and expanding good practices in smart home security should also be explored. In a related  manner, what work is necessary to make existing security measures and approaches smart  home ready?   Smart home security diagnostic and forensic methods. To what extent are existing methods  for understanding security events and discovering the source of these events suitable for use  in the smart home context? Do new approaches (including processes and procedures) need  to be developed? Can methods and systems be developed which allow smart home  inhabitants to better understand the security behaviour of their smart home?   The interface between the smart home and the smart city. Smart cities are developing in  parallel with smart homes and utilise some shared technologies. To what extent are the smart  home and the smart city connected, integrated or communicating, and what issues of security  and privacy does this relationship raise?   Security management methodologies, including better approaches to patching, updates,  provision of information to asset owners, incident logging and report, should be developed  that specifically cater to the smart home context.   Longer term studies of the impacts of smart home security and particularly the impacts upon  privacy. It is currently too early in the wide-scale deployment of smart homes to fully  understand the implications, however research should attempt to identify the practical  implications upon privacy and the effects of security failures, in order to supplement and  expand the information available on potential vulnerabilities and to allow trend mapping.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 54  12 Conclusions  Based on the experience gained within this activity and in addition to the asset, threat and  vulnerability assessment pursued through the report, the study has identified additional cross-cutting  conclusions on threats to the smart home and converged media.  The study identified threats to all of the asset classes and high threat exposure across all devices,  including to humans inhabitants. A smart home will likely contain a large, complex and diverse attack  surface. The potential for abuse of smart homes should be considered high. The smart home offers  personalised and context-informed attack vectors. The increasing number of smart homes, and smart  devices within homes, particularly converged media, will increase the return of targeting smart home  vulnerabilities. The security management of these assets is not yet mature and requires further  attention.  Not all smart homes are created equally. There are multiple design pathways that lead to functional  smart homes (ranging between localised and integrated home-automation systems, to sets of devices  based upon a shared interoperability protocol, and cloud-based gadget-and-app approaches with ad- hoc integration). These pathways have their own security and privacy peculiarities, but also have  shared issues and vulnerabilities. Design choices in the make-up of the smart home are likely to have  significant impacts both on individual security and upon the collective security ecosystem. For  example, a cloud provider might become a single point of access for multiple smart homes as a result  of individual design choices, with the result that that provider’s security decisions will have  widespread impact.  We might be unaware of how “smart” the home already is. In many ways, the underlying technologies  and elements of the smart home are already available and increasingly in place. This is particularly  the case in relation to converged media devices. Further services and products are likely to be  developed based upon these technologies. The smart home is not just about objects, but about a  variety of connected IT devices and services with some relation to the home. This includes tethered  devices which move in and out of the physical space, such as smart phones and laptop computers, as  well as cloud, media and social network services and accounts in regular use in the home. The smart  home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and physical space,  and therefore brings together security risks from both the virtual and the physical contexts. As the  cost of smart functionality decreases, home appliances will increasingly have some form of computing  functionality and connectivity. Individual users may easily be unaware of the potential of the devices  and systems in their home. Moreover, their mental models of what is a “computer” (and as such is in  need of information security) may be outdated and in need of change.  Several economic factors generate security vulnerabilities in smart home devices. First, companies  involved in the smart home market include home appliance companies, small start-up companies, and  even crowd-funded efforts. These groups are likely to lack security expertise, security budgets and  access to security research networks and communities. For some devices, smart functionality is not a  core function but may be an additional function or serve to differentiate between models at different  price points. Security and privacy can be an afterthought, following on from getting the smart  functions to work and be interoperable. The market does not currently appear to support greatly  increased cost for adding smart functionality, which further limits the resources that can be devoted  to developing and testing for security. Second, data-mining and analytics are a business model for  some smart offerings, which will create additional economic incentives for smart home system  vendors to collect data from sensor systems. Design choices are competing against cost, convenience,  as well as security and privacy.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 55  Applying basic information security could have significant impacts in the smart home domain. Some  devices are so lacking in security measures and secure engineering that implementing relatively well  known security measures (such as encrypted communication, non-default passwords, user  authentication) would increase smart home security. This study has identified specific and focused  approaches specifically for smart home security that are being developed in academia and in industry  research, but these approaches may require further evaluation and testing beyond the scope of this  study.  The interests of different asset owners in the smart home are not necessarily aligned and may even  be in conflict. This creates a complex environment for security activity. For example, media content  owners may view occupants’ attempts to access licensed media content through alternate channels  as a threat to their assets, whilst occupants may interpret digital rights management measures as  barriers preventing them from accessing their assets. Different service providers and technology  vendors may be in competition with each other for both bandwidth and data.  There is a developing research base for smart home vulnerabilities, but this is limited and requires  further development and expansion. Much of the available information regards technical  vulnerabilities and exploits discovered in research labs. The potential real world impacts (including  upon privacy) are less well evidenced, and impacts have to be inferred from these vulnerabilities and  contextual knowledge. Some knowledge can be transposed from parallel and linked industries, such  as cable and satellite TV, hotel systems and wireless security. The research base has some constitutive  limits, for example, there is not much information available on the vulnerability of smart homes to  natural disaster and physical harm. There is more information available on information leakage than  on sociological and legal impacts of information leakage. Several areas requiring further research have  been identified.  Smart homes will impact privacy and data protection significantly. The increased number of  interlinked sensors and activity logs present and active in the smart home will be a source of close,  granular and intimate data on the activities and behaviour of inhabitants and visitors. The home is a  key site of consumption, and given the intimate, non-public context, behaviour in the home may be  seen as more meaningful or authentic that public activity. This means that the data produced by such  environments will have commercial and law enforcement value and there will be resulting privacy and  data protection debates arising from this. The risks that arise from smart home privacy are  probabilistic rather than deterministic, and can therefore be hard to communicate. Function creep is  highly likely in the smart home context. Much of the smart home literature, and particularly the  promotional and marketing literature for smart devices, starts from the assumption that the occupant  of the smart home is the owner. In many cases, such as rented accommodation and commercial  building automation, this will not be the case. In these contexts, smart homes provide for surveillance,  and for automatic enforcement of policies set by the owner. Smart homes also provide the capacity  for potentially intense surveillance of other family members.

In addition to this consolidated and remote control of the home, a smart home may also be  able to “learn” the preferences of its inhabitants and adapt to them. Examples of smart home devices  include: smart fridges, smart electricity meters, smart blinds, and automatic pet feeders. Important  components of the integrated smart home are converged media - media characterised by the merging  of traditional broadcast services with the Internet - in particular in the form of smart TVs and related  devices such as media centres. Home automation has increased over the years due to the fact that  the various smart home components, devices and systems have reached a level of technological  development and maturity suitable for entry into the market. Furthermore, smart home devices have  nowadays become more affordable. Due to the proliferation of interconnectivity and intelligence  related to living habits, coupled with the digitalization of important utilities, smart homes constitute  an attractive field for developments and future deployments.  Smart home technology aims to increase efficiency and quality of life, for example through assisted  living for ageing populations. However, besides benefits, smart home also bears cyber security risks.  This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media provides an  overview of the current state of cyber security in this domain. In particular it identifies commonly used  assets, exposure of these assets to cyber threats, threat agents, vulnerabilities and risks, as well as  available good practices in the field. In addition to the input from the members of the ENISA informal  Expert Group (EG) created for this effort, existing assessments and publicly available information have  been taken into account.  The study identifies threats to all asset classes, across the several alternative design pathways to smart  homes. As it develops, the smart home will exhibit a high cyber security risk profile for the individual  context, with additional systematic effects on broader information security. Highlights of this study  are:   Not all smart homes are created equally. There are multiple design pathways that lead to  functional smart homes, ranging between localised and integrated home-automation systems.  These pathways have their own security and privacy peculiarities, but also have shared issues and  vulnerabilities.   Smart homes will have significant privacy and data protection impacts. The increased number of  interlinked sensors and activity logs present and active in the smart home will be a source of close,  granular and intimate data on the activities and behaviour of inhabitants and visitors.   Several economic factors may lead to poor security in smart home devices. Companies involved  in the smart home market include home appliance companies, small start-up companies, and even  crowd-funded efforts. These groups are likely to lack security expertise, security budgets and  access to security research networks and communities.   The interests of different asset owners in the smart home are not necessarily aligned and may  even be in conflict. This creates a complex environment for security activity.   Just as in many other areas of ICT, applying basic information security would significantly  increase overall security in the smart home domain.  The smart home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and physical  space. This will create new yet unknown threat and vulnerability models that are result of bringing  together both the virtual and physical contexts.

Threat landscapes can  be broad, including the entire range of cyber threats, or targeted at a particular sector, such as the  financial sector, critical infrastructure or smart homes.  Threat landscapes can also vary by the particular time horizon involved, including current threat  landscapes, emergent threat landscapes and future threat landscapes. Emerging threat landscapes  reflect threat exposure of deployments of new technology, often characterised by a low maturity  regarding technical vulnerabilities. Emerging threat landscapes also involve mapping existing threats  onto emerging technologies to better understand how the particular context is exposed to these  threats.  The scope of this threat landscape is smart home environments, with a particular focus on converged  media and television.  Smart homes can be considered a sub-category of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently been  identified as an emerging digital battlefield for information security 1 . Smart homes are also an  emergent technology, which has reached a level of technological development suitable for entry onto  the market and are therefore a relevant subject for an emergent threat landscape. The popularity and  affordability of smart homes has been increasing in recent years due to reductions in costs and  integration with mobile phones and tablets2. Converged media devices are likely to be some of the  first consumer smart home devices introduced to many homes, and will therefore be the terrain for  the initial playing out of many of the identified smart home security issues.  Goal  This threat landscape deepens the generic threat assessment of the ENISA Threat Landscapes 20123  and 20134, by taking into account the specificities of the area of smart home environments, with a  particular focus on converged media and television. It does so by following the same approach  adopted by ENISA for other thematic threat landscapes, such as the Smart Grid Threat Landscape and  1 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats, European Network  and Information Security Agency, Heraklion, 11 December 2013, p.iii.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats [accessed 27 October 2014}  2 Booton, J., “Why the ‘Smart Home’ Market is about to Take Off”, Foxbusiness, 21 January 2014.  http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2014/01/21/why-smart-homes-might-actually-be-here-to-stay/  [accessed 27 October 2014]; Warman, M., “Everything Connected: the smart home in 2014”, The Telegraph, 31  December 2013. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/Internet/10542550/Everything-connected-the- smart-home-in-2014.html [accessed 27 October 2014]  3 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2012: Responding to the Evolving Threat Environment, European Network  and Information Security Agency, Heraklion, 08 January 2013. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape [accessed 27 October 2014]  4 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats, Op. cit.. p.7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat- landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2014/01/21/why-smart-homes-might-actually-be-here-to-stay/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10542550/Everything-connected-the-smart-home-in-2014.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10542550/Everything-connected-the-smart-home-in-2014.html http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 2  Good Practice Guide from 20135  and Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for the Internet  Infrastructure6, a work conducted by ENISA in parallel in 2014. This Threat Landscape and Good  Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media is one of the deliverables (Work Package 1.1 -  Deliverable 2) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 2014 under the Work Stream “Support EU  policy building”7.  The purpose of ENISA’s work on threat landscapes is to provide stakeholders with information about  developments in the cyber-threat landscape and to identify threat trends for the near future. This is  in support of the EU Cyber Security Strategy8. In this context, this report aims to:   Identify security challenges, associated risks and required countermeasures, for emerging  technologies in smart homes, in particular, for converged media and television9.   Consider political, social, economic and technical threats, in addition to technical threats.   Take into account input from experts and the members of the ENISA informal Expert Group  (EG) established to support the compilation of the current Threat Landscape for Smart Home  and Converged Media.   Take into account existing assessments, publicly available information sources and the  perspectives of involved stakeholders.  Policy context  The EU Cyber Security Strategy10 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging trends in  cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged  Media contributes towards the achievement of objectives formulated in this Communication, in  particular, to the identification of emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution  of cyber-crime (regarding the proposed role of ENISA, see in particular section 2.4 of this  Communication).  Moreover, the ENISA Regulation11 mentions in its Recital (24) the necessity to analyse current and  emerging risks (and their components), stating that for this purpose the Agency should, “in  5 ENISA, Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide, European Network and Information Security  Agency, Heraklion, 9 December 2013. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving- threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide [accessed 27 October 2014]  6 ENISA, Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for the Internet Infrastructure, European  Network and Information Security Agency, Heraklion, 19 December 2014.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl  [accessed 19 December 2014]  7 ENISA, Work Programme 2014, 29 November 2013. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes- reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014 [accessed 27 October 2014]  8 Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee  and the Committee of the Regions, JOIN(2013) 1 final, of 7 February 2013, on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the  European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 [accessed 20 October 2014].  9 ENISA Work Programme 2014. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014, p. 19 [accessed 27 October 2014]  10 Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions, JOIN(2013) 1 final, of 7 February 2013, on the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 [accessed 20 October 2014].  11 European Parliament and the Council, Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013, Concerning the European Union  Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004, 21 May  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1413446331633&uri=CELEX:52013JC0001  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 3  cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collect  relevant information”. In particular, Article. 3 (Tasks), d), ii), states that one of the tasks to be  performed by the Agency is to “support research and development […] by […] advising the Union and  the Member States on research needs in the area of network and information security with a view to  enabling effective responses to current and emerging network and information security risks and  threats, including with respect to new and emerging information and communications technologies  […]”.The ENISA Threat Landscape is contribution to the EU Cyber Security Strategy, by streamlining  and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and their evolution. Detailing the ENISA  Threat Landscape for various emerging areas, such as smart homes, should contribute to existing  policy measures established by the European Commission.  Furthermore, the Commission has issued a recommendation12 regarding energy efficiency by means  of intelligent buildings encompassing “ICT-based innovations that may provide one of the potentially  most cost-effective means to help Member States achieve the 2020 (energy) targets”. Although being  an indirect consequence of this recommendation, such innovations will be the catalyst for the  introduction of smart home environments, as they play an important role in increasing energy  efficiency of buildings. This is an indirect, rather than a direct context. But it will result in smart  functionality being introduced in smart buildings and smart homes. This study is a first contribution  towards cyber-security issues of these environments.  Target audience  The target groups of this document are specialists and individuals who are concerned with the  development and evolution of threats in cyber space, primarily security experts interested in assessing  the “external environment” and “internal environments” in the framework of threat and risk  assessments. This information might be interesting when formulating security policies or creating  protection profiles. Interested decision makers and users of IT components may find information of  help in defining their risk appetite and in making informed investment decisions and for the protection  of potentially valuable assets and of help. This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart  Home and Converged Media provides non-security experts with information to better understand  dependencies and developments in the area of cyber-security.  The document will also be of interest to policy-makers as, in addition to providing an overview of the  threat landscape and good practices in smart home and coverged media, it identifies existing policy  measures supporting smart home security and further action that may be required for various  stakeholders.  Finally, the document is intended to serve as a basis and a resource for further research in the area of  smart home security.  2013, OJ.

Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 5  2 Smart home infrastructure including converged media and television  The fundamental concept of a smart home is one fitted or equipped with a range of interconnected  sensors (light, temperature, motion, moisture, pressure, etc.), systems (heating, lighting, security,  etc.), and devices (media devices, appliances, washing machines, fridges, home robotics, etc.), which  can be automated, monitored and controlled, e.g., through a computer or smart phone, including  from outside the home, or via the Internet. Smart homes can either be the result of integrated design,  or the accumulation of interconnected components over time, perhaps in response to changing needs  or availability of technology13. The intent is to provide the occupants with sophisticated information  about the state of their home, and to allow them to control the connected devices. In addition to  consolidated and remote control of the home, a smart home may also be able to “learn” the  preferences of its inhabitants and adapt to them. In this case, the control interfaces may fade into the  background. This shift is seen as critical to avoid overloading the household with the task of monitoring  and programming the smart home14. A smart-home-connected refrigerator might be able to monitor  its contents, and use this information to suggest potential menus or to order replacements. A smart  electricity meter connected to the smart grid might be able to respond to fluctuations in the per-unit  cost of energy by slightly adjusting the temperature of the house, or by starting the washing machine  at a later time15. A smart home might respond to the presence of certain occupants by changing  desired lighting levels. Smart homes have also been identified as particularly beneficial for assisted  living for ageing populations16.  Smart homes combine a set of currently developing technologies. Whilst the development of these  technologies is not fixed, trends are discernible. This threat landscape report focuses on the most  likely patterns of development in smart homes17.  Early approaches to home automation assumed a cohesive and harmonised model, in which a single  system would provide automation of a building, most likely provided by a single supplier, and  potentially integrated with the building at the time of its construction. Current approaches suggest a  more complex smart home environment, composed of multiple technologies from multiple  manufacturers and service providers, and often integrated on an ad-hoc basis with existing legacy  technologies and systems. This complex environment may take a range of models.  In a fully decentralised smart home, each device is autonomous, making use of the existing home  network to connect to the Internet, and transmits data to the service provider in the cloud. This is the  model adopted, for instance, by the NEST smart thermostat 18 . Each device has its own control  interface or app. The home network provides secure transmission of data in the home. Any integration  or interaction between services is accomplished by communication between different service  providers, either through a central service (such as IFTTT19), or through direct peer-to-peer integration.  13 Edwards, W.K., and Grinter, R.E., “At home with ubiquitous computing: Seven challenges” in Abowd, G.D.,  Brumitt, B., and Schafer, S.A.N., (eds.), Ubicomp, 2001, pp. 256-272.  14 Davidoff, S., Lee, M.K., Yiu, C., Zimmerman, J., and Dey, A. K., “Principles of Smart Home Control” in Dourish,  P., and Friday A. (eds.), Ubicomp 2006, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006, pp. 19-34.  15 In this manner, smart homes are closely linked to the concept of the smart grid, especially those  implementations of smart grids that intend to reduce energy used through variable pricing schemes.  16 Arcelus, A., Jones M. H., Goubran, R., and Knoefel, F., “Integration of Smart Home Technologies in Health  Monitoring System for the Elderly”, 21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and  Applications Workshop (AINAW’07), 2007.  17 For information on the identification and collection of sources, see Section 3: Methodology.  18 https://nest.com/uk/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  19 https://ifttt.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  https://nest.com/uk/ https://ifttt.com/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 6  In this context, security and privacy are not guaranteed by a single manufacturer but rather the whole  network has to be considered.  An alternative option enables local connectivity between smart devices, without the use of  connections to cloud services and without a central gateway. In this model, all devices are able to  discover each other and automatically form a smart solution by recognising their peers and their  capabilities. This model faces strong technological barriers and suffers from the absence of shared  protocols and communication standards, as well as ways of incorporating individual devices designed  to connect to the Internet.  A third alternative is a system based around a central hub or gateway of some form. A central software  system (deployed on a home desktop, a set-top-box, a smart TV) co-ordinates all the devices,  integrating their services in order to provide added value, more complex services. In this case, as the  data is confined to the home itself, security and privacy can be protected. Many approaches to home  automation adopt a home gateway (such as the GIRA Homeserver20, the QIVICON Home Base21, the  Insteon Hub22, the SmartThings Hub23, the Revolv Hub24 and the Ninja Sphere25). In addition to these  fixed devices, other devices such as smart phones, tablets, laptops and wearable technology enter and  leave the house.  We consider that the most likely and feasible scenario for the common installation of smart homes  will not be a pure form of one of these three models. One potential location for smart home gateway  or hub will be the smart media device, typically a converged media device such as a smart television.  Smart televisions have a number of attributes that contribute towards this role, which are discussed  in more detail in Section 9, Subsection: Particular issues raised for converged media. Smart phones,  which should also be considered as media devices in this context, will also play a role in controlling  the smart home.  We can gain additional insights into the likely smart home infrastructure from parallel infrastructure.  For example, hotels worldwide have been installing a range of room-automation, entertainment and  management systems for the comfort of their customers as well as for their own management, billing  and profit maximisation (for example, selling premium media content). Smart TVs are often a key  element of these systems, allowing visitors to the hotel to order services, access entertainment, and  view billing details. This can include TV over IP26. These systems are of a larger scale than the typical  home automation set-up, but utilise many of the same technologies. The large transient population  of hotels, including international business travellers and other high-value customers, makes them a  tempting target for fraudsters and for espionage, and therefore potentially exposes a large number of  people to victimise through the exploitation of information security vulnerabilities in these systems.  Hotels can be seen as leading the way in introducing these systems, and provide a perspective on how  these issues might play out as smart home technology becomes more diffuse and dispersed.  Digital convergence is the coming together of the media, telecommunications and consumer  electronics sectors, driven by several trends, including increases in processing speed, storage capacity,  20 http://www.gira.com/en/gebaeudetechnik/systeme/knx-eib_system/knx-produkte/server/homeserver.html  [accessed 20 October 2014]  21 https://www.qivicon.com/qivicon-prinzip/qivicon-home-base/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  22 http://www.insteon.com/2242-222-insteon-hub.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  23 http://www.smartthings.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  24 http://revolv.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  25 http://ninjablocks.com/pages/home [accessed 20 October 2014]  26Leyden, J., “Hotel hacking could pump smut into every room”, The Register, 22 August 2005.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/22/hotel_hacking_reloaded/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.gira.com/en/gebaeudetechnik/systeme/knx-eib_system/knx-produkte/server/homeserver.html https://www.qivicon.com/qivicon-prinzip/qivicon-home-base/ http://www.insteon.com/2242-222-insteon-hub.html http://www.smartthings.com/ http://revolv.com/ http://ninjablocks.com/pages/home http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/22/hotel_hacking_reloaded/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 7  transmission speed, compression techniques and standardisation27. Despite the increasing popularity  of consuming media through other devices such as smart phones and tablets, television remains an  important media channel for European citizens. This is expanded by the increased uptake of smart  TVs, which offer Internet connectivity, as well as other devices (such as Google Chromecast, Apple TV,  Roku streaming devices and games consoles such as the PlayStation and Xbox) that connect to non- smart TVs to grant them certain elements of smart functionality. Smart TVs are capable of  broadcasting both linear (traditional broadcast television) and non-linear (downloaded or streamed)  audio-visual content, bringing about a convergence between traditional and online media. The smart  TV offers the potential for a device, which replicates the functionality of existing TV, media player,  home cinema, music and gaming systems, connected to the Internet and a range of online services,  and may well be integrated with home automation systems as part of a smart home. Internet  connectivity and home networking also allow a range of media devices within the home to share  content with each other, streaming media to different devices28. This general convergence of media  creates a dynamic situation in which the information processed and produced by converged home  media centres will be significant, will run through a shifting set of publishers, broadcasters, search  providers, connection providers, etc., and will be highly applicable to the profiling of individuals within  the household. As networked forms of interactive communication become pervasive, they enhance  and expand monitoring practices as they can gather information about user activity29. Whilst this  convergence brings advantages to the consumer in terms of access to a wide variety of media content  on flexible terms, these systems may well not be under the full control of the user. For example, in  2013, a tech blogger reported that he discovered that some smart TVs were transmitting unencrypted  information on viewing habits, as well as the names of files stored on an external USB drive30. In  addition to social issues around privacy, access and copyright, converged media and television raise  related security issues to smart homes in terms of connectivity, embedded functionality, opaque  systems and incompatibility with traditional information security approaches, and can be understood  as a particular instance of the principles behind smart homes.  Smart homes raise security concerns. First, small, low cost, interconnected devices may not have  mature security functions, having been designed primarily for ease of set-up, use and interconnection  and having relatively low processing capability. Communication within the smart home may use a  range of protocols (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, ZigBee and others), and therefore have a number of open  vectors for exploitation. Devices which were previously considered secure (or not even within the  ambit of information security) may become vulnerable to attack, either against the device itself, or to  harness the device to propagate further malicious attacks. Your smart kettle might, without your  knowledge, participate in a botnet31. Furthermore, many current information security approaches  have been developed in the context of enterprise computing, and may not be perfectly applicable to  the context of a distributed smart home, set up and inhabited by individual consumers. Second, smart  homes will be a key point of intersection between people and technology, and as such an approach to  27 Van Oranje, C., Cave, J., Van der Mandele, M., Shindler, H.

Privacy issues in smart home are  not limited to confidentiality and access control. Smart home sensors in particular will generate a large  amount of highly personal data about activities within the home. The multiple streams of data  combined together in a smart home system create the possibility of deeper contextual background  and reveal patterns of behaviour of the inhabitants32. The visibility of the smart home occupant is  increased by the large network of third parties who may be involved in providing smart home  functionality. Smart home functions may have serious impacts upon privacy of the person, privacy of  behaviour and action, privacy of communication, privacy of data and image, privacy of location, and  privacy of association33. The role of an information industry becomes particularly important in the  shift to ubiquitous computing34. Smart home systems may include embedded features that are opaque  to the user, and do not inform the user about the status of their operation. They may also be difficult  to update and patch in response to identified vulnerabilities. Smart homes may include sensitive  systems related to the occupants’ healthcare, finances and systems related to the physical security of  the home35, which may be open to dangerous manipulation by attackers.  Responses to the security and privacy risks of smart homes will include layering effective privacy  controls, and user-centric solutions on top of other effective information security measures, adapted  to the domestic context of smart homes36. Security services, such as authentication and access control,  have to be non-intrusive, intelligent and able to adapt to the rapidly changing contexts of the spaces37.  Smart home control and management systems will have to take security into consideration. This is  likely to include decisions about the architecture of smart home systems, as well as the broader policy  and legal context.  32 Davies, N., and Langheinrich, M., “Privacy by Design”, IEEE Pervasive Computing, vol. 12, No. 3, April-June  2013, pp. 2-4.  33 Finn, R.

In addition, ENISA established  an informal expert group to collect input at various stages of the project. The group comprised five  experts in the field who, on a voluntary basis, provided their expertise, e.g., for the identification of  the relevant assets, associated risks, past incidents and existing good practices. The expert group  contributed to the finalisation of this report. This section provides an overview of the methods of  collection and the information collected as well as some of the issues encountered during this process.  Documentary sources  This report identifies the majority of sources consulted; the details of all documentary sources  consulted during the study are available on request by contacting resilience@enisa.europa.eu. 166  documentary sources were identified through a number of search methods, including specialist search  engines for academic sources and journal articles. The sources collected are primarily in English, but  also include documents in other European languages.  Interviews and groups discussion with the expert group  The study team conducted a series of semi-structured expert interviews with each of the members of  the study’s expert group. The aim of these interviews was to access these experts’ knowledge of the  field of smart home security and to identify additional documentary material for the study. The  interviews also allowed for the cross-checking of information from the documentary sources. A semi- structured approach starts with initial questions and topics for discussion but does not use a fixed  standardised question schedule. This allows the interviews to address emergent and unexpected  topics, whilst still covering the necessary material. The interviews lasted between thirty minutes and  one hour and allowed for detailed examination of specific issues and threats. The study team  supplemented individual interviews with expert group discussions and answers to written questions.  The study team provided the expert group with drafts of the report, as well as key components, such  as the valuable assets diagram, for consultation throughout the drafting process.  Issues in data collection on the specific topic  Security issues in smart homes, and those focused upon converged media and television, overlap with  other areas of research, in particular, information security, the Internet of Things, home automation,  communications, cloud security, privacy and data protection. The Internet of Things is an area  attracting attention from the general and specialist press. In some cases, relatively minor press  releases, reports or studies on smart home security have been taken up by numerous other blogs and  content aggregators, creating something of an echo-chamber, where the same basic claim is repeated  by several sources, and later appears as fact without citation. As is common with other areas of  information security, data on vulnerabilities and potential technical exploits are much more easily  available than verifiable information on actually occurring threats.  mailto:resilience@enisa.europa.eu  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 10  4 Valuable assets in smart homes and converged media  The figure below (Figure 1: Overview of Smart Home and Converged Media Assets) provides an  overview of smart home assets. An asset is anything that has value and therefore requires  protection38. Owners value assets and wish to minimise risks to those assets. Threat agents wish to  abuse, co-opt and/or damage assets, and thereby give rise to threats that increase risk to assets.  Any such typology or categorisation exercise is variable, reflecting the purpose behind the  categorisation. As such, several different approaches to categories could have been identified, with  individual assets potentially placed within multiple categories. When such a decision was required, it  was guided by the exposure of the assets to related threat families. This categorisation therefore  serves to underpin the following threat landscape. Many of these assets could be further decomposed  into components and sub-processes, and the categorisation here attempts to strike a balance between  covering key significant categories and relevant detail.  In this threat landscape the following assets groups have been identified: Sensors, Software, Human- machine interface devices, Home networking, Audio/Visual, Information Storage, Home appliances,  Integrated Home services, Robotics, Tags and markers, Building security, connected transportation,  Medical, Information, Management/operation, and People/living. Identified assets and sub-assets are  categorised and listed under these assets groups. E.g., under the asset group Sensors, the assets  Temperature, Lights, Microphones, etc. are listed.  This asset list has been developed from an examination of common models of actual and potential  smart homes, guided by the development scenarios outline in the previous section. Given the modular  and potentially idiosyncratic nature of real-world smart home set-ups, the study team does not  suggest that all smart homes will necessarily contain all of these assets. Individual set-ups will be  determined by a mixture of occupant or owner choices and requirements, budgets, available  technology, and compatibility with existing or legacy systems. Smart homes might be understood as  sitting somewhere on a continuum from those with a small number of such assets to those that include  the full range. Regardless, the different classes of assets result in complex environments even within  a single home, since they are produced by different manufacturers and may be installed in an ad hoc  manner.  Smart home technology, including converged media and television, is still developing, and new  applications are being developed. The study team hopes this categorisation of assets will remain  relevant for some years due to the selected level of abstraction and the capacity of several categories  to accept new assets.  The asset list includes non-ICT assets where these assets are exposed to potential harm from ICT assets  and where those assets may be a potential route to attack ICT assets.  38 ISO/IEC 27005:2011 Information technology – security techniques – Information security risk management.

The threats included in this collection of threats are all applicable to the smart home assets presented  in the previous section. The presented threat taxonomy covers mainly cyber-security threats, that is,  threats applying to information and communication technology assets. Some additional non-IT threats  have been assumed in order to cover threats to physical assets that are necessary to operate the  considered ICT-assets. This threat taxonomy draws upon the threat taxonomies developed for the  ENISA Threat Landscape 201339 and the Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide40.  Please note that the use of colour is to distinguish between threat categories, and does not signify any  correlation between threats in this figure and assets in the previous figure.  In this threat landscape the following threats groups have been identified: Physical attacks,  Unintentional damage (accidental), Disasters, Damage/Loss (IT assets), Failures/Malfunctions,  Outages, Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking, Nefarious activity/Abuse, and Legal.  Identified threats and sub-threats are categorised and listed under these threat groups. E.g., under  the threat group Unintentional damage (accidental), the threats Information leakage or sharing,  Erroneous use or administration of devices and systems, Using information from an unreliable source,  etc. are listed.  The specific smart home threats are described in Section 6.  39 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2013: Overview of current and emerging cyber threats, Op. cit, 2013.

Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 14  6 Specific smart home threats  By analysing existing literature on smart home and converged media security (See Section 3:  Methodology), we have identified specific threats that have been taken into account in existing  assessments. These threats include some widely applicable cyber security threats, which manifest in  particular ways in the smart home environment, as well as threats that emerged from the specific  smart home research.  The threats analysed include those that are applicable to the specific smart home with a focus upon  converged media infrastructure, as set out in Section 2. The specific smart home threats encountered  in the analysed literature are structured below, according to the categories mentioned in Figure 2:  Overview of Threats Assumed for Smart Home Assets. They are presented by means of threat details  of particular threats and threat groups.  The sequence of the specific smart home threats presented below is not prioritised because the  analysed material has not provided any information that would allow prioritising threats. Given the  fact that no significant experience exists in this domain from existing implementations (i.e., through  incident statistics in this area), no attempt has been made to introduce any priorities for these threats.  Threat Group: Physical attacks  The majority of smart home assets are physically located objects, which can be physically damaged,  and many have a financial value motivating theft. These smart home assets are therefore potentially  vulnerable to physical attacks, which may remove or damage the assets, degrading or preventing their  functionality. Physical attacks can also disrupt the communications between smart home  components.  Some smart home assets, such as smart phones, tablets, removable storage media and computers,  may physically move in and out of the home making them more vulnerable when outside. Smart  homes may feature sensors on the exterior of the building, which may make them more vulnerable to  sabotage or damage than internal components.  Physical access to smart home assets is important as many manufacturers assume that only the device  owner will have physical access to the device, thus ensuring security. Physical access to smart home  devices can allow for uploading new software 41 , adding hardware components, changing device  settings, and even extracting encryption keys42.  Threat Group: Unintentional damage (accidental)  Threat: Information leakage or sharing  Smart homes are complex networks of sensors and collect significant information on inhabitants.  Inhabitants and visitors may reveal more information to the smart home sensors than they intend or  anticipate, and may further share information through incorrect security settings43.  41 Lawler, R., “Nest Learning Thermostat has its security cracked open by GTV Hacker”, June 23rd 2014.  http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/23/nest-thermostat-rooted/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  42 Bowers, B., “ZigBee Wireless Security: A New Age Penetration Tester's Toolkit”, 9 January 2012.  http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1823368&seqNum=4 [accessed 20 October 2014]  43 Ward, M., “Why your washing machine is a security risk”, BBC, 4 August 2014.  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479  [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/23/nest-thermostat-rooted/ http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1823368&seqNum=4 http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 15  Many smart home and converged media devices lack dedicated security software and secure  encrypted communications (due to a lack of processing or electrical power, the added cost and  decreased convenience of adding encryption, or the difficulty of correctly establishing secure  communications). This increases the likelihood of unintentional information leakage.  The way the smart home is organised impacts upon the probability of information leakage. For  example, smart home technologies that make use of cloud services for information storage are reliant  upon the security of those services to prevent information leakage, in addition to securing information  inside the smart home. The greater the number of external connections, the greater the chance of  information leakage.  Additionally, the service providers that collect and process smart home data may be acquired by other  companies in a way that is unanticipated by the data subject. These companies may then process the  data collected in unanticipated ways, and potentially against the interests and wishes of the data  subject44.  Threat: Erroneous use or administration of devices or systems  Smart homes are complex systems with multiple devices and technologies, and with complex  interoperability between them, through different protocols, which can make administration a difficult  task. Smart homes are further complicated through any form of automation or learning, which can be  hard to anticipate. Smart home systems can be powerful (heating, lighting, water, physical access) and  erroneous use of these can therefore cause physical damage to the systems themselves or to the  home environment generally. Despite attempts to make smart home interaction “natural”, many of  the design techniques and cues that simplify interaction with a graphical user interface are not  available with sensor-based systems 45 . For example, multiple errors can occur through voice- controlled smart home systems46.  Threat: Using information from an unreliable source  Automated smart home systems that respond to the behaviour of inhabitants (for example, heating  that comes on when an inhabitant arrives home) may be activated on the basis of unreliable sensor  readings, leading to un-required activation. Compromised devices can be redirected towards  unreliable sources. Smart TVs that allow the broadcaster control over the purported origin of web  content would allow a malicious broadcaster to inject any script of his choice into websites accessed  through the TV47 48.  44Davies, S., “Google takes a dangerous stride from your hear to your home”.  http://www.privacysurgeon.org/blog/incision/google-takes-a-bold-stride-from-your-head-to-your-home/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  45 Bellotti, V., Back, M.

Threat: Inadequate design and planning or a lack of adaptation  Inadequate design and planning are key issues for smart homes as they can cause security and privacy  problems. Inadequate design can occur at the level of smart home components and services, and at  the level of the general installation and integration of the smart home as a whole.  At the component level, poor security design can range from a lack of security methods to poor  implementation of security. For example, incorrectly set up Secure Sockets Layer certificates may  mean that information is transmitted without encryption49. Or a device might ship with unchangeable  default passwords50. Smart home components may be developed by manufacturers with limited  experience of security design, as they add connectivity to their existing products. Alternatively,  security features may be limited in order to keep the cost of the devices affordable. Smart TVs may  have a combination of over-the-air updates, and a lack of firewalls51.  With the increase in stand-alone smart gadgets that connect to existing Wi-Fi networks, smart home  functionality can be created piece-by-piece in an ad-hoc manner by inexperienced users. These users  may not plan for the security of the smart home as a whole. The absence of privacy-by-design52  measures in the smart home also exposes the smart home to unwanted information leakage and its  potential misuse.  Threat Group: Disasters (natural, environmental)  Threats from disasters are not particularly prevalent in the current literature on smart home security,  with the exception of the potential role of flood detection systems and general emergency alert  systems. However, physical smart home assets are as vulnerable to these threats as any other physical  device. Smart home components are often integrated into the structure of a building, or otherwise  installed in appropriate locations within it (for example, wall mounted sensors). They can also be quite  large (e.g., integrated smart heating system) and are therefore difficult to move in response to a  disaster. Smart home and converged media systems are sensitive electronics networked together in a  complicated arrangement and are therefore vulnerable to changes in the environment. Fire, flood,  pollution, dust, corrosion, lightning53, water, violent physical movement and unfavourable climatic  conditions are likely to significantly degrade or prevent smart home functionality and decrease the  49 Wisniewski, C., Smart meter hacking can disclose which TV shows and movies you watch, 8 January 2012.  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/01/08/28c3-smart-meter-hacking-can-disclose-which-tv-shows-and- movies-you-watch/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  50 Chirgwin, R., “SmartTV, dumb vuln: Philips hard-codes Miracast passwords”, The Register, 2 Apr 2014.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/04/02/smarttv_dumb_vuln_philips_hardcodes_miracast_passwords/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  51 Roberts, P., “Samsung Smart TV: Like A Web App Riddled With Vulnerabilities”, 1 August 2013.  https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with-vulnerabilities/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  52 About “privacy-by-design”, see, for instance, Privacy and data protection by design --- bridging policy and  technology (provisional title), a work conducted by ENISA in 2014, to be published on the ENISA website.

Building management systems may be placed under particular  strain from extreme changes in climate and environment. Natural disasters are likely to cause outages  in services necessary for the smart home, including Internet connection and electrical power54 55.  Additionally, natural disasters can have long lasting impacts56.  In contrast with physical components, virtual assets in a connected smart home with converged  media, can be better protected from physical threats due to external storage in the cloud. The specific  location of threat is important for determining the vulnerability of an asset. For example, external  information storage is not vulnerable to natural disaster in the location of smart home, but is  vulnerable to natural disaster in the location of the server.  Threat Group: Damages or loss (IT assets)  Threat: Damage caused by a third-party  (Similar to Threat Group: Physical attack, see above).  Threat: Loss from DRM (Digital rights management) conflicts  Media content use in the smart home and converged media environment may be protected by digital  rights management methods, both in software and in hardware. Hardware devices can be protected  against tampering through certificates and tamper-switches. Improperly implemented DRM might  result in the blocking or deletion of legitimately owned media content or in extreme cases to damage  to hardware (“bricking”) 57. DRM policies may also prevent access to desired functions58.  Threat: Loss of (integrity of) sensitive information  Smart homes and converged media devices potentially collect and store large amount of sensitive  information and this increases the attack surface and the opportunity for information leakage. This  can be exacerbated by poor security design, implementation or management and by a lack of  encrypted communication59. Additionally, it may not be immediately obvious to smart home users  what information can be collected by the smart home, and how sensitive this information might be  (and therefore what is the appropriate level of protection). Many smart home and converged media  devices lack dedicated security software and secure encrypted communications (due to a lack of  54 Heidemann, J., Quan, L., and Pradki, J., “A Preliminary Analysis of Network Outages during Hurricane Sandy”,  USC/ISI Technical Report, ISI-TR-685b, February 2013. ftp://ftp.isi.edu/isi-pubs/tr-685.pdf [accessed 27 October  2014]  55 Erjongmanee, S., Chuanyi, J., Stokely J. and Hightower N., “Interference of Network-Service Disruption upon  Natural Disasters”, Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data, Springer, 2010.  http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  56 ENISA, Annual Incident Reports 2013, 16 September 2014. http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience- and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013, p. iii.  57 North, D., Using piracy devices could brick your Nintendo 3DS, 3 July 2011.  http://www.destructoid.com/using-piracy-devices-could-brick-your-nintendo-3ds-195895.phtml [accessed 20  October 2014]  58 Cushing, T., \"LG Will Take the 'Smart' Out Of Your Smart TV If You Don't Agree To Share Your Viewing And  Search Data With Third Parties”, 20 May 2014. https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg- will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third- parties.shtml [accessed 20 October 2014]  59 Goodin, D., “Crypto weakness in smart LED lightbulbs exposes Wi-Fi passwords”, 7 July 2014.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  ftp://ftp.isi.edu/isi-pubs/tr-685.pdf http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013 http://www.destructoid.com/using-piracy-devices-could-brick-your-nintendo-3ds-195895.phtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 18  processing or electrical power, the added cost and decreased convenience of adding encryption, or  the difficulty of correctly establishing secure communications). This increases the likelihood of  unintentional information leakage.  Threat: Loss or destruction of devices, storage media, and documents  Smart home and converged media systems are likely to store significant media and documents. Unless  stored in external cloud storage systems, these are likely to be retained in the home itself. Documents  and media in the smart home may include both physical and digital media. Some smart home devices  are mobile and may be exposed to damage or loss outside the smart home, where data leakage  resulting from device loss of threat is one of the highest risks60.  Threat: Loss of information in the cloud  Loss of smart home-related information (sensor records, activity, preferences and settings, account  details) stored in the cloud can lead to the loss of functionality of cloud-based services61, or the system  to return to factory default. Information in the cloud also likely includes media content, documents  and files, which are valuable, and may be either costly, or impossible to replace. Cloud service  providers themselves may go out of business, making stored information inaccessible62.  Threat: Information leakage  The smart home offers significant opportunities for surveillance, espionage, law enforcement, social  surveillance (voyeurism) and other potential invasions of privacy. In addition to the nefarious  activity/abuse threats described below, information could leak from improper destruction of smart  home components, particularly memory and storage63.  Threat Group: Failures/malfunctions  Smart homes and converged media devices are complex systems, reliant upon a number of different  inputs, and are vulnerable to failures and malfunctions64. In many cases failure or malfunction will  result in the smart home service being unavailable. In some cases this will be a minor nuisance, for  example being unable to access media, but in others could result in costly damage, for example, a  defrosted freezer, or doors that cannot be opened without repair. Impacts will be dependent upon  the failure states of the devices and how they are designed to deal with disruption of service, power  supply or communication links. Cloud-based smart home and media services are reliant upon the  Internet connection for services and may be nearly useless without it. Recovery from failure can be  60 See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-applications/smartphone-security- 1/top-ten-risks [accessed 20 October 2014]  61 Dabbs, A., “Cloud computing is FAIL and here’s why”, The Register, 16 May 2014.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/16/cloud_computing_is_fail_and_heres_why/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  62 Lawton, S., “When Cloud Providers Fail: Creating A Cloud Storage Backup Plan”, 7 January 2014.  http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/cloud-storage-backup-plan,1-1529.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  63 Doner, K., “Information Security and Computer Disposal”, Property Professional.  https://www.npma.org/Archives/Vol.18-1-Donner.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  64 Kapitanova, K., Hoque, E., Stankovic, J.

For example, a device might have to be physically reset or  rebooted by the user, who may be physically remote.  A particular issue for smart home services, and for devices in general, is that if the service or vendor  company goes out of business then the device may no longer be supported and updated, and spare  parts may not be available. This may leave vulnerabilities un-patched or remove particular  functionality from the smart home. This may be a particular risk in a relatively emergent market with  a large number of start-up companies, which may be at high risk of failure and leave users without  services65.  As with other areas of electronics, the quality of smart home components may be variable and some  devices may be more likely to malfunction than others within a category66. Smart gadgets might be  appealing to counterfeit manufacturers.  Exploiting failure states can facilitate other threats. For example, if a component that has lost network  connectivity it may search for other networks to connect to, which may allow it to be hijacked.  Threat Group: Outages  Smart homes are reliant upon a range of resources and services to provide sophisticated functionality.  Outages in these inputs can have a negative impact upon the functionality of the smart home.  Threat: Lack of resources/electricity  Smart home and converged media systems require electricity. Whilst some of the smaller components  can operate on battery power, the larger systems, including integrated home services, and most  audio-visual and home networking, will require mains power. Functionality of these devices will be  significantly degraded or stop entirely, with a loss of electricity. Major home integrated services such  as heating and plumbing also require input from external services to function.  In some cases short term outages will be a minor nuisance, for example being unable to access media,  but in others could result in costly damage, for example, a defrosted freezer. The level of disruption is  dependent upon the failure states of the devices and how they are designed to deal with disruption  of service, power supply or communication links. Recovery from outages can be complicated by the  design of the system. For example, a device might have to be physically reset or rebooted by the user,  who may be physically remote or unaware of the problem.  Threat: Internet outage  Internet outage to the smart home will prevent any remote access to the smart home systems from  outside, and will prevent the smart home from accessing an external resources dependent upon an  active Internet connection. In particular for converged media, this will include any media content  delivered over IP or stored in the cloud.  Threat: Loss of support services  Support services includes any cloud services, any monitoring, security or analytics services not locally  hosted, and support services (including call centres and helplines) for audio-visual services. This can  65 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU [accessed 20 October 2014]  66 Hnat, T. W., Srinivasan, V., Lu, J., Sookoor, T. I, Dawson, R., Stankovic, J., and Whitehouse, K., “The  hitchhiker’s guide to successful residential sensing deployments”, InSenSys, 2011.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 20  also include the business failure of service providers, or their decision to withdraw a particular service.  Loss of support services may make the routine operation of the smart home more difficult, but are  likely to be particularly problematic in the event of another failure or problem, as the absence of  support services will complicate recovery, as advice, guidance, and potential service replacement, may  not be available.  Threat: Absence of personnel  In the domestic smart home context described in section two, the knowledge and skills required to  manage the smart home are likely to be unevenly distributed amongst the inhabitants; for instance,  some members of a family may not know how to operate the smart home, or may not be allowed to.  The absence of the owner/controller of the smart home, or other knowledgeable inhabitants, may  complicate general operation, recovery from error, or response to attacks and threats.  Threat: Strikes  In this context, strikes as a threat are most likely to manifest as outages in electricity, support services,  or other resources, with impacts as above. Some warning may be available.  Threat: Network outages  Network outages in the smart home with converged media may occur as a result of hardware failure  or software error, interference, deliberate attack, or power failure. The result would include a loss of  local connectivity between smart home components, with a resulting near total loss of smart home  functionality. Additionally, network outages outside the home might degrade functionality, depending  upon what services, capabilities or information are stored or provided externally.  Threat Group: Eavesdropping/interception/hijacking  Eavesdropping, interception and hijacking are key threats to smart homes and converged media. The  large number of sensors, as well as devices that log fine-grained details of the behaviour of people in  the home, produces significant information on the inhabitants such as their regular habits, consumer  activity, presence or absence, health, and preferences. This information is valuable for several actors,  both illegal and illegal. Secondly, smart homes feature high levels of communication between different  devices over a range of protocols and technologies. These increasingly include wireless protocols such  as Wi-Fi, Z-wave67, Zigbee, Bluetooth and others.  End devices do not have the processing power (or energy if on batteries) for encryption in the home,  which makes them very vulnerable to sniffing, replay attacks, man in the middle and taking control of  the gadgets when in physical proximity. Smart TVs and other converged media devices may  themselves log viewing habits, and may transmit these logs to the manufacturer, or to a service  provider68. The physical location of the smart TV, often in the centre of a home, provides a good  position for monitoring a location and the activity within it69.  67 Fouladi, B., and Ghanoun, S., “Security Evaluation of the Z-wave Wireless Protocol.”  http://research.sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20 Z-Wave_WP.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  68 McAllister, N., “You THINK you're watching your LG smart TV - but IT's WATCHING YOU, baby  Phones home with the names of videos you watch, too”, The Register, 20 Nov 2013.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/20/lg_smart_tv_data_collection/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  69 Ferrante D., Auriemma, L., Smart TV INsecurity, 2014,  http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://research.sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20Z-Wave_WP.pdf http://research.sensepost.com/cms/resources/conferences/2013/bh_zwave/Security%20Evaluation%20of%20Z-Wave_WP.pdf http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/20/lg_smart_tv_data_collection/ http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 21  Lifestyle data gathered from the smart home is likely to be very attractive to advertisers and data- miners70.  Threat: War driving  War driving involves seeking out vulnerable wireless communications in a mobile manner (for example  from a moving vehicle or walking with a portable device). The wireless communications protocols in  the smart home may extend some distance from the house itself, making them vulnerable to war  driving. It is likely that multiple smart homes will be located in the same area, making these areas an  attractive target for war driving. If wireless networks are accessed through war driving, then the  attackers may be able to effect physical and visible changes to the smart home (e.g. turn lights on/off)  that will confirm the physical location of the identified network. War driving may serve as a relatively  slow way of identifying unsecured building automation systems71. War driving has been demonstrated  for the ZigBee protocol72.  Threat: Interception of compromising emissions  It is possible to detect what TV programme is being watched based upon monitoring the electricity  consumption of a smart TV73.  Threat: Interception of information  As threats for the general category of Eavesdropping/Interception/hijacking. Smart home and  converged media environments contain large amounts of information, which is communicated  through multiple protocols with differing levels of security. For example, signals from video-over-IP  cameras can be intercepted and received by an attacker74.  It is difficult to learn that much about individual behaviour from a single smart device, but with  multiple devices and some contextual knowledge it becomes easier to make inferences about  behaviour. At least sufficient to support aggressive advertising, reminders, deals etc. and this can  influence the inhabitants’ way of living.  Threat: Interfering radiation  Multiple smart home devices from different manufacturers, using different wireless communication  protocols may potentially interfere with each other, or compete for bandwidth. Multiple smart homes  in close proximity may experience interference between Wi-Fi on the same channel causing the signal  70 Ward, M., Op. cit., http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 [accessed 20 October 2014]  71 Storm, D., “Botnets coming soon to a smart home or automated building near you”, Computerworld, 4 June  2014. http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a- smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  72 Goodsspeed, T., “Wardriving for Zigbee”, 23February 2012.  http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/wardriving-for-zigbee.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  73 Brinkhaus, S., Carluccio, D., Greveler, U., Justus, B., Löhr, D., Wegener, C., “Smart Hacking For Privacy”.  http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/1968_28c3-abstract- smart_hacking_for_privacy.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  74 Larose, C., Veness, A., “Internet Peeping Toms and The Internet of Things Face New Hurdles: FTC Settles with  TRENDnet, Inc.”, 10September 2013. http://www.privacyandsecuritymatters.com/2013/09/Internet-peeping- toms-and-the-Internet-of-things-face-new-hurdles-ftc-settles-with-trendnet-inc/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a-smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a-smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/wardriving-for-zigbee.html http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/1968_28c3-abstract-smart_hacking_for_privacy.pdf http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/1968_28c3-abstract-smart_hacking_for_privacy.pdf http://www.privacyandsecuritymatters.com/2013/09/internet-peeping-toms-and-the-internet-of-things-face-new-hurdles-ftc-settles-with-trendnet-inc/ http://www.privacyandsecuritymatters.com/2013/09/internet-peeping-toms-and-the-internet-of-things-face-new-hurdles-ftc-settles-with-trendnet-inc/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 22  quality to degrade. Deliberate jamming of smart home communications may also be possible75, and  jamming devices designed for common smart home frequencies are available for sale76.  Threat: Replay of messages  Replay attacks involve replaying captured packets back to a smart home network in order to replay  the previous activity. Smart home wireless communications protocols, including ZigBee have minimal  protection against replay attacks77. These can attack wireless communication components from within  radio range of the smart home78. Replaying control signals in smart homes may allow for the bypassing  of locks and other security systems.  Threat: Network reconnaissance and information gathering  Network reconnaissance in the smart home and converged media context involves building up a  model of the smart home network, its systems and services, and its vulnerabilities. Network  reconnaissance may be the precursor to other forms of attack. Internet connected devices with poor  security (including smart TVs79) may facilitate reconnaissance of other devices connected to the same  network.  Threat: Man-in-the-middle/session hijacking  Man-in-the-middle attacks involve an attacker making independent connections with two parties or  devices and relaying communications between them. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on  communications and control other elements of the communication. In this smart home context this  might include common devices which lack properly implemented encrypted communications80 81and  end point authentication, such as unencrypted wireless access points, and baby monitors 82 .  Vulnerabilities that could allow man-in-the-middle attacks have been identified in the ZigBee and Z- Wave protocols83.  75 Mpitziopoulos, A., Gavalas, D., Konstantopoulos, C., Pantziou, G., \"A survey on jamming attacks and  countermeasures in WSNs\", Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE, vol.11, no.4, pp.42, 56, Fourth Quarter  2009.  76 See for instance: http://www.jammer-store.com/868mhz-car-remote-control-jammer.html [accessed 20  October 2014]  77 Bowers, B., “ZigBee Wireless Security: A New Age Penetration Tester's Toolkit”, 9 January 2012.  http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1823368&seqNum=4 [accessed 20 October 2014]  78 Reuter, T., Security analysis of wireless communication standards for home automation, Der Technischen  Universität München, 15 November 2013, p.5  https://www.sec.in.tum.de/assets/Uploads/MAThomasReuter.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  79 Oren Y., and Keromytis, A.

Threat: Repudiation of actions  Repudiation of actions involves the malicious manipulation or falsification of the identification of  actions, often involving the deletion of logs. Within the smart home and converged media this would  allow for attackers to cover their involvement in an action, including access to smart home services,  or to attribute actions to others, including smart home inhabitants85 86.  Threat Group: Nefarious activity/abuse  Threat: Identity fraud  Smart homes systems may store and manage credentials for various functions and services which the  home provides and makes use of. These credentials may be for use internally (identity, user accounts,  permissions, preferences and settings or access conditions) or externally (media accounts, cloud  storage, billing and home delivery, security alarms, external management or analytics). These  credentials are likely to include payment details (credit card or account numbers) which are desirable  targets for financially motivated cyber criminals87. Information about user behaviour, preferences,  habits, travel, media consumption etc., collected and stored in the smart home, may assist more  detailed forms of impersonation fraud. A more local form of identity fraud can include the  unauthorised use of smart home user accounts belonging to other inhabitants.  Threat: Unsolicited and infected email  Smart home devices may have their own email accounts (this is common for web-connected printers  and for e-reader devices) and this can be exploited to send messages to these devices, potentially as  a form of spam88, but also as a delivery vector for malware.  Threat: Denial of service  Traditional denial of service and distributed denial or service attacks on information systems can be  threats to the smart home, given Internet-connected components89. Such attacks may be the first step  84 Upton, L., “Rickmote: Rickrolling Chromecast users”, 16 July 2014. http ://www.raspberrypi.org/rickmote- rickrolling-chromecast-users/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  85 Mantas, G., Lymberopoulos, D., and Komninos, N., “Security in the Smart Home Environment”, Wireless  Technologies for Ambient Assisted Living and Healthcare, 2011. http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless- technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 [accessed 27 October 2014]  86 Krishnamurthy, P., Kabara, J., and Anusasamornkul, T., (2002).

The physical elements in the smart home environment also offer the possibility of physical denial of  service attacks90. If an attacker can gain control of smart home components then she could activate  these in order to deny access and use to legitimate users (for example, repeatedly turning lights on  and off, lock all access to and from the building91, turning off heating, changing media source, playing  loud music, etc.).  Threat: Malicious code/software activity  Malicious code and software activity underpin many of the other threats to the smart home and  converged media. Many smart home devices are essentially computers, often running a variant of  Linux and with the capacity to perform other functions92 93. They can therefore be reprogrammed by  an attacker with access to run software that the attacker desires. This generative functionality has  been demonstrated on multiple devices from large manufacturers94 and is likely to also affect home- built or custom smart environments. This opens up a wider range of threats, including monitoring  network traffic, controlling other devices, and extracting information stored in the system (including  both sensitive personal data and media content). In addition to accessing the information systems in  the smart home, the Internet connected devices can potentially be used for external functions desired  by the attacker, for example, hosting malware or illegal websites, operating as part of a botnet, or  sending spam emails95 96. For some smart home devices, physical access is advantageous for installing  malicious code.  Threat: Abuse of information leakage  See also “Information leakage” under “Physical attacks”, and “Unintentional damage”. Information  leakage can be exploited for further nefarious activity including crime and surveillance97.  90 Wendzel, S., Zwanger, V., Meier, M., and Szlósarczyk, S., “Envisioning Smart Building Botnets”, Sicherheit  2014. http://www.wendzel.de/dr.org/files/Papers/EnvisioningSmartBuildings.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  91 Storm, D., “Botnets coming soon to a smart home or automated building near you”, Computerworld, 4 June  2014, http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476386/cybercrime-hacking/botnets-coming-soon-to-a- smart-home-or-automated-building-near-you.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  92 Stross C., Trust Me (I’m a kettle), December 12, 2013, http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog- static/2013/12/trust-me.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  93 Leyden, J., “Patch Bash NOW: ‘Shellshock’ bug blasts OS X, Linux systems wide open”, The Register, 24  September 2014, http ://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/09/24/bash_shell_vuln/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  94 HP, Internet of Things Research Study, July 2014. http ://fortifyprotect.com/HP_IoT_Research_Study.pdf  [accessed 20 October 2014]  95Proofpoint Inc., “Your Fridge is Full of SPAM, part II: Details”, 21 January 2014.  http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/your-fridge-is-full-of-spam-part-ll-details.php ; Goodin, D., “Is  your refrigerator really part of a massive spam-sending botnet?”, 17 January 2014.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/is-your-refrigerator-really-part-of-a-massive-spam-sending-botnet/ ;  Thomas, P., “Despite the News, Your Refrigerator is Not Yet Sending Spam”, 23 January 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/despite-news-your-refrigerator-not-yet-sending-spam [All accessed  20 October 2014]  96 Hussein, E., Talmat, S., “Behind ADSL Lines: How to Bankrupt ISPs While Making Money”, 28 March 2013.  http://blog.ioactive.com/2013/03/behind-adsl-lines-how-to-bankrupt-isps.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  97 Titlow, J.

This can then be used to force updates,  potentially containing malware or undesired functionality, to smart home components.  Threat: Manipulation of hardware and software  Vulnerabilities have been identified in many smart TV systems from different manufacturers, which  allow for the software running on the TV set to be altered99. Smart home hardware may potentially  be pre-manipulated during production to include undesired functions, spyware, or hardware  backdoors100. Smart home inhabitants many manipulate their own hardware (for example, hacking a  set-top box to receive additional TV services101), which may violate license conditions if this hardware  is not fully owned, or is required to be in a particular state to receive services.  Threat: Manipulation of information  Smart home sensors could be fed false information, which could be particularly important for access  or for bypassing security measures (biometric sensors or facial recognition). Falsification of records  could be part of blackmail, fraud or escalation of privileges. Smart home audio-visual systems could  be used to display false data. HbbTV broadcasts allow for an attacker to insert malicious content over  a large geographical footprint102.  Threat: Misuse of audit tools  Audit tools, such as system logs103 will collate a large amount of information on behaviour in the smart  home from which information on the inhabitants could be extrapolated.  Threat: Falsification of records  Falsification of records could be used to plant false records in order to embarrass or blackmail  inhabitants, as well as to hide other nefarious behaviour (theft, illegal access, etc.) from the system  owner. This is necessary for long-term misuse of smart home assets and is a component of rootkits104.  98 Bodnar, C., Op. cit. https://blog.kaspersky.co.uk/dont-shop-or-bank-with-a-smart-tv/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  99 “European HbbTV Smart TV Holes Make Sets Hackable”,  http ://it.slashdot.org/story/13/06/05/1216232/european-hbbtv-smart-tv-holes-make-sets-hackable [accessed  20 October 2014]  100 Sharwood, S., “Don’t Brew That Cuppa!

These provide access to control over the smart  home’s functions. Exploitation of app-based control methods for smart devices is possible to gain  access to and control over the device106. In some contexts, for example elder-care and medical devices,  administration tools might be located off-site to administer a number of smart homes together.  Gaining access to these administrative credentials would allow an attacker to control multiple smart  homes at the same time.  Threat: Unauthorised access to the information system/network  Unauthorised access to the information system in the smart home context allows for the extraction  of information about the inhabitants, including their behaviours, preferences, and credentials. It  allows the attacker to change settings, and install or manipulate software. Unauthorised access allows  the user to replicate all the activity available to the legitimate user, and therefore for act as an  inhabitant. They can then access media and other information, cause operations and effect physical  changes107 (including remotely), and can cause downloads, purchases etc., feed false information to  sensors, and access information and records. Depending upon the extent to which the smart home  design has integrated different accounts and services, then access to the smart home administration  potentially offers access to a number of different services. Access can be facilitated by poorly set-up  access controls108.  Threat: Unauthorised use of software  Unauthorised use of software that is legitimately installed on smart home components could include  remote activation, as well as event logging, identification/authentication methods, use of any installed  apps, visualisation tools or web-based control panels. Unauthorised use of existing software could  include the exploitation of very common pieces of software109 110.  105 Emspak, J., “A Phone That Lies for You”, 1 June 2014. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-phone- that-lies-for-you-an-android-hack-allows-users-to-put-decoy-data-on-a-smartphone/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  106 Ward, M., Op. cit. http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 [accessed 20 October 2014]  107 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/13/wave_goodbye_to_security_with_zwave/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  108 Ray, B., “Revealed: Simple ‘open sesame’ to unlock your home by radiowave”, 13 Aug 2013.  http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access- 5926.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  109 Heilman, D., “Hackers Exploit Shellshock, Much More Trouble Awaits”, 29 September 2014.  http://www.toptechnews.com/article/index.php?story_id=00100018PJ5T [accessed 20 October 2014]  110 Zolfagharifard E., Woollaston, V.,“Bash bug could be worse than Heartbleed’: ‘Catastrophic’ flaw may  threaten the security of millions of internet-connected devices”, 24 September 2014.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2769514/Bash-bug-worse-Heartbleed-Catastrophic-flaw- threaten-security-millions-Internet-connected-devices.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-phone-that-lies-for-you-an-android-hack-allows-users-to-put-decoy-data-on-a-smartphone/ http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-phone-that-lies-for-you-an-android-hack-allows-users-to-put-decoy-data-on-a-smartphone/ http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28582479 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/13/wave_goodbye_to_security_with_zwave/ http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.toptechnews.com/article/index.php?story_id=00100018PJ5T http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2769514/Bash-bug-worse-Heartbleed-Catastrophic-flaw-threaten-security-millions-internet-connected-devices.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2769514/Bash-bug-worse-Heartbleed-Catastrophic-flaw-threaten-security-millions-internet-connected-devices.html  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 27  Threat: Unauthorised installation of software  See “Badware” (below) for likely threats emerging from unauthorised installation of software.  Unauthorised installation of software by inhabitants might compromise licensing agreements or might  expose the system to trojans or backdoors included in cracked versions of software111.  Threat: Compromising confidential information  The sensors in the smart home (microphones, video, face recognition, biometrics) in physical space,  as well as the activity logging through various devices and accounts allows for the collection of highly  granular confidential information on inhabitants and visitors112 113. This information may be stored  locally, or transmitted over local networks, and even into cloud storage. This also applies to  confidential documents that might be stored on the home network. Attackers could compromise this  confidential information through access to any of the relevant components, but particularly through  access to physical and remote storage, the network router, or the smart home hub. Attackers may  also compromise this confidential information by undermining security measures, including  encryption.  Threat: Abuse of authorizations  The smart home and converged media context offers a large number of potential user accounts for  media services, as well as external smart home services. This increases the number of authorizations  that could be misused. This would include the sharing of accounts within or between households when  this is not authorised by the content provider. A common example in converged media is the use of  one streaming media account by multiple people in different locations114.  Threat: Abuse of personal data  The significant personal data on inhabitants and visitors that could be collected by the sensors and  system logs in a smart home115 could be valuable for a range of purposes that may not be desired by  the smart home owner. These purposes include targeted advertising, profiling and categorisation,  identity fraud, disclosure of personal information, espionage, journalism, law-enforcement, and  general invasions of privacy.  Threat: Hoax  The smart home with converged media can support hoax activity in three ways. Firstly, it contains a  number of information sources, which could be fed false information, in order to propagate a hoax.  111 Reisinger, D., “Could your printer be a Trojan horse? Researchers say yes!”, 29 November 2011.  http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/could-your-printer-be-a-trojan-horse-researchers-say-yes/ accessed 20  October 2014 [accessed 27 October 2014]  112 O’Hara, K., “Privacy and the Internet of Things”, Internet of Things Ecosystem – the Next 40 Billion Devices,  NESTA, 3 June 2014.  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf [accessed  27 October 2014]  113 http://readwrite.com/2013/03/18/smart-homes-our-next-digital-privacy-nightmare [accessed 20 October  2014]  114 http ://gigaom.com/2012/02/13/tv-everywhere-password-sharing/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  115 Haowen, C., and Perrig, A., “Security and Privacy in Sensor Networks”, IEEE Computer, 36(10), October  2003. https ://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/group/pub/chan_perrig_secure_sensor_article.pdf [accessed 27 October  2014]  http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/could-your-printer-be-a-trojan-horse-researchers-say-yes/ http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf http://readwrite.com/2013/03/18/smart-homes-our-next-digital-privacy-nightmare http://gigaom.com/2012/02/13/tv-everywhere-password-sharing/ https://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/group/pub/chan_perrig_secure_sensor_article.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 28  For instance, the system that inserts adverts into streamed content on a smart TV could be exploited  to push hoax content to the viewer, or web-enabled displays in the home could display false  information. Secondly, an attacker could falsely trigger alarm systems in the home116; alarms for  invisible, odourless dangers such as carbon monoxide would be particularly effective for this. Thirdly,  attackers with access to the smart home components could fake a system crash or error, or virus, and  then offer to repair this as a method of gaining physical access to the home or further access to other  components.  Threat: Badware  As many smart home components are functional computers, they can be affected by the full range of  malicious software, although some may need to be customised to take full advantage of the smart  home context. This can include spyware, adware, ransomware, key and activity logging, traffic  monitoring software117 118. As many smart home components lack the capacity to run security software  and even lack a graphical display, the presence and activity of this malicious software can remain  undetected for long periods of time. It may be possible to utilise the broadcast network to place  badware on smart TVs through the HbbTv protocol119.  Threat: Remote activity (execution)  Part of the core selling point of many smart home applications is the ability to remotely activate  integrated home systems (heating, lighting, irrigation, etc.) from outside the home. This functionality,  if unsecured, or attacked, can allow physically distant attackers to potentially activate any of the  remote functions in the smart home120. Unwanted activation could be used for denial of service  attacks and harassment.  Threat: Targeted attacks (including Advanced Persistent Threat)  If attackers are seeking to attack a particular target, rather than any available unsecured victim, then  the smart home is highly useful for this. It will often physically surround the target with a sensor  infrastructure, collects sensitive information on them, manages permissions for other accounts and  services belonging to the target, and potentially allows for control of their environment. Access to the  smart home will provide targeted attackers with information on their target useful for reconnaissance  as well as potential ways to influence the target’s behaviour. The sensors in a smart home, if  compromised, could be particularly useful for the reconnaissance component of Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT), whilst the greater attack surface presented by multiple devices could facilitate an  attacker gaining presence121.  116 http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/24/home-alarm-hacking [accessed 20 October 2014]  117 http://www.wired.com/2011/08/hacking-home-automation/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  118 Wendzel et al, Op. cit. http://www.wendzel.de/dr.org/files/Papers/EnvisioningSmartBuildings.pdf  119 Oren Y., Keromytis A.

Software controlled systems must remain  compliant with these requirements.  Third-party data processing services for the smart home must be compliant with data protection law.  This is required for all parties collecting and processing personal data, but in the smart home and  converged media context it is particularly significant for cloud services and information storage  companies. Part of the requirements of data protection law with the EU is that appropriate security  measures must be taken122 123.  Threat: Failure to meet contractual requirements  Smart home, converged media, and related services offered by third-party companies, may fail to  meet contractual requirements promised to the subscriber. This is a particular problem given the small  and under-resourced nature of many smart home start-up companies124. Smart home inhabitants may  themselves fail to meet their contractual requirements in relation to these services, most likely  through failure of payment, but also by breaking conditions of use (for example, using HDMI splitters  to circumvent a TV provider’s single-room license arrangement, or by “jailbreaking” or “rooting”  devices).  Smart home technology, presented as a closed-source “black box”, may include additional functions  and capabilities and they might represent legal risks of which the user may be unaware.  Threat: Unauthorised use of copyrighted material  The converged media environment may allow inhabitants to make unauthorised use of copyrighted  material such as audio and visual media (films, TV, music, sport) and software125. Unauthorised use  might include downloading and storing streamed media, storing and displaying pirated content, or  accessing content with geographical access restrictions over a virtual private network or proxy126 127.

The following table (Table 1:  Association between Threats and Smart Home Assets) shows the association between the assumed  threats from Figure 2: Overview of Threats Assumed for Smart Home Assets and the smart home and  converged media assets from Figure 1: Overview of Smart Home and Converged Media Assets.  The table below establishes the relationship between threats and the assets to which these threats  apply. To this extent, the table shows the exposure of smart home assets to the assessed threats.  Threat groups are listed in the first column of the following table. Related threats in the second  column. Associated assets groups are in the third column. The last column, only when relevant,  provides information on some particular assets or some more details on some specific issue. E.g.,  under the threat group Unintentional damage (accidental) (first column), the threat Information  leakage or sharing is listed (second column). An association is made between such threat and the  following asset groups (third column): Human-machine interface devices, Information storage,  Integrated home services, Information, and Management/operation. The Asset/Detail field (fourth  column) is empty here because in this specific case no furher detailed information needed to be  mentioned.  This information contained in the table below is important in the process of identification of  countermeasures that will reduce the exposure surface of assets. This threat-to-assets association is  made on the basis of an initial assessment done within the project. More detailed assessments can  follow when additional asset details and/or new threats are being considered. To this extent, the  association performed in this report is non-exhaustive and subject to refinements, according to  particular smart home and threat environments.  The table below details threats identified in the preceding literature review. Threats that can be  logically assumed to apply to smart homes, but for which we did not identify evidence, are not  included in this table, but are included in a fuller table available by contacting  resilience@enisa.europe.eu . The fuller table has been created as a side-product of this work and may  be used as basis for detailed risk assessments in the area of smart homes.

It is important for smart home and converged media  asset owners to know which threats emerge from which threat agent group. This information is  significant to decide on the kind of risks that should be mitigated: threat agent groups are indicative  of the energy behind launched attacks and capability level. The smart home environment, as depicted  in our initial scenarios, differs in some significant ways from other cyber security contexts, and this  has implications for the nature of the threat agents. The typology of threat agents draws upon but  adapts the typology presented in previous ENISA threat landscape reports128.  Corporations  Corporations are private legal entities, generally motivated by the pursuit of profit and organised  accordingly, but this category can include not-for-profits and charitable organisations. The sources of  threat from corporate actors can range from the impacts of poor implementation or design of smart  home technologies, business models that are not aligned with the interests of smart home inhabitants,  through to illegal practices. Corporate actors can be potentially well resourced and competent if the  threat emerges from the deliberate actions of the organisation, but corporations can also include  elements of insider threat from employees who may have their own divergent agendas. Corporate  threat agents can be sub-divided into three categories. The categories are not mutually exclusive and  can overlap.  Data miners and advertisers  These threat agents operate with business models that are reliant upon the collection and processing  of data from smart home technology, which can also include personal data of individuals. They  therefore have an interest in the information that a smart home can produce about its inhabitants  and how this can inform the creation and promotion of advertised products and services. They may  themselves be service providers, or may be interested in data produced by service providers. The  primary threats from these actors include the use and abuse of intentionally shared or unintentionally  leaked information from the smart home. Inhabitants may be unaware of how such information may  be utilised by corporate actors, and these actors may therefore have strong impacts upon privacy and  data protection. These actors may also collect significant personal data, which may then become a  valuable asset itself in need of security protection.  Technology vendors and service providers  Service providers and technology developers for the smart home may themselves become threat  agents to other smart home assets. The key sources of threat here are in the unintentional category,  such as errors in design, installation, administration, maintenance of devices and systems as well as  obsolescence of technology over time, and the possibility of these agents being unable to fulfil their  commitments (loss of service, a smart home service provider going bankrupt or stopping support for  a widely installed product). Failures and malfunctions (including unintended information leakage) can  result from design decisions on the part of these actors. Technology vendors and services providers  are in an influential position in the smart home context and their actions can have significant impacts  upon smart home assets, including their security capabilities. In the context of smart media, threats  to smart home assets can emerge from digital rights management or revenue-protection actions.  128 ENISA, Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide, Op. cit..  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat- landscape-and-good-practice-guide [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 36  Journalists and media  These agents are primarily motivated by the information on people available from the smart home.  Their interests are likely to focus upon smart home inhabitants who are in some way notable  (celebrities, politicians).  Cyber criminals  Cyber criminals are the largest and most significant hostile threat category in relation to smart homes  with a special focus upon converged media.  Financial criminals  Cyber criminals are primarily motivated by financial interest, and threats to smart home assets arise  from criminal attempts to extract value from these assets. The full range of potential cyber-criminal  activity directed at other types of information systems are also applicable to the smart home, including  identity and credential theft, ransomware, malware, using smart home assets to conduct other illegal  activity (spam, bot nets, etc.).  Content pirates  In the particular context of converged media and television, media piracy and related types of crime  are highly relevant.  Other actors may overstep their legal boundaries and technically become cyber criminals, but their  motivations will vary. Cybercriminals can be organised on a local, national or even international level.  It should be taken as given, that a certain degree of networking between cybercriminals is being  maintained.  Traditional criminals  Traditional criminals are criminal actors that conduct crimes that are not primarily mediated through  information technology, but may increasingly contain a technological aspect, and this aspect makes  them a threat to smart home assets. For example, a physical burglar, who makes use of a method for  circumventing a smart lock, or jamming a video-over-IP system, fits into this category. In the smart  home context, traditional criminals are most likely relatively local, and their activity is categorically  defined by their physical interaction with the smart home. Their primary motivation is financial, but  this category can include other types of socially-motivated crime such as assault, voyeurism or  harassment. Threats to smart home assets from this category of threat agent primarily emerge from  circumvention of smart home security measures, exploitation of smart home systems to gain  information about the home, or theft of valuable smart home components themselves.  Inhabitants  Inhabitants of a smart home may be considered threat agents to assets, which may be located in the  smart home, but which the inhabitants themselves do not control or own. Examples of such assets  might include licensed audio-visual media, proprietary software in smart home devices, or smart  home devices on lease or license. Threats to assets from inhabitants can also be the result of mistakes  and errors in set-up and use. Furthermore, the interests of all inhabitants in a single smart home may  not necessarily coincide. Inhabitants may use the information gathering capability of the smart home  to invade the privacy of other inhabitants, or attempt to overcome content or access restrictions  placed on particular media content.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 37  Nation states  Threats to smart home assets from nation states can arise from the state where a smart home is  located, as would be the case in law enforcement, or from other countries, in the case of espionage  or cyber warfare. Depending upon national context, nation states threat to smart home may be  restricted by legal frameworks. Nation states can have offensive cyber capabilities and use them  against an adversary. Nation states are becoming a prominent threat agent due to the deployment of  sophisticated attacks that are considered as cyber weapons. From the sophistication of these malware  it can be confirmed that some nation states have a plethora of resources and they have a high level of  skills and expertise. It is too early to determine if smart homes (rather than for example critical  national infrastructure) would be perceived as either an effective or legal target for offensive cyber  operations.  Hacktivists  Hacktivists are politically and socially motivated individuals who use computer systems in order to  protest and promote their cause (but stopping short of terror-provoking violence). Moreover, they  usually target high profile websites, corporations, intelligence agencies and military institutions.  Threats to smart home assets from hacktivists may include intelligence and information gathering,  sabotage, destruction of information, or denial of service attacks.  Terrorists  There is little evidence for a terrorist-conducted cyber attack having occurred, and much terrorist use  of the Internet is in the realm of communications activity. It is debatable if cyber attacks would be an  effective means for politically or religiously motivated terrorists to achieve their goals. However, it is  feasible that terrorist groups or individuals might be motivated to attempt to attack smart home  assets. The extent to which this would result in fear-related behaviour change is relatively minimal as  the smart home context provides little opportunity for wide-spread damage, injury or destruction.  Non-violent actions against smart home assets in this context can be treated as activity by hacktivists.  Threat agents and threat categories  Based on these short threat agent profiles, the threats presented in this document can be assigned to  relevant groups. This assignment is based on the threat agent group profile and in particular on  assumed motives. The table below (Table 2: Involvement of Threat Agents in the Threats) presents  the potential involvement of threat agent groups in the threats considered for smart grid assets.

Risks are understood as emerging when threats abuse the vulnerabilities of  assets to generate harm.  It should be noted that the smart home environment is at a relatively early stage of development and  adoption. This has implications for mapping vulnerabilities and risks. It is possible to draw from  experiences of vulnerabilities and risk in related fields such as home automation and media content  provision, however, the nature of the current smart home environment is likely to re-cast some of  these risks and vulnerabilities. This section therefore includes consideration of the sources of  vulnerabilities in smart home security.  Vulnerabilities  There have been many demonstrations of vulnerabilities in individual smart home components. These  have been identified across most of the relevant asset categories in Figure 1: Overview of Smart Home  and Converged Media Assets, including IoT devices129  130 , home automation technologies 131  132 ,  television133 134 135 and media136 137, and in several widely used communications protocols138. The  majority of these vulnerabilities have been demonstrated by security researchers in lab-based  contexts, rather than culled from “real-world” examples. Researchers have then used their  judgement, and experiences in other contexts, to extrapolate from these vulnerabilities to the  potential harms and impacts that could result from their exploitation. As smart homes are comprised  of multiple types of technology (including radio communications, networking, software, hardware,  operating systems, protocols, Internet and cloud services, audio/visual etc.), known and unknown  vulnerabilities in all these areas are relevant to smart home security.  129 HP, Op. cit. http://fortifyprotect.com/HP_IoT_Research_Study.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  130 Goodin,D., http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi- fi-passwords/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  131 Chirgwin, R., “Nasty holes found in Belkin's home automation kit”, 19 Feb 2014.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/19/wemo_home_automation_is_insecure_ioactive/ [accessed 20  October 2014]  132 Botezatu, L., “Vulnerability in Vaillant Heating Systems Allows Unauthorized Access”,  April 16, 2013. http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows- unauthorized-access-5926.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  133 Kuipers, R., Starck, E., Heikkinen, E., “Smart TV Hacking: Crash Testing Your Home Entertainment”.  http://www.codenomicon.com/resources/whitepapers/codenomicon-wp-smart-tv-fuzzing.pdf [accessed 20  October 2014]  134 Mocana Corporation, Vulnerability Assessment of [redacted] Internet-Connected HDTVs, 14 December 2010.  storage.pardot.com/7062/128784/tv.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  135 Darren, P., “Samsung TVs, Blu-ray vulnerable to eternal boot loop”, 20 April 2012.  http://www.itnews.com.au/News/297710,samsung-tvs-blu-ray-vulnerable-to-eternal-boot-loop.aspx  [accessed 20 October 2014]  136 “DRM Security Issues DRM system cracks: DRM security software & hardware solutions”,  http://www.locklizard.com/drm_security_issues.htm [accessed 20 October 2014]  137 Doctorow, C., “What happens with digital rights management in the real world?”, 5 February 2014.  http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management [accessed 20 October  2014]  138 Fouladi B., Ghanoun, S., Op. cit. http://research.sensepost.com/conferences/2013/bh_zwave [accessed 20  October 2014]  http://fortifyprotect.com/HP_IoT_Research_Study.pdf http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/ http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwords/ http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/19/wemo_home_automation_is_insecure_ioactive/ http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/vulnerability-in-vaillant-heating-systems-allows-unauthorized-access-5926.html http://www.codenomicon.com/resources/whitepapers/codenomicon-wp-smart-tv-fuzzing.pdf http://www.itnews.com.au/News/297710,samsung-tvs-blu-ray-vulnerable-to-eternal-boot-loop.aspx http://www.locklizard.com/drm_security_issues.htm http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management http://research.sensepost.com/conferences/2013/bh_zwave  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 40  Vulnerabilities arising from business models and economic incentives  Several sources of vulnerability arise from the way that the smart home market is currently configured.  The traditional model for home automation was based around a single technology from a single  provider, with components integrated through a bus or hub. In this model the main security concerns  arise from the security or vulnerability of this hub. A newer model involves connecting together  multiple types of devices, often on an existing home network, and making use of cloud services to  provide mobile access to these smart systems. This model is gaining popularity because the reduction  in cost of low-power processors, memory and networking components has reduced the costs of entry  to the smart home market. The cost of adding network connectivity capacity to a device is now around  €20 but current customer demand does not yet allow for substantial prices increases for “smart”  connectivity. This has brought new entrants to the smart home market, both in terms of large  appliance manufacturers adding connectivity to existing home appliances (fridges, washing machines,  TVs) as well as smaller start-up companies producing new types of devices. However, these developers  may have little experience in security engineering, and/or little budget to devote to security139. They  are likely to adopt standard, generic hardware and firmware, which may have well-known but  unpatched vulnerabilities, or unknown vulnerabilities which, when discovered, will apply to a huge  range of different devices.  Secondly, the heavy use of cloud computing resources, for storage and the provision of services,  introduces new vulnerabilities140 141 142. Hacking the cloud server becomes a very effective way of  getting access to large numbers of smart homes, and could be done through relatively simply methods  of social engineering, phishing, etc. The use of cloud services may include transfers of data across  national and jurisdictional boundaries, with resulting implications for data protection and privacy  regulation143. Although cloud providers are putting effort into cloud security,144 domestic consumers,  or smart home services marketed at consumers, may not adopt more costly cloud security methods  and services, or be able to scrutinise the security methods of cloud providers145.  Vulnerabilities arising from ownership and administration models  Smart homes have an administrative model much closer to that of the home PC and home network  than that of enterprise IT. They are unlikely to have dedicated IT or IT security personal, but rather  this will be the responsibility of a likely untrained occupant with limited attention and capacity to  identify security risks to the smart home or to take action against them. An increased number of non- integrated smart devices connected to cloud services may also increase problems with authentication  139 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU [accessed 20 October 2014]  140 ENISA Op. cit., 2013, p.49 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats [accessed 27  October 2014]  141 Subashini, S., and Kavitha, V., “A survey on security issues in service delivery models of cloud computing”,  Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 34(1), January 2011.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804510001281 [accessed 27 October 2014]  142 Svantesson, D., and Roger Clarke (2010) “Privacy and consumer risks in cloud computing”, Computer Law  and Security Review, 26 (4), 391-397.  143 Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, Opinion 05/2012 on Cloud Computing, WP196, 1 July 2012.  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion- recommendation/files/2012/wp196_en.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  144 Pucher, A., and Dimopoulos, S., “A Survey on Cloud Provider Security Measures”,  http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  145 http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-customers/d/d-id/1139143  Accessed 20 October 2014 [accessed 27 October 2014]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804510001281 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp196_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp196_en.pdf http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-customers/d/d-id/1139143  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 41  and password management in this context. For many users, the security models and activity of smart  home technology, including devices they may bring into their homes, will be opaque146. Many smart  devices lack graphical users interfaces, or have limited display capability, making it hard to determine  if they are functioning incorrectly or have been compromised. Additionally, smart home technology,  particularly sensors, can itself be low profile and not particularly visible. Therefore, occupants will be  interacting with smart home devices even when they are not consciously using them147.  The marketing models of smart homes create a picture of smart homes being organised by and for  their inhabitants, in order to increase the quality of life of the latter and respond to their needs and  problems (such as security, convenience, comfort, entertainment and home administration). This is  not the only model for the home automation and monitoring functions of smart homes. Other models  may be primarily of benefit to landlords and building owners wishing to mandate or prescribe certain  types of behaviour from their tenants. Smart buildings are also likely to be used in business contexts  where functions might be used for cost-reduction, environmental sustainability or physical security,  but have implications for the privacy of employees.  Many smart home devices and components are vulnerable to an attacker with physical access to the  device. Often this will allow the attacker to access stored passwords or cryptographic keys, changes  settings, access data, and upload new software. The working assumption appears to be that only asset  owners will have this level of physical access, or that the interests of all smart home occupants are the  same, and therefore devices do not need to be secured against physical attacks. Physical access to one  device of a type (which can be quite affordable) may also be highly advantageous for an attacker  targeting that whole range of devices.  In addition, ownership (and therefore responsibility for security) in the smart home context is not  always clear. Common beliefs about ownership may not match the legal model. Depending upon  particular ownership models, some of the assets in the home may be owned by third-parties (cable  and set-top boxes are physical examples of this, and digital media can be rented or supplied with  access controls and use limitations). This complicates vulnerability mapping. In some context the  inhabitants may be a security risk to the externally owned asset (for example copying and distributing  pirated media content), and in others, the external party may be a security risk to the smart home  inhabitants. This situation may change the economic incentives to take security action to the extent  that additional security vulnerabilities are created.  Pervasive and persistent insecurity  Smart homes increase the number of vulnerable devices within an environment. This is particularly  true in comparison with a non-smart home, but also in comparison with a more traditional home  network supporting a small number of dedicated computers. This proliferation of devices increases  the attack surface for the home. Further, a single compromised device in a smart home may be able  to eavesdrop on network traffic and be used as a starting point to compromise other devices. The  smart home is therefore as vulnerable as its most vulnerable component and every additional device  might introduce a security vulnerability.  146 O’Hara, Op. cit.,  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf  147 Nixon, P.A., Wagealla, W., English, C., Terzis, S., Security, Privacy and Trust Issues in Smart Environments,  p.2. http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf [accessed 20 October  2014]  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 42  Given this proliferation of devices, smart home device designers may be tempted to over-rely upon  security through obscurity148, assuming that the range of available targets will obscure their own  devices from attackers. The existence of methods for finding and identifying Internet of Things  devices, such as the Shodan search engine, suggest this is unwise. Shodan is a search engine for  Internet connected devices, including searches based upon known software exploits149 150.  As embedded hardware, smart home components can potentially have long service life-spans.151 They  may also be difficult to update or patch if vulnerabilities are discovered152. This can leave assets  vulnerable for long periods of time. This can be exacerbated by developers no longer supporting an  embedded device, going out of business, and having no requirement or economic incentive to  continue to update and produce patches153.  Risks  Understanding risks in the smart home requires an understanding of context and the position of the  inhabitants and asset owners. It also requires understanding of the potential harms that can arise from  the exploitation of smart home assets.  Crime risks  As set out in Section 5, smart home assets are exposed to threats which can either facilitate criminal  actions, or are themselves be a form of crime (e.g. physical damage or theft, unauthorised access to  smart home assets). Whilst smart homes may be at risk of crime, it was not possible to  comprehensively assess this risk based upon documentation collected. Interviewed experts believe  that the current risk of criminal activity directed at the smart home is currently relatively low, given  the relatively small number of smart homes. However the increasing number of homes with some  kind of Internet connected smart functionality, as well as the corresponding value of identity  information, financial tokens and credentials stored in the smart home, may increase financial  motivations for crime.  Privacy, surveillance and data protection risks  Smart homes are intended to exploit combinations of small distributed sensing and computational  nodes, to identify and deliver personalised services to the users, when they are interacting and  exchanging information with the environment154. Internet of Things data is high in quantity, quality  148 Ferrante D., Auriemma, L., Op. cit. http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf  [accessed 20 October 2014]  149 http://www.shodanhq.com/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  150 Hill, K., “The Terrifying Search Engine That Finds Internet-Connected Cameras, Traffic Lights, Medical  Devices, Baby Monitors and Power Plants”, 9 April 2013.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/04/shodan-terrifying-search-engine/ [accessed 20 October  2014]  151 Grossman, W., “Software is forever”, 30 May 2014.  http://www.pelicancrossing.net/netwars/2014/05/software_is_forever.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  152 Roberts, P., “Beware the next circle of hell: Unpatchable systems”, 2June 2014  http://www.infoworld.com/article/2606438/endpoint-protection/beware-the-next-circle-of-hell-- unpatchable-systems.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  153 Fleishman, G., “Security cruft means every exploit lives forever”, 25 September 2014.  http://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/security-cruft-means-every-exp.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  154 Nixon et al, Op. cit.,, http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf  [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf http://www.shodanhq.com/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/04/shodan-terrifying-search-engine/ http://www.pelicancrossing.net/netwars/2014/05/software_is_forever.html http://www.infoworld.com/article/2606438/endpoint-protection/beware-the-next-circle-of-hell--unpatchable-systems.html http://www.infoworld.com/article/2606438/endpoint-protection/beware-the-next-circle-of-hell--unpatchable-systems.html http://boingboing.net/2014/09/25/security-cruft-means-every-exp.html http://www.smartlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/Publications/techreports/SPTPaperFinal.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 43  and sensitivity155. Given the depth and variety of personal information that can be captured and  processed within the smart home, and the potential for privacy violations, potential harms are far  from purely technical matters and social context therefore becomes particularly important in  assessing risk. Many of the risks presented by the smart home will be of this socio-technical type.  Smart homes will produce data on previously unrecorded activities and have a close link between  people and their environments156. The data produced by activity within a smart home is likely to be  perceived as valuable to a number of actors and additional applications may be found, not initially  envisaged by designers, service providers or asset owners157. This expansion of the uses of smart home  data can be understood as a form of “function creep”. It complicates understanding potential risks  because new uses of previously captured data also produce new risks that were not considered at the  time of either device installation, or the point of data capture. Precisely because of the personal,  behavioural and granular nature of the data, smart home data is likely to be seen as having predictive  value for applications including market segmentation, risk classification, assessments of insurability,  and policing and crime control158. This type of data processing, can lead to what is known as “social  sorting”, where people are assigned to different categories, assigned worth or risk, in ways which have  significant impacts upon their life chances 159 . These practices can have collective social justice  implications as well as individual privacy risks.  Particular issues raised for converged media  From the threat analysis conducted in this study, converged media can be understood as a particular  instance of the principles behind smart homes. To the extent that the converged media devices can  be understood as a computer, the security and risk profile of converged media resembles that of  computing more broadly. The security differences therefore arise from implementation,  administration and use models as much as from the underlying technological principles. This section  presents specific reflections upon threats, vulnerabilities and other security issues in relation to  converged media. In addition to issues around privacy, access and copyright, converged media and  television raise related security issues to smart homes in terms of connectivity, embedded  functionality, opaque systems and incompatibility with traditional information security approaches.  Converged media devices are likely to be some of the first consumer smart home devices introduced  to many homes, and will therefore be the terrain for the initial playing out of many of the identified  smart home security issues. Internet-connected smart televisions in particular have a number of  attributes which contribute towards their envisaged role in the smart home.   Commonly present. Televisions are a common feature in many homes and other buildings.  They are also often centrally located in commonly used areas of the building.  155 Kohnstamm, J., and Madhub, D., Mauritius Declaration on the Internet of Things, 36th International  Conference of Data protection and Privacy Commissioners, 14 October 2014.  http://www.privacyconference2014.org/media/16421/Mauritius-Declaration.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  156 O’Hara, Op. cit.,  http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/365545/1/PRIVACY%20AND%20THE%20INTERNET%20OF%20THINGS.pdf [accessed  27 October 2014]  157 Higginbotham , S., “The Internet of things isn’t about things.

In contrast to many other smart devices and home appliances, televisions  have larger and higher quality screens which may be better suited to the management and  control of other devices, as well as the display of information.   Capacity and processing power. In comparison with smaller, dedicated devices, a larger  gateway can support increased processing power, memory and storage capacity. The  additional capacity offers some potential to support additional security software.   Multi-functionality. Smart TV offers the potential for a device which replicates the  functionality of existing TV, media play, home cinema, music and gaming systems, is  connected to the Internet and a range of online services, and may well be integrated with  home automation systems as part of a smart home.   Integration with other devices. Smart TVs are capable of being linked to a range of devices  (set top boxes, media players, games consoles, external memory) that could potentially be  expanded. Internet connectivity and home networking also allow a range of media devices  within the home to share content with each other, streaming media to different devices160.   Manufacturer interest. Smart TV manufacturers have exhibited interest in a broad range of  functionalities, including the use of the smart TV as a home gateway161 162. This interest is  linked to the potential for the smart TV (including set-top boxes) to provide the broadcaster  with greater control over quality and content, and for positive branding163. The ability to  distinguish new TVs from previous models is also of interest to manufacturers.  The corollary of these attributes is that if smart TV becomes a common coordinating hub for the smart  home, as well as supporting multiple media services and account credentials, then it will become a  likely target for cyber crime. If this is the case then it should therefore equally be a focus for security  efforts164. Data on media consumption is particularly attractive for business in this field, both for  advertising and revenue purposes.  Specific vulnerabilities have been identified in converged media devices 165  166 . These have been  highlighted in Section 6: Vulnerabilities, but include incorrect security implementation, (for example  hard coded passwords167), backdoors, mechanisms for the insertion of content168, remote reporting  160 Arabo, Abdullahi and Fadi El-Mousa, “Security Framework for Smart Devices”, International Conference on  Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare and Digital Forensic (CyberSec), 28 June 2012.

Many smart TVs, for example,  use custom user interfaces and operating systems which may allow little security control to the user,  or may have undiscovered vulnerabilities. For example, an on screen web-browser might obscure the  URL of a visited webpage, allowing for easier spoofing. If smart media devices have the capacity to  install third-party applications then this raises the danger of spyware hidden in malicious apps, as has  been experienced on smart phones.  The field of converged media is a point of contention between different actors in the smart home with  potentially different security interests and incentives. Converged media is typified by a wide and  shifting set of publishers, content producers, content providers, distribution channels, and hardware  manufacturers172. Security conflicts can emerge between the industry and users, with digital rights  management and revenue protection activities being a particular source of contention if these are not  handled sensitively, and with an eye to general security. The result of this environment is that the  converged media device is unlikely to be under the full control of the user173. This raises the question  of who carries responsibility for security in this environment, and the extent to which converged media  actors can and should act in this role.  169 Ferrante D., Auriemma, L., Op. cit. http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf  [accessed 23 October 2014]  170 Roberts, P., https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with- vulnerabilities/ [accessed 23 October 2014]  171 http://blog.kaspersky.com/dont-shop-or-bank-with-a-smart-tv/ [accessed 23 October 2014]  172 OECD, “Connected Televisions: Convergence and Emerging Business Models”, OECD Digital Economy  Papers, No. 231, OECD Publishing, 2014. http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/connected- televisions_5jzb36wjqkvg-en [accessed 27 October 2014]  173 https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you- dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml [accessed 23 October 2014]  http://revuln.com/files/Ferrante_Auriemma_SmartTV_Insecurity.pdf https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with-vulnerabilities/ https://securityledger.com/2013/08/samsung-smart-tv-like-a-web-app-riddled-with-vulnerabilities/ http://blog.kaspersky.com/dont-shop-or-bank-with-a-smart-tv/ http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/connected-televisions_5jzb36wjqkvg-en http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/connected-televisions_5jzb36wjqkvg-en https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140511/17430627199/lg-will-take-smart-out-your-smart-tv-if-you-dont-agree-to-share-your-viewing-search-data-with-third-parties.shtml  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 46  10 Good practices in smart home and converged media security measures  The following section presents good practices in smart home and converged media security measures  that have been identified in the literature search and in discussion with the expert group. This report  has not independently evaluated these measures and so cannot necessarily recommend these  measures. Rather, the report presents an overview of efforts and recommendations in the field. The  good practices are structured according to the type of security measure.  Smart home and converged media design and architecture choices  Several good practices for security measures involve making good choices and decisions at the level  of the design of the smart home as a system, including how the various components are to be  integrated together. These good practices suggest ways in which the smart home might be designed  in order to increase security and reduce impacts upon privacy. They are therefore directed at smart  home designers and owners.  Design considerations include: careful consideration of the security of cloud-based smart home  designs, and maximising the extent to which automation and data storage can remain local and under  control of the smart home owner; reducing the number of external services used in the smart home  design may decrease the attack surface; using a single type of smart home technology may minimise  the points of vulnerability that arise from mixing together multiple technologies and protocols; the  choice of Open Source protocols over closed-source or proprietary protocols so that the  implementation can be inspected and the communications behaviour understood; better interface  design so that smart home users can better understand the operation of their devices and exert better  control over their activity; and limiting the proliferation of passwords that results from multiple  services and accounts.  Another architectural choice can include an application isolation framework (as is developed in smart  cars174), to keep critical software separate from non-critical apps. In the context of the car, this keeps  the music player or climate control from running on the same system as the brakes or steering; in the  smart home it might separate media and music systems from security or integrated appliances.  Architectural choices can also include the adoption of privacy-by-design approaches to developing the  smart home and converged media. These approaches have been detailed for smart grids 175  and  approaches may also be applicable in the smart home context. The NCC Group report, Implementers  guide to cyber security of Internet of things devices, provides design and implementation advice,  including considerations for smart homes176.  174 Dietzel, S., Kost, M., Schaub, F. and Kargl, F., “CANE: A Controlled Application Environment for Privacy  Protection in ITS“, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems  Telecommunications, 2012. http://www.dbis.informatik.hu- berlin.de/fileadmin/research/papers/conferences/2012_11_Dietzel_Kost_Schaub_Kargl_ITST.pdf [accessed 27  October 2014]  175 Cavoukian, A., Smart Meters in Europe: Privacy by Design at its Best, April 2012.  http://www.privacybydesign.ca/content/uploads/2012/04/pbd-smartmeters-europe.pdf [accessed 27 October  2014]  176 Whitehouse, O.

Architecture and design good practices may contribute towards mitigating threats from physical  attack, unintentional damage, Failures and malfunctions, eavesdropping/interception/hijacking,  nefarious activity, outages and disaster. They may contribute in particular to threats from information  leakage, loss of support services, inadequate design and planning, or lack of adaption.  Device security measures  A second set of good practices in security measures involve measures at the level of the individual  smart device. These measures are directed towards the device manufacturers, but can also guide the  selection of devices by smart home designers and owners. Given the Internet-connected nature of  many smart home devices, these practices overlap somewhat with network and communications  security measures below, and also involve measures on the part of the device vendor and associated  service providers. An example of this is HP’s account of its activity in protecting Internet-connected  printers from spam. In this context this includes restricted access to the printer, deletion of printer  content, and activity monitoring conducted by the service provider as well as management tasks  delegated to the user, such as not publicly posting the email address of the printer and keeping the  printer physically secure177. Security measures at the device level can also include improved user  interfaces, as well as activity and state alerting (for example, an alert when a device has failed). Many  of these good practices include the application of basic information security measures to smart home  components178, including:   Design with security in mind   No fixed, default passwords   No storage of default passwords in the device firmware   Use encrypted communication with proper implementation   Secure IP gateways   End-to-end authentication, no http access without authentication   Strong key implementation   Apply updates to apps and firmware as available179   Message authentication180  Device security measures may mitigate against threats from unintentional damage,  failures/malfunctions, eavesdropping/interception/hijacking, nefarious activity/abuse, and  damage/loss of IT assets.  177 HP, “Protecting Your Web-Connected Printer from Unwanted Email”,  http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&lc=en&docname=c03600177#N55 [accessed 20  October 2014]  178 Ward, M., “How to hack and crack the connected home”, 17 August 2014.  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27373328 [accessed 20 October 2014]  179 “Belkin fixes WeMo security holes, updates firmware and app”, 19 February 2014.  http://www.networkworld.com/article/2226374/microsoft-subnet/belkin-fixes-wemo-security-holes-- updates-firmware-and-app.html [accessed 20 October 2014]  180 Brown, J., Bagci, I.

These good practices relate to how the various smart home assets  are interconnected, and how they communicate and are therefore addressed to both smart home  technology manufacturers and vendors, as well as to smart home installers, designers and owners.  Several sources emphasise the importance of ensuring that security measures provide for the  maintenance of the following essential properties181 182:   Confidentiality   Integrity   Authentication   Authorisation   Non-repudiation   Availability  Similarly, Duo Security identified the following security areas as starting points for Internet of Things  security183:   Proper encoding of web service credentials   Secured local video streaming   Easy-to-manage firmware upgrades   Mobile device access and authentication   Strong password policies for device authentication   Strong WiFi security   Secured 3rd party service connections   Encrypted storage of customer data   Customer data segmentation with back end systems  Some sources recommend that given the proliferation of connected devices in the smart home, the  focus of security should be upon the control of key access points such as the residential gateway,  home hub, or smart TV if performing this function. The argument is that security may be better  performed at the network level rather than at the end point due to the variety of devices of different  types and the limited support for end point security functions on those devices184.  Various network security measures have been identified as appropriate for increasing security in the  smart home, such as white lists for external access to smart home devices, and secure profile  management185. Remote logging of activity on smart home components and event management  software to detect and prevent anomalous or undesired activity may be desirable.  181 Mantas, G., Lymberopoulos, D., and Komninos, N., Op. cit. http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless- technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 [accessed 20 October 2014]  182 Whitehouse, O., Op. cit. https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_- _an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf [accessed 20  October 2014]  183 Martins, F., “How PKI Can Fix Security in the Internet of Things”, August 13, 2014.  https://blog.digicert.com/how-security-can-fix-Internet-of-things/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  184 Spencer, L., “IoT security under scrutinity as Apple looks at smart home systems”, 27 May 2014.  http://www.zdnet.com/iot-security-under-scrutiny-as-apple-looks-at-smart-home-system-7000029859/  [accessed 20 October 2014]  185 Ziegler, M., Mueller, W., Schaefer, R. and Loeser, C., “ Secure Profile Management in Smart Home  Networks“, Sixteenth International Workshop on Database and Exert Systems Applications, 2005.  http://adt.cs.upb.de/wolfgang/sun2005a.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126 https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_Internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://blog.digicert.com/how-security-can-fix-internet-of-things/ http://www.zdnet.com/iot-security-under-scrutiny-as-apple-looks-at-smart-home-system-7000029859/ http://adt.cs.upb.de/wolfgang/sun2005a.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 49  Various specific security models for smart homes have been proposed, particularly in the academic  literature. Examples include product-based security models186 , and context-aware approaches to  authentication and access control187. The uTRUSTit project aimed to test user trust perception in the  Internet of Things and provide guidance on producing trusted IoT. The project created a set of  collected threat and control objectives which are applicable to smart homes188.  Finally, there are measures which propose to take advantage of the smart home assets and  infrastructure to increase privacy. In one case, this involves using the smart home as privacy proxy for  the individual, acting as an intermediary and enforcing the use of desired privacy policies189.  Network and communication security measures may primarily mitigate threats from  eavesdropping/interception/hijacking and nefarious activity/abuse, as well as from legal;  failures/malfunctions; and unintentional damage.  Policy measures, including standardisation  In addition to the technological and design best practices, several policy measures have been  identified that seek to improve smart home and converged media security. Many of these are  certification or standardisation approaches that seek to make good practices more widespread  through the smart home industry, but others are political or economic activities. The latter case  includes the argument for placing economic pressure upon Internet service providers to increase  security190.  The Consumer Electronics Association and Computer Technology Industry Association introduced a  new “Digital Home Technology Integrators” certification for individuals and companies installing home  networks and connecting consumer electronics devices to a central PC, which has particular relevance  to audio-visual installation191.  CENELEC (The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) established a SmartHouse  Roadmap project, to provide strategic direction and co-ordination for the standardisation activities of  the European standards organisations (ETSI, CEN and CENELEC), in relation to smart homes192. The  intent of this roadmap is to identify relevant standards in the area and encourage interoperability.

CENELEC has developed, in cooperation with the  European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTR), a Code of Practice  for Smart Houses. Section 3.4 of the Code of Practice engages with system security, and the Code of  Practice recommends that security services and model should be selected according to threats, needs,  knowledge and costs, and that users should read and adopt user security guidelines. Following the  project the coordination of the standardisation activities around SmartHouse were taken over by  CLC/TC 205 “Home and Building Electronic Systems (HBES)” Working Group 2, which was tasked with  coordinating the introduction of the output of the SmartHouse Roadmap project into the regular  standardisation work of CENELEC.  Similarly, the ICTSB (the Information & Communications Standards Board) has conducted a review of  existing standards, which may be applicable to smart homes. For the ICTSB, standards for smart homes  should be seen in conjunction with standards for digital broadcasting, mobile communications,  Internet, PCs, Protected distribution systems, and voice services195.  IEC Technical Specification IEC TS 62045-1 Multimedia Security – Guidelines for privacy protection of  equipment and systems in and out of use196, is intended to respond to the increase in consumer  multimedia products that store users’ private information, which should be protected from  unauthorised or illegal use. The technical specification describes the system model and general  methods for the user’s privacy protection of data storage, equipment and systems, both in and out of  use.  Finally, good practices have been identified that relate to the structure of the smart home industry  and how this can be better coordinated in order to improve security. BuildItSecure.ly is a US-based  initiative, which aims to improve the interaction between small Internet of things developers and  vendors on one hand, and the security research community on the other. The initiative aims to create  mechanisms that allow for security researchers to communicate security vulnerabilities that they have  identified, to the vendors, and to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two communities197.  Policy measures, including standardisation, may mitigate threats from unintentional damage,  failures/malfunctions, eavesdropping/interception/hijacking, legal, nefarious activity/abuse, outages,  damage/loss, and disaster.  193 Ibid.  194 CENELEC Work Shop - Smart House, Final Report, July 2003.  http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Smart_House/Documents/Annex_Authent.pdf [accessed 20 October 2014]  195 ICTSB, Design for All – Final Background Report, 15 May 2000,  http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Design_for_All/Documents/15%20Smart%20Housing.pdf  196 IEC, Technical Specification IEC TS 62045-1 “Multimedia Security – Guidelines for privacy protection of  equipment and systems in and out of use”. http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045- 1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf [accessed 27 October 2014]  197 For more information, see: http://builditsecure.ly/ [accessed 20 October 2014]  http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Smart_House/Documents/Annex_Authent.pdf http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Design_for_All/Documents/15%20Smart%20Housing.pdf http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf http://builditsecure.ly/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 51  Design and  architecture  Device  security  measures  Network and  communications  Policy  measures/  Standardisation  Physical attacks √  Unintional damage √ √ √ √  Disaster  (natural/environmental)  √  √  Damage/loss of IT assets  √  √  Failures/malfunctions √ √ √ √  Outages √  √  Eavesdropping/interception/ hijacking  √ √ √ √  Nefarious activity/abuse √ √ √ √  Legal  √ √  Table 3: Good Practice Measures against Threat Categories  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 52  11 Gap analysis  The study has identified the follow areas of smart home threats, security, and good practice where  further research and investigation is required.   The role of the smart home in emergency response. To what extent can the capabilities of  smart homes be harnessed to support emergency responses, either in the context of an  individual location, or across locations in the case of a larger incident? To what extent can  information from the smart home be securely shared with incident responders whilst  respecting occupant privacy? Might smart home systems cause additional difficulties for  emergency response, and would this require additional training or design consideration?   The impacts of natural disasters upon the smart home. As complicated electronics, smart  home components are likely to be vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters, however  more research may be necessary to determine the particular impacts and to increase the  resilience of smart homes. This research should also consider the way in which smart homes  may contribute towards mitigating the impacts of natural disasters.   The criminology of the smart home. In a similar manner to how computing opens up the  potential for new types of crime as well as new approaches to traditional crimes, the smart  home will have impacts upon criminal behaviour in relation to the home. Understanding the  changes in criminal behaviour (and associated policing practices) will reduce the negative  impacts of smart home crime and allow designers to take mitigating steps.   The role of the smart home in critical infrastructure. Smart homes will be associated with  smart grids, but will also be connected to other elements of critical infrastructure. Can the  smart home play a role in contributing to the protection of critical infrastructure, or will the  differential demands of the smart home place new pressures upon critical infrastructure that  was designed around the needs and requirements of the non-smart home?   Liability and insurance issues related to the smart home. Liability is a particular issue for  smart homes involving automation and learning behaviour, where systems are likely to make  decisions or act as proxies for their owners. Given that smart homes might include electricity,  heating, lighting, and water services which can be damaging and costly, the implications might  be significant. Insurance policies might encourage the adoption of particular smart home  technologies (for example connected fire, smoke or flooding alarms) in order to reduce policy  costs. The implications, processes and extent to which alternative approaches are available  should be considered. Related to liability, are questions of contract law, lock-in, and the ability  to change service providers for smart home functions.   Law, policy and the smart home. The extent to which existing laws and policies are impacted  by developments in the smart home, and the bearing these laws and policies have upon smart  home security, should be considered. Of particular interest is the extent to which existing  cyber security policies, including national cyber security strategies, encompass smart homes.  As international law on cyber conflict develops, consideration should be given to increasingly  smart homes.   Baseline requirements for manufacturers should be explored, to ensure that smart home  components meet existing and newly developed standards for home appliances and  infrastructures. To what extent would product, device, protocol, or service certification  improve the standards of smart home security? What should be the contents of such  certification and where can it best be targeted? The content of standards should be regularly  revised as technology develops. The possibility of technology forcing through standards and  regulation should be investigated.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 53   User education for the smart home. As complex interconnected systems, smart homes may  require users to be educated in home to operate their smart home safely, securely, and  maintain their desired level of privacy and data protection. User education approaches may  need to differ from those addressed to home PCs or enterprise IT and these requirements  should be explored and addressed. What are the limits of user education in relation to smart  home privacy, and what behaviour can be reasonable expected?   Training at various levels. To what extent are existing information security training  approaches applicable to and relevant to the smart home, and in particular to the design of  smart home components and appliances? Do new training approaches need to be developed,  and if so, for whom? What training is available for smart home vendors and installers and is  this training creating an adequate level of smart home security?   Further development of good practices. The previously identified good practices address  some areas of smart home security, and if applied more widely would have significant impact.  However these practices should be further developed and explored. Mechanisms for sharing  and expanding good practices in smart home security should also be explored. In a related  manner, what work is necessary to make existing security measures and approaches smart  home ready?   Smart home security diagnostic and forensic methods. To what extent are existing methods  for understanding security events and discovering the source of these events suitable for use  in the smart home context? Do new approaches (including processes and procedures) need  to be developed? Can methods and systems be developed which allow smart home  inhabitants to better understand the security behaviour of their smart home?   The interface between the smart home and the smart city. Smart cities are developing in  parallel with smart homes and utilise some shared technologies. To what extent are the smart  home and the smart city connected, integrated or communicating, and what issues of security  and privacy does this relationship raise?   Security management methodologies, including better approaches to patching, updates,  provision of information to asset owners, incident logging and report, should be developed  that specifically cater to the smart home context.   Longer term studies of the impacts of smart home security and particularly the impacts upon  privacy. It is currently too early in the wide-scale deployment of smart homes to fully  understand the implications, however research should attempt to identify the practical  implications upon privacy and the effects of security failures, in order to supplement and  expand the information available on potential vulnerabilities and to allow trend mapping.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 54  12 Conclusions  Based on the experience gained within this activity and in addition to the asset, threat and  vulnerability assessment pursued through the report, the study has identified additional cross-cutting  conclusions on threats to the smart home and converged media.  The study identified threats to all of the asset classes and high threat exposure across all devices,  including to humans inhabitants. A smart home will likely contain a large, complex and diverse attack  surface. The potential for abuse of smart homes should be considered high. The smart home offers  personalised and context-informed attack vectors. The increasing number of smart homes, and smart  devices within homes, particularly converged media, will increase the return of targeting smart home  vulnerabilities. The security management of these assets is not yet mature and requires further  attention.  Not all smart homes are created equally. There are multiple design pathways that lead to functional  smart homes (ranging between localised and integrated home-automation systems, to sets of devices  based upon a shared interoperability protocol, and cloud-based gadget-and-app approaches with ad- hoc integration). These pathways have their own security and privacy peculiarities, but also have  shared issues and vulnerabilities. Design choices in the make-up of the smart home are likely to have  significant impacts both on individual security and upon the collective security ecosystem. For  example, a cloud provider might become a single point of access for multiple smart homes as a result  of individual design choices, with the result that that provider’s security decisions will have  widespread impact.  We might be unaware of how “smart” the home already is. In many ways, the underlying technologies  and elements of the smart home are already available and increasingly in place. This is particularly  the case in relation to converged media devices. Further services and products are likely to be  developed based upon these technologies. The smart home is not just about objects, but about a  variety of connected IT devices and services with some relation to the home. This includes tethered  devices which move in and out of the physical space, such as smart phones and laptop computers, as  well as cloud, media and social network services and accounts in regular use in the home. The smart  home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and physical space,  and therefore brings together security risks from both the virtual and the physical contexts. As the  cost of smart functionality decreases, home appliances will increasingly have some form of computing  functionality and connectivity. Individual users may easily be unaware of the potential of the devices  and systems in their home. Moreover, their mental models of what is a “computer” (and as such is in  need of information security) may be outdated and in need of change.  Several economic factors generate security vulnerabilities in smart home devices. First, companies  involved in the smart home market include home appliance companies, small start-up companies, and  even crowd-funded efforts. These groups are likely to lack security expertise, security budgets and  access to security research networks and communities. For some devices, smart functionality is not a  core function but may be an additional function or serve to differentiate between models at different  price points. Security and privacy can be an afterthought, following on from getting the smart  functions to work and be interoperable. The market does not currently appear to support greatly  increased cost for adding smart functionality, which further limits the resources that can be devoted  to developing and testing for security. Second, data-mining and analytics are a business model for  some smart offerings, which will create additional economic incentives for smart home system  vendors to collect data from sensor systems. Design choices are competing against cost, convenience,  as well as security and privacy.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media  1 December 2014  Page 55  Applying basic information security could have significant impacts in the smart home domain. Some  devices are so lacking in security measures and secure engineering that implementing relatively well  known security measures (such as encrypted communication, non-default passwords, user  authentication) would increase smart home security. This study has identified specific and focused  approaches specifically for smart home security that are being developed in academia and in industry  research, but these approaches may require further evaluation and testing beyond the scope of this  study.  The interests of different asset owners in the smart home are not necessarily aligned and may even  be in conflict. This creates a complex environment for security activity. For example, media content  owners may view occupants’ attempts to access licensed media content through alternate channels  as a threat to their assets, whilst occupants may interpret digital rights management measures as  barriers preventing them from accessing their assets. Different service providers and technology  vendors may be in competition with each other for both bandwidth and data.  There is a developing research base for smart home vulnerabilities, but this is limited and requires  further development and expansion. Much of the available information regards technical  vulnerabilities and exploits discovered in research labs. The potential real world impacts (including  upon privacy) are less well evidenced, and impacts have to be inferred from these vulnerabilities and  contextual knowledge. Some knowledge can be transposed from parallel and linked industries, such  as cable and satellite TV, hotel systems and wireless security. The research base has some constitutive  limits, for example, there is not much information available on the vulnerability of smart homes to  natural disaster and physical harm. There is more information available on information leakage than  on sociological and legal impacts of information leakage. Several areas requiring further research have  been identified.  Smart homes will impact privacy and data protection significantly. The increased number of  interlinked sensors and activity logs present and active in the smart home will be a source of close,  granular and intimate data on the activities and behaviour of inhabitants and visitors. The home is a  key site of consumption, and given the intimate, non-public context, behaviour in the home may be  seen as more meaningful or authentic that public activity. This means that the data produced by such  environments will have commercial and law enforcement value and there will be resulting privacy and  data protection debates arising from this. The risks that arise from smart home privacy are  probabilistic rather than deterministic, and can therefore be hard to communicate. Function creep is  highly likely in the smart home context. Much of the smart home literature, and particularly the  promotional and marketing literature for smart devices, starts from the assumption that the occupant  of the smart home is the owner. In many cases, such as rented accommodation and commercial  building automation, this will not be the case. In these contexts, smart homes provide for surveillance,  and for automatic enforcement of policies set by the owner. Smart homes also provide the capacity  for potentially intense surveillance of other family members.

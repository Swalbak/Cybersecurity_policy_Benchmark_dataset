    "document(english)": "1  Introduction  Applying patches to applications and operating systems is critical to ensuring the security of systems. As such, patching  forms part of the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents .  In this publication, a security vulnerability refers to a flaw in an application or operating system rather than a  misconfiguration or deployment flaw.  Applying patches  Once a patch is released by a vendor, the patch should be applied in a timeframe commensurate with an organisation’s  exposure to the security vulnerability and the level of cyber threat the organisation is aiming to protect themselves  against. For example, once a security vulnerability in an internet-facing service is made public, it can be expected that  malicious code will be developed by adversaries within 48 hours. In fact, there are cases in which adversaries have  developed malicious code within hours of newly discovered security vulnerabilities.  The following are recommended timeframes for applying patches for applications:   to mitigate basic cyber threats:   internet-facing services: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists   commonly-targeted applications: within one month   to mitigate moderate cyber threats:   internet-facing services: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists   commonly-targeted applications: within two weeks   other applications: within one month   to mitigate advanced cyber threats:   internet-facing services: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists   commonly-targeted applications: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists   other applications: within one month.  The following are recommended timeframes for applying patches for operating systems:   to mitigate basic cyber threats:   internet-facing services: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists  Assessing Security  Vulnerabilities and  Applying Patches  First published: October 2011  Last updated: October 2021  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  2   workstations, servers, network devices and other network-connected devices: within one month   to mitigate moderate cyber threats:   internet-facing services: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists   workstations, servers, network devices and other network-connected devices: within two weeks   to mitigate advanced cyber threats:   internet-facing services: within two weeks, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists   workstations, servers, network devices and other network-connected devices: within two weeks, or within  48 hours if an exploit exists.  Patching considerations  Identifying missing patches  One problem faced by many organisations is a lack of visibility of the true patch status of their environment. This can  leave organisations unknowingly exposed to exploitation by adversaries or otherwise thinking that patches had been  applied, or reported that they had been applied, when they had failed to be applied successfully. Using vulnerability  scanners can assist organisations to gather information on missing patches in their environment. In cases where  vulnerability scanners can’t be used, organisations should refer to vendor documentation on how to identify patching  levels and conduct manual audits instead.  The following are recommended timeframes for conducting vulnerability scans for missing application patches:   to mitigate basic cyber threats:   internet-facing services: daily   commonly-targeted applications: fortnightly   other applications: as required   to mitigate moderate cyber threats:   internet-facing services: daily   commonly-targeted applications: weekly   other applications: fortnightly   to mitigate advanced cyber threats:   internet-facing services: daily   commonly-targeted applications: weekly   other applications: fortnightly.  The following are recommended timeframes for conducting vulnerability scans for missing operating system patches:   to mitigate basic cyber threats:   internet-facing services: daily   workstations, servers, network devices and other network-connected devices: fortnightly   to mitigate moderate cyber threats:  3   internet-facing services: daily   workstations, servers, network devices and other network-connected devices: weekly   to mitigate advanced cyber threats:   internet-facing services: daily   workstations, servers, network devices and other network-connected devices: weekly.  Patching during change freeze periods  Change freeze periods are typically periods of time when changes are minimised, usually to preserve business  operations during critical periods. However, most organisations still allow emergency changes and patching activities  during change freeze periods via an exemption process.  In theory, the tenet of freezing almost all changes in order to preserve business operations is sound. However, in  today’s constantly evolving cyber threat landscape, it is important to keep in mind that new security vulnerabilities  continue to be discovered by adversaries, vendors and security researchers, and that adversaries continue to operate  irrespective of an organisation’s self-imposed change freeze period.  The discovery of new security vulnerabilities, and disruptions from adversaries, may occur at any time. As such,  organisations should ensure that security vulnerabilities are still being addressed during change freeze periods,  especially within 48 hours for any internet-facing services. Critical security vulnerabilities, or security vulnerabilities that  affect critical applications or operating systems, should also be addressed with patches or other recommended  mitigations from vendors during change freeze periods. In some cases, vendor mitigations that are not traditional  patches will be provided before a patch, or alongside a patch if the patch is disruptive. Where vendor mitigations are  initially used, patches should be applied as a follow-up.  Faults during patching  When patching, organisations may be concerned about the risk of patches breaking applications or operating systems,  and the associated outage this may cause. While this is a legitimate concern, and should be considered when deciding  what actions to take in response to security vulnerabilities, many vendors perform thorough testing of patches prior to  their release. However, this testing is not always perfect and organisations are likely to at some point face the release  of faulty patches or experience faults when attempting to apply patches to applications or operating systems.  It is recommended that organisations account for the possibility of faults during patching by establishing clear patch  management processes. In doing so, organisations might adopt different strategies for managing faulty patches, for  example, larger organisations might test all patches beforehand in a testing or staging environment, whereas smaller  organisations might choose to forgo testing and instead implement a rollback mechanism. Organisations using modern  software environments and deployment approaches can more easily rollback their applications or operating systems to  a known good state.  Overall, the immediate protection afforded by patching a security vulnerability that is currently being exploited by  adversaries far outweighs the impact of the unlikely occurrence of having to roll back a patch.  Tightly coupled security and feature patches  It is always recommended that security patches be applied as soon as possible. However, some vendors do not provide  separate security and feature update patches. If an organisation does not require a new feature, being forced to apply  the new feature by a vendor could introduce business process risks, as certain business processes may rely on features  remaining unchanged.  Organisations should review vendor release notes and keep up-to-date on the types of updates and security  configurations that vendors provide. They should then determine if using products with tightly coupled security and  4  feature patches is a risk or not. Any potential risk that has been identified may increase during change freeze periods  where possible disruptions to business operations due to feature changes is especially undesirable.  If organisations choose to use products from vendors that don’t provide security-only patches, they need to account for  this in their patch management processes, as they may need to be ready to implement feature changes at short notice  if security vulnerabilities are being exploited and require immediate patching.  Patching in resource constrained environments  In situations where resources are constrained, organisations are encouraged to prioritise the deployment of patches.  For example, patches should first be applied for all internet-facing services. This should then be followed by important  network devices, servers and workstations of high-risk users (e.g. senior managers and their staff; system  administrators; and staff members from human resources, sales, marketing, finance and legal areas). Finally, all other  network devices, servers and workstations should be patched.  Temporary workarounds  Temporary workarounds may provide the only effective protection if there are no patches available from vendors for  security vulnerabilities. These workarounds may be published in conjunction with, or soon after, security vulnerability  announcements. Temporary workarounds may include disabling the vulnerable functionality within an application or  operating system, or restricting or blocking access to the vulnerable service using firewalls or other security controls.  Patching in different contexts  The following considerations are applicable for organisations that use cloud services or operate critical infrastructure.  Cloud infrastructure  For organisations that use externally-provided cloud services, the technology stack and secure administration processes  implemented are often opaque. However, this is unlikely to provide a significant risk if the cloud service provider (CSP)  properly patches their infrastructure and systems as CSPs are required to provide a consistent and reliable service to  their customers.  In terms of change freeze periods, if an organisation freezes change at the operating system layer when using  Infrastructure-as-a-Service, all of their data, resources and configurations should remain the same even if the CSP  performs changes underneath that layer. Similarly, if an organisation freezes change at the application layer when using  Software-as-a-Service, they should not notice any difference even if the CSP migrates the application across different  operating systems.  Separately, in order to flexibly and efficiently control changes for infrastructure they manage, organisations that are  cloud-native might consider utilising Agile and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)  development methodologies. This allows organisations to rapidly deploy and test patches in a controlled manner.  Moving to the cloud entails not only the transformation of technical architecture, but also the transformation of  business processes.  Finally, information on the security responsibilities of CSPs and their customers can often be found via a CSP’s shared  responsibility model and service-level agreements. For example, organisations should note that they are still  responsible for patching their applications and operating systems when using Infrastructure-as-a-Service.  5  Critical infrastructure  Critical infrastructure, such as Industrial Control Systems, are unique in the sense that they are often in a state of  change freeze due to their requirement of high availability. Organisations with critical infrastructure will most likely  favour manual patching over automated patching, and find through risk assessments that it is riskier to patch than it is  to withhold from patching. These organisations should still seek to apply mitigations to address any identified security  vulnerabilities. For example, network monitoring and segmentation might be applied instead of patching. It is up to  organisations to define patch management processes that are in line with their business requirements and threat  profile.  Summary  By maintaining a clear and streamlined patch management process – including an awareness of information sources  used to determine whether security vulnerabilities are currently being exploited, an awareness of the regular patch  release schedules of vendors, defined responsibilities for individuals involved in patching activities and regular  vulnerability scanning for missing patches – organisations can position themselves to act swiftly upon security bulletin  or patch releases. In doing so, organisations can dramatically reduce the time between noticing information on new  security vulnerabilities and applying patches, or implementing temporary workarounds where appropriate.

Conclusions 39  References  41  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  05  Executive Summary  The primary target audience for this report is the EU CSIRTs network teams, and their leadership.  However it needs to be stressed here that this report, and especially the maturity self-assessment that it  contains, will be of use to all types of CSIRTs all over the world.1  The EU Network and Information Security Directive2 (NIS Directive) creates a CSIRTs network “to  contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation”. The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one or  more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I (requirements),  covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex III, responsible  for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well–defined process. The Directive gives high-level  requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform.  In order to provide input to the designated CSIRTs on this topic, ENISA performed a continuation of the  2016 study on CSIRT maturity, focused on the national teams expected to join the CSIRTs network. To  recapitulate, the 2016 study had the following main results:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best  based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used in  Europe serves as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS  Directive requirements.  2. The three-tier approach towards maturity that ENISA adopted in the 2013 report “CERT  community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes” can be used to define a scale of three steps  when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and  advanced.  3. A proposed specific definition of those three steps for the benefit of the CSIRTs network, coupled  with the suggestion to define a validation process based on self-assessments and peer- assessments.  By adopting the approach proposed in the 2016 study, the CSIRTs network would have immediate access  to a clearly laid out CSIRT maturity improvement process, that is not only implementable and  sustainable, but also based on a proven best practice: the SIM3 model is in use in the European TF-CSIRT  Trusted Introducer community since 2009, for self-assessments but also for over 20 certifications so far,  including 7 members of the CSIRTs network.  The Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE3) has adopted  1 Only in the definitions of the three maturity steps, there are elements that are strongly based on EU NISD demands –  however these three steps can easily be adapted to the demands in other CSIRT cooperations, regions and/or sectors.  2 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/18-cybersecurity-agreement/  3 https://www.thegfce.com  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/18-cybersecurity-agreement/ https://www.thegfce.com/  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  06  SIM3 as their CSIRT maturity framework in 2015.4 In Japan, the Nippon CSIRT Association (NCA5), with  well over 200 member teams, is basing their maturity improvement scheme on SIM3.  A growth path was suggested that reaches the basic step within one year, intermediate two years later  and advanced another two years later: a total of five years’ maximum which is in line with the CSIRTs  network work roadmap. Achieving the basic step would already allow a minimum of successful co- operation between teams on incident handling, the higher steps are needed to allow the members of the  CSIRTs network to interact on all steps, including pro-actively, thus truly giving meaning to the word  CSIRTs network.  The continuation work reported on here focused on two important aspects of the afore mentioned CSIRT  maturity improvement process:  1. Self-assessment survey. A survey with questions and answers for all the SIM3 parameters is  delivered here, which makes it considerably easier for any team to self-assess their maturity in  the terms of SIM3. The survey is complete with a mapping to the proposed CSIRTs network  maturity scale (with the steps basic, intermediate and advanced), so that members of the CSIRTs  network who use the survey can self-assess their maturity on that scale.  4 See the GFCE’s “CSIRT Maturity Kit”: https://check.ncsc.nl/static/CSIRT_MK_guide.pdf  5 http://www.nca.gr.jp/en/  0  1  2  3  4  O-1 O-2 O-3  O-4 O-5  O-7  O-8  O-9  O-10  O-11  H-1  H-2  H-3  H-4  H-5  H-6  H-7  T-1 T-2  T-3 T-4T-5  T-6 T-7T-8  T-9 T-10  P-1  P-2  P-3  P-4  P-5  P-6  P-7  P-8  P-9  P-10  P-11  P-12  P-13 P-14  P-15 P-16 P-17  CSIRT MATURITY EVALUATION IN 3 STEPS  Basic Intermediate Advanced  https://check.ncsc.nl/static/CSIRT_MK_guide.pdf http://www.nca.gr.jp/en/  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  07  2. Peer review methodology. A methodology for how to do peer reviews inside the CSIRTs network  is delivered here, complementary to the self-assessment approach and intended as a form of  intra-community mutual support aimed at further enhancing all teams’ maturity. The proposed  peer review approach is a flexible one, that is expected to suit the needs of all teams involved.  With all these building blocks in place, the next recommended step is discussion inside the CSIRTs  network, followed by a small scale pilot application, any necessary revisions, and then roll-out. During  the whole process it is recommended to stay in close touch with the (not-for-profit) Open CSIRT  Foundation [1], who have assumed the SIM3 stewardship role in October 2016, to make sure that the  SIM3 related developments are handled synergistically.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  08  1. Introduction  The EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive) aims to create a CSIRTs network “to  contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation”. [2] The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one  or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in the Directive’s point (1) of Annex I  (requirements), covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex  III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well–defined process. The Directive  gives high-level requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform.  ENISA’s 2016 study on CSIRT maturity, focused on the national teams expected to join the CSIRTs  network, concluded that a sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving  maturity is best based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters, and it proposed to use the  existing SIM3 model for that. The existing ENISA three-tier maturity approach was added to define a scale  of three steps when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and  advanced. It was proposed to validate these inside the CSIRTs network by means of a process based on  self-assessments and peer-assessments.  In order to further explain this validation process, ENISA has contracted a research to establish a readily  implementable and useable self-assessment survey and peer review methodology. The results of this  study are presented here.  Methodology  The work carried out in this project focused on how to measure the maturity of CSIRTs, especially those  in the CSIRTs network, by means of self-assessment (chapter 3) and peer review (chapter 4) based on the  SIM3 maturity model (see 1.1). This work is a practical follow-up of the recommendations made in the  ENISA report: Challenges for National CSIRTs in Europe in 2016 : Study on CSIRT Maturity (2016).  Input sources  Input was considered from the following areas:  1. The ENISA report Challenges for National CSIRTs in Europe in 2016 : Study on CSIRT Maturity  (2016) [3]  2. The SIM3 model for CSIRT self-assessment and certification (generic evaluation scheme for  any type of CSIRT) [4]  3. The NIS Directive – tasks and requirements of the dedicated (national) CSIRT (obligations for  national (dedicated) CSIRT in the European Union [5]  Input evaluation  Members of two CSIRTs network teams provided advice and input, as did the Open CSIRT Foundation.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  09  2. Self-assessment Survey  This chapter details a survey that teams can use to self-assess their team’s maturity in terms of the SIM3  model. The outcomes of such self-assessments will in principle be less objective than can be expected  from e.g. the TI Certification, which is also based on SIM3. However, for the purpose of the CSIRTs  network and this report, we see this survey as a fair and useful approximation, especially when combined  with peer review (see chapter 4).  The survey is self-explaining. Simply follow the questions for all 44 SIM3 parameters, and select the  answer that fits your situation best. This will result in a self-assessed level for each of the 44 parameters.  These levels can be one of the following (taken from the SIM3, with NOTEs added):  LEVEL EXPLANATION  0 Not available / undefined / unaware.  1 Implicit (known/considered but not written down, “between the ears”).  2  Explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way).  NOTE: any written document (including wiki pages) that has not been formally  approved by the CSIRT management falls in this category.  3  Explicit, formalised on authority of the CSIRT management (“rubberstamped” or  published).  NOTE: any written document (including wiki pages) that has been formally  approved by the CSIRT management falls in this category. Bear in mind that if a  document has been formally approved at an organisational level that is  hierarchically above but in the same branch of the (host) organisation’s  organigram, that document is automatically valid for the CSIRT and their  management too – still, if it is directly relevant, it is advisable for the CSIRT  management to endorse this document anyway, and e.g. place it on the team  wiki. (As to such a team wiki, if it exists, we advise that if that holds level 3  documents, to use version and date control, to ensure that a document that has  once been approved by the CSIRT management, does not automatically keep  that status forever. Otherwise the risk of having outdated documents is  significant.)  4  As 3, but regularly and explicitly assessed on authority of governance levels  above the CSIRT management.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  10  NOTE: in the answers below we talk about “periodic review”. Often that period  does is one year. It can however also be twice per year for instance, or once per  2 years for instance. What matters is that it is regular, and planned and will  actually take place. What is also important is that parameters are “explicitly”  assessed or reviewed: and this needs to be laid down in writing explicitly. So a  vague statement like “the team will be reviewed every year” does not lead to  level 4 for all SIM3 parameters – the parameters in question, or their content,  must be explicitly mentioned, and explicitly reviewed. The review must be on  the initiative of the higher levels of management: not the CSIRT management.  This also means that sending a periodic report to the higher management does  not allow a level 4 status – that is still level 3. There is one special case: if a  parameter is explicitly mentioned (by content, not necessarily by name) in  national law, then this allows a level 4 status, because we assume that in all EU  countries, national law is sufficiently maintained and guarded by all 3 powers of  the Trias Politica 6– we do repeat here that the parameter’s content must be  made explicit in the law, no vague abstractions.  Finally, we added for each parameter the proposed minimum steps for “basic”, “intermediate” and  “advanced” maturity as has been proposed for the CSIRTs network. This way, using this survey for self- assessment, a team can quickly see where they are maturity wise. Of course, “basic” maturity is reached  when all parameters score “basic” or better. “Intermediate” maturity is reached when all parameters  score “intermediate” or better. And the same for “advanced”.  O – Organisation parameters  2.1.1 O-1: Mandate  Question  Does your CSIRT have a mandate? The mandate defines the assignment of your team. Ideally, the  mandate is set at the highest management or political level (in the latter case it can even be anchored in  legislation).

This could include different services  such as incident response, vulnerability handling, malware analysis and others - plus related practical  aspects like contact information and service windows. An important aspect to consider is whether a  version of the service description has been made available to (at least) the constituency – to publish rfc- 2350 is a recommended way of doing this.

Incident classifications  usually contain “types” of incidents or incident categories. However, it is highly recommended that they  also include the aspects “severity/impact” and \"priority\" – as this will allow a logical way of dealing with  bigger number of incidents at the same time, and also indicate when escalations may be due (see e.g. P- 1,2,3).  Answers   We don’t classify incidents, we just deal with them.  level 0   We appreciate that there are different types of incidents, but we don’t make this explicit.

This kind of participation is necessary to be  an effective member of the national/sectoral/regional/worldwide CSIRT collaboration.  Answers   We never really discussed this.  level 0   We know in what CSIRT co-operation(s) we participate, but it was never written down.   level 1   We don’t have a formal written statement on the CSIRT co-operations we participate in,  therefore we wrote something for our own purposes.

In the periodic review of our team it is  checked if and how actively we participate in these co-operations, and what the benefits are.   level 4  Proposed demands for CSIRTs network maturity steps:   Basic: level 3 or better   Intermediate: level 4   Advanced: level 4  2.1.10 O-10: Organisational Framework  Question  Does your CSIRT have a coherent framework document serving as the controlling document for the team,  also known as \"team charter\" or \"organisational framework\"? This charter should bundle descriptions for  O-1 to O-9 and possibly some more SIM3 parameters. In many cases, teams seek the approval of the  higher management of their organisation for their charter - recommended, but not obligatory. Rfc-2350  is sometimes proposed as a team charter, but though rfc-2350 does cover some of the \"O\" parameters, it  does not cover all of them, and more importantly is not meant to be a controlling document, but rather a  public service description for a CSIRT.

The policy for your team can be an explicit or implicit part of a policy for the wider  organisation - or your CSIRT may have a separate security policy. As a CSIRT usually has specific  IT/security requirements (e.g. wanting to receive unfiltered e-mail, needing to have some way of running  tests without being blocked by a firewall, specific encryption demands, etc.), a separate policy is worth  considering.

The Trusted Introducer CSIRT Code of Practice serves as an example, and can be used for this  purpose. A code of conduct for the team’s host organization may exist, but is rarely sufficient as it does  not touch on the specific CSIRT aspects.

Three (part-time) team members are seen as an absolute minimum to ensure that at  any point in time at least someone can pick up the phone, or read e-mail and do something. Depending  on the services offered and the service level agreements, a significantly bigger number (permanent  and/or ad hoc) may be required to ensure availability even in times of short-term challenges or crises.

This question is about “asset management” (ISO terminology) or the “Configuration  Management Database” (CMDB: ITIL terminology). The CSIRT will normally not maintain a CMDB, but at  least they need to have access to it if it exists. In the absence of an advanced solution, the CSIRT may  consider maintaining a limited version of such a list themselves, with the help of their security contacts in  the constituency.  Note: in the case of e.g. national teams, or university teams, it can be argued that the constituency uses  all possible types of IT resources, and that it is therefore not feasible to maintain such a list. In such cases  it is acceptable in the case of T-1 that the CSIRT focuses on “vital parts of the constituency”, like a  country’s critical infrastructure, or a university’s business and core IT systems – and that at least for those  vital parts, the CSIRT should know what kind of IT resources are being used.

Minimum requirement:   (1) The handling of the following mailbox aliases (from RFC-2142 and best practice) is secured in such a  way that the handlers either are part of the CSIRT or know the CSIRT, what it is for, and how to reach it  when needed:  Security: security@ ; cert@ ; abuse@  E-mail: postmaster@   IP-numbers & domain names: hostmaster@  WWW: webmaster@ ; www@  (2) Some form of web presence for the CSIRT, at least internally. That presence must at least explain  what the CSIRT is for, who it is for, and how it can be reached and when. Additional recommendations  are (a) to link rfc-2350 from that presence, and (b) to enable a slash-security page, that is a page like  www.org.tld/security , which can serve a wider security purpose than just the CSIRT.  (3) Social media presence is optional, but needs to be considered. Twitter, Facebook etcetera.

Peer Review Methodology  The self-assessment proposed above serves many purposes, most of all to learn about its own  capabilities and capacities. But its values are directed inwards, not outwards. Therefore, the main  question that other CSIRTs will have about any one team is still un-answered: How mature is the team I  am looking at?  Right now, only one Certification scheme is available, provided by the Trusted Introducer service based  on SIM3, which can answer this question objectively based on the long-term experience of the auditors.  But there should be another alternative available that can answer the same question, maybe not to the  same degree, but good enough for practical purposes. Such purposes might be in the context of the NIS  Directive or the collaboration of teams in a specific trust circle like CSIRTs network.  To achieve this, a peer review methodology was designed, which is explicated below. The peer review  methodology is defined based on four leading principles that can be described by asking the following  questions:  1. Who carries out a peer review?  2. What specifically is reviewed and to which degree?  3. How are the results documented?  4. Which results are communicated to whom?  These four principles are detailed below, and the questions answered.  Who carries out a peer review?  Obviously, just by the name of it, only peers can carry out such reviews. The reviewer needs to have  significant working knowledge of the context of the team and their working relationships, as well as the  overall setup of such teams. The team to be reviewed has this knowledge and could therefore propose 3  to 5 potential reviewers to ENISA who could serve as intermediary in this “match making” process.  This means, that the potential reviewer will come from the same trust circle(s) and must be a senior  representative of their own team with at least 5 years of practical experience working in these trust  circles and as part of an operational CSIRT. Alternatively, the team can request that an ENISA CSIRT- relations senior expert be the reviewer.  Ideally, the peer reviewer has hands-on experience with the adoption of the SIM3 model, e.g. because  (s)he worked or works for a team that was Certified by the Trusted Introducer.7  What is exactly reviewed to which degree?  A peer review of all SIM3 parameters would require too much effort on the side of the peer reviewer. To  review only one or two of the four main areas – organisation and human issues for example – would  7 The Open CSIRT Foundation will start to provide trainings for SIM3 assessors in the autumn of 2017. Such a training  specifically for reviewers inside the CSIRTs network could help improve the peer review process.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  36  reduce the effort required for the peer review, but not cover all important topics. Therefore, it is  recommended to focus the peer review on the following two items:  1. Has the team representative provided the results (completed self-assessment for all SIM3  parameters) to the peer reviewer and signed it? This ensures that the peer reviewer has a good  foundation to go from and can base their further actions on the self-assessment results. The  signature signifies compliance with the model and principles adopted (SIM3 tuned for CSIRTs  network usage).  2. The peer reviewer will always discuss and review the following parameters:  Organisation: O-1, O-4 and O-10;  Human: H-1, H-2, H-4, H-5, H-6, H-7;  Tools: T-2, T-4, T-5;  Processes: P-1, P-6, P-9, P11, P-17.  3. Based on the self-assessment results the peer reviewer will discuss and check all those  parameters, that are declared as “level 4” by the team representative. Checking means that there  needs to be substantiation for these parameters which can be reviewed. This will be further  explained below.  To explain the reasoning behind #2 and #3 above, we will shortly look at the SIM3 levels again. SIM3’s  real life applicability has been achieved by adopting a unique set of levels, valid for all parameters all  categories:  LEVEL EXPLANATION  0 Not available / undefined / unaware  1 Implicit (known/considered but not written down, “between the ears”)  2 Explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way)  3  Explicit, formalised on authority of the CSIRT management (“rubberstamped” or  published)  4  As 3, but regularly and explicitly assessed on authority of governance levels  above the CSIRT management  So basically, with the signature of the team management all parameters can be declared up to “level 3”.  This can be ensured by her/him, given that there is a written document that can be signed. While it can  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  37  be certainly checked whether such written documents really exist (as is done in TI Certification, for  example), this is not needed inside a closed trust circle.8  The reason to still always discuss and review a number of parameters (as mentioned under #2 above) is  that these parameters are seen as so important in the light of the CSIRTs network, that it is both  important and beneficial for all teams involved to share ideas on those and gain common  understandings. “Reviewing” in this case means, that the peer reviewer accepts the declaration of the  team management up to “level 3” but will discuss what this means in the practice of the team, and  compare it with the practices of their own team (and possibly others that they may have reviewed).  It also follows from the table above that specifically those parameters that have been declared as “level  4” must be checked by means of reviewing substantiation. Here too, however, the discussion element is  essential for gaining better and common understanding.  Still the question will be, what specifically should be checked then, and to which degree, for those SIM3  parameters that will have been declared as “level 4”. Such parameters require a governance influence  above the CSIRT management. Therefore, the peer review needs to focus here on the existence of those  higher governance levels, the rules as defined by national law or organisational policies, and the  execution of the “regular and explicit assessment” on authority of those governance levels.  So what the peer reviewer needs to identify and check is the existence of any such process and evidence  that this is indeed “above” the CSIRT management. It is important to note again that this does not  include the checking on any results of such processes in the past or current. A description of the process  and evidence, like a formal statement of an overseeing body, would be sufficient.  How are the results documented  The documentation of the peer review results is relatively simple:  a) It must contain a reproduction of the signed self-assessment provided by the team  representative, which may include the team’s own comments on all SIM3 parameters;  b) A summary of review findings for the parameters O-1,4,10; H-1,2,4,5,6,7; T-2,4,5 and P- 1,6,9,11,17;  c) A summary of review findings for all SIM3 parameter declared as “level 4”, plus an explicit  confirmation that in the eyes of the peer reviewer these are correctly declared as “level 4;  d) The date of the documentation and name of the peer reviewer as well as the signature.  Which results are communicated to whom?  As the peer reviewer collects all details and insights necessary to produce the documentation, a draft  version shall be produced and presented to the team representative for review. If any interpretation  needs to be discussed, this would be the point in time to bring it up with the peer reviewer before  concluding the review.  8 If – at some later point in time – it might become clear, that one or more of such documents may never have existed, this  would remove all trust in the team. In addition, it can be assumed, that based on such peer pressure and the dependence of  the team to work within these trust circles, no team will jeopardise their trust-status in the community by foul-play.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  38  After the final documentation has been produced, the documentation is sent to ENISA for further  processing.  This research and proposed solution on CSIRT maturity assessment is tailored for the NISD CSIRTs  network needs and requirements. The outcome of this document should be further implemented within  this Network.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  39  4. Conclusions  The NISD aims at creating a CSIRTs network “to contribute to developing confidence and trust between  the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation”. Each Member State  shall designate one or more CSIRTs that shall comply with a set of defined high-level requirements.  ENISA’s 2016 report Challenges for National CSIRTs in Europe in 2016 : Study on CSIRT Maturity  concluded the following, in short:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best  based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used  in Europe serves as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS  Directive.  2. The three-tier approach towards maturity steps that ENISA adopted in the past can be used to  define three steps when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic,  intermediate and advanced tailored to the needs of the CSIRTs network.  3. An explicit definition of those three steps for the benefit of the NISD CSIRTs network has been  proposed in the report. Basic step already allows successful co-operation between teams on  incident handling, the higher steps are needed to allow the members of the CSIRTs network to  interact on all levels, including pro-actively. The Advanced step has been defined at the level  of the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe, which means that certification is within  reach once that maturity level has been reached.  4. A validation process based on self-assessments and peer-reviews has been suggested in the  report, pending further explication.  5. By adopting this approach, the NISD CSIRTs network will have immediate access to a clearly  defined CSIRT maturity improvement process that is both implementable and sustainable. A  growth path has been suggested in the report that asks teams to reach basic step within one  year, intermediate two years later and advanced another two years later.  The report presented here is a further explication of point 4. above, focusing on two important aspects of  the CSIRT maturity improvement process:  1. Self-assessment survey. A survey with questions and answers for all the SIM3 parameters was  delivered here, which makes it considerably easier for any team to self-assess their maturity in  the terms of SIM3 parameters. The survey is complete with a mapping to the proposed CSIRTs  network maturity scale (with the steps basic, intermediate and advanced), so that members of  the CSIRTs network who use the survey can self-assess their maturity on that scale.  2. Peer review methodology. A methodology for how to do peer reviews inside the CSIRTs network  was delivered here, complementary to the self-assessment approach and intended as a form of  intra-community mutual support aimed at further enhancing all teams’ maturity. The proposed  peer review approach is a flexible one, that is expected to suit the needs of all teams involved.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  40  With all these building blocks in place, the next recommended steps are:  1. Discussion inside the CSIRTs network on content and application of both maturity studies. (May –  June 2017)  2. A small scale pilot application, involving up to 3 volunteer teams of varying maturity to do self-  assessments and 1 TI-certified team as peer reviewer. (September-November 2017)  3. Revising the models used based on the pilot outcomes. During the whole process it is  recommended to stay in close touch with ENISA about recommendations on CSIRTs capabilities  and maturity and also with the (not-for-profit) Open CSIRT Foundation, who have assumed the  SIM3 stewardship role in October 2016, to make sure that the SIM3 related developments are  synergetic. (November-December 2017). Additionally, it is seen as highly recommendable to  synchronise with the CEF CSP project that is being rolled out from 2017-2019 for the CSIRTs  network community, as this project has budget and plans to organise a series of trainings in 2018  that aim at increasing the CSIRT maturity level, as a boundary condition for successful take-up of  the CSP services – and as the thinking of the project consortium on fostering maturity has a high  degree of synchronicity9 with the ideas presented in this report, a win/win situation is within  reach.  4. Decision for roll-out inside CSIRTs network. (January 2018)  5. Roll-out. (Timing to be decided in step 4.)  9 This observation is based on communications with representatives of the CEF CSP project consortium.

However it needs to be stressed here that this report, and especially the maturity self-assessment that it  contains, will be of use to all types of CSIRTs all over the world.1  The EU Network and Information Security Directive2 (NIS Directive) creates a CSIRTs network “to  contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation”. The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one or  more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I (requirements),  covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex III, responsible  for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well–defined process. The Directive gives high-level  requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform.  In order to provide input to the designated CSIRTs on this topic, ENISA performed a continuation of the  2016 study on CSIRT maturity, focused on the national teams expected to join the CSIRTs network. To  recapitulate, the 2016 study had the following main results:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best  based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used in  Europe serves as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS  Directive requirements.  2. The three-tier approach towards maturity that ENISA adopted in the 2013 report “CERT  community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes” can be used to define a scale of three steps  when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and  advanced.  3. A proposed specific definition of those three steps for the benefit of the CSIRTs network, coupled  with the suggestion to define a validation process based on self-assessments and peer- assessments.  By adopting the approach proposed in the 2016 study, the CSIRTs network would have immediate access  to a clearly laid out CSIRT maturity improvement process, that is not only implementable and  sustainable, but also based on a proven best practice: the SIM3 model is in use in the European TF-CSIRT  Trusted Introducer community since 2009, for self-assessments but also for over 20 certifications so far,  including 7 members of the CSIRTs network.  The Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE3) has adopted  1 Only in the definitions of the three maturity steps, there are elements that are strongly based on EU NISD demands –  however these three steps can easily be adapted to the demands in other CSIRT cooperations, regions and/or sectors.  2 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/18-cybersecurity-agreement/  3 https://www.thegfce.com  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/18-cybersecurity-agreement/ https://www.thegfce.com/  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  06  SIM3 as their CSIRT maturity framework in 2015.4 In Japan, the Nippon CSIRT Association (NCA5), with  well over 200 member teams, is basing their maturity improvement scheme on SIM3.  A growth path was suggested that reaches the basic step within one year, intermediate two years later  and advanced another two years later: a total of five years’ maximum which is in line with the CSIRTs  network work roadmap. Achieving the basic step would already allow a minimum of successful co- operation between teams on incident handling, the higher steps are needed to allow the members of the  CSIRTs network to interact on all steps, including pro-actively, thus truly giving meaning to the word  CSIRTs network.  The continuation work reported on here focused on two important aspects of the afore mentioned CSIRT  maturity improvement process:  1. Self-assessment survey. A survey with questions and answers for all the SIM3 parameters is  delivered here, which makes it considerably easier for any team to self-assess their maturity in  the terms of SIM3. The survey is complete with a mapping to the proposed CSIRTs network  maturity scale (with the steps basic, intermediate and advanced), so that members of the CSIRTs  network who use the survey can self-assess their maturity on that scale.  4 See the GFCE’s “CSIRT Maturity Kit”: https://check.ncsc.nl/static/CSIRT_MK_guide.pdf  5 http://www.nca.gr.jp/en/  0  1  2  3  4  O-1 O-2 O-3  O-4 O-5  O-7  O-8  O-9  O-10  O-11  H-1  H-2  H-3  H-4  H-5  H-6  H-7  T-1 T-2  T-3 T-4T-5  T-6 T-7T-8  T-9 T-10  P-1  P-2  P-3  P-4  P-5  P-6  P-7  P-8  P-9  P-10  P-11  P-12  P-13 P-14  P-15 P-16 P-17  CSIRT MATURITY EVALUATION IN 3 STEPS  Basic Intermediate Advanced  https://check.ncsc.nl/static/CSIRT_MK_guide.pdf http://www.nca.gr.jp/en/  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  07  2. Peer review methodology. A methodology for how to do peer reviews inside the CSIRTs network  is delivered here, complementary to the self-assessment approach and intended as a form of  intra-community mutual support aimed at further enhancing all teams’ maturity. The proposed  peer review approach is a flexible one, that is expected to suit the needs of all teams involved.  With all these building blocks in place, the next recommended step is discussion inside the CSIRTs  network, followed by a small scale pilot application, any necessary revisions, and then roll-out. During  the whole process it is recommended to stay in close touch with the (not-for-profit) Open CSIRT  Foundation [1], who have assumed the SIM3 stewardship role in October 2016, to make sure that the  SIM3 related developments are handled synergistically.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  08  1. Introduction  The EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive) aims to create a CSIRTs network “to  contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation”. [2] The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one  or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in the Directive’s point (1) of Annex I  (requirements), covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex  III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well–defined process. The Directive  gives high-level requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform.  ENISA’s 2016 study on CSIRT maturity, focused on the national teams expected to join the CSIRTs  network, concluded that a sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving  maturity is best based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters, and it proposed to use the  existing SIM3 model for that. The existing ENISA three-tier maturity approach was added to define a scale  of three steps when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and  advanced. It was proposed to validate these inside the CSIRTs network by means of a process based on  self-assessments and peer-assessments.  In order to further explain this validation process, ENISA has contracted a research to establish a readily  implementable and useable self-assessment survey and peer review methodology. The results of this  study are presented here.  Methodology  The work carried out in this project focused on how to measure the maturity of CSIRTs, especially those  in the CSIRTs network, by means of self-assessment (chapter 3) and peer review (chapter 4) based on the  SIM3 maturity model (see 1.1). This work is a practical follow-up of the recommendations made in the  ENISA report: Challenges for National CSIRTs in Europe in 2016 : Study on CSIRT Maturity (2016).  Input sources  Input was considered from the following areas:  1. The ENISA report Challenges for National CSIRTs in Europe in 2016 : Study on CSIRT Maturity  (2016) [3]  2. The SIM3 model for CSIRT self-assessment and certification (generic evaluation scheme for  any type of CSIRT) [4]  3. The NIS Directive – tasks and requirements of the dedicated (national) CSIRT (obligations for  national (dedicated) CSIRT in the European Union [5]  Input evaluation  Members of two CSIRTs network teams provided advice and input, as did the Open CSIRT Foundation.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  09  2. Self-assessment Survey  This chapter details a survey that teams can use to self-assess their team’s maturity in terms of the SIM3  model. The outcomes of such self-assessments will in principle be less objective than can be expected  from e.g. the TI Certification, which is also based on SIM3. However, for the purpose of the CSIRTs  network and this report, we see this survey as a fair and useful approximation, especially when combined  with peer review (see chapter 4).  The survey is self-explaining. Simply follow the questions for all 44 SIM3 parameters, and select the  answer that fits your situation best. This will result in a self-assessed level for each of the 44 parameters.  These levels can be one of the following (taken from the SIM3, with NOTEs added):  LEVEL EXPLANATION  0 Not available / undefined / unaware.  1 Implicit (known/considered but not written down, “between the ears”).  2  Explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way).  NOTE: any written document (including wiki pages) that has not been formally  approved by the CSIRT management falls in this category.  3  Explicit, formalised on authority of the CSIRT management (“rubberstamped” or  published).  NOTE: any written document (including wiki pages) that has been formally  approved by the CSIRT management falls in this category. Bear in mind that if a  document has been formally approved at an organisational level that is  hierarchically above but in the same branch of the (host) organisation’s  organigram, that document is automatically valid for the CSIRT and their  management too – still, if it is directly relevant, it is advisable for the CSIRT  management to endorse this document anyway, and e.g. place it on the team  wiki. (As to such a team wiki, if it exists, we advise that if that holds level 3  documents, to use version and date control, to ensure that a document that has  once been approved by the CSIRT management, does not automatically keep  that status forever. Otherwise the risk of having outdated documents is  significant.)  4  As 3, but regularly and explicitly assessed on authority of governance levels  above the CSIRT management.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  10  NOTE: in the answers below we talk about “periodic review”. Often that period  does is one year. It can however also be twice per year for instance, or once per  2 years for instance. What matters is that it is regular, and planned and will  actually take place. What is also important is that parameters are “explicitly”  assessed or reviewed: and this needs to be laid down in writing explicitly. So a  vague statement like “the team will be reviewed every year” does not lead to  level 4 for all SIM3 parameters – the parameters in question, or their content,  must be explicitly mentioned, and explicitly reviewed. The review must be on  the initiative of the higher levels of management: not the CSIRT management.  This also means that sending a periodic report to the higher management does  not allow a level 4 status – that is still level 3. There is one special case: if a  parameter is explicitly mentioned (by content, not necessarily by name) in  national law, then this allows a level 4 status, because we assume that in all EU  countries, national law is sufficiently maintained and guarded by all 3 powers of  the Trias Politica 6– we do repeat here that the parameter’s content must be  made explicit in the law, no vague abstractions.  Finally, we added for each parameter the proposed minimum steps for “basic”, “intermediate” and  “advanced” maturity as has been proposed for the CSIRTs network. This way, using this survey for self- assessment, a team can quickly see where they are maturity wise. Of course, “basic” maturity is reached  when all parameters score “basic” or better. “Intermediate” maturity is reached when all parameters  score “intermediate” or better. And the same for “advanced”.  O – Organisation parameters  2.1.1 O-1: Mandate  Question  Does your CSIRT have a mandate? The mandate defines the assignment of your team. Ideally, the  mandate is set at the highest management or political level (in the latter case it can even be anchored in  legislation).  Answers   We never really discussed this and we don't formally know our mandate or assignment. We  just do our work.  level 0   We have a pretty good idea that we are doing is what we were assigned to do, but it was  never written down.  level 1   We don’t have a formal written mandate, therefore we wrote something for our own  purposes. Our team management has not formally approved this.  level 2   We have a written mandate approved by our team management.  level 3   We have a written mandate from higher management that our team management regards as  authoritative. In the periodic review of our team it is checked if and how we fulfil our  mandate.  level 4  6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  11  Proposed demands for CSIRTs network maturity steps:   Basic: level 3 or better   Intermediate: level 4   Advanced: level 4  2.1.2 O-2: Constituency  Question  Does your CSIRT have a clear constituency, that is, the target group for who you do the CSIRT work, your  \"client base\"?

This could include different services  such as incident response, vulnerability handling, malware analysis and others - plus related practical  aspects like contact information and service windows. An important aspect to consider is whether a  version of the service description has been made available to (at least) the constituency – to publish rfc- 2350 is a recommended way of doing this.  Answers   We never really discussed this. We just do our work.  level 0   We know what services we offer, but it was never written down.  level 1   We don’t have a formal written service description, therefore we wrote something for our  own purposes.

For reasons of backwards compatibility, it has been intentionally  left blank.  2.1.7 O-7: Service Level Description  Question  Have service levels been defined for the services that your CSIRT offers? This can range from something  as simple as the requirement to send a first (human) reaction to incident reports within a set amount of  time, to more extensive \"SLA\" type requirements.  Answers   We never really discussed this.  level 0   We have a basic understanding of the level of service expected of us, but it was never written  down.  level 1   We don’t have a formal written service level description, therefore we wrote something for  our own purposes. Our management has not formally approved this.  level 2   We have a written service level description approved by our team management.  level 3   We have a written service level description approved by our team management.

Incident classifications  usually contain “types” of incidents or incident categories. However, it is highly recommended that they  also include the aspects “severity/impact” and \"priority\" – as this will allow a logical way of dealing with  bigger number of incidents at the same time, and also indicate when escalations may be due (see e.g. P- 1,2,3).  Answers   We don’t classify incidents, we just deal with them.  level 0   We appreciate that there are different types of incidents, but we don’t make this explicit. If an  incident needs special attention, we just deal with that accordingly.  level 1   We don’t have a formal written incident classification, therefore we wrote one for our own  purposes. Our management has not formally approved this.  level 2   We have a written incident classification approved by our team management.  level 3   We have a written incident classification approved by our team management. In the periodic  review of our team attention is given to the different types of incidents and how we handled  those.  level 4  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  14  Proposed demands for CSIRTs network maturity steps:   Basic: level 1 or better   Intermediate: level 2 or better   Advanced: level 3 or better  2.1.9 O-9: Participation in Existing CSIRT Frameworks  Question  Does your CSIRT participate in a well-established CSIRT co-operation, either directly or through an  \"upstream\" CSIRT of which your team is a customer/client? This kind of participation is necessary to be  an effective member of the national/sectoral/regional/worldwide CSIRT collaboration.  Answers   We never really discussed this.  level 0   We know in what CSIRT co-operation(s) we participate, but it was never written down.   level 1   We don’t have a formal written statement on the CSIRT co-operations we participate in,  therefore we wrote something for our own purposes. Our management has not formally  approved this.  level 2   We have a formal written statement on the CSIRT co-operation(s) we participate in, approved  by our team management and budget supported.  level 3   We have a formal written statement on the CSIRT co-operation(s) we participate in, approved  by our team management and budget supported. In the periodic review of our team it is  checked if and how actively we participate in these co-operations, and what the benefits are.   level 4  Proposed demands for CSIRTs network maturity steps:   Basic: level 3 or better   Intermediate: level 4   Advanced: level 4  2.1.10 O-10: Organisational Framework  Question  Does your CSIRT have a coherent framework document serving as the controlling document for the team,  also known as \"team charter\" or \"organisational framework\"? This charter should bundle descriptions for  O-1 to O-9 and possibly some more SIM3 parameters. In many cases, teams seek the approval of the  higher management of their organisation for their charter - recommended, but not obligatory. Rfc-2350  is sometimes proposed as a team charter, but though rfc-2350 does cover some of the \"O\" parameters, it  does not cover all of them, and more importantly is not meant to be a controlling document, but rather a  public service description for a CSIRT.  Answers   We never really discussed this.  level 0  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  15   We do have a coherent view on our organisational set-up, but it was never written down.   level 1   We don’t have a formal written organisational framework, therefore we wrote something for  our own purposes. Our management has not formally approved this.  level 2   We have a written organisational framework approved by our team management.  level 3   We have a written organisational framework approved by our team management.

The policy for your team can be an explicit or implicit part of a policy for the wider  organisation - or your CSIRT may have a separate security policy. As a CSIRT usually has specific  IT/security requirements (e.g. wanting to receive unfiltered e-mail, needing to have some way of running  tests without being blocked by a firewall, specific encryption demands, etc.), a separate policy is worth  considering.  Answers   We never really discussed this.  level 0   We know the kind of security limitations that apply, but those were never written down.   level 1   We don’t have a formal written security policy that applies to us, therefore we wrote  something for our own purposes.

The Trusted Introducer CSIRT Code of Practice serves as an example, and can be used for this  purpose. A code of conduct for the team’s host organization may exist, but is rarely sufficient as it does  not touch on the specific CSIRT aspects.  Note: behaviour outside work is relevant, because it can be expected of CSIRT members that they behave  responsibly in private as well where computers and security are concerned.  Answers   We never really discussed this.  level 0   We know what kind of work ethics are expected of us, but they were never written down.   level 1   We don’t have a formal written code of conduct, therefore we wrote something for our own  purposes.

Three (part-time) team members are seen as an absolute minimum to ensure that at  any point in time at least someone can pick up the phone, or read e-mail and do something. Depending  on the services offered and the service level agreements, a significantly bigger number (permanent  and/or ad hoc) may be required to ensure availability even in times of short-term challenges or crises.  Answers   This is outside our scope.  level 0   We do have sufficient people on the job to be resilient, but this was never put down in  writing.  level 1   We don’t have a formal statement on the number of available CSIRT staff, therefore we wrote  something for our own purposes.

These can be positions like “(senior) incident handler”, “cyber security researcher”, “general  manager”, and others. Skills should not only be of a technical/knowledge nature, as also soft skills are  essential to the CSIRT work, such as communication and presentation skills, team play, flexibility.

This can be on- the-job-training as well as classroom-type or other types of traditional training.  Answers   We don’t offer this kind of training.  level 0   We have ideas about internal training and/or we train team members informally, but we  never wrote down anything about training demands, topics or materials.  level 1   We don’t have a formal internal training programme, therefore we wrote something for our  own purposes. Our management has not formally approved this.  level 2   We have an internal training programme approved by our team management.  level 3   We have an internal training programme approved by our team management. In the periodic  review of our team it is checked if this internal training programme has been put into action  sufficiently to meet the training needs of the team.  level 4  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  18  Proposed demands for CSIRTs network maturity steps:   Basic: level 1 or better   Intermediate: level 2 or better   Advanced: level 3 or better  2.2.5 H-5: (External) Technical Training  Question  Does your CSIRT allow staff to get relevant job-technical training? This is usually done externally – like  TRANSITS, ENISA CSIRT Training, or commercial training programs (CERT/CC, SANS, etc.) – but in some  bigger organisations such trainings are also (partially) available internally.  Answers   We have no options, time or money for this kind of training.  level 0   We send people to such trainings when it is necessary, but we have no written policy on this.   level 1   We don’t have a formal technical training programme, therefore we wrote something for our  own purposes which helps in sending our staff to such trainings.

This is usually done by external  trainers but in some bigger organisations such trainings are also available internally. Note that this  parameter is not just about talking with the press: in every aspect of the CSIRT work, human  communication is of the utmost importance, whether this is in writing e-mails or advisories, or talking to  people on the phone or in meetings.

This question is about “asset management” (ISO terminology) or the “Configuration  Management Database” (CMDB: ITIL terminology). The CSIRT will normally not maintain a CMDB, but at  least they need to have access to it if it exists. In the absence of an advanced solution, the CSIRT may  consider maintaining a limited version of such a list themselves, with the help of their security contacts in  the constituency.  Note: in the case of e.g. national teams, or university teams, it can be argued that the constituency uses  all possible types of IT resources, and that it is therefore not feasible to maintain such a list. In such cases  it is acceptable in the case of T-1 that the CSIRT focuses on “vital parts of the constituency”, like a  country’s critical infrastructure, or a university’s business and core IT systems – and that at least for those  vital parts, the CSIRT should know what kind of IT resources are being used.

Peer Review Methodology  The self-assessment proposed above serves many purposes, most of all to learn about its own  capabilities and capacities. But its values are directed inwards, not outwards. Therefore, the main  question that other CSIRTs will have about any one team is still un-answered: How mature is the team I  am looking at?  Right now, only one Certification scheme is available, provided by the Trusted Introducer service based  on SIM3, which can answer this question objectively based on the long-term experience of the auditors.  But there should be another alternative available that can answer the same question, maybe not to the  same degree, but good enough for practical purposes. Such purposes might be in the context of the NIS  Directive or the collaboration of teams in a specific trust circle like CSIRTs network.  To achieve this, a peer review methodology was designed, which is explicated below. The peer review  methodology is defined based on four leading principles that can be described by asking the following  questions:  1. Who carries out a peer review?  2. What specifically is reviewed and to which degree?  3. How are the results documented?  4. Which results are communicated to whom?  These four principles are detailed below, and the questions answered.  Who carries out a peer review?  Obviously, just by the name of it, only peers can carry out such reviews. The reviewer needs to have  significant working knowledge of the context of the team and their working relationships, as well as the  overall setup of such teams. The team to be reviewed has this knowledge and could therefore propose 3  to 5 potential reviewers to ENISA who could serve as intermediary in this “match making” process.  This means, that the potential reviewer will come from the same trust circle(s) and must be a senior  representative of their own team with at least 5 years of practical experience working in these trust  circles and as part of an operational CSIRT. Alternatively, the team can request that an ENISA CSIRT- relations senior expert be the reviewer.  Ideally, the peer reviewer has hands-on experience with the adoption of the SIM3 model, e.g. because  (s)he worked or works for a team that was Certified by the Trusted Introducer.7  What is exactly reviewed to which degree?  A peer review of all SIM3 parameters would require too much effort on the side of the peer reviewer. To  review only one or two of the four main areas – organisation and human issues for example – would  7 The Open CSIRT Foundation will start to provide trainings for SIM3 assessors in the autumn of 2017. Such a training  specifically for reviewers inside the CSIRTs network could help improve the peer review process.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  36  reduce the effort required for the peer review, but not cover all important topics. Therefore, it is  recommended to focus the peer review on the following two items:  1. Has the team representative provided the results (completed self-assessment for all SIM3  parameters) to the peer reviewer and signed it? This ensures that the peer reviewer has a good  foundation to go from and can base their further actions on the self-assessment results. The  signature signifies compliance with the model and principles adopted (SIM3 tuned for CSIRTs  network usage).  2. The peer reviewer will always discuss and review the following parameters:  Organisation: O-1, O-4 and O-10;  Human: H-1, H-2, H-4, H-5, H-6, H-7;  Tools: T-2, T-4, T-5;  Processes: P-1, P-6, P-9, P11, P-17.  3. Based on the self-assessment results the peer reviewer will discuss and check all those  parameters, that are declared as “level 4” by the team representative. Checking means that there  needs to be substantiation for these parameters which can be reviewed. This will be further  explained below.  To explain the reasoning behind #2 and #3 above, we will shortly look at the SIM3 levels again. SIM3’s  real life applicability has been achieved by adopting a unique set of levels, valid for all parameters all  categories:  LEVEL EXPLANATION  0 Not available / undefined / unaware  1 Implicit (known/considered but not written down, “between the ears”)  2 Explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way)  3  Explicit, formalised on authority of the CSIRT management (“rubberstamped” or  published)  4  As 3, but regularly and explicitly assessed on authority of governance levels  above the CSIRT management  So basically, with the signature of the team management all parameters can be declared up to “level 3”.  This can be ensured by her/him, given that there is a written document that can be signed. While it can  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  37  be certainly checked whether such written documents really exist (as is done in TI Certification, for  example), this is not needed inside a closed trust circle.8  The reason to still always discuss and review a number of parameters (as mentioned under #2 above) is  that these parameters are seen as so important in the light of the CSIRTs network, that it is both  important and beneficial for all teams involved to share ideas on those and gain common  understandings. “Reviewing” in this case means, that the peer reviewer accepts the declaration of the  team management up to “level 3” but will discuss what this means in the practice of the team, and  compare it with the practices of their own team (and possibly others that they may have reviewed).  It also follows from the table above that specifically those parameters that have been declared as “level  4” must be checked by means of reviewing substantiation. Here too, however, the discussion element is  essential for gaining better and common understanding.  Still the question will be, what specifically should be checked then, and to which degree, for those SIM3  parameters that will have been declared as “level 4”. Such parameters require a governance influence  above the CSIRT management. Therefore, the peer review needs to focus here on the existence of those  higher governance levels, the rules as defined by national law or organisational policies, and the  execution of the “regular and explicit assessment” on authority of those governance levels.  So what the peer reviewer needs to identify and check is the existence of any such process and evidence  that this is indeed “above” the CSIRT management. It is important to note again that this does not  include the checking on any results of such processes in the past or current. A description of the process  and evidence, like a formal statement of an overseeing body, would be sufficient.  How are the results documented  The documentation of the peer review results is relatively simple:  a) It must contain a reproduction of the signed self-assessment provided by the team  representative, which may include the team’s own comments on all SIM3 parameters;  b) A summary of review findings for the parameters O-1,4,10; H-1,2,4,5,6,7; T-2,4,5 and P- 1,6,9,11,17;  c) A summary of review findings for all SIM3 parameter declared as “level 4”, plus an explicit  confirmation that in the eyes of the peer reviewer these are correctly declared as “level 4;  d) The date of the documentation and name of the peer reviewer as well as the signature.  Which results are communicated to whom?  As the peer reviewer collects all details and insights necessary to produce the documentation, a draft  version shall be produced and presented to the team representative for review. If any interpretation  needs to be discussed, this would be the point in time to bring it up with the peer reviewer before  concluding the review.  8 If – at some later point in time – it might become clear, that one or more of such documents may never have existed, this  would remove all trust in the team. In addition, it can be assumed, that based on such peer pressure and the dependence of  the team to work within these trust circles, no team will jeopardise their trust-status in the community by foul-play.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  38  After the final documentation has been produced, the documentation is sent to ENISA for further  processing.  This research and proposed solution on CSIRT maturity assessment is tailored for the NISD CSIRTs  network needs and requirements. The outcome of this document should be further implemented within  this Network.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  39  4. Conclusions  The NISD aims at creating a CSIRTs network “to contribute to developing confidence and trust between  the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation”. Each Member State  shall designate one or more CSIRTs that shall comply with a set of defined high-level requirements.  ENISA’s 2016 report Challenges for National CSIRTs in Europe in 2016 : Study on CSIRT Maturity  concluded the following, in short:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best  based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used  in Europe serves as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS  Directive.  2. The three-tier approach towards maturity steps that ENISA adopted in the past can be used to  define three steps when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic,  intermediate and advanced tailored to the needs of the CSIRTs network.  3. An explicit definition of those three steps for the benefit of the NISD CSIRTs network has been  proposed in the report. Basic step already allows successful co-operation between teams on  incident handling, the higher steps are needed to allow the members of the CSIRTs network to  interact on all levels, including pro-actively. The Advanced step has been defined at the level  of the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe, which means that certification is within  reach once that maturity level has been reached.  4. A validation process based on self-assessments and peer-reviews has been suggested in the  report, pending further explication.  5. By adopting this approach, the NISD CSIRTs network will have immediate access to a clearly  defined CSIRT maturity improvement process that is both implementable and sustainable. A  growth path has been suggested in the report that asks teams to reach basic step within one  year, intermediate two years later and advanced another two years later.  The report presented here is a further explication of point 4. above, focusing on two important aspects of  the CSIRT maturity improvement process:  1. Self-assessment survey. A survey with questions and answers for all the SIM3 parameters was  delivered here, which makes it considerably easier for any team to self-assess their maturity in  the terms of SIM3 parameters. The survey is complete with a mapping to the proposed CSIRTs  network maturity scale (with the steps basic, intermediate and advanced), so that members of  the CSIRTs network who use the survey can self-assess their maturity on that scale.  2. Peer review methodology. A methodology for how to do peer reviews inside the CSIRTs network  was delivered here, complementary to the self-assessment approach and intended as a form of  intra-community mutual support aimed at further enhancing all teams’ maturity. The proposed  peer review approach is a flexible one, that is expected to suit the needs of all teams involved.  ENISA Maturity Evaluation Methodology for CSIRTs  09 April 2019  40  With all these building blocks in place, the next recommended steps are:  1. Discussion inside the CSIRTs network on content and application of both maturity studies. (May –  June 2017)  2. A small scale pilot application, involving up to 3 volunteer teams of varying maturity to do self-  assessments and 1 TI-certified team as peer reviewer. (September-November 2017)  3. Revising the models used based on the pilot outcomes. During the whole process it is  recommended to stay in close touch with ENISA about recommendations on CSIRTs capabilities  and maturity and also with the (not-for-profit) Open CSIRT Foundation, who have assumed the  SIM3 stewardship role in October 2016, to make sure that the SIM3 related developments are  synergetic. (November-December 2017). Additionally, it is seen as highly recommendable to  synchronise with the CEF CSP project that is being rolled out from 2017-2019 for the CSIRTs  network community, as this project has budget and plans to organise a series of trainings in 2018  that aim at increasing the CSIRT maturity level, as a boundary condition for successful take-up of  the CSP services – and as the thinking of the project consortium on fostering maturity has a high  degree of synchronicity9 with the ideas presented in this report, a win/win situation is within  reach.  4. Decision for roll-out inside CSIRTs network. (January 2018)  5. Roll-out. (Timing to be decided in step 4.)  9 This observation is based on communications with representatives of the CEF CSP project consortium.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  03  Executive Summary  The term M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications describes any solution or technology that facilitates  the wired and wireless communication between networked devices to exchange information, as ad-hoc  networking is an basic building block for M2M communications. Today, intelligent transportation, cyber- physical systems (CPS) and “Smart <anything>” (e.g. cities, buildings, vehicles, home appliances, phones)  technologies have been intensified and attract the attention of the R&D enthusiasts. Sensor networking has  the lion’s share among almost any of the above emerging trends. In this context, it is almost a “condition  sine qua non” to define any M2M implementation without including connected sensors in an ad-hoc  approach.  All the above contribute in describing the emerging universe of the Internet of Things (IoT), which can be  acknowledged as the driver for the evolution of M2M communications. In quantitative terms1, the IoT  connections are expected to exceed 27 billion by 2025 compared to 6 billion in 2015. In respect to the  market-share, the revenue opportunity is accounted for 6.8 billion Euros, whereas this amount will increase  to 2.7 trillion Euros by 2025. In terms of technology, 71% of all IoT connections are accommodated using a  short-range technology (i.e. WiFi, Zigbee, NFC, in-building Programmable Logic Controllers - PLCs).  From the security perspective, the increased attack surface in ad-hoc and sensor networks has urged the  development of technology for preventing attack incidents and for tackling system failures. In this vein, the  networks acquire greater importance in critical infrastructures (i.e. industrial control systems, water and  power plants, defence bases) and in sensitive data exploitation (i.e. healthcare, banking systems, social  networks) for which privacy and ethics issues are likely to arise. Recent incidents proved that any connected  device, such as smart TVs and video cameras2,3, can be compromised to propagate illegitimate network  traffic, but can also jeopardize security in a national and governmental level.  Objectives of the report  The ad-hoc and sensor networking Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide complements the Annual  Cyber Security ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL). It provides a deep overview of the current state of security in  the ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M communications. It also aims to support decision makers to  comprehend the landscape and take informed decisions regarding cyber-security by incorporating  consolidated information from the European Network & Information Security (NIS) threat landscape  evolution.  Key findings  By analysing the threats to identified assets of the ad-hoc and sensor networking nomenclature, we focused  on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and Wireless Sensor Networks  (WSN). We observed that the current threefold M2M communications architectural model, as considered  by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), can be expanded to two additional domains  1 Machina Research (2016).

In the same context,  we observed that the fusion of sensors, targeting to monitor the physiological vital signs of patients in clinical  operations, leads to technical and legal considerations. We also observed that the regulatory frameworks  do not explicitly define the obligatory actions that burden the end-users regarding their activities in a health- care environment. These gaps must be bridged to achieve privacy-friendly design of systems and services.  Further, security-by-design in sensor networks is found to be inadequate in business processes (e.g. power  generation and water distribution). These sensors operate in embedded systems whose preinstalled  operating system is susceptible to malicious exploits. The limitation of not modifying these networks  components should be eliminated without offending the sensor vendors’ copyrights and industrial design  rights. Considering that the M2M applications are increasingly based on the cloud computing (CC) paradigm  and the respective deployment and service models, we observed that is adequate to only secure the  application layer of a service in accordance with legacy environment practices because those service models  are mutually dependent for provisioning the end-services.  List of Recommendations  The main recommendations follow; for deeper explanations see section 9.6.   For developers, M2M applications development in CC environments should be performed by  adopting and expanding the application security guidelines of standardization organizations and  cover the needs of the M2M architecture.   For administrators: Identify by whom the sensorial data is accessed. Specific policies should be  established about authorising procedures and sharing agreements regarding these data.   For administrators and service providers: Security by design should be implemented for each layer  of the ad-hoc network.   For service providers, administrators and decision makers: The underlying infrastructure of M2M  applications and operations should comply with the security and operations regulatory frameworks  regarding the protection of personal data.   For administrators and networks/service providers: An elastic type of access control mechanism is  to be incorporated in ad-hoc and sensor networks   For administrators and network/service providers: Mobile Edge Cloud Computing (MEC) to be  orchestrated so as to develop a perimeter defence and collect/analyse forensic information about  the attacks.

Introduction  For 2016, the first ENISA strategic objective foresees: “To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of  EU actors considering evolutions in Network & Information Security (NIS)” 4. The current study analyses the  threats and the threat landscape for ad-hoc and sensor networks. We perform a comprehensive compilation  of the respective threats by analysing collected information, and deliver the respective threat analysis and  landscape reports on the application area.  Ad-hoc and sensor networks for smart objects are utilized for the collection of critical, sensitive, massive and  other types of data in several points of interest, such as weather stations, healthcare environments, aviation  and car fields, baggage and asset tracking, home and industry applications, manufacturing and supply chain  analytics and management. Then, the data can be analysed to trigger several corrective/preventive actions;  record and analyse system failures, initiate the appropriate remedial changes, apply/revert configuration  changes, and provide the quality data reporting and statistical process/control analysis. Today, smart  transport, smart finance and loans, smart utilities, smart supply and manufacturing, smart environments,  smart energy, smart home, and smart health involve numerous interconnected devices and rely heavily on  ad-hoc and sensor networks (Figure 1).  Figure 1 Global ad-hoc and sensor network market space  These pervasive and ubiquitous networks facilitate the processing and collection of data generated by  sensors and smart devices. In many cases, the operations, the resiliency, the availability and the performance  of these networks are critical, and, thus, we need to protect the secure exchange of the information, and  ensure data privacy and integrity. Besides, the reduction of their attack surface is among the predominant  issues that thrive during the operation of ad-hoc and sensor networks. Due to the increased attack surface  in ad-hoc and sensor networks, we need to prevent security incidents, tackle system failures, and mitigate  4 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Even more, the necessity to reduce the attack surface acquires greater importance in  critical environments (e.g. industrial control systems) and whenever sensitive data are involved (e.g. in  healthcare, banking systems and social networks), severe privacy and ethics issues may arise (e.g.  compromise of sensitive medical records and patients’ data). Inevitably, these networks constitute a strong  point of interest for several research teams throughout the world.  1.1 Policy Context  This report aims to analyse the evolving threat environment both from the stakeholder and the EU policy  makers’ perspective by identifying evolving threats, risks and challenges related to ad-hoc and sensors  networks with a special approach to the M2M communication architectural model.  The different challenges appeared during the adoption of new models of communication (such IoT and  M2M) suggests to propose a set of recommendations aligned with the EU strategy in research and  innovation5. A great added value is expected to be created as a result of these technology advancements.  The market value of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the EU is expected to exceed one trillion euros in 20205.  Within the IoT ecosystem, the major goal is to interconnect networks of sensors and smart objects in a way  that they can intelligently interact with humans, and to ensure the secure and seamless sensor and network  connectivity. In this context, ENISA expects these sectors to take advantage of the current ad-hoc and sensor  network for M2M communications threat landscape and provide added-value services to the IoT and M2M  technologies. By enabling a secure, trusted, reliable, and resilient environment, the industry will be more  competitive, and the markets within the EU will benefit from numerous innovative use cases. Therefore, it  is vital to promote and establish secure ad-hoc and sensor network for M2M communications, and manage  efficiently the large volumes of connected devices6.  The European Commission (EC) supports the evolutionary trends of ad-hoc and sensor networks leading to  the integration of sensor appliances in the market through various research and project efforts, such as the  MOBILEMAN project7, and the multi-sensor platform AirSensEUR8. The EC has also acknowledged the  emerging trends, identified the need for cross-layer techniques and efficient cooperative protocols, and has  implemented and validated the feasibility of the outcome of the Cooperative transmission and cross-layer  techniques for secure wireless sensor networks (Coolness) project9.  The current report identifies the ad-hoc and sensor network assets and illustrates the ad-hoc and sensor  networking threats by reviewing the current working and environmental practices, assessing the private and  public initiatives, and analysing the research information in this area. The report also provides the threat  5 European Commission, Directorate-General of Communications Networks, Content & Technology. (2014).

This document can also be useful for experts working in the EU’s electronic  communications sector and for experts working in the information security field.  1.3 Scope of the Study  As described in the ENISA regulation, one of the objectives of the agency is to assist the Union institutions,  bodies, offices and agencies in developing policies in network and information security by including  accumulated expertise related to availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or  transmitted data and the related services offered by or accessible via those networks and systems. For  instance, the new ENISA regulation undelines the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks (and their  components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical  bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA  regulation states that ENISA should enable effective responses to information security risks and threats.  This document is published by ENISA to provide a threat analysis and best practices guideline to ad-hoc and  sensor networking trends, and it also addresses the risks and threats of these technologies underpinning the  emergence of a ‘smart’ society. The ad-hoc and sensor networking threat information is directed to  executives, security architects and security managers. Nonetheless, the provided information can also be  10 A Global Strategy for the European Union [online] Available at: http://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/global-strategy- foreign-and-security-policy-european-union [Accessed 18 Nov. 2016].  http://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/global-strategy-foreign-and-security-policy-european-union http://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/global-strategy-foreign-and-security-policy-european-union  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  11  considered by non-experts. Furthermore, since the Agency assists the European Commission and EU  Member States, it  cooperates with the business community, in order to help them to meet the requirements  of network and information security, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the Internal Market.  1.4 Methodology  The current study examines various use cases to identify the respective assets and then collect, analyse and  categorize the ad-hoc and sensor networking threats. For the project execution, our methodology  performed research and collected the information through various sources (i.e. journals, conference papers,  white papers, industry recommendations, online documents). Various sources have been identified and  studied during our investigation.  We consider previous ETLs to specify the format, to review the ENISA taxonomy threats, and study the  approach taken in those ETLs. Besides, we also consider several other sources regarding the existing EU  policies  and we identify evolving threats, risks and challenges related to ad-hoc and sensors networks with  a special focus on the M2M communication architectural model. All these threats are assessed, categorized  and analyzed by means of several references to the collected sources. Then, we perform an analysis of the  existing good practices and present how the threat exposure can be reduced, while we identify gaps in  existing practices. A presentation of the state-of-the art developments in the area of threat intelligence is  also undertaken. Finally, we study how we can adapt best security protection practices towards a more agile  management of security controls.  All the collected sources are written in English, and all the referenced web resources were last accessed in  November 2016.  1.5 Structure of this Study  The structure of this document is as follows: in chapter 2 we provide the ad-hoc and sensor networking for  M2M communications basics and present the architecture; in chapter 3 we illustrate the asset taxonomy for  ad-hoc and sensor networks in M2M communications, and present the use cases that are analysed in the  current study; in chapter 4 we identify threats against ad-hoc and sensor networks, and in chapter 5 we map  these threats to the assets; in chapter 6 we consider which threat agents are more relevant to ad-hoc and  sensor networks attacks; in chapter 7 we present the vulnerabilities and risks in ad-hoc and sensor networks;  in chapter 8 we present a set of recommendations and good practices for ad-hoc and sensor networks; in  chapter 9 we provide the gap analysis, and finally in chapter 10 we conclude the study.  In addition, we have also included two annexes at the end of this document. Annex A contains the ad-hoc  and sensor network assets matrix for specific use cases, while Annex B contains the ad-hoc and Sensor  Networks’ Full Threat Taxonomy.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  12  2. Ad-hoc and sensor networking architecture  The term M2M is used to describe technologies that allow the communication between devices with no or  limited human intervention11. The M2M communication requires wired or wireless connection between the  nodes. In the case of Wireless ad-hoc networks, the M2M communication is wireless. M2M mainly focuses  on the machine-type-communication (MTC), where the devices are communicating end-to-end. The key  components of the M2M models are field-deployed wireless devices with embedded sensors or wireless  communication networks with radio-frequency identification (RFID) features.  Wireless ad-hoc networks for M2M communications, also known as WANETs, can be classified in three types,  based on their application12:  Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) use a mesh topology consisting of radio nodes. The nodes are the mesh  client, and the mesh routers or the mesh gateways. In WMN the mesh clients, often laptops, cell phones  etc., behave both as hosts and routers for the network. This way each client contributes to the range  expansion of the network. Most WMN implementations are found in harsh environments or in situations  like field operations of military forces, satellite communications inside a constellation, public transportation  monitoring or real time telemetry on car races. Likewise, they are also deployed in broadband home  networking, community and municipality networking13.  A Mobile ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an “on demand” contacted network, mainly between mobile devices  such as smartphones and tablets. Each node behaves like a router, forwarding any traffic unrelated to its  own use. The fact that nodes move independently of each other makes this type of network unreliable and  of a constant changing topology. Some more specific implementations of MANET include the military ad-hoc  networking between soldiers in the field, vehicles and headquarters, ship-to-ship ad-hoc mobile  communication, Personal Area Networks (PAN)14 etc.  A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)15 is a network of smart sensor nodes. A smart sensor node is a device  equipped with a processor, a memory, a wireless network interface, and one or more sensors and actuators.  The sensors give the device the ability of monitoring several physical or environmental conditions. The  memory is limited to processing aid, thus, all the data acquired by the node are transmitted wirelessly to a  base station for storage and further processing. Also via WSN the base-station or any other node can send  data back to one sensor node; e.g. a command for the actuator. Various applications of WSNs have emerged  in several fields, such as in healthcare, military, manufacturing and industrial/public systems, environment  and smart homes as shown in Figure 2.  11 Mehmood, Y., Görg, C., Muehleisen, M., Timm-Giel, A.

CPS is an evolution of M2M16,17 in  intelligent information processing and an important form of IoT18. The respective CPS applications are going  to benefit from massive wireless networks and IoT based on the information they collect from the  surrounding environment.

This model is composed of different  domains, each of them having its own characteristics, assets, threats and vulnerabilities, existing cyber  threats, trends, security challenges, associated risks and required countermeasures related to ad-hoc and  sensors networks, with a special approach to the M2M communications architectural model.  The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI)20 considers an M2M network as a three-part  structure that includes the:  1. M2M Device domain (usually embedded)  2. M2M Network domain (connection between devices, sensors and gateways, network to network  connection)  3. Application domain (data manipulation and usage by specific business-applications)  In the current study, we consider two additional domains to address the operational challenges as well as  the products and the business processes automation and workflows, namely the.  1.

Product/business processes domain (e.g. healthcare, transportation)  These five elements form different interlinked domains21, facilitate the data processing by various  application services and achieve full interoperability of network and services11. The full-picture of the five  elements is depicted in Figure 4.  In the Device domain, M2M devices constitute several ad-hoc and sensor network nodes for data forwarding.  These devices are equipped with specific sensing technologies for real-time monitoring to take the  appropriate transmission decisions to the gateway (i.e. single-hop or multi-hop transmission). The M2M  gateway acts as the entrance to another network and collects the packets from the M2M nodes via the M2M  network. This network furnishes a connection between all kinds of intelligent devices (or sensors) and  gateways. In the Network domain, communication networks achieve connections and transmit the sensory  data between gateways and applications.  Various application services are used by the specific business-processing engines in the Application domain.  These services are responsible for storing the data and for providing the data to the M2M applications for  management.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  16  3. Ad-hoc and sensor assets identification  Anything of value can be considered as an asset. Assets could be abstract assets (like processes or  reputation), virtual assets (data for instance), physical assets (cables, a piece of equipment), human  resources, money, etc23. In this study, we focus on the ETSI taxonomy20 and the aforementioned M2M  architecture (Figure 4). We analyze the assets related in the area of specific use cases, as there is a very large  number of interconnected devices, and a significant amount of asset types in the ad-hoc wireless and sensor  networking for M2M communications sector. Conclusively, the approach presented should not be  considered as exhaustive, but rather an analysis of assets in different business cases and diverse  perspectives.  In the Device domain, we capture these devices which are capable for data processing, while in the Network  domain, we study the assets that enable the communication between the applications. We also include the  operational aspects and the business process modeling in order to combine classical functions and processes  with ad-hoc and sensor networking extensions, and capabilities. Data exchange, control systems,  monitoring, and metering applications can be part of several business processes that enable the  standardization, and the interoperability of the implementations of M2M solutions.  3.1 Asset taxonomy  The ad-hoc and sensor network assets are identified and classified based on the building blocks of the  following domains:  1. Application domain  a. Data  b. Critical applications  c. eHealth  d. Cloud-based applications  2. Device domain  a. Car/vehicles  b. Mobile devices  c. RFID tags  d. RFID readers  e. Radars  f.

As presented in  Chapter 2, we extend the model including the Operational domain and the Product/business processes  domain. Based on this categorization, the valuable ad-hoc and wireless sensor network assets are listed  below. A full list of these assets is shown in Figure 5.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  18  Figure 5 Assets Taxonomy  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  19  3.2.1 Application domain  The Application domain involves M2M and client applications. It is the middleware layer between the end- user and the data provided by the M2M Device domain, after being processed by various application  services. The assets of this domain are described below, however is needed to mention that applications  listed in this domain are not exhaustive and we are going only to cover certain interesting application areas.  a. Data  In this domain, the data collected from devices is stored, managed and represented via applications or web  interfaces to user. The data can be used for information only, statistical analysis, and control capabilities.  b. Critical applications  Critical applications are special-purpose applications, combining information and data from diverse sources  (i.e. sensors, devices, internet, and databases).  c. eHealth  In a Mobile Healthcare Network (MHN)24 the data combination from wearables, smartphones and vitals  monitoring equipment can provide to the individual or the physician the whole picture of a health case, and  the Personal Health Record (PHR)25. An essential part of an MHN is the eHealth applications that store,  represent and process the collected data to produce statistics. In the need of storing PHRs, a Private  Healthcare Information (PHI) database is used with special concerns in privacy and data protection.  Representation interfaces are the eHealth portals, web-based or mobile applications.  d. Cloud-based applications  The integration of sensor networks and cloud computing26 is motivated by the processing and storage  capabilities of the cloud. This sensor-cloud sensing-as-a-service (SSaaS) leads to the ability of having multiple  applications accessing the sensor data at the same time. Additionally, the sensor-cloud model improves the  sensor’s resources’ utilization, and the sensor management and provides the environment for developing  software interfaces between sensors and the cyber or real world.  Furthermore, mobile computing applications accommodate an increasing effort to assist the sensor  networking ecosystem. On these grounds, recent technology advances in mobile cloud applications include  the Open Mobile Alliance’s (OMA) Smartcard Web Server27, which is literally coupled with a mobile device  (e.g. Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card) that connects directly with the Carrier to push applications to  mobile phones. Another example is TokTok, a technology that allows access to cloud-based services like  Gmail and Google Calendar by voice, using the mobile phone device28.  24 Zhang, K., Yang, K., Liang, X., Su, Z., Shen, X. and Luo, H.H.

The M2M Device domain, as the term implies, is the group of devices capable of replying to data  requests or transmitting this data autonomously. The connectivity between M2M devices and M2M  Gateways is the M2M Area Network. The following subsections present the most common assets in the  Device domain.  a. Cars and vehicles  The Vehicular ad-hoc Networks29 (VANETs) are a subclass of the Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). The  hardware asset of a VANET is mainly the on-board equipment installed in vehicles, which provides them with  the means to communicate with other vehicles (Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication - V2V) or with the  network infrastructure (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure - V2I and Infrastructure-to-Vehicle - I2V). Some VANET  hardware assets30 are presented below:  Event Data Recorder (EDR): records transmissions and receives messages and all the events that occurred  in the vehicle environment during a trip  Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver: communicates the geographic location, the speed, the direction  of the movement and the node acceleration at specified time intervals  Radars and sensors:  used to detect obstacles in the vehicle environment  Omnidirectional antenna:  used to access wireless channels  Electronic License Plate (ELP):  provides an ID number used by the police or any other authority  b. Mobile device  A mobile device connects to the area network utilizing the built-in sensors (camera, gyroscope,  thermometer, GPS, etc.), the embedded interfaces (GSM antenna, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.), and the  Personalized Portable Devices (PPDs).  c. RFID tags  In the Device domain, the RFID systems37 include tags, readers and the RFID middleware. RFID tags are the  small labels attached on objects, animals or people to embed some information on them or to make them  identifiable among others. An RFID tag circuit consists of a control unit and an antenna.  d. RFID readers  An RFID reader is a device or receiver often embedded in other common devices, (i.e. smartphones) that can  get the information of a tag when it is within range. The software that ensures the communication between  the reader and a database storing system is called RFID middleware. The latter filters, processes and sends  the collected data from the reader to the database and provides an interface to enable data access for  external applications.  e. Radars  29 Aswad, R. and Abdala, M. (2016). Performance Enhancement of VANET Routing Protocols. Journal of  Telecommunications, 32(1), pp.5-10.  30 Wei, C., Jianding, Y. and Xiangjun, L. (2012). The design of electronic license plate recognition terminal system based  on nRF24LE1. 5th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design (ISCID). 28-29 Oct, Hangzhou,  China, pp.127-129.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  21  A micro-power Impulse Radar (MIR63,31) is applicable in many fields as a motion detector or range finder.  Radars are widely used in the military for asset protection, in rescue applications, in vehicle automation  (parking assistance, cruise control, etc.), in home security systems (keyless locks, automatic doors, etc.) and  in manufacturing field (industrial automation).  f. Transmission nodes  In a clustered architecture, sensor nodes are grouped into clusters where each cluster has elected a node as  Cluster Head (CH)32. This node is the one that transmits all the cluster nodes’ data to the base station. This  mitigates energy consumption, traffic congestion and data collisions into the network.  g. Interconnection points  According the ETSI M2M architecture, an interconnection point is the gateway between the devices and the  communication network, which is also referred in the architecture as an M2M Gateway. The interconnection  point manages the packets and provides efficient paths for transmitting these packets to the remote back- end server via the Network domain.  h. Support systems  Due to the complexity and the high volumes of traffic in ad-hoc and sensor networks, there is an emerging  need for the appropriate support systems in a sustainable, converged, integrated and operational way.  Business Support systems (BSS) is a collective term for the set of software solutions used by  telecommunication providers to run their business operations. The term includes software for billing and  charging, customer management, product design and management, sales and marketing, and order and  order activation. BSS is also an operational asset of the networks in question.  i. Wearables  A wearable33 can comfortably be worn or carried by an individual all day long and monitor several biometrics  like body temperature, blood pressure, diabetes levels, transpiration, heart beat rate, etc. Generally, the  wearable technology has some form of communication capability and allows the wearer to access the  information in real time. Data-input capabilities feature the wearable devices, same as the local storage.  Examples of wearable devices include watches, glasses, contact lenses, e-textiles and smart fabrics,  headbands, beanies and caps, jewellery such as rings, bracelets, and hearing aid-like devices that are  designed to look like earrings.  j. Indoor positioning systems  The indoor positioning systems (IPS) provide the capability to identify the location of an object or a person  inside a building using radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals, or other sensory information.  k. CE devices  The Consumer Electronic devices (DVDs, cameras, TV sets, PVR, game consoles, etc.) most commonly use  Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication signals and are part of the Home Automation system.  31 Azevedo, S. and McEwan, T.E.

The main part of the M2M Network  domain is the communication between the M2M Gateway(s) and the M2M Application domain. The  communication is performed either over wired networks (e.g., xDSL and PLC) or wireless networks (e.g., 3G  cellular, Wi-Fi and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access - WiMAX). The following list of assets is  not exhaustive and includes some of the most common assets in this domain.  a. Communication protocols  The communication protocol is a key-component in the development of ad-hoc and sensor networks, and is  often susceptible to various threats and attacks. The communication protocol may have various security  vulnerabilities, faults in the code, weak responses, and insecure transport and network layer services.  b. Cooling Systems  Energy efficient and securely operated cooling systems ensure the availability and the proper operations of  ad-hoc and sensor networks.  c. Power Supplies  In general, the power supply systems in routers, switches, servers and computers are critical network assets,  which are extremely vulnerable to physical attacks or failures.  d. Mobile user and location registers  The mobile user and location registers are used to determine the geographic region, and to inform the nodes  about the latest positional information.  e. Radio  Since most ad-hoc and sensor networks are based on wireless communications the radio itself is the  medium, hence radio is an asset in Network domain.  f. PKI  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a state-of-the-art mechanism in confidentiality (encryption) and  authentication for almost every ad-hoc and sensor network application and communication.  g. Appliance controls  Because of recent advancements in ad-hoc and sensor networks, the users can now easily monitor the  services and control remotely the appliances.  h. Addressing servers  The registration and address assignment is important in ad-hoc and sensor networks. They also affect other  services and operations, such as routing. An efficient and resilient addressing solution should be employed.  i. Mobile switches  The telecommunication provider in most cases is a cellular network provider. The system of the provider  consists of mobile user and location registers, mobile base stations, controllers, etc.  j. PSTN switches  The infrastructure networks usually rely on the core network components and may be built from PSTN  backbone switches.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  23  k. Physical security and control systems  Physical security is often underestimated and overlooked in the case of ad-hoc and sensor networks. An  appropriate plan with the necessary control systems is vital to avoid compromising the sensors in the  network.  l. Routers and switches  This group of assets is the core of Network domain. The routers, the DSLAMs, the Session Border Controllers  (SBCs), and the network switches form the data grid over which the Devices Domain and the Application  domain interconnect.  m. Mobile base stations and controllers  The Mobile base stations and controllers’ topology affects the routing in ad-hoc and sensor networks, and  the performance in sensory data exchange. Most of the applications can benefit from the topology of the  sensor nodes and the data routing to the other sensor nodes, an external base station, or a controller.  n. Servers  The server system that assists the operation of network connectivity is another asset in the Network domain.  Important services included in this domain are addressing and DNS naming, private key identification for  devices or users, monitoring and administration of network traffic, etc.  o. WBSNs / WBANs  The Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) or the Body Area Networks (WBANs) are emerging wireless  networks of wearable computing devices. In general, this type of networks has interest in applications, such  as ehealth, remote measuring of health information, assisting the patients and elderly, home automations,  and monitoring human-body changes.  3.2.4 Operational domain  Automating operations, which until recently were manipulated by people, may ensure effectiveness in  meeting customer requirements using as few resources as necessary. Some typical examples of the assets  involved in this domain are listed below.  a. Physical security  The physical security of monitoring and safeguarding access of areas/zones, objects, or people is an  operation of ad-hoc and sensor networks. Typical examples include alarm systems, video and camera  surveillance applications, etc.  b. Control systems  The control systems that give access in buildings, houses or specific areas are assets of ad-hoc and sensor  networks operations. One case is the use of smart grid to facilitate the development of appliance control  systems. These systems consist34 of energy storage devices, transmission cables, smart substations and  transformers, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Home Area Networks (HANs). In general, these  systems are utilized as Home Automation systems (e.g. Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning -HVAC),  building or campus automation systems, etc.  34 Syal, M.M. and Ofei-Amoh, K. (2013). Smart-grid technologies in housing. Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development  and Research, 15(2), pp.283-288.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  24  c. Utilities  These networks may provide automation solutions in cases of measurement, provisioning and billing of  water, electricity, oil, heat, etc.  In the following sections, we analyse the attributes and characteristics of several use case types in the  abovementioned domains to identify the respective assets. The mapping between these use cases and the  assets is also summarized in Annex A.  3.2.5 Product/Business processes domain  Ad-hoc and sensor networks may provide automation solutions for many areas of business organization and  operation. Some of the assets in this domain are listed below.  a. Supply and provisioning  This is a high value area for a product-making company and needs to be accomplished in high speed and  precision. Sensors and actuators are used to automate processes like freight supply, product packaging etc.  Additionally, software in the application domain (e.g. Business Support systems - BSS) provides monitoring  and managing abilities to the company’s human resources. The vending machines are also common in this  area.  b. Manufacturing  In a modern manufacturing environment, the manufacturing systems heavily utilize ad-hoc and sensor  network operations to improve the quality of service, manage the manufacturing resources efficiently, and  achieve near zero down time operations.  c. Healthcare  In healthcare, various ad-hoc and sensor networks applications are widely used for monitoring and data  archiving. These applications should pay great attention to security, due to the data sensitivity and privacy  issues. Sensors are often integrated and embedded with health monitoring devices providing real-time or  batch-driven data.  d. Transportation  The fleet management issue is important for the business and affects the efficiency of the product  distribution, the product cost and the business economics in general. By automating and monitoring the  fleet, the emissions, road safety and toll payment, and the business profit are in-all eventually better  controlled.  e. Home automation  Recently, the use of ad-hoc and sensor networks in home automation has gained increased attention and  several solutions have evolved, such as remote monitoring of electricity, adjusting the water supply,  controlling the gas consumption, and managing sensor equipped appliances.  3.3 Use case types  By collecting the information, the ad-hoc and sensor networks for M2M communications threats can be  classified, including information on risks, opportunities, threat agents, impact, vulnerabilities, etc. The use  cases that have been analysed and studied are based on the most common areas of sensor networks and  interest. Due to the large heterogeneity in the type of the devices, their capabilities (i.e. communication,  computational), the network domains, and the applications, we need to assess the most representative  environments. Several small and inexpensive portable devices can be used for wireless sensor network  applications for both military and civilian use. These sensor networks can be used to transfer the captured  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  25  information to the destination by detecting any available environmental change. For instance, a civilian  application can include some type of habitat monitoring, health monitoring and home automation, while  the military applications could be used for tracking the enemies and improved efficiency.  We analyse five use cases which are listed below:  1. Ultra-wideband (UWB) communication and applications35  2. RFID applications and protocols  3. Mobile cloud computing and mobile social networking  4. Software-defined ad-hoc, and sensor networks  5. Body networks and eHealth  Concerning the UWB transmission technology36, there have been considerable advancements and  innovations recently. UWB includes features35 that could be exploited in ad-hoc networks37. With respect to  RFID applications and protocols, a typical example and common practice used in several business cases,  products and web-sites is the smart tagging of things. Various forms of contactless communications and  technologies can be utilized, such as Near-Field Communication (NFC), Quick-Response (QR) codes, and  Bluetooth.  Mobile and cloud computing (MCC) is emerging rapidly, providing various technological, research and  business opportunities. MCC technology refers to the mobile devices, mobile computing interfaces, mobile  operators and cloud service providers that deliver increased computational resources, capabilities and  functionalities to the mobile users. MCC involves mobile communications, mobile hardware, mobile  software, cloud and network technologies for utilizing different services, and routing and packet forwarding  in heterogeneous and distributed environments.  Software-defined ad-hoc wireless, and sensor networks may include several nodes spread across the area.  New nodes may join/leave the networks, and can participate in data processing and forwarding. Based on  the capabilities of the nodes, they can provide different communication services (i.e. security, data  retention) and speeds. Finally, body networks and eHealth information sharing technologies are used  increasingly and extensively to provide or access the data of the objects (i.e. patients, home & elderly care  centre monitoring for chronic and elderly patients). The characteristics of these uses cases are presented in  the following tables.  35 Zhuang, W., Shen, X. and Bi, Q. (2003). Ultra-wideband wireless communications.

Threats Taxonomy  Threat taxonomy is a classification of threat types and threat groups at various levels of detail. The purpose  of such a taxonomy is to establish a point of reference for the encountered threats, while providing a  possibility to shuffle, arrange, amend and detail threat definitions. Therefore, a threat taxonomy is dynamic  and should be used to maintain a consistent view on threats based on the collected information.  The current threat mind map (Figure 6) is based on the ENISA Threat Taxonomy70, which has collected and  combined numerous threats from various sources into a unified and united threat catalogue. During the  ENISA Threat classification exercise, several other existing threat catalogues were analysed to consolidate  the security and risk management information.  In the current study, we have also considered threats in the fields of operational and product/business  processes domains to extend the ENISA’s work which focused in physical threats, information security, and  cyber-space areas  A detailed presentation of the threats taxonomy in ad-hoc wireless and sensor networking is provided in  Annex B.  70 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Mapping Threats to Assets  According to the ENISA Glossary71, a threat is “any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely  impact an asset through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of  service”.  Based on the identified assets, a taxonomy of relevant threats impeding the ad-hoc sensor networks or at  least significant parts is developed.  Since this study focuses on information security, the presented threat taxonomy mainly covers cyber security  threats. However, for a faultless operation, physical assets are also required and, therefore, several specific  non-IT threats are assumed.  A full taxonomy map of ad-hoc and sensor network threats is shown in Annex B. The taxonomy of threats is  based on the first and second level categorization suggested by the ENISA Threat Taxonomy 2013-201570. In  the following sections, a short description of the most popular threats is presented.  5.1 Threat Group: Unintentional damage / loss of information or IT assets  The following group of threats refers to those damages or loss of information caused by human errors in the  administration of systems or misconfiguration of systems. Additionally, these damages may be caused by an  unintentional intervention or by the actual loss of devices or of part of them.  5.1.1 Threat: Inadequate design and planning improper adaptation  The scope of planning and designing sensor networks is the better area coverage in a way that permits the  unblocked access between the end users (e.g. an application, a business process) and the primary data which  are collected from the monitored or controlled area72. Any error or lack of consideration in the design could  cause low availability or downtime and resource consumption.  Ad-hoc networks constantly change architecture, due to the node mobility. Their communication basis is the  transmission between neighbouring nodes73. The lack of proper design could lead to network instability and  resource over-consumption in every change of the number of participants (nodes).  The fact that the ad-hoc and sensor network assets have limited or no computational abilities and low  resources is one factor of their behaviour. Another factor is that the environment or the area targeted to be  monitored in each case, could be hostile, open to unattended or unauthorized access, constantly changing  (due to mobility) and geographically wide28 an inadequate design could result to the improper or insufficient  area coverage, to assets’ miscommunication or to assets’ resource exhaustion, trying to overcome design  problems.  71 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 90(1), pp.67-76.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  37  The data collected and transmitted in these networks are of high value and sensitivity (e.g. Private  Healthcare Information - PHI). However, the low computational power of assets makes it difficult or  impossible to protect the data and the data transmission itself. A method of data protection through  encryption and decryption, though affective, is highly demanding in computing resources. An inadequate  design of how this problem will be overcome may permit information to be compromised74.  Further to the above, the lack of planning or the existence of a design error may allow the existence of  software (Applications) that do not take under consideration the devices power and computing limitations28  with software update (i.e. cars and other devices).  Assets targeted by this threat group are those from the Device Domain and the asset Data in the Application  Domain.  5.1.2 Threat: Using information from an unreliable source  Any system or device with computational power and an operating system (OS) is vulnerable to OS exploits.  This threat occurs mainly due to the vulnerable versions of preinstalled software used in corporate  environments. In most cases, third-party applications can be installed and activated in the devices, posing  potential risks to the enterprise. These applications may hide various software faults, security bugs,  vulnerabilities, and coding errors that can be exploited to an adversary under certain conditions. This is an  unintentional threat, because the software and the applications risks could exist by design.  As reported in the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Report75, the cybercrime events show an increasing  interest in personally identifiable information (PII) and high-value data (e.g. health-records) since 2014.  Besides, in the case of business-critical applications (e.g. billing, e-Health), sensitive and personal may  traverse ad-hoc and sensor networks. Therefore, these networks are susceptible to attacks and malicious  activities.  All the assets in all Domains can be a target for this threat.  5.1.3 Threat: Erroneous use or administration of devices and systems  The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)76 are software elements, which are used by software  developers in their attempt to construct applications or graphical user interfaces. Cloud service providers  utilise APIs to allow access to cloud-based services77. The APIs can be used by several devices and  applications simultaneously for various purposes. However, it is difficult to determine who should or should  not be granted access78. Since an API is a public library, the unauthorized access and nefarious use of the  APIs content cannot be prevented easily. It should be noted that via this access, any data, system or service  of the network becomes vulnerable.  74 Zhou, F.S.X.D.Y. (2016).

All assets in all Domains can be a target for this threat.  5.1.4 Threat: Loss of devices  In ad-hoc and sensor networks, the threat of physically losing devices can affect the stability of the network.  In most cases, the areas that sensor networks are designed to cover are geographically wide. As the risk is  considerably high, this leads to the use of a big number79 of devices to achieve a sufficient coverage of the  area. These areas (e.g. underwater, underground, terrestrial, etc.)80 could also provide open access to  anyone. Moreover, the network’s nodes are mostly devices with small size79; this characteristic makes them  vulnerable to robbery incidents.  Further in ad-hoc networks, the covered area is undetermined and may change in real-time81. The number  of devices is also changing constantly. In addition to the above, the nodes usually are small devices (e.g.  smartphone, smart-card, RFID, etc.), which are easy to be stolen containing sensitive or personal  information.  These characteristics make the ad-hoc and sensor networks and, more specifically, the assets in the Device  Domain vulnerable to Loss of Devices threat.  5.1.5 Threat: Damage caused by a third party  A malware is a hostile fragment of programming code that targets sensitive information inside a system. For  instance, the term information-stealing mobile malware describes the malware which is remotely accessing  a system and is focused in gathering information when installed with the main purpose of targeted  advertisement.  Data leakage82 is the illegitimate outcome produced by a third-party application which is focused on  gathering personal information due to the existence of critical vulnerabilities or integrated backdoors on the  source code of the applications.

The recovery and restoration of the services take the  longest time; in 2014 the recovery time lasted 81 hours85, while in 2013 it was more than 50 hours84. Taking  into consideration the great exposure to the numerous users and habitants, this depicts that disasters not  only last long, but also, they are the most difficult to manage.  Nowadays, we witness an increased number of interlinked sensors, integrated into the infrastructure and  buildings, and incorporated in various systems and services. These sensors can be monitored and controlled  by various means (i.e. smart phones, workstations over the internet), and they reveal behavioural patterns  of the monitored objects86. Thus, it is critical to ensure the data integrity and the service operations of WSNs  against any natural or environmental disaster. In the ad-hoc wireless and sensor networks, the nodes in the  infrastructure are often fixed, and in several cases WSNs are utilized in monitoring and security services (i.e.  monitor human activities and the environment like climate control, gather data for medical diagnostics,  transport critical-mission data and confidential measurements, provide the location information to the  corresponding receiver). Still, the WSNs are also used by weather, emergency response and disaster  management systems for immediate inference upon network and service disruptions87. The sensory  measurements are collected on a regular basis by spatially dispersed networks distributed over a certain  region. Thus, WSNs can enhance the surveillance and awareness of any status changes in disaster  responses88, and prevent massive destructions from natural or environmental disasters.  Nevertheless, the WSNs are susceptible to many natural or environmental disasters, as any other IT  component or network. They are vulnerable to the power failures and cuts, communication problems and  delays, jamming and channel errors, hardware problems, physical damage, insecure routing, and failures in  data aggregation.  Assessing the impact of natural and environmental disasters is of paramount importance and will facilitate  to identify the factors and methods that can contribute to reduce WSNs damage and service disruptions  after natural disasters occur.  Assets targeted by this threat include the assets from the Device domain, the Network domain and the  assets Control Systems, Physical Security, Vending Machines and Road Safety.  84 Karsberg, C., Skouloudi, C. and Dekker, D.

These issues are highly associated  with the eHealth and pHealth sensors’ attack surface. The ad-hoc and wireless network sensors may  encounter harsh and anomalous physiological conditions in the remote monitoring, which require the  continuous supervision to provide intensive care. The operations and the concentration of data by the  medical sensors such as in the case of the cardio net system89, should be managed by the doctors and  nursery. Upon receiving the data, the sensors dispatch the data to the back-end server for processing by  using a short-range wireless network. However, during this process, the WBANs are threatened mainly by  exhausting attacks, which are namely: (a) the collision attacks, (b) the denial of sleep attacks and (c) the  selfish attacks 90.  In the field of Mobile Healthcare Networks (MHNs), where wearable sensor devices communicate based on  the device-to-device (D2D) concept, the protection of the personal data plays a significant role. Hence, if the  personal data (e.g. patient’s daily health data) is processed in the Cloud, it should be protected from being  accessed by unauthorized parties, e.g. insurance company or a mobile intruder who can disseminate health  records through an Online Social Network. By that means, the Quality of Privacy (QoP) is of great  importance91.  Sensitive banking information can be maliciously retrieved in the case of near field communication (NFC)  cards. The attacker can utilize NFC radio waves and then access to data stored on the victim’s card92.  Furthermore, social engineering fraud can also be a way to abuse personal data in ad-hoc or mobile  networks93.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Applications Domain and Device Domain and  the assets Physical Security, Supply and Provisioning and Healthcare.  5.3.2 Threat: Failure to meet contractual requirements  Failure to meet contractual requirements, or break a contractual one could result to security incidents.  89 European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

Stakeholders prone to break the rules are94 (a) the operators (i.e. which have a direct link with  physical infrastructure) and (b) the digital service providers (which have a cross border nature).  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.4 Threat Group: Outages  Due to the nature of the ad-hoc wireless and sensor networks, specific constraints exist. Apart from the  limited storage capacity and computational costs95, energy consumption is among the critical success factors  and important constraints for ad-hoc and sensor networks.  5.4.1 Threat: Internet outage  We should not underestimate the great importance of evidence of internet outage reports and incidents, as  nowadays heavily internet-dependent businesses rely extensively on the Internet services, and, thus, any  Internet outage is likely to hit business operations severely. Even though most businesses have defined the  processes and the countermeasures to respond to internet outages, there are still several complex  dependencies, capacity issues, performance delays, and business continuity risks in the case of internet  failures96. The internet outage can be caused by numerous factors either accidentally or intentionally; human  errors, problematic and erroneous maintenance works, BGP misconfiguration and massive route leaks97,  failed international cable affecting mobile and data domestic operations, and cyberspace dangers and  cyberattacks98,99 result in Internet blackouts or brownouts. Not only the service disruptions damage the  brand of the service provider, but they also create several business implications and frustration to the  users100.  94 Weber, R. and Studer, E. (2016).

This results in service outage and disruptions, as no further  legitimate request can receive any further resource. By injecting invalid requests, the resources are  exhausted and this raises denial of service attacks.  A common example of network outage is the outage of cable networks. If the power or network cables are  unprotected, they can be damaged accidentally or intentionally. Often, the cables are pulled out by the staff  as they stumble over them, unauthorized personnel (i.e. cleaning services) unplug the cable and plug the  loose end into an empty \"hole\" that seems to fit, or the cable connection is abruptly terminated (i.e. a ship’s  anchor accidentally slices internet cables101). The unavailability and loss of support services essential for  proper operation of the information system and the business processes are often causing disruptions and  outages.  Intermittent problems and outages in a wireless networks environment are also likely due to technical  exploits and vulnerabilities (i.e. IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15 families). In the case of outages of mobile  networks, aside from the communication problems with the networks (i.e. 3G, GSM, LTE, satellite links),  several operational and business issues can arise that result in service disruptions and outages. Insolvency,  financial instabilities, subcontractor’s issues, outsourcing implications, difficulties in contractual  arrangements are few typical reasons that the service providers may fail to deliver the expected quality of  the services and lead to impairments. Additionally, the business processes may fail because of misalignment  and inappropriate communication with the service provider, or even because of inadequately documented  procedures102.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain, and Product/business processes Domain.  5.4.3 Threat: Loss of support services  Another typical example of outage is the unavailability of the necessary support services, which are required  for the proper operation of the networks and the systems.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain, and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5 Threat Group: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  The fact that the base of ad-hoc and sensor networks is a group of devices with low or no data storage and  low power autonomy makes these networks vulnerable to nefarious activity attacks. This group of attacks  includes intentionally created threats aiming at the infrastructure.  101Fortin, J. (2012). East African Internet Cables Damaged by Ship’s Anchor Near Mombasa.

Sensor networks are met in critical deployment  environments, like healthcare systems. Thus, DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks are of great  importance to be mitigated by timely detecting them103. In ambient assisted living (AAL)104, especially in  eHealth environments, the multi-hop nature of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is vulnerable against  unwanted rerouted traffic. Therefore, such a DoS attack situation (e.g. hello flooding) can be compromised  by utilizing resilient routing protocols. Although there are several different characteristics105 between WSNs  and MANETs and several specific attacks targeted at each type of these networks106, they are both  susceptible to malicious node and routing attacks. For instance, in a flooding attack, the attacker tries to  drain its victim’s resources by remotely sending numerous connection establishment requests. In a cloud- based system, which could be a cornerstone component of an IoT solution, this kind of attack severely affects  the Autonomic Manager, which is the component in charge of controlling and self-tuning the necessary  changes in the system’s life cycle107.  However, many ambiguities exist in how we can theoretically define a DoS attack in ad-hoc and sensor  networks. Nevertheless, emerging research work108 has illustrated formal methods that evidently define  such an attack situation.  DoS attacks are mainly caused by109: (a) producing varied effects on different OSI levels on the target (i.e.  Slowloris110), (b) amplification / reflection techniques (i.e. DNS and NTP amplification, reflection change) and  (c) flooding mechanisms (e.g. ping of death), (d) protocol exploit attacks (e.g. TCP SYN attacks) and (e)  malformed packet attacks (e.g. land attack and fragmented packet attacks)111. For example, the resource  starvation attack can be achieved by sending many packets that require authentication resulting in initiating  103 Abbas, H., Latif, R., Latif, S. and Masood, A. (2016).

When malicious nodes are connected to the internal  network, they can launch different types of attacks, such as routing poisoning or packet dropping. Based on  the characteristics of the attacks, they can be distinguished as goal-oriented attacks, performer-oriented  attacks and layer-oriented attacks113. Concerning the performer-oriented attacks, the inside attackers can  perform black hole and grey hole attacks114,115. During a black-hole attack, all the network traffic is  redirected, which results in data packet loss. In the case of a grey hole attack, there is a selective forwarding  of data packets. These types of attacks usually happen in mesh networks.  Sensor networks are prone to jamming mechanisms, which means that an adversary may inject unwanted  signals into the communication channel. These signals can entirely engage the channel so that authentic  communications cannot take place or the packets in transmission be corrupted 116. In a DoS attack incident  using jamming techniques, energy issues exist regarding the attacker counterpart that may run out of  energy, when its energy budget is limited, and may also result in a node failure. In this vein, state-of-the-art  ongoing works have aimed at how the attacker can save energy by utilizing an estimation on whether to jam  the channel to degrade the ability of the intrusion detection117.  As the technology shift brings out new advances in ad-hoc networking, mobile devices and sensors can  dominate the telecommunication market in the not-so-distant future. Moving towards a mobile and cloud  networking convergence, multiple security issues arise while mobile-based agents lack a shared  language/ontology and thus they are prone to DoS attacks by classifying their nature118.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5.2 Threat: Malicious code / software / activity  Ad-hoc and sensor networks should be monitored for environmental parameters, structural integrity of the  built environment and usage of urban spaces, services and utilities. However, the sensors can be  compromised through malicious injected code or by exploiting their physical interface. An attacker may seek  to elicit an inappropriate system response, (e.g. triggering an overload on a power grid and lead to partial  shutdown) or to mask a desired system response (e.g. silencing an intrusion alarm)119.  Due to the potential vulnerabilities of the actuators and sensors, it is crucial to study and analyse the  malicious code (i.e. malware) propagation within the networks. For propagation analysis purposes, recent  112 Basicevic, I., Ocovaj, S. and Popovic, M. (2015). Evaluation of entropy-based detection of outbound denial-of-service  attacks in edge networks.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  45  research has introduced mathematical models in a per-device (i.e. autonomous) manner120. Furthermore,  modern malware is characterized by sophisticated obfuscation techniques, and recent research approaches  have led to novel detection and classification techniques121.  The concept of Hardware Trojan (HWT) emerges in wireless sensor networks. A HWT is a deliberate  modification of the hardware during the fabrication process and can be designed to quietly monitor, to  actively send out sensitive information, or to make the infected host device unusable122. Within the IoT  ecosystem, the sensor nodes can be deployed in a distributed network to mutually acknowledge the  trustworthiness of their sensor neighbour. Under this scheme, we can detect information leakages which  are caused by a HWT123.  Ad-hoc networks may employ mobile devices in a specific purpose, like for gaming, such as in the famous  games Blizzard’s World of Warcraft (WOW) and Linden Research’s Second Life (SL)124. In this case, massive  multiplayer online games (MMOG) can be exposed to malicious activities.  The assets targeted by these threats include asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5.3 Threat: Manipulation of hardware and software  Contrary to the outsiders (i.e. individuals outside the network access perimeter) who are not able to  communicate directly with the network, the insiders have increased access to the resources and privileged  knowledge of the internal network. This insider attack is a growing concern for most implementations, as  this attack is more difficult to be prevented because of the unknown attack patterns and the variety of the  internal attacks. If an alert for an invalid pattern is received, an extra analysis is required to verify whether  there is a malicious attempt or not.  Some malicious activities are also likely to go undetected125, as they can bypass the authentication and  authorization methods, since they are already connected to the internal network. Rogue access points,  wireless access points that are installed without any prior consent or knowledge, may expose the internal  information to the outside world and could provide illegitimate access to unauthorized users.  The assets targeted by these threats include asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  120 del Rey, A., Hernández Encinas, A., Hernández Guillén, J., Martín Vaquero, J., Queiruga Dios, A. and Rodríguez  Sánchez, G.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  46  5.5.4 Threat: Manipulation of information  WSNs are commonly utilizing a many-to-one communication pattern meaning that various sensors collect  and send data to the single one control centre (i.e. the sink node or the base station). This is the reason why  WSNs are vulnerable to sinkhole attacks. The attacker claims itself as having the shortest path to the base  station and, therefore, it can remotely alter the passing data and by that means to threat the network  operation126.  Among the various models proposed for M2M communications and the IoT by various researchers, Semantic  middleware and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) oriented middleware are based on the Extensible  Mark-up Language (XML) metadata exchange for interoperability, while the SOA and Representational State  Transfer (REST) based systems are more popular in the enterprise environments. Main exploits related to  the above are127: (a) duplication of a device, (b) black hole or sink hole attack (which are also DoS incidents)  in the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy (RPL) Networks, (c) replay attacks, when valid data is  retransmitted or delayed by an adversary to gain illegitimate and unauthorized access, (d) confidentiality  compromise, when the relayed data can be manipulated, (e) active introduction of  network traffic (i.e.  spoofing, impersonation) to send malicious traffic to other nodes, (f) passive monitoring of network traffic  (i.e. sniffing, snooping) in Zigbee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks because of their weak implementation of the  nodes encryption keys (i.e. they are transmitted in clear text). Examples of important issues on the routing  process are the routing table overflow (i.e. transmit false information to the neighbours, flood their tables  and hence deny the real routes) and the routing table poisoning (i.e. advertise a false route with the smallest  hop and the latest sequence number) in the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol128.  The assets targeted by these threats include asset groups Device domain, Network domain and the  Applications domain.  5.5.5 Threat: Remote activity  A paradigm on remote activity includes the Botnet utilization in terms of a network of infected machines,  which is controlled by a remote machine and aims to initiate attacks against more victim machines. In terms  of mobile computing and by leveraging the advantages of M2M communications in masking malicious code  propagation, MobiBots can infect and coordinate these devices in a large-scale manner. For example, a  MobiBot can infect a 96-node network in only few minutes and totally can scale up to 10,000-node  networks126.  For instance, when it comes to embedded systems in Home Networking, where sensors are a core  component to study, there are specific needs; i.e. connecting to the Internet for firmware updates.  Nowadays, remote firmware updates do not comply to the myth of ultimate security as they are responsible  for distributing malicious content through the Internet. Another example of malicious firmware is the control  on vehicles and their accelerator. Furthermore, another firmware rootkit is responsible for maliciously  manipulating network packets by controlling the CPU of the network interface card (NIC)129.  126 Han, G., Li, X., Jiang, J., Shu, L. and Lloret, J.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  47  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, Network Domain, Operational  Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5.6 Threat: Targeted attacks  Mobile participatory sensing130 takes advantage of the sensing resources available in mobile phones for an  in-depth analysis of about the participating individuals and their environment. In this ad-hoc networking  concept, when downloading the tasks from the application server or reporting sensor readings to the server,  the participant’s privacy information131 (e.g. identity and location) can be revealed even if a pseudonym is  used. For example, a reverse look-up address search may reveal their name, as participants typically  commute between their domicile and workplace. Furthermore, the current participants’ location can also  be identified based on the collected sensor readings. For example, pictures, audio samples, and pollution  data may include unique features, exposing the participants’ whereabouts.  Targeted attacks also exist in the physical layer of any sensor communication. The Spectrum Sensing Data  Falsification (SSDF) or else the Byzantine attack132 is conducted in pursuit of two objectives: (a) vandalism  and (b) exploitation. The first objective refers to interference to the primary systems by means of the  malicious users reporting channel vacancy which indicates that the channel is busy. Thus, the sensing data  induce the dedicated node (i.e. the fusion centre – FC) to allow other sensors to have false access to the  channel. The second objective refers to exclusion of idle channels. Here, the attackers send channel busy  information when their sensing data concludes that the channel is idle.  Likewise, the back off mechanism manipulates the back off time for the case of the medium access control  (MAC) and especially the IEEE 802.11. The back off misbehaviour133, or else back off attack, is unpredictable  in such networks and results in a node which intends to acquire the channel with a higher chance by reducing  its back off (i.e. waiting) time.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain and Network Domain.  5.5.7 Threat: Social Engineering  In the scope of M2M communications, as the core of the IoT ecosystem, which also include humans, social  engineering remains a major security threat to individuals and organizations, and is often launched through  phone (phone fraud) or email (phishing). Recent studies argue that a correlation exists between the  individuals’ intention to resist social engineering and their security actions (i.e. self-reported or observed) in  multiple cultural environments134.  The growing trend towards BYOD (bring your own device) has deteriorated the problem. Ad-hoc networking  and vulnerable mobile applications can be misused to conduct attacks for user-ID spoofing or hijack user  130 Holler, J., Tsiatsis, V., Mulligan, C., Karnouskos, S., Avesand, S. and Boyle, D.

As such, the baiting attack refers to attackers who leave malware-infected storage  media in a location where it is likely to be found by future victims. Another example is phishing by means of  the attempt to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity135. Furthermore, the  waterhole attack refers to compromising a website that is likely to be of interest of the chosen victim135.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain and  Network Domain.  5.5.8 Threat: Unauthorized activities  Stealing the identity within an ad-hoc and sensor network can be achieved by unleashing a Sybil attack136.  Here, the adversaries can create many malicious identities either by forging a new identify or by stealing an  identity from a legitimate node.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset group Device Domain.  5.6 Threat Group: Eavesdropping, Interception and Hijacking  This group includes threats that rely on the alteration/manipulation of the communication link between two  parties. These attacks do not require the installation of additional tools or software on the victims’  infrastructure. Insecure network access is a known threat, when connecting to insecure networks (i.e. public  hot-spots) that are exposed to several attacks due to their openness and public characteristics. Usually, they  are lacking security measures and policy rules, which also facilitate the eavesdropping or malicious  activities137.  5.6.1 Threat: Network Reconnaissance  WSNs are highly distributed ad-hoc networks. Due to specific limitations of their nodes communication  radius, they route their traffic through a base station (BS); or else in a hop-by-hop basis. The selective forward  attack is an example in which the attacker places a malicious sensor node on a path between a data source  and a base station138. Hence, the attacker can identify and process network traffic at its illegitimate  advantage.  Due to the unstable wireless channel that is common in such networks, the packet loss rate is high and varies  from time to time. Hence, it is difficult to distinguish between a malicious drop and normal packet loss.  Recent studies propose alternative data forwarding behaviours of sensor nodes per the deviation of the  monitored against the estimated normal loss139.

The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.6.2 Threat: Interception of information  Spectrum sensing is at the core of operational techniques seen in a wireless network. Interception of  information may occur. The most famous such action is called primary user emulation (PUE). In such an  incident, the attackers may modify the radio transmission frequency to mimic the primary signal (i.e. the  signal by the primary user – PU). Therefore, the secondary users (SU) erroneously identify the attackers as a  PU. The PUE attackers can be classified as142 (a) selfish and malicious (i.e. stealing bandwidth) and (b) static  and mobile (i.e. per their location).  In the mobile computing environment, various techniques for malware detection exist, such as dynamic  program-execution based mechanisms for the Android operating system. Nevertheless, malicious intruders  can easily prevail on them by deploying dump code blocks and API calls143. The latter is accommodated in an  advanced persistent threat (APT), which results in passively and maliciously capturing information from the  network.  In a company or corporation, the interception of information is one of the tools for corporate espionage or  cyber-espionage144. The high skilled personnel employed by companies today tend to use these skills for  their own profit by intercepting and selling inside information or by operating as external agents and trying  to intercept information of opponent companies. In the first case where they intercept within the company,  the existence of ad-hoc access to the company’s Intranet or the transmission of data over the air, makes  cyber-espionage more easy to be successful.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, Network Domain, and  Product/business processes Domain.  5.6.3 Threat: Man in the middle / Session hijacking  Under certain circumstances, a malicious node can enter the network and pretend to be another node. Once  the node joins the network, then spoofing and data interception may occur. In other cases, this type of attack  is known as man-in-the-middle (MiMA), as the nodes can intercept the communication and receive the  information, and relay wrong information between two parties communicating directly. This threat can lead  140 Al-Hamadi, H. and Chen, I. (2015). Adaptive Network Defence Management for Countering Smart Attack and  Selective Capture in Wireless Sensor Networks.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  50  to system instability or to abnormal behaviour due to fake information and even collisions of packets due to  increased transmission requests or intercepted connections145.  Based on recent research146,147, although ad-hoc and sensor networks as well as RFID systems deploy  distance bounding (DB) cryptographic protocols, they still obtain considerable high security mechanisms to  defend against illegitimate actions. DB protocols are vulnerable in mafia fraud147 (or else grandmaster  problem) and terrorist fraud attacks146. In the mafia fraud, an attacker executes a man-in-the-middle attack  between a verifier (i.e. the one who verifies the location of the user) and a user and erroneously informs the  latter about the location of the user node. An instance of this attack is a physically located ATM machine. In  a terrorist fraud, a dishonest user colludes with a “terrorist” attacker in a way that the latter can erroneously  inform the verifier node about the location of the user node.  Another example is the applications hosted by Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) which are described as  a part of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) ecosystem. These networks include a variety of emerging  applications, such as traffic management and control, nearby information services, and real-time  information routing calculations. Such applications, which belong in the superset of Dedicated Short-Range  Communications (DSRC) applications family, can facilitate cooperative collision warnings148 and emergencies  notifications as well as commercial related applications which enable internet access, map navigation and  fuel savings. In more detail, when it comes to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)  communications using the road-side units (RSUs)149,150, major privacy issues could arise under man-in-the- middle attacks. These attacks are feasible because of the unencrypted communication150 between the RSUs  and the vehicles.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, and  the assets eHealth and cloud-based applications.  5.7 Threat Group: Failures / Malfunction  5.7.1 Threat: Failure of devices or systems  Akin to any other computer machinery, sensor nodes suffer from software bugs that potentially end up in  either a temporal out-of-service condition or in a complete failure of these devices. Offline bug fixing and  self-healing are two techniques151 that can be used to detect and deal with these conditions before the  deployment or during runtime.  145 Dong, Z., Espejo, R., Wan, Y. and Zhuang, W.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  51  In addition to the above, a failure of systems can be dramatically harmful not only for the devices they  employ, but also for the potential impact to the human population they accommodate. For instance, the  computer worm named Stuxnet, employed to attack the Natanz nuclear facility located in Iran, exploited the  PLCs in the industrial control systems infrastructure. This incident152,153 highlighted that machinery design  errors and vulnerabilities as well as the human factor154 can even lead to fatal accidents.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, but  also the assets Manufacturing and Control Systems.  5.7.2 Threat: Failure or disruption of communication links  Jamming attacks have been a major problem for ad-hoc and sensor networks and they are increasingly  concerning the military and disaster response state authorities. The jamming device seeks to choose a  location by choosing the same channel the nodes are using, so that the data is blocked or disrupted from  successful transmission. The disruption of communication links is also threatened in an alternative manner  by155 (a) constant jammer (i.e. who continuously transmits randomly), (b) deceptive jammer (i.e. constantly,  but not randomly), (c) random jammer (i.e. randomly and reserving power), (d) reactive jammer (i.e. listen  to the channel and reserve power). Jamming attacks are considerably severe as the jamming signals are156  (a) resistant to collisions, (b) can travel for longer distances and (c) likely to be transmitted in short durations  (e.g. as an ACK frame).  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, and  the asset Radio.  5.7.3 Threat: Malfunction of equipment  Enterprises and organisations also be affected by equipment failure, e.g. air conditioning, heating or cooling  systems, power supplies.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, and  the assets Power Supplies and Cooling Systems.  5.7.4 Threat: Disruption of main supply  Electric power transmission and distribution systems are susceptible to attack generally with little risk to the  attacker, a fact well recognized by saboteurs and terrorists.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain.  5.8 Ad-hoc and sensor network assets exposure to threats  In this section the threat exposure of ad-hoc and sensor network assets is summarized and categorized. The  categorization is based on the assessment of the threats’ impact on an asset or an asset group and this  152 Lindsay, J. (2013). Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Warfare.

Threat Agents  In this chapter, we present a list of threat agents categories. Threat agents or threat sources are the  individuals or groups of people who use the threats and vulnerabilities of a system for their purposes. This  study is based on the ENISA Threat Landscape157 2013’s consolidation of several publications. For each threat  agents’ category, we focus on the characteristics158 emission, location, quantity, motivation, rationality,  mobility and skill. The proposed categories are the following:  Corporations often adopt offensive tactics with the motive of gaining an advantage over competitors. They  usually commit attacks as outsiders. Also, corporations are rational attackers since they consider the ratio  of outcome gain and cost of the attack. The level of sophistication of their attack methods is relevant to the  size and sector of the company.  Cyber criminals’ motivation is financial gain or in many cases the hacking itself, as a skill test or obstacle.  They are highly skilled and this factor may lead to irrational attacks, where the risk is bigger than the attack’s  expected outcome. They can work in local, national or international groups.  Cyber terrorists group involves terrorists that exploit the impacts of cyber-attacks in critical infrastructure  like energy production system, telecommunications, government sites, etc. Their level is lower than the  cyber criminals and they commit more rational attacks. Their motivation is usually politics or religion. They  are considered as outside agents and can also work in groups.  Script kiddies use existing computer scripts or code to hack. They lack the expertise to create their own tools.  Their motivation is the thrill of danger. The attacks committed by them are mostly naïve since they do not  have the background to estimate the outcome/risk ratio or it is indifferent to them.  Online social hackers (hacktivists) are activists that use hacking as a tool. This group is like cyber terrorists.  Their motive is also politics or social matters; their skill level may vary and they may work in groups. They  target critical public infrastructure.  Employees are insiders that may be responsible for unintentional damage due to error or nefarious attacks  in collaboration with outsiders intentionally or to make personal profit. They provide inside information and  make the targeted system extremely vulnerable.  Nation states in the cyberwar and cybercrime have developed extremely sophisticated cyber weapons,  systems with resources and high level experts. These characteristics makes them prominent threat agents.  Natural disasters are not controlled by an adversary group; however, they should be considered as a threat  agent for ad-hoc and sensor networks. Mainly sensor networks are vulnerable to natural disaster since the  network nodes could be in a wide area of rough or open to access environments (i.e. underwater,  underground, flying, spread in a wide terrestrial area, etc.).  157 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Vulnerabilities and Risks in Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks  Ad-hoc and sensor networks deployment is significantly increasing not only due to the increasing volume of  IoT devices, but also due to the industrial and research interest ad-hoc and sensor networks have attracted  since the '80s. “Smart <anything>” (e.g. cities, buildings, vehicles, home appliances, phones etc.) is a big  trend and, hence, these network vulnerabilities have become a major issue among researchers and  practitioners. Thus, publicly available information on ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M  communications security issues widely originates from research, standardisation and industrial activities.  Henceforth, sensors and their significance on the M2M communications paradigm are about to change some  aspects of what can we consider something as vulnerable. These networks are characterized by flexible  architecture, spatial nature, the communication means, and the complexity of the devices. To extract this  information, we focus on standardization organisations like National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU),  on governmental authorities like Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Qatar's National  Centre for Security but also on published research works. More details are presented in the next chapter.  In this chapter, a short description of the vulnerabilities and risks for ad-hoc and sensor networks is provided.  A thorough assessment of the related good practices is presented in the next chapter.  7.1 Ad-hoc and sensor networks vulnerabilities  The ad-hoc and sensor networks akin to any other IT system suffer from emerging threats and obscure  vulnerabilities in every of the five domains, related to confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy and  authenticity159. More specifically, the major vulnerabilities in these networks concern the device security,  the data protection, the communication integrity and availability (for both the protocols and hardware  involved), the business process availability, privacy, and the operation stability. The device security is mostly  handled with the use of authentication methods and the appropriate monitoring tools. The authentication  methods in collaboration with data classification aim to ensure the protection of data. With the proper  management and specialized protocol techniques, the network communication can be secured. The risk  management procedures also lead to the business process availability and operation stability.  The resource exhaustion of devices is a vulnerability of ad-hoc and sensor networks, because of the nature  of these devices (i.e. small devices, with low-level of power independency)160. This can be eliminated with  data classification, appropriate management and simulation/visualization/testing activities.  The use of wireless communication161 in ad-hoc and sensor networks potentially gives rise to certain  vulnerabilities owning to the nature of the communication channel (i.e. open air, water). Besides, the  159 Ashraf, Q. and Habaebi, M. (2015). Autonomic schemes for threat mitigation in Internet of Things.

Another typical example is the access control violation164 that exploits vulnerabilities,  such as unencrypted transmissions caused by specific protocols used for wireless communication between  an access control reader (e.g. RFID reader) and the controller device.  7.2 Ad-hoc and sensor networks risks  Several risks affect the assets and the operations of ad-hoc and sensor networks. Throughout the literature,  it is highlighted that these networks can often be exploited for nefarious activities and eavesdropping attacks  leading to a high data loss risk. Since these networks have a variety of types of physical positioning  (underwater, underground, etc.), the risk of loss of devices in the case of natural or environmental disasters  (earthquake, flood, tornado) is also significant165.  The variety of physical positioning of ad-hoc and sensor networks, the resource constraints of the devices  and the topology of the networks may lead to the leakage of personal or sensitive data. Notably, the privacy  leakage risk behaviours166 in ad-hoc and sensor networks could threaten even human lives.  Overcoming and managing nefarious activities can be accomplished with tighter risk management and  operational controls, and with the availability of specialized tools and techniques that resolve these risks.  Besides, various other risk management techniques (i.e. risk rating, risk matrices) can be adopted to provide  consistency in prioritizing the risks, present the complex risk data, and facilitate the reviews to allocate the  sufficient resources and mitigation methods.  It should be noted risk assessment is an ongoing procedure and the constant monitoring of the network is a  necessity. Therefore, the continuous feedback and risk assessment from the stakeholders will certainly be  an added value at any point of this procedure.  162 Karygiannis, T., Eydt, B., Barber, G., Bunn, L. and Phillips, T.

Gap Analysis  Ad-hoc and sensor networks mainly consist of distributed nodes processing critical, sensitive, mass, and  several other types of data. Moreover, these nodes often form dynamic topologies and incorporate changing  characteristics such as high mobility and fluctuating bandwidth. These characteristics along with the real- time transmission of data streams, the low energy supply, the low processing power, the routing protocols  and the authentication schemes could raise several security concerns.  Various security concerns could also arise regarding the integrated components used in the sensors.  Typically, PLCs can read signals from different sensors, and the integration of sensors with the PLCs in  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems - aiming to optimize the level of production –  should be examined thoroughly considering any security threats and risks. For instance, the electrification  and water supply of cities could be at risk, if we do not consider on a perpetual basis all the appropriate and  effective security countermeasures. In the same context, the integration of ad-hoc and sensor networks in  domestic appliances enables the remote management of houses and offers increased flexibility; however,  there are various security concerns for smart objects and connected devices (i.e. home-automation systems,  smart TVs and refrigerators) threatening the internet interconnection of houses, because of security  vulnerabilities and data privacy issues. In healthcare environments (i.e. hospitals), the fusion of sensors in  clinical operations targeting to monitor the physiological vital signs of patients, leads to critical technical and  legal considerations, such as business and technical restrictions in the implementation, and regulatory  reviews. For example, a patient has the right to know the names of all the employees who may access the  medical records, but on the flip side in the cases of “break-the-glass” and life-critical operations the average  consultation time should be significantly shorter.  The aim of the current gap analysis is to determine the path towards optimizing the countermeasures and  to establish specific target objectives set by the industry, the academic community, and the research work  by the security experts (e.g. Black Hat Conferences) in working out the needs and resources to improve  security and provide better protection. The gap analysis is performed upon all five areas of the M2M  functional Architecture (see Figure 4 M2M Architecture): 1) Application Domain, 2) Device Domain, 3)  Network Domain, 4) Operational Domain, and 5) Product/business processes Domain.  9.1 Gaps on the Device domain  Gap: The sophistication of attacks targeting the communication amongst mobile devices as well as with  backend servers is greater than the level of security that practices offer.  A wide spectrum of attacks targets the weakest component in the M2M architecture which is the  communication amongst the mobile devices of any ad-hoc network. When it comes to mission critical ad- hoc networks which are met in the military area where the lives of individuals depend on them and in  production environments where designs and concealed information are endangered by disclosure, then the  challenge of mitigating vulnerabilities of complex communications is of great importance. For example, the  RFID tags are exposed to certain threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks (see 5.6.3) and tools such as the  Tastic RFID Thief205. The orchestration of the cover-coding method, the press-to-activate switch and the non- revealing identifier format practices (see 8.2, 8.8), mitigate these threats. Thus, the attackers’ attention is  205 Brown F. (2013). RFID Hacking: Live Free or RFID Hard. Black Hat USA 2013.

Access control is another facet which is affected by the gap of susceptible communications in ad-hoc  networks. For example, the practice that leads to emerging security challenges in the context of RFID is  Access control on RFID information (see 8.6). Access controls on RFID readers cannot be achieved when the  Wiegand protocol facilitates communication with upstream devices206.  The Gecko207 and the BLEkey208  exploit vulnerabilities of the Wiegand protocol and have managed to perform passive attacks by violating  the access control transmitted information. The most recent penetration systems facilitate the interception  of RFID data in transit, and could be remotely controlled by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). These systems  must be placed in the RFID readers to be able to perform their malicious activities. To this end, not only the  monitoring of access points should be continuous, but also strict access should be applied to the monitoring  system. This need is of high value, because the success of these attacks depends on whether the attacker  can tamper with the monitoring system as an intermediate stage to the exploitation of the RFID readers.  9.2 Gaps on Network domain  Gap: The continuous assessment to resolve the proper positions and then deploy the WIDS’s required  resources.  It is evident that a host-based intrusion-detection solution cannot be implemented for each node of an ad- hoc and sensor network because of energy constraints. Furthermore, the need to monitor real-time data  prior to their transmission results in delays. In the case of ad-hoc and sensor networks, even though the use  of Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) (see 8.8) enables certain proactive activities which may lead  to the identification of malicious incidents such as real-time data monitoring, detecting anomalies on  network segments of exchanged packets among the sensors, and reporting, WIDS are restrained by specific  challenges. Due to the dynamic topology of such networks, determining the best location for the WIDS’s  sensors, as well as the respective correlation server, is a complex and difficult task. Accordingly, for every  new sensor which establishes a connection with an ad-hoc network, the WIDS’s sensors coverage should be  evaluated. In the case that the new sensor is out of WIDS’s coverage, then a new WIDS sensor should be  integrated. This process reveals a gap, as the sensors connect and disconnect dynamically in ad-hoc  networks. Thus, in the event of leaving a new sensor out of a WIDS’s coverage, the vulnerabilities of this  sensor threaten the ad-hoc network.  Gap: The required time-period between the assessment of firmware updates and their deployment or with  withdrawal depending on the identification of threats.  There is a major concern about the effectiveness of the practice named changing or replacing the base  stations that make it more difficult to compromise the mobile nodes (see 8.8), which increases the level of  security and the complexity in ad-hoc and sensor networks. By adopting this procedure, the networks  operational expenses are also increased due to the topology magnitude and the number of sensors.  206 3M Cogent, (2014).

The expenses discourage any service provider  of ad-hoc networks to implement the examined practice due to the cost-efficient nature of these networks.  The diversity of security mechanisms for each one of the domains in the M2M architecture necessitates  human interaction in order to mitigate the risks and ensure an adequate threat protection. Besides, we need  to efficiently tackle the challenges of the release management (i.e. firmware upgrades, patches, hot-fixes,  OS updates) and attain a high level of security. For instance, the automated firmware updates increase the  security risks by raising potential vulnerabilities in the vehicles Engine Control Unit (ECU) and in distributed  networks sensors. To this end, the automated or remote firmware updates (see 5.5.5) threat is mitigated by  the testing process of this practice. However, the required time period to perform the testing process of the  new updates and patches, leaves the sensors susceptible to vulnerabilities which could be mitigated by the  examined updates as soon as they are approved and deployed. In this time period, the exploitation of any  vulnerability is extremely dangerous, due to the fact that it depends on the capabilities of the attacker and  the sophistication of the exploitation method.  Gap: The standalone characteristics of routing protocols which are employed in MANETs are not sufficient  for threat protection.  By design, the routing protocols in ad-hoc networks and autonomous systems of mobile nodes (MANETs)  are classified into three categories; namely the proactive, the reactive/on-demand and the hybrid ones209.  The protocols also facilitate the exchange of routing information, which allows the ad-hoc and sensor nodes  to learn and adapt to the node or topology changes. However, none of them can adequately safeguard the  operation of such networks against the whole spectrum of attacks such as against DoS attacks (see 5.5.1)  because of trade-offs and limitations which are inherited by their characteristics210. These limitations are not  adequately addressed by the implementation of the practices named design and maintain flat-based,  hierarchical-based, location-based and hierarchical routing protocols (see 8.8), which only partially safeguard  the MANETs’ operation. Thus, the routing protocols are prone to a wider spectrum of malicious attacks such  as jamming (see 5.5.1) and eavesdropping (see 5.6).  9.3 Gaps on the Application Domain  Gap: Security patches and updates do not mitigate zero-day exploits targeting M2M applications.  In the case that the software deficiencies of M2M applications are not known vulnerabilities (e.g. Exploit  Database211) and, consequently, they are not managed and resolved by security patches, updates and  hotfixes, then the M2M applications could be of interest for the perpetrators that leverage the power of  zero-day exploits to obtain access. For instance, the attacks which arise from the threat of nefarious activities  (see 5.5) are highly associated to zero-day exploits and lead to malicious code injection, security  misconfigurations exploitation as well as broken authentication212. Thus, the development of applications  should follow best practices and state-of-the-art solutions, which could prioritize the practical  209 Petearson Anzola, J., Bolanos-Castro, S. and Tarazona-Bermudez, G.

Moreover, the deployment, the updating  and the resolving of security emergency incidents should be guided by Community Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs) spread worldwide. In that vein, the security in the application layer can be reinforced.  Gap: Cloud-based M2M applications cannot be safeguarded by the proposed practices due to the complex  backend environment.  Due to their scaling demand on back-end resources, the M2M applications are increasingly based on the  cloud computing (CC) paradigm and the respective deployment and service models. The CC service models  belong in different layers of abstraction in the architecture and are mutually dependent for provisioning the  end-services. Moreover, there are several security implications among the cloud computing service models.  For example, specific vulnerabilities of the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) could potentially endanger the  secure deployment of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Consequently, the security dependencies between  these models could lead to threats such as in erroneous use or administration of devices and systems (see  5.1.3). With the aim to secure the application layer in accordance with legacy environment practices, such  as with inventory maintenance and update with the information of authorized and unauthorized  software/OS/applications/devices within the network (see 8.6), many vulnerabilities outsourced by the CC  models dependencies are not confronted. For example, the Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations  Manipulations (VENOM)211 vulnerability is leveraged by attackers to target the virtualisation systems of  Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) which use the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model. In that case, the  negative effects of a successful attack impact the Software-as-a-Service operations.  9.4 Gaps on the Operational Domain  Gap: The interaction with human factor and the poor video quality of surveillance systems.  Many ad-hoc networks operate in complex locations such as supply chains and production environments.  These locations are complex since they cannot be locked down to be off-limits to unauthorized personnel.  Thus, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) and surveillance systems213 are employed in the context of the  practice, usage of centralized monitoring systems for security (see 8.3). These systems facilitate real-time  surveillance or capture of footage to assess it later. Their operation is supervised by highly trained employees  who are liable for reporting suspicious activities. However, the response time of CCTV and surveillance  systems in case of alerts is limited due to the human factor. Further, the video quality of many CCTV systems  is poor, leading to inability of usage for forensic purposes. To this end, these gaps harden the success of the  monitoring crime prevention procedures which are applied at ad-hoc networks.  Gap: Physical security is limited when defence-in-depth is implemented.  Even though throughout the operation and life-cycle of ad-hoc networks many mobile devices enter and  leave, the assets of ad-hoc networks are constantly increasing. This situation combined with the practice of  implementing a security plan based on defense-in-depth (see 8.1), leads to a gap which burdens many  providers. By definition, defense in depth separates the M2M architecture into defense layers. Each layer,  consists of certain security mechanisms and measures able to obstruct and prevent criminal activities. In  many use cases, where ad-hoc networks are mounted in remote locations and they are vulnerable to threats  such as loss of devices (see 5.1.4), then the physical layer demands a greater number of security resources.  213 D. Hutter, (2016). Physical Security and Why It Is Important. SANS Institute. [online] Available at:  https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/physical/physical-security-important-37120 [Accessed xx Nov.  2016].  https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/physical/physical-security-important-37120  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  79  The gap lays on the fact that defense-in-depth necessitates dynamic resource allocation214 of security  mechanisms to cover the dynamic topology of ad-hoc networks. To this event, the linkage amongst this  security plan and the budget of the provider do not fulfill the provider’s cost-effective expectations. Thus,  following defense-in-depth, the physical security which is of great importance, is also limited due to the  spectrum of resources which are required to secure each layer of ad-hoc networks.  Gap: Fraudulent activities are addressed only with security mechanisms on M2M architecture without  functional procedures.  The distributed nature and the shared resources of the M2M architecture expose the business processes to  threats of abusing personal data as well as to nefarious activities. This exposure could potentially lead to  fraudulent activities, which primarily violate the assets integrity and lead to a low-level of trust and privacy.  The existence of operational defensive mechanisms aims to secure the enterprises technical layer (i.e. trust  relationship using mobile-based security agents that use single-sign-on mechanisms or trust management- based techniques (see 8.1)). The implementation of these mechanisms without any support by the functional  layer of the enterprises in which the policies documentation occurs, leads to inconsistencies such as a static  approach against fraud threats.  9.5 Gaps on the Product/Business Processes Domain  Gap: The regulations mitigate only threats against the type of collected and processed data.  The structuring model of the business processes for ad-hoc and sensor networks incorporated in the  enteprises should be based upon a regulatory framework that defines the legality and level of privacy. The  security and operations regulatory framework should define and provide the success factors (e.g.  confidentiality, integrity and level of privacy) for the sensory data and the communication. Then, the threat  of violating rules and regulations (see 5.3.2) can be eliminated and eradicated. However, the regulatory  frameworks take into consideration only the type of the collected and processed data without focusing on  the type of the underlying environment. Accordingly, only threats against the type of collected and  processed data are addressed by the regulations. Thus, the regulatory frameworks do not always pose  certain threat protection methods and techniques to eliminate threats in ad-hoc and sensor networks. As a  result, even if the ad-hoc networks operate according to the regulatory frameworks which also conform to  the law, this is not adequate to achieve a high level of security. Thus, the enteprise is liable to define the  objectives that would eliminate threats such as outages and DDoS attacks.  Gap: The regulations do not necessarily resolve all the responsibilities of individuals concerning the  security activities.  Typically, the regulationsdefine the liabilities and the responsibilities concerning the security activities,  which should be performed by the service providers. For example, the integration of technical and  organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental  loss215 could be employed. The regulatory frameworks do not explicitly define the obligatory actions that  burden the end-users concering their security activities. As a result, the end-users are threatened, since they  are uninformed about the security perspective of the M2M applications. In most cases, applications which  214 Interagency Security Committee, (2015). Best Practices for Planning and Managing Physical Security Resources: An  Interagency Security Committee Guide.

Gap: The attack surface of external components derails security by design.  Every communication layer of an ad-hoc and sensor network is threatened by the lack of planning or design  errors (see 5.1.1) during their initiation phase. The implementation of the practice of planning and  implementing security by design (see 8.1) provides adequate security mechanisms in each layer. However,  the implementation of security by design fails to protect business processes due to their association to the  attack surface of external components216 integrated in ad-hoc and sensor networks. For example, SCADA  systems consist of several external components (e.g. PLCs) facilitating the operational management of ad- hoc and sensor networks. PLCs are usually orchestrated in order to achieve the business’ goals concerning  the level of performance and QoS. With regard to PLCs which are manufactured by specific vendors, existing  vulnerabilities enable arbitrary file disclosure211 and remote control211. The vulnerabilities of PLCs introduce  security risks that could not be mitigated in the context of security by design. Besides, the enteprises owing  SCADA systems, such as power generation and water distribution facilities, can not alter or modify PLCs in  order to eliminate their vulnerabilities because they are subject  to Intellectual Properties Rights (IPR) such  as copyrights and the industrial design rights of the vendors. Another example of this limitation is the fact  that certain sensors operate with a preinstalled OS whcih may have various  vulnerabilities without the  possibility for installation of an updated version of OS or security patches. As a result, the vulnerabilities on  these sensors can not be resolved by the examined practice named security by design, and they are  susceptible to OS exploits (see 5.1.2).To this end, this constrain arises both for sensors and external  components such as Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Automation Controllers (PACs) which  are purchased by vendors. Correspondingly, security by design does not fully mitigate the threat of lack of  planning or design errors, in the context of business processes.  9.6 Recommendations  The above gaps naturally result in a set of recommendations that can improve the overall security  performance and can be classified either as organisational or as technical recommendations.  9.6.1 Organisational recommendations  In the context of security attributes, ad-hoc and sensor network development could be strengthened by  practices that are documented with respect to standards and compliance, for that purpose we propose  functional, policy and regulatory recommendations that can provide a clear guidance to interested  organizations  Functional Recommendations  In the context of security attributes, ad-hoc and sensor network development could be strengthened by  practices that are documented with respect to standards.  There is a growing concern about the natural persons’ privileges that access sensorial datasets to perform a  diversity of management operations (i.e. M2M service provider’s operators). This concern refers to most of  the challenges on the surveillance data management on areas monitored by closed circuit security systems,  and indoor positioning data mainly on supply chains and data streams, which facilitate M2M home  appliances remote control. For this purpose, it is of great significance to identify by whom the data is  accessed, and the conditions they need to access the data. The appropriate roles should be defined to  associate the end-users (e.g. M2M service provider’s employees, clients) with specific segments of collected  216 I. Arce, K. Clark-Fisher, N. Daswani, J.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  81  data and authorize them with specific privileges concerning the computational operations. This procedure  should be combined with strict monitoring on ad-hoc and sensor network to ensure and enable the secure  collection of sensitive data. Moreover, the M2M applications development and deployment in CC  environments should be performed by adapting and expanding the application security guidelines of  standardization organizations and cover the needs and demands of the M2M architecture.  Policy Recommendations  Due to the privacy issues that should be considered in the ad-hoc and sensor networks with personal,  confidential, sensitive data being exchanged, specific policies should be established about authorising  procedures and sharing agreements regarding the sensorial data. For transparency purposes, policies should  be considered, which relate to the liabilities definition and the management operations description.  Furthermore, a privacy policy should articulate the reasons and methods, which are orchestrated for the  collection as well as for the processing of sensorial data and the mechanisms mitigating threats against  functional and operational procedures. Moreover, privacy compliance should be ensured in the context of a  reliable and consistent M2M application. A standardized documentation concerning the privacy compliance  should be followed; typical examples are the Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) or the Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA). Further to the sensitive data plane, the privacy policy is also associated with additional  documents. For example, in the healthcare sector, the informed consent documents are associated with the  privacy objectives which are set forth by the integrated ad-hoc networks deployed at hospitals environment.  The patients are empowered to control and to approve the concentration as well as the processing of their  sensitive information by the BSNs. In other terms, the patients agree to control the disclosure of their PII to  a trusted and predefined third-party, such as to specific nursing staff and doctors.  The security level of M2M applications is highly affected by the back-end servers’ vulnerabilities. For this  purpose, these servers should be updated using security patches and they should also be subject to  vulnerability management. The components of this management should be a technical assessment as well  as the revaluation of the competent policy which defines acceptable methods to perform the assessment  itself.  Security by design should be implemented for each layer of the ad-hoc network, which means that, on a  higher layer of abstraction, the development of the password-management policy is of great significance for  mitigating various threats. However, prior to the adaptation of this type of policy, many challenges, such as  the mutation of passwords and the intervals of time under which the changing of passwords will take place,  should be addressed. Moreover, the operational implementation of this policy should be ensured in the  context of its compliance by orchestrating appropriate controls and assessments. Furthermore, the technical  practises utilized to secure the RFID interaction between tags and readers should be compliant with  standards and state-of-art security mechanisms.  Regulatory Recommendations  The collection and processing of PII should be performed by following the constraints placed by the European  Directives, such as by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679217, the Cross-Border Healthcare  217 General Data Protection Regulation: officially Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons in regards  to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General  Data Protection Regulation).

However,  the underlying infrastructure of M2M applications and operations should comply with the security and  operations regulatory frameworks regarding the protection of personal data. For example, in two-years’  time, these applications should operate under the guidelines of the General Data Protection Regulation  2016/679217 which follows a risk-based approach and enables privacy by design. Finally, the service providers  of ad-hoc networks should inform the end-users about their responsibilities (e.g. strong credentials, usage  of digital signatures) concerning the PII concealment during the networks’ operation and especially in cases  where MHNs are orchestrated.  Business/Product processes Recommendations  The manufacturing of certain products (e.g. GPS receivers, medical sensors) should be threat-driven to  minimize potential vulnerabilities, which would allow attacks during the deployment and development  phases. The manufacturing enterprises of GPS receivers should also be aware of the constantly growing  attack surface of their products. The GPS operation is based on the transaction of signals between the GPS  receiver and four or more satellites. This transaction of signals takes place so as the GPS receiver can  establish its current three coordinates and synchronize its clock with the constellation’s atomic clocks. The  predominant method, per which GPS operates, can be exploited due to vulnerabilities which enable spoofing  attacks220. The defensive techniques which can be employed to construct a tamper-proof GPS receiver can  only be applied during their manufacturing due to the individuals’ lack of knowledge and resources.  Moreover, end-to-end encryption should be implemented during the communication of GPS receivers and  satellites. Therefore, this issue is recommended to be addressed by the companies during the design and  modelling procedures.  In the context of addressing fraudulent activities inside the M2M architecture, proactive functional  procedures, protocols and policies should be orchestrated aiming to provide fraud prevention and  assurances to the end-users. More specifically, a code of conduct, and a fraud risk control policy consist the  minimum safeguards which should be defined and incorporated in M2M architecture by means of the  authorization policy upon the collected data. These proactive safeguards in the businesses functional layer  should be strengthened by fraud detecting mechanisms.  9.6.2 Technical Recommendations  In order to improve and securely implement sensors networking in M2M communication, we provide  different technical recommendations, with a special focus on authentication/authorization methods and  proactive and reactive defences.  Authentication/Authorization Recommendations  In principle, we should aim to increase the security in the authentication process by deploying strong or  multi-factor authentication methods (MFA), wherever applicable. However, concerning device  authentication for ad-hoc and sensor networks, any device could also rely on certificate-based  authentication and on methods which harden the exploitation procedure by employing a secure network  218 Cross-Border Healthcare Directive 2011/24/EU; officially Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights  in cross-border healthcare.

Furthermore, an elastic type of access control mechanism is recommended to be incorporated  in ad-hoc and sensor networks such as the attribute-based access controls. Hence, these amplified secure  devices could be mounted in non-secure locations and unattended installations. Moreover, in the context  of RFID communication between the tags and the readers, it is recommended that the authentication  process take place in upstream devices to associate unique passwords to individuals.  Proactive Defence Recommendation  In the recent years, there is a growing concern about DDoS and flooding attacks as well as about the  sophistication of their offensive techniques. botnets are utilized in DDoS attacks against ad-hoc and sensor  networks; because of the concealed nature of bots, the botnets may become an unpredictable adversary.  From another perspective, the ad-hoc and sensor networks are targeted with the scope to be compromised  and the devices are enrolled in botnets, which perform DDoS attacks. This method was followed during the  US incident involving a critical internet infrastructure which was targeted by the Mirai-based IoT botnet.  Thus, despite the orchestration of WIDS in the context of ad-hoc networks, the employment of IDS in every  bottleneck of the M2M architecture such as the M2M gateway is recommended. Following the adjustment  of this measure, any incoming junk traffic from the M2M devices targeting entities outside the ad-hoc and  sensors network could be identified and prevented. To this end, the network traffic of every internet- connected device is monitored and proactive detection is orchestrated. Besides, it is recommended to  ensure the continuous update of the IDS sensors’ ruleset in strict time intervals and by following trustful  sources of signatures. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of MANET  routing protocols , it is strongly  recommended that the network security assessment should primarly focus on the routing protocols  vulnerabilities.  Reactive Defence Recommendation  The identification of zero-day exploits is impossible to be implemented by WIDS.The operation of the  defensive mechanisms performing deep packet inspection (DPI) is based upon signatures of known attacks.  Thus, it is recommended to create a defense zone consisting of a honeynet, alongside the ad-hoc and sensor  networks. This network is composed of honeypots emulating the operation of sensors. The honeynet  constitutes a type of darknet which is able to identify new methods of attacks and zero-day exploits. Mobile  Edge Cloud Computing is recommended to be orchestrated so as to develop the honeynet. The operation of  honeynets enables the tracking of malicious activities in order to analyse them and collect forensic  information about the attacks and the attackers behaviour. A network of virtual entities emulating the  operation of sensors should be employed and, in the event of a threatening incident, the malicious traffic  could be offloaded in the Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) in order for this traffic to be recorded and monitored.  Due to the fact that the offloading process increases the overhead of energy consuption, virtual machines  which operate inside the MEC should be utilised in order to avoid performance constraints contrary to the  case of using sensors.

Conclusions  The development of the ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M communications threat landscape in 2016  has been impressive in one thing: it exponentially expands its own borders of impact whilst the industry, the  authorities and the experts analyse the big picture to date.  The threat landscape has evolved in terms of the assets quantitative set which is affected or may  unintentionally contribute to this landscape expansion. By completing the current research document, our  conclusions have been divided into three categories: policy, business and technical (focused on research)  conclusions.  Policy conclusions   Establish specific policies about authorising procedures and sharing agreements. A privacy policy  should articulate the reasons and methods which are orchestrated for the collection as well as for  the processing of sensorial data and the mechanisms mitigating threats against functional and  operational procedures.   Ensure privacy compliance in the context of reliable and consistent M2M applications. Standardized  documentation concerning the privacy compliance should be followed; typical examples are the  Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) or the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).  Business conclusions   Proactive functional procedures, protocols and policies should be orchestrated aiming to provide  fraud prevention and assurances to the end-users. More specifically, a code of conduct, and a fraud  risk control policy should be incorporated in an M2M architecture by means of the authorization  policy upon the collected data.   Ensure that the manufacturing of certain products (e.g. GPS receivers, medical sensors) should be  threat-driven to minimize potential vulnerabilities which would allow attacks during the deployment  and development phases.  Technical conclusions   Incorporate an elastic type of access control mechanism such as the attribute-based access controls.  Hence, these amplified secure devices could be mounted in non-secure locations and unattended  installations.   Employ an IDS in every bottleneck of the M2M architecture such as the M2M gateway. Following  the adjustment of this measure, any incoming junk traffic from the M2M devices targeting entities  outside the ad-hoc and sensors network could be identified and prevented.   Create a defence zone which consists of a honeynet by orchestrating Mobile Edge Cloud Computing  (MEC) to track of malicious activities. A network of virtual entities emulating the operation of sensors  should be employed and, in the event of a threatening incident, the malicious traffic could be  offloaded in the Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) for this traffic to be recorded and monitored.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  03  Executive Summary  The term M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications describes any solution or technology that facilitates  the wired and wireless communication between networked devices to exchange information, as ad-hoc  networking is an basic building block for M2M communications. Today, intelligent transportation, cyber- physical systems (CPS) and “Smart <anything>” (e.g. cities, buildings, vehicles, home appliances, phones)  technologies have been intensified and attract the attention of the R&D enthusiasts. Sensor networking has  the lion’s share among almost any of the above emerging trends. In this context, it is almost a “condition  sine qua non” to define any M2M implementation without including connected sensors in an ad-hoc  approach.  All the above contribute in describing the emerging universe of the Internet of Things (IoT), which can be  acknowledged as the driver for the evolution of M2M communications. In quantitative terms1, the IoT  connections are expected to exceed 27 billion by 2025 compared to 6 billion in 2015. In respect to the  market-share, the revenue opportunity is accounted for 6.8 billion Euros, whereas this amount will increase  to 2.7 trillion Euros by 2025. In terms of technology, 71% of all IoT connections are accommodated using a  short-range technology (i.e. WiFi, Zigbee, NFC, in-building Programmable Logic Controllers - PLCs).  From the security perspective, the increased attack surface in ad-hoc and sensor networks has urged the  development of technology for preventing attack incidents and for tackling system failures. In this vein, the  networks acquire greater importance in critical infrastructures (i.e. industrial control systems, water and  power plants, defence bases) and in sensitive data exploitation (i.e. healthcare, banking systems, social  networks) for which privacy and ethics issues are likely to arise. Recent incidents proved that any connected  device, such as smart TVs and video cameras2,3, can be compromised to propagate illegitimate network  traffic, but can also jeopardize security in a national and governmental level.  Objectives of the report  The ad-hoc and sensor networking Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide complements the Annual  Cyber Security ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL). It provides a deep overview of the current state of security in  the ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M communications. It also aims to support decision makers to  comprehend the landscape and take informed decisions regarding cyber-security by incorporating  consolidated information from the European Network & Information Security (NIS) threat landscape  evolution.  Key findings  By analysing the threats to identified assets of the ad-hoc and sensor networking nomenclature, we focused  on Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and Wireless Sensor Networks  (WSN). We observed that the current threefold M2M communications architectural model, as considered  by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), can be expanded to two additional domains  1 Machina Research (2016).

In the same context,  we observed that the fusion of sensors, targeting to monitor the physiological vital signs of patients in clinical  operations, leads to technical and legal considerations. We also observed that the regulatory frameworks  do not explicitly define the obligatory actions that burden the end-users regarding their activities in a health- care environment. These gaps must be bridged to achieve privacy-friendly design of systems and services.  Further, security-by-design in sensor networks is found to be inadequate in business processes (e.g. power  generation and water distribution). These sensors operate in embedded systems whose preinstalled  operating system is susceptible to malicious exploits. The limitation of not modifying these networks  components should be eliminated without offending the sensor vendors’ copyrights and industrial design  rights. Considering that the M2M applications are increasingly based on the cloud computing (CC) paradigm  and the respective deployment and service models, we observed that is adequate to only secure the  application layer of a service in accordance with legacy environment practices because those service models  are mutually dependent for provisioning the end-services.  List of Recommendations  The main recommendations follow; for deeper explanations see section 9.6.   For developers, M2M applications development in CC environments should be performed by  adopting and expanding the application security guidelines of standardization organizations and  cover the needs of the M2M architecture.   For administrators: Identify by whom the sensorial data is accessed. Specific policies should be  established about authorising procedures and sharing agreements regarding these data.   For administrators and service providers: Security by design should be implemented for each layer  of the ad-hoc network.   For service providers, administrators and decision makers: The underlying infrastructure of M2M  applications and operations should comply with the security and operations regulatory frameworks  regarding the protection of personal data.   For administrators and networks/service providers: An elastic type of access control mechanism is  to be incorporated in ad-hoc and sensor networks   For administrators and network/service providers: Mobile Edge Cloud Computing (MEC) to be  orchestrated so as to develop a perimeter defence and collect/analyse forensic information about  the attacks.

Introduction  For 2016, the first ENISA strategic objective foresees: “To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of  EU actors considering evolutions in Network & Information Security (NIS)” 4. The current study analyses the  threats and the threat landscape for ad-hoc and sensor networks. We perform a comprehensive compilation  of the respective threats by analysing collected information, and deliver the respective threat analysis and  landscape reports on the application area.  Ad-hoc and sensor networks for smart objects are utilized for the collection of critical, sensitive, massive and  other types of data in several points of interest, such as weather stations, healthcare environments, aviation  and car fields, baggage and asset tracking, home and industry applications, manufacturing and supply chain  analytics and management. Then, the data can be analysed to trigger several corrective/preventive actions;  record and analyse system failures, initiate the appropriate remedial changes, apply/revert configuration  changes, and provide the quality data reporting and statistical process/control analysis. Today, smart  transport, smart finance and loans, smart utilities, smart supply and manufacturing, smart environments,  smart energy, smart home, and smart health involve numerous interconnected devices and rely heavily on  ad-hoc and sensor networks (Figure 1).  Figure 1 Global ad-hoc and sensor network market space  These pervasive and ubiquitous networks facilitate the processing and collection of data generated by  sensors and smart devices. In many cases, the operations, the resiliency, the availability and the performance  of these networks are critical, and, thus, we need to protect the secure exchange of the information, and  ensure data privacy and integrity. Besides, the reduction of their attack surface is among the predominant  issues that thrive during the operation of ad-hoc and sensor networks. Due to the increased attack surface  in ad-hoc and sensor networks, we need to prevent security incidents, tackle system failures, and mitigate  4 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Even more, the necessity to reduce the attack surface acquires greater importance in  critical environments (e.g. industrial control systems) and whenever sensitive data are involved (e.g. in  healthcare, banking systems and social networks), severe privacy and ethics issues may arise (e.g.  compromise of sensitive medical records and patients’ data). Inevitably, these networks constitute a strong  point of interest for several research teams throughout the world.  1.1 Policy Context  This report aims to analyse the evolving threat environment both from the stakeholder and the EU policy  makers’ perspective by identifying evolving threats, risks and challenges related to ad-hoc and sensors  networks with a special approach to the M2M communication architectural model.  The different challenges appeared during the adoption of new models of communication (such IoT and  M2M) suggests to propose a set of recommendations aligned with the EU strategy in research and  innovation5. A great added value is expected to be created as a result of these technology advancements.  The market value of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the EU is expected to exceed one trillion euros in 20205.  Within the IoT ecosystem, the major goal is to interconnect networks of sensors and smart objects in a way  that they can intelligently interact with humans, and to ensure the secure and seamless sensor and network  connectivity. In this context, ENISA expects these sectors to take advantage of the current ad-hoc and sensor  network for M2M communications threat landscape and provide added-value services to the IoT and M2M  technologies. By enabling a secure, trusted, reliable, and resilient environment, the industry will be more  competitive, and the markets within the EU will benefit from numerous innovative use cases. Therefore, it  is vital to promote and establish secure ad-hoc and sensor network for M2M communications, and manage  efficiently the large volumes of connected devices6.  The European Commission (EC) supports the evolutionary trends of ad-hoc and sensor networks leading to  the integration of sensor appliances in the market through various research and project efforts, such as the  MOBILEMAN project7, and the multi-sensor platform AirSensEUR8. The EC has also acknowledged the  emerging trends, identified the need for cross-layer techniques and efficient cooperative protocols, and has  implemented and validated the feasibility of the outcome of the Cooperative transmission and cross-layer  techniques for secure wireless sensor networks (Coolness) project9.  The current report identifies the ad-hoc and sensor network assets and illustrates the ad-hoc and sensor  networking threats by reviewing the current working and environmental practices, assessing the private and  public initiatives, and analysing the research information in this area. The report also provides the threat  5 European Commission, Directorate-General of Communications Networks, Content & Technology. (2014).

This document can also be useful for experts working in the EU’s electronic  communications sector and for experts working in the information security field.  1.3 Scope of the Study  As described in the ENISA regulation, one of the objectives of the agency is to assist the Union institutions,  bodies, offices and agencies in developing policies in network and information security by including  accumulated expertise related to availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or  transmitted data and the related services offered by or accessible via those networks and systems. For  instance, the new ENISA regulation undelines the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks (and their  components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical  bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA  regulation states that ENISA should enable effective responses to information security risks and threats.  This document is published by ENISA to provide a threat analysis and best practices guideline to ad-hoc and  sensor networking trends, and it also addresses the risks and threats of these technologies underpinning the  emergence of a ‘smart’ society. The ad-hoc and sensor networking threat information is directed to  executives, security architects and security managers. Nonetheless, the provided information can also be  10 A Global Strategy for the European Union [online] Available at: http://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/global-strategy- foreign-and-security-policy-european-union [Accessed 18 Nov. 2016].  http://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/global-strategy-foreign-and-security-policy-european-union http://europa.eu/globalstrategy/en/global-strategy-foreign-and-security-policy-european-union  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  11  considered by non-experts. Furthermore, since the Agency assists the European Commission and EU  Member States, it  cooperates with the business community, in order to help them to meet the requirements  of network and information security, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the Internal Market.  1.4 Methodology  The current study examines various use cases to identify the respective assets and then collect, analyse and  categorize the ad-hoc and sensor networking threats. For the project execution, our methodology  performed research and collected the information through various sources (i.e. journals, conference papers,  white papers, industry recommendations, online documents). Various sources have been identified and  studied during our investigation.  We consider previous ETLs to specify the format, to review the ENISA taxonomy threats, and study the  approach taken in those ETLs. Besides, we also consider several other sources regarding the existing EU  policies  and we identify evolving threats, risks and challenges related to ad-hoc and sensors networks with  a special focus on the M2M communication architectural model. All these threats are assessed, categorized  and analyzed by means of several references to the collected sources. Then, we perform an analysis of the  existing good practices and present how the threat exposure can be reduced, while we identify gaps in  existing practices. A presentation of the state-of-the art developments in the area of threat intelligence is  also undertaken. Finally, we study how we can adapt best security protection practices towards a more agile  management of security controls.  All the collected sources are written in English, and all the referenced web resources were last accessed in  November 2016.  1.5 Structure of this Study  The structure of this document is as follows: in chapter 2 we provide the ad-hoc and sensor networking for  M2M communications basics and present the architecture; in chapter 3 we illustrate the asset taxonomy for  ad-hoc and sensor networks in M2M communications, and present the use cases that are analysed in the  current study; in chapter 4 we identify threats against ad-hoc and sensor networks, and in chapter 5 we map  these threats to the assets; in chapter 6 we consider which threat agents are more relevant to ad-hoc and  sensor networks attacks; in chapter 7 we present the vulnerabilities and risks in ad-hoc and sensor networks;  in chapter 8 we present a set of recommendations and good practices for ad-hoc and sensor networks; in  chapter 9 we provide the gap analysis, and finally in chapter 10 we conclude the study.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  12  2. Ad-hoc and sensor networking architecture  The term M2M is used to describe technologies that allow the communication between devices with no or  limited human intervention11. The M2M communication requires wired or wireless connection between the  nodes. In the case of Wireless ad-hoc networks, the M2M communication is wireless. M2M mainly focuses  on the machine-type-communication (MTC), where the devices are communicating end-to-end. The key  components of the M2M models are field-deployed wireless devices with embedded sensors or wireless  communication networks with radio-frequency identification (RFID) features.  Wireless ad-hoc networks for M2M communications, also known as WANETs, can be classified in three types,  based on their application12:  Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) use a mesh topology consisting of radio nodes. The nodes are the mesh  client, and the mesh routers or the mesh gateways. In WMN the mesh clients, often laptops, cell phones  etc., behave both as hosts and routers for the network. This way each client contributes to the range  expansion of the network. Most WMN implementations are found in harsh environments or in situations  like field operations of military forces, satellite communications inside a constellation, public transportation  monitoring or real time telemetry on car races. Likewise, they are also deployed in broadband home  networking, community and municipality networking13.  A Mobile ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an “on demand” contacted network, mainly between mobile devices  such as smartphones and tablets. Each node behaves like a router, forwarding any traffic unrelated to its  own use. The fact that nodes move independently of each other makes this type of network unreliable and  of a constant changing topology. Some more specific implementations of MANET include the military ad-hoc  networking between soldiers in the field, vehicles and headquarters, ship-to-ship ad-hoc mobile  communication, Personal Area Networks (PAN)14 etc.  A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)15 is a network of smart sensor nodes. A smart sensor node is a device  equipped with a processor, a memory, a wireless network interface, and one or more sensors and actuators.  The sensors give the device the ability of monitoring several physical or environmental conditions. The  memory is limited to processing aid, thus, all the data acquired by the node are transmitted wirelessly to a  base station for storage and further processing. Also via WSN the base-station or any other node can send  data back to one sensor node; e.g. a command for the actuator. Various applications of WSNs have emerged  in several fields, such as in healthcare, military, manufacturing and industrial/public systems, environment  and smart homes as shown in Figure 2.  11 Mehmood, Y., Görg, C., Muehleisen, M., Timm-Giel, A.

CPS is an evolution of M2M16,17 in  intelligent information processing and an important form of IoT18. The respective CPS applications are going  to benefit from massive wireless networks and IoT based on the information they collect from the  surrounding environment. The correlations among M2M, WSNs, CPS, and IoT are shown in Figure 3.  16 Pticek, M., Podobnik, V. and Jezic, G. (2016). Beyond the Internet of Things: The Social Networking of Machines.

This model is composed of different  domains, each of them having its own characteristics, assets, threats and vulnerabilities, existing cyber  threats, trends, security challenges, associated risks and required countermeasures related to ad-hoc and  sensors networks, with a special approach to the M2M communications architectural model.  The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI)20 considers an M2M network as a three-part  structure that includes the:  1. M2M Device domain (usually embedded)  2. M2M Network domain (connection between devices, sensors and gateways, network to network  connection)  3. Application domain (data manipulation and usage by specific business-applications)  In the current study, we consider two additional domains to address the operational challenges as well as  the products and the business processes automation and workflows, namely the.  1. Operational domain (includes physical security, control systems and utilities)  19 Mehmood, Y., Görg, C., Muehleisen, M., Timm-Giel, A. (2015).

Product/business processes domain (e.g. healthcare, transportation)  These five elements form different interlinked domains21, facilitate the data processing by various  application services and achieve full interoperability of network and services11. The full-picture of the five  elements is depicted in Figure 4.  In the Device domain, M2M devices constitute several ad-hoc and sensor network nodes for data forwarding.  These devices are equipped with specific sensing technologies for real-time monitoring to take the  appropriate transmission decisions to the gateway (i.e. single-hop or multi-hop transmission). The M2M  gateway acts as the entrance to another network and collects the packets from the M2M nodes via the M2M  network. This network furnishes a connection between all kinds of intelligent devices (or sensors) and  gateways. In the Network domain, communication networks achieve connections and transmit the sensory  data between gateways and applications.  Various application services are used by the specific business-processing engines in the Application domain.  These services are responsible for storing the data and for providing the data to the M2M applications for  management.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  16  3. Ad-hoc and sensor assets identification  Anything of value can be considered as an asset. Assets could be abstract assets (like processes or  reputation), virtual assets (data for instance), physical assets (cables, a piece of equipment), human  resources, money, etc23. In this study, we focus on the ETSI taxonomy20 and the aforementioned M2M  architecture (Figure 4). We analyze the assets related in the area of specific use cases, as there is a very large  number of interconnected devices, and a significant amount of asset types in the ad-hoc wireless and sensor  networking for M2M communications sector. Conclusively, the approach presented should not be  considered as exhaustive, but rather an analysis of assets in different business cases and diverse  perspectives.  In the Device domain, we capture these devices which are capable for data processing, while in the Network  domain, we study the assets that enable the communication between the applications. We also include the  operational aspects and the business process modeling in order to combine classical functions and processes  with ad-hoc and sensor networking extensions, and capabilities. Data exchange, control systems,  monitoring, and metering applications can be part of several business processes that enable the  standardization, and the interoperability of the implementations of M2M solutions.  3.1 Asset taxonomy  The ad-hoc and sensor network assets are identified and classified based on the building blocks of the  following domains:  1. Application domain  a. Data  b. Critical applications  c. eHealth  d. Cloud-based applications  2. Device domain  a. Car/vehicles  b. Mobile devices  c. RFID tags  d. RFID readers  e. Radars  f.

As presented in  Chapter 2, we extend the model including the Operational domain and the Product/business processes  domain. Based on this categorization, the valuable ad-hoc and wireless sensor network assets are listed  below. A full list of these assets is shown in Figure 5.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  18  Figure 5 Assets Taxonomy  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  19  3.2.1 Application domain  The Application domain involves M2M and client applications. It is the middleware layer between the end- user and the data provided by the M2M Device domain, after being processed by various application  services. The assets of this domain are described below, however is needed to mention that applications  listed in this domain are not exhaustive and we are going only to cover certain interesting application areas.  a. Data  In this domain, the data collected from devices is stored, managed and represented via applications or web  interfaces to user. The data can be used for information only, statistical analysis, and control capabilities.  b. Critical applications  Critical applications are special-purpose applications, combining information and data from diverse sources  (i.e. sensors, devices, internet, and databases).  c. eHealth  In a Mobile Healthcare Network (MHN)24 the data combination from wearables, smartphones and vitals  monitoring equipment can provide to the individual or the physician the whole picture of a health case, and  the Personal Health Record (PHR)25. An essential part of an MHN is the eHealth applications that store,  represent and process the collected data to produce statistics. In the need of storing PHRs, a Private  Healthcare Information (PHI) database is used with special concerns in privacy and data protection.  Representation interfaces are the eHealth portals, web-based or mobile applications.  d. Cloud-based applications  The integration of sensor networks and cloud computing26 is motivated by the processing and storage  capabilities of the cloud. This sensor-cloud sensing-as-a-service (SSaaS) leads to the ability of having multiple  applications accessing the sensor data at the same time. Additionally, the sensor-cloud model improves the  sensor’s resources’ utilization, and the sensor management and provides the environment for developing  software interfaces between sensors and the cyber or real world.  Furthermore, mobile computing applications accommodate an increasing effort to assist the sensor  networking ecosystem. On these grounds, recent technology advances in mobile cloud applications include  the Open Mobile Alliance’s (OMA) Smartcard Web Server27, which is literally coupled with a mobile device  (e.g. Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card) that connects directly with the Carrier to push applications to  mobile phones. Another example is TokTok, a technology that allows access to cloud-based services like  Gmail and Google Calendar by voice, using the mobile phone device28.  24 Zhang, K., Yang, K., Liang, X., Su, Z., Shen, X. and Luo, H.H.

The M2M Device domain, as the term implies, is the group of devices capable of replying to data  requests or transmitting this data autonomously. The connectivity between M2M devices and M2M  Gateways is the M2M Area Network. The following subsections present the most common assets in the  Device domain.  a. Cars and vehicles  The Vehicular ad-hoc Networks29 (VANETs) are a subclass of the Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). The  hardware asset of a VANET is mainly the on-board equipment installed in vehicles, which provides them with  the means to communicate with other vehicles (Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication - V2V) or with the  network infrastructure (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure - V2I and Infrastructure-to-Vehicle - I2V). Some VANET  hardware assets30 are presented below:  Event Data Recorder (EDR): records transmissions and receives messages and all the events that occurred  in the vehicle environment during a trip  Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver: communicates the geographic location, the speed, the direction  of the movement and the node acceleration at specified time intervals  Radars and sensors:  used to detect obstacles in the vehicle environment  Omnidirectional antenna:  used to access wireless channels  Electronic License Plate (ELP):  provides an ID number used by the police or any other authority  b. Mobile device  A mobile device connects to the area network utilizing the built-in sensors (camera, gyroscope,  thermometer, GPS, etc.), the embedded interfaces (GSM antenna, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.), and the  Personalized Portable Devices (PPDs).  c. RFID tags  In the Device domain, the RFID systems37 include tags, readers and the RFID middleware. RFID tags are the  small labels attached on objects, animals or people to embed some information on them or to make them  identifiable among others. An RFID tag circuit consists of a control unit and an antenna.  d. RFID readers  An RFID reader is a device or receiver often embedded in other common devices, (i.e. smartphones) that can  get the information of a tag when it is within range. The software that ensures the communication between  the reader and a database storing system is called RFID middleware. The latter filters, processes and sends  the collected data from the reader to the database and provides an interface to enable data access for  external applications.  e. Radars  29 Aswad, R. and Abdala, M. (2016). Performance Enhancement of VANET Routing Protocols. Journal of  Telecommunications, 32(1), pp.5-10.  30 Wei, C., Jianding, Y. and Xiangjun, L. (2012).

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  21  A micro-power Impulse Radar (MIR63,31) is applicable in many fields as a motion detector or range finder.  Radars are widely used in the military for asset protection, in rescue applications, in vehicle automation  (parking assistance, cruise control, etc.), in home security systems (keyless locks, automatic doors, etc.) and  in manufacturing field (industrial automation).  f. Transmission nodes  In a clustered architecture, sensor nodes are grouped into clusters where each cluster has elected a node as  Cluster Head (CH)32. This node is the one that transmits all the cluster nodes’ data to the base station. This  mitigates energy consumption, traffic congestion and data collisions into the network.  g. Interconnection points  According the ETSI M2M architecture, an interconnection point is the gateway between the devices and the  communication network, which is also referred in the architecture as an M2M Gateway. The interconnection  point manages the packets and provides efficient paths for transmitting these packets to the remote back- end server via the Network domain.  h. Support systems  Due to the complexity and the high volumes of traffic in ad-hoc and sensor networks, there is an emerging  need for the appropriate support systems in a sustainable, converged, integrated and operational way.  Business Support systems (BSS) is a collective term for the set of software solutions used by  telecommunication providers to run their business operations. The term includes software for billing and  charging, customer management, product design and management, sales and marketing, and order and  order activation. BSS is also an operational asset of the networks in question.  i. Wearables  A wearable33 can comfortably be worn or carried by an individual all day long and monitor several biometrics  like body temperature, blood pressure, diabetes levels, transpiration, heart beat rate, etc. Generally, the  wearable technology has some form of communication capability and allows the wearer to access the  information in real time. Data-input capabilities feature the wearable devices, same as the local storage.  Examples of wearable devices include watches, glasses, contact lenses, e-textiles and smart fabrics,  headbands, beanies and caps, jewellery such as rings, bracelets, and hearing aid-like devices that are  designed to look like earrings.  j. Indoor positioning systems  The indoor positioning systems (IPS) provide the capability to identify the location of an object or a person  inside a building using radio waves, magnetic fields, acoustic signals, or other sensory information.  k. CE devices  The Consumer Electronic devices (DVDs, cameras, TV sets, PVR, game consoles, etc.) most commonly use  Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication signals and are part of the Home Automation system.  31 Azevedo, S. and McEwan, T.E.

The main part of the M2M Network  domain is the communication between the M2M Gateway(s) and the M2M Application domain. The  communication is performed either over wired networks (e.g., xDSL and PLC) or wireless networks (e.g., 3G  cellular, Wi-Fi and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access - WiMAX). The following list of assets is  not exhaustive and includes some of the most common assets in this domain.  a. Communication protocols  The communication protocol is a key-component in the development of ad-hoc and sensor networks, and is  often susceptible to various threats and attacks. The communication protocol may have various security  vulnerabilities, faults in the code, weak responses, and insecure transport and network layer services.  b. Cooling Systems  Energy efficient and securely operated cooling systems ensure the availability and the proper operations of  ad-hoc and sensor networks.  c. Power Supplies  In general, the power supply systems in routers, switches, servers and computers are critical network assets,  which are extremely vulnerable to physical attacks or failures.  d. Mobile user and location registers  The mobile user and location registers are used to determine the geographic region, and to inform the nodes  about the latest positional information.  e. Radio  Since most ad-hoc and sensor networks are based on wireless communications the radio itself is the  medium, hence radio is an asset in Network domain.  f. PKI  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a state-of-the-art mechanism in confidentiality (encryption) and  authentication for almost every ad-hoc and sensor network application and communication.  g. Appliance controls  Because of recent advancements in ad-hoc and sensor networks, the users can now easily monitor the  services and control remotely the appliances.  h. Addressing servers  The registration and address assignment is important in ad-hoc and sensor networks. They also affect other  services and operations, such as routing. An efficient and resilient addressing solution should be employed.  i. Mobile switches  The telecommunication provider in most cases is a cellular network provider. The system of the provider  consists of mobile user and location registers, mobile base stations, controllers, etc.  j. PSTN switches  The infrastructure networks usually rely on the core network components and may be built from PSTN  backbone switches.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  23  k. Physical security and control systems  Physical security is often underestimated and overlooked in the case of ad-hoc and sensor networks. An  appropriate plan with the necessary control systems is vital to avoid compromising the sensors in the  network.  l. Routers and switches  This group of assets is the core of Network domain. The routers, the DSLAMs, the Session Border Controllers  (SBCs), and the network switches form the data grid over which the Devices Domain and the Application  domain interconnect.  m. Mobile base stations and controllers  The Mobile base stations and controllers’ topology affects the routing in ad-hoc and sensor networks, and  the performance in sensory data exchange. Most of the applications can benefit from the topology of the  sensor nodes and the data routing to the other sensor nodes, an external base station, or a controller.  n. Servers  The server system that assists the operation of network connectivity is another asset in the Network domain.  Important services included in this domain are addressing and DNS naming, private key identification for  devices or users, monitoring and administration of network traffic, etc.  o. WBSNs / WBANs  The Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) or the Body Area Networks (WBANs) are emerging wireless  networks of wearable computing devices. In general, this type of networks has interest in applications, such  as ehealth, remote measuring of health information, assisting the patients and elderly, home automations,  and monitoring human-body changes.  3.2.4 Operational domain  Automating operations, which until recently were manipulated by people, may ensure effectiveness in  meeting customer requirements using as few resources as necessary. Some typical examples of the assets  involved in this domain are listed below.  a. Physical security  The physical security of monitoring and safeguarding access of areas/zones, objects, or people is an  operation of ad-hoc and sensor networks. Typical examples include alarm systems, video and camera  surveillance applications, etc.  b. Control systems  The control systems that give access in buildings, houses or specific areas are assets of ad-hoc and sensor  networks operations. One case is the use of smart grid to facilitate the development of appliance control  systems. These systems consist34 of energy storage devices, transmission cables, smart substations and  transformers, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Home Area Networks (HANs). In general, these  systems are utilized as Home Automation systems (e.g. Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning -HVAC),  building or campus automation systems, etc.  34 Syal, M.M. and Ofei-Amoh, K.

Utilities  These networks may provide automation solutions in cases of measurement, provisioning and billing of  water, electricity, oil, heat, etc.  In the following sections, we analyse the attributes and characteristics of several use case types in the  abovementioned domains to identify the respective assets. The mapping between these use cases and the  assets is also summarized in Annex A.  3.2.5 Product/Business processes domain  Ad-hoc and sensor networks may provide automation solutions for many areas of business organization and  operation. Some of the assets in this domain are listed below.  a. Supply and provisioning  This is a high value area for a product-making company and needs to be accomplished in high speed and  precision. Sensors and actuators are used to automate processes like freight supply, product packaging etc.  Additionally, software in the application domain (e.g. Business Support systems - BSS) provides monitoring  and managing abilities to the company’s human resources. The vending machines are also common in this  area.  b. Manufacturing  In a modern manufacturing environment, the manufacturing systems heavily utilize ad-hoc and sensor  network operations to improve the quality of service, manage the manufacturing resources efficiently, and  achieve near zero down time operations.  c. Healthcare  In healthcare, various ad-hoc and sensor networks applications are widely used for monitoring and data  archiving. These applications should pay great attention to security, due to the data sensitivity and privacy  issues. Sensors are often integrated and embedded with health monitoring devices providing real-time or  batch-driven data.  d. Transportation  The fleet management issue is important for the business and affects the efficiency of the product  distribution, the product cost and the business economics in general. By automating and monitoring the  fleet, the emissions, road safety and toll payment, and the business profit are in-all eventually better  controlled.  e. Home automation  Recently, the use of ad-hoc and sensor networks in home automation has gained increased attention and  several solutions have evolved, such as remote monitoring of electricity, adjusting the water supply,  controlling the gas consumption, and managing sensor equipped appliances.  3.3 Use case types  By collecting the information, the ad-hoc and sensor networks for M2M communications threats can be  classified, including information on risks, opportunities, threat agents, impact, vulnerabilities, etc. The use  cases that have been analysed and studied are based on the most common areas of sensor networks and  interest. Due to the large heterogeneity in the type of the devices, their capabilities (i.e. communication,  computational), the network domains, and the applications, we need to assess the most representative  environments. Several small and inexpensive portable devices can be used for wireless sensor network  applications for both military and civilian use. These sensor networks can be used to transfer the captured  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  25  information to the destination by detecting any available environmental change. For instance, a civilian  application can include some type of habitat monitoring, health monitoring and home automation, while  the military applications could be used for tracking the enemies and improved efficiency.  We analyse five use cases which are listed below:  1. Ultra-wideband (UWB) communication and applications35  2. RFID applications and protocols  3. Mobile cloud computing and mobile social networking  4. Software-defined ad-hoc, and sensor networks  5. Body networks and eHealth  Concerning the UWB transmission technology36, there have been considerable advancements and  innovations recently. UWB includes features35 that could be exploited in ad-hoc networks37. With respect to  RFID applications and protocols, a typical example and common practice used in several business cases,  products and web-sites is the smart tagging of things. Various forms of contactless communications and  technologies can be utilized, such as Near-Field Communication (NFC), Quick-Response (QR) codes, and  Bluetooth.  Mobile and cloud computing (MCC) is emerging rapidly, providing various technological, research and  business opportunities. MCC technology refers to the mobile devices, mobile computing interfaces, mobile  operators and cloud service providers that deliver increased computational resources, capabilities and  functionalities to the mobile users. MCC involves mobile communications, mobile hardware, mobile  software, cloud and network technologies for utilizing different services, and routing and packet forwarding  in heterogeneous and distributed environments.  Software-defined ad-hoc wireless, and sensor networks may include several nodes spread across the area.  New nodes may join/leave the networks, and can participate in data processing and forwarding. Based on  the capabilities of the nodes, they can provide different communication services (i.e. security, data  retention) and speeds. Finally, body networks and eHealth information sharing technologies are used  increasingly and extensively to provide or access the data of the objects (i.e. patients, home & elderly care  centre monitoring for chronic and elderly patients). The characteristics of these uses cases are presented in  the following tables.  35 Zhuang, W., Shen, X. and Bi, Q. (2003). Ultra-wideband wireless communications.

Threats Taxonomy  Threat taxonomy is a classification of threat types and threat groups at various levels of detail. The purpose  of such a taxonomy is to establish a point of reference for the encountered threats, while providing a  possibility to shuffle, arrange, amend and detail threat definitions. Therefore, a threat taxonomy is dynamic  and should be used to maintain a consistent view on threats based on the collected information.  The current threat mind map (Figure 6) is based on the ENISA Threat Taxonomy70, which has collected and  combined numerous threats from various sources into a unified and united threat catalogue. During the  ENISA Threat classification exercise, several other existing threat catalogues were analysed to consolidate  the security and risk management information.  In the current study, we have also considered threats in the fields of operational and product/business  processes domains to extend the ENISA’s work which focused in physical threats, information security, and  cyber-space areas  A detailed presentation of the threats taxonomy in ad-hoc wireless and sensor networking is provided in  Annex B.  70 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Mapping Threats to Assets  According to the ENISA Glossary71, a threat is “any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely  impact an asset through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of  service”.  Based on the identified assets, a taxonomy of relevant threats impeding the ad-hoc sensor networks or at  least significant parts is developed.  Since this study focuses on information security, the presented threat taxonomy mainly covers cyber security  threats. However, for a faultless operation, physical assets are also required and, therefore, several specific  non-IT threats are assumed.  A full taxonomy map of ad-hoc and sensor network threats is shown in Annex B. The taxonomy of threats is  based on the first and second level categorization suggested by the ENISA Threat Taxonomy 2013-201570. In  the following sections, a short description of the most popular threats is presented.  5.1 Threat Group: Unintentional damage / loss of information or IT assets  The following group of threats refers to those damages or loss of information caused by human errors in the  administration of systems or misconfiguration of systems. Additionally, these damages may be caused by an  unintentional intervention or by the actual loss of devices or of part of them.  5.1.1 Threat: Inadequate design and planning improper adaptation  The scope of planning and designing sensor networks is the better area coverage in a way that permits the  unblocked access between the end users (e.g. an application, a business process) and the primary data which  are collected from the monitored or controlled area72. Any error or lack of consideration in the design could  cause low availability or downtime and resource consumption.  Ad-hoc networks constantly change architecture, due to the node mobility. Their communication basis is the  transmission between neighbouring nodes73. The lack of proper design could lead to network instability and  resource over-consumption in every change of the number of participants (nodes).  The fact that the ad-hoc and sensor network assets have limited or no computational abilities and low  resources is one factor of their behaviour. Another factor is that the environment or the area targeted to be  monitored in each case, could be hostile, open to unattended or unauthorized access, constantly changing  (due to mobility) and geographically wide28 an inadequate design could result to the improper or insufficient  area coverage, to assets’ miscommunication or to assets’ resource exhaustion, trying to overcome design  problems.  71 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 90(1), pp.67-76.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  37  The data collected and transmitted in these networks are of high value and sensitivity (e.g. Private  Healthcare Information - PHI). However, the low computational power of assets makes it difficult or  impossible to protect the data and the data transmission itself. A method of data protection through  encryption and decryption, though affective, is highly demanding in computing resources. An inadequate  design of how this problem will be overcome may permit information to be compromised74.  Further to the above, the lack of planning or the existence of a design error may allow the existence of  software (Applications) that do not take under consideration the devices power and computing limitations28  with software update (i.e. cars and other devices).  Assets targeted by this threat group are those from the Device Domain and the asset Data in the Application  Domain.  5.1.2 Threat: Using information from an unreliable source  Any system or device with computational power and an operating system (OS) is vulnerable to OS exploits.  This threat occurs mainly due to the vulnerable versions of preinstalled software used in corporate  environments. In most cases, third-party applications can be installed and activated in the devices, posing  potential risks to the enterprise. These applications may hide various software faults, security bugs,  vulnerabilities, and coding errors that can be exploited to an adversary under certain conditions. This is an  unintentional threat, because the software and the applications risks could exist by design.  As reported in the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Report75, the cybercrime events show an increasing  interest in personally identifiable information (PII) and high-value data (e.g. health-records) since 2014.  Besides, in the case of business-critical applications (e.g. billing, e-Health), sensitive and personal may  traverse ad-hoc and sensor networks. Therefore, these networks are susceptible to attacks and malicious  activities.  All the assets in all Domains can be a target for this threat.  5.1.3 Threat: Erroneous use or administration of devices and systems  The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)76 are software elements, which are used by software  developers in their attempt to construct applications or graphical user interfaces. Cloud service providers  utilise APIs to allow access to cloud-based services77. The APIs can be used by several devices and  applications simultaneously for various purposes. However, it is difficult to determine who should or should  not be granted access78. Since an API is a public library, the unauthorized access and nefarious use of the  APIs content cannot be prevented easily. It should be noted that via this access, any data, system or service  of the network becomes vulnerable.  74 Zhou, F.S.X.D.Y. (2016).

All assets in all Domains can be a target for this threat.  5.1.4 Threat: Loss of devices  In ad-hoc and sensor networks, the threat of physically losing devices can affect the stability of the network.  In most cases, the areas that sensor networks are designed to cover are geographically wide. As the risk is  considerably high, this leads to the use of a big number79 of devices to achieve a sufficient coverage of the  area. These areas (e.g. underwater, underground, terrestrial, etc.)80 could also provide open access to  anyone. Moreover, the network’s nodes are mostly devices with small size79; this characteristic makes them  vulnerable to robbery incidents.  Further in ad-hoc networks, the covered area is undetermined and may change in real-time81. The number  of devices is also changing constantly. In addition to the above, the nodes usually are small devices (e.g.  smartphone, smart-card, RFID, etc.), which are easy to be stolen containing sensitive or personal  information.  These characteristics make the ad-hoc and sensor networks and, more specifically, the assets in the Device  Domain vulnerable to Loss of Devices threat.  5.1.5 Threat: Damage caused by a third party  A malware is a hostile fragment of programming code that targets sensitive information inside a system. For  instance, the term information-stealing mobile malware describes the malware which is remotely accessing  a system and is focused in gathering information when installed with the main purpose of targeted  advertisement.  Data leakage82 is the illegitimate outcome produced by a third-party application which is focused on  gathering personal information due to the existence of critical vulnerabilities or integrated backdoors on the  source code of the applications. Consequently, the information is then used without the owner’s permission  for several malicious activities such as the exposition to the black market83. The data in question is related  to the customer’s market profile.  Asset targeted by this threat is Data Domain from the Application Domain.  79 Mahdavi, M. and Ismail, M. (2016).

The recovery and restoration of the services take the  longest time; in 2014 the recovery time lasted 81 hours85, while in 2013 it was more than 50 hours84. Taking  into consideration the great exposure to the numerous users and habitants, this depicts that disasters not  only last long, but also, they are the most difficult to manage.  Nowadays, we witness an increased number of interlinked sensors, integrated into the infrastructure and  buildings, and incorporated in various systems and services. These sensors can be monitored and controlled  by various means (i.e. smart phones, workstations over the internet), and they reveal behavioural patterns  of the monitored objects86. Thus, it is critical to ensure the data integrity and the service operations of WSNs  against any natural or environmental disaster. In the ad-hoc wireless and sensor networks, the nodes in the  infrastructure are often fixed, and in several cases WSNs are utilized in monitoring and security services (i.e.  monitor human activities and the environment like climate control, gather data for medical diagnostics,  transport critical-mission data and confidential measurements, provide the location information to the  corresponding receiver). Still, the WSNs are also used by weather, emergency response and disaster  management systems for immediate inference upon network and service disruptions87. The sensory  measurements are collected on a regular basis by spatially dispersed networks distributed over a certain  region. Thus, WSNs can enhance the surveillance and awareness of any status changes in disaster  responses88, and prevent massive destructions from natural or environmental disasters.  Nevertheless, the WSNs are susceptible to many natural or environmental disasters, as any other IT  component or network. They are vulnerable to the power failures and cuts, communication problems and  delays, jamming and channel errors, hardware problems, physical damage, insecure routing, and failures in  data aggregation.  Assessing the impact of natural and environmental disasters is of paramount importance and will facilitate  to identify the factors and methods that can contribute to reduce WSNs damage and service disruptions  after natural disasters occur.  Assets targeted by this threat include the assets from the Device domain, the Network domain and the  assets Control Systems, Physical Security, Vending Machines and Road Safety.  84 Karsberg, C., Skouloudi, C. and Dekker, D.

These issues are highly associated  with the eHealth and pHealth sensors’ attack surface. The ad-hoc and wireless network sensors may  encounter harsh and anomalous physiological conditions in the remote monitoring, which require the  continuous supervision to provide intensive care. The operations and the concentration of data by the  medical sensors such as in the case of the cardio net system89, should be managed by the doctors and  nursery. Upon receiving the data, the sensors dispatch the data to the back-end server for processing by  using a short-range wireless network. However, during this process, the WBANs are threatened mainly by  exhausting attacks, which are namely: (a) the collision attacks, (b) the denial of sleep attacks and (c) the  selfish attacks 90.  In the field of Mobile Healthcare Networks (MHNs), where wearable sensor devices communicate based on  the device-to-device (D2D) concept, the protection of the personal data plays a significant role. Hence, if the  personal data (e.g. patient’s daily health data) is processed in the Cloud, it should be protected from being  accessed by unauthorized parties, e.g. insurance company or a mobile intruder who can disseminate health  records through an Online Social Network. By that means, the Quality of Privacy (QoP) is of great  importance91.  Sensitive banking information can be maliciously retrieved in the case of near field communication (NFC)  cards. The attacker can utilize NFC radio waves and then access to data stored on the victim’s card92.  Furthermore, social engineering fraud can also be a way to abuse personal data in ad-hoc or mobile  networks93.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Applications Domain and Device Domain and  the assets Physical Security, Supply and Provisioning and Healthcare.  5.3.2 Threat: Failure to meet contractual requirements  Failure to meet contractual requirements, or break a contractual one could result to security incidents.  89 European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

Stakeholders prone to break the rules are94 (a) the operators (i.e. which have a direct link with  physical infrastructure) and (b) the digital service providers (which have a cross border nature).  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.4 Threat Group: Outages  Due to the nature of the ad-hoc wireless and sensor networks, specific constraints exist. Apart from the  limited storage capacity and computational costs95, energy consumption is among the critical success factors  and important constraints for ad-hoc and sensor networks.  5.4.1 Threat: Internet outage  We should not underestimate the great importance of evidence of internet outage reports and incidents, as  nowadays heavily internet-dependent businesses rely extensively on the Internet services, and, thus, any  Internet outage is likely to hit business operations severely. Even though most businesses have defined the  processes and the countermeasures to respond to internet outages, there are still several complex  dependencies, capacity issues, performance delays, and business continuity risks in the case of internet  failures96. The internet outage can be caused by numerous factors either accidentally or intentionally; human  errors, problematic and erroneous maintenance works, BGP misconfiguration and massive route leaks97,  failed international cable affecting mobile and data domestic operations, and cyberspace dangers and  cyberattacks98,99 result in Internet blackouts or brownouts. Not only the service disruptions damage the  brand of the service provider, but they also create several business implications and frustration to the  users100.  94 Weber, R. and Studer, E. (2016).

This results in service outage and disruptions, as no further  legitimate request can receive any further resource. By injecting invalid requests, the resources are  exhausted and this raises denial of service attacks.  A common example of network outage is the outage of cable networks. If the power or network cables are  unprotected, they can be damaged accidentally or intentionally. Often, the cables are pulled out by the staff  as they stumble over them, unauthorized personnel (i.e. cleaning services) unplug the cable and plug the  loose end into an empty \"hole\" that seems to fit, or the cable connection is abruptly terminated (i.e. a ship’s  anchor accidentally slices internet cables101). The unavailability and loss of support services essential for  proper operation of the information system and the business processes are often causing disruptions and  outages.  Intermittent problems and outages in a wireless networks environment are also likely due to technical  exploits and vulnerabilities (i.e. IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15 families). In the case of outages of mobile  networks, aside from the communication problems with the networks (i.e. 3G, GSM, LTE, satellite links),  several operational and business issues can arise that result in service disruptions and outages. Insolvency,  financial instabilities, subcontractor’s issues, outsourcing implications, difficulties in contractual  arrangements are few typical reasons that the service providers may fail to deliver the expected quality of  the services and lead to impairments. Additionally, the business processes may fail because of misalignment  and inappropriate communication with the service provider, or even because of inadequately documented  procedures102.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain, and Product/business processes Domain.  5.4.3 Threat: Loss of support services  Another typical example of outage is the unavailability of the necessary support services, which are required  for the proper operation of the networks and the systems.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain, and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5 Threat Group: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  The fact that the base of ad-hoc and sensor networks is a group of devices with low or no data storage and  low power autonomy makes these networks vulnerable to nefarious activity attacks. This group of attacks  includes intentionally created threats aiming at the infrastructure.  101Fortin, J. (2012). East African Internet Cables Damaged by Ship’s Anchor Near Mombasa.

Sensor networks are met in critical deployment  environments, like healthcare systems. Thus, DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks are of great  importance to be mitigated by timely detecting them103. In ambient assisted living (AAL)104, especially in  eHealth environments, the multi-hop nature of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is vulnerable against  unwanted rerouted traffic. Therefore, such a DoS attack situation (e.g. hello flooding) can be compromised  by utilizing resilient routing protocols. Although there are several different characteristics105 between WSNs  and MANETs and several specific attacks targeted at each type of these networks106, they are both  susceptible to malicious node and routing attacks. For instance, in a flooding attack, the attacker tries to  drain its victim’s resources by remotely sending numerous connection establishment requests. In a cloud- based system, which could be a cornerstone component of an IoT solution, this kind of attack severely affects  the Autonomic Manager, which is the component in charge of controlling and self-tuning the necessary  changes in the system’s life cycle107.  However, many ambiguities exist in how we can theoretically define a DoS attack in ad-hoc and sensor  networks. Nevertheless, emerging research work108 has illustrated formal methods that evidently define  such an attack situation.  DoS attacks are mainly caused by109: (a) producing varied effects on different OSI levels on the target (i.e.  Slowloris110), (b) amplification / reflection techniques (i.e. DNS and NTP amplification, reflection change) and  (c) flooding mechanisms (e.g. ping of death), (d) protocol exploit attacks (e.g. TCP SYN attacks) and (e)  malformed packet attacks (e.g. land attack and fragmented packet attacks)111. For example, the resource  starvation attack can be achieved by sending many packets that require authentication resulting in initiating  103 Abbas, H., Latif, R., Latif, S. and Masood, A. (2016).

When malicious nodes are connected to the internal  network, they can launch different types of attacks, such as routing poisoning or packet dropping. Based on  the characteristics of the attacks, they can be distinguished as goal-oriented attacks, performer-oriented  attacks and layer-oriented attacks113. Concerning the performer-oriented attacks, the inside attackers can  perform black hole and grey hole attacks114,115. During a black-hole attack, all the network traffic is  redirected, which results in data packet loss. In the case of a grey hole attack, there is a selective forwarding  of data packets. These types of attacks usually happen in mesh networks.  Sensor networks are prone to jamming mechanisms, which means that an adversary may inject unwanted  signals into the communication channel. These signals can entirely engage the channel so that authentic  communications cannot take place or the packets in transmission be corrupted 116. In a DoS attack incident  using jamming techniques, energy issues exist regarding the attacker counterpart that may run out of  energy, when its energy budget is limited, and may also result in a node failure. In this vein, state-of-the-art  ongoing works have aimed at how the attacker can save energy by utilizing an estimation on whether to jam  the channel to degrade the ability of the intrusion detection117.  As the technology shift brings out new advances in ad-hoc networking, mobile devices and sensors can  dominate the telecommunication market in the not-so-distant future. Moving towards a mobile and cloud  networking convergence, multiple security issues arise while mobile-based agents lack a shared  language/ontology and thus they are prone to DoS attacks by classifying their nature118.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5.2 Threat: Malicious code / software / activity  Ad-hoc and sensor networks should be monitored for environmental parameters, structural integrity of the  built environment and usage of urban spaces, services and utilities. However, the sensors can be  compromised through malicious injected code or by exploiting their physical interface. An attacker may seek  to elicit an inappropriate system response, (e.g. triggering an overload on a power grid and lead to partial  shutdown) or to mask a desired system response (e.g. silencing an intrusion alarm)119.  Due to the potential vulnerabilities of the actuators and sensors, it is crucial to study and analyse the  malicious code (i.e. malware) propagation within the networks. For propagation analysis purposes, recent  112 Basicevic, I., Ocovaj, S. and Popovic, M. (2015). Evaluation of entropy-based detection of outbound denial-of-service  attacks in edge networks.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  45  research has introduced mathematical models in a per-device (i.e. autonomous) manner120. Furthermore,  modern malware is characterized by sophisticated obfuscation techniques, and recent research approaches  have led to novel detection and classification techniques121.  The concept of Hardware Trojan (HWT) emerges in wireless sensor networks. A HWT is a deliberate  modification of the hardware during the fabrication process and can be designed to quietly monitor, to  actively send out sensitive information, or to make the infected host device unusable122. Within the IoT  ecosystem, the sensor nodes can be deployed in a distributed network to mutually acknowledge the  trustworthiness of their sensor neighbour. Under this scheme, we can detect information leakages which  are caused by a HWT123.  Ad-hoc networks may employ mobile devices in a specific purpose, like for gaming, such as in the famous  games Blizzard’s World of Warcraft (WOW) and Linden Research’s Second Life (SL)124. In this case, massive  multiplayer online games (MMOG) can be exposed to malicious activities.  The assets targeted by these threats include asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5.3 Threat: Manipulation of hardware and software  Contrary to the outsiders (i.e. individuals outside the network access perimeter) who are not able to  communicate directly with the network, the insiders have increased access to the resources and privileged  knowledge of the internal network. This insider attack is a growing concern for most implementations, as  this attack is more difficult to be prevented because of the unknown attack patterns and the variety of the  internal attacks. If an alert for an invalid pattern is received, an extra analysis is required to verify whether  there is a malicious attempt or not.  Some malicious activities are also likely to go undetected125, as they can bypass the authentication and  authorization methods, since they are already connected to the internal network. Rogue access points,  wireless access points that are installed without any prior consent or knowledge, may expose the internal  information to the outside world and could provide illegitimate access to unauthorized users.  The assets targeted by these threats include asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  120 del Rey, A., Hernández Encinas, A., Hernández Guillén, J., Martín Vaquero, J., Queiruga Dios, A. and Rodríguez  Sánchez, G.

Security in sensor networks, ch. 11, p.275. CRC Press.  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  46  5.5.4 Threat: Manipulation of information  WSNs are commonly utilizing a many-to-one communication pattern meaning that various sensors collect  and send data to the single one control centre (i.e. the sink node or the base station). This is the reason why  WSNs are vulnerable to sinkhole attacks. The attacker claims itself as having the shortest path to the base  station and, therefore, it can remotely alter the passing data and by that means to threat the network  operation126.  Among the various models proposed for M2M communications and the IoT by various researchers, Semantic  middleware and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) oriented middleware are based on the Extensible  Mark-up Language (XML) metadata exchange for interoperability, while the SOA and Representational State  Transfer (REST) based systems are more popular in the enterprise environments. Main exploits related to  the above are127: (a) duplication of a device, (b) black hole or sink hole attack (which are also DoS incidents)  in the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy (RPL) Networks, (c) replay attacks, when valid data is  retransmitted or delayed by an adversary to gain illegitimate and unauthorized access, (d) confidentiality  compromise, when the relayed data can be manipulated, (e) active introduction of  network traffic (i.e.  spoofing, impersonation) to send malicious traffic to other nodes, (f) passive monitoring of network traffic  (i.e. sniffing, snooping) in Zigbee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks because of their weak implementation of the  nodes encryption keys (i.e. they are transmitted in clear text). Examples of important issues on the routing  process are the routing table overflow (i.e. transmit false information to the neighbours, flood their tables  and hence deny the real routes) and the routing table poisoning (i.e. advertise a false route with the smallest  hop and the latest sequence number) in the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol128.  The assets targeted by these threats include asset groups Device domain, Network domain and the  Applications domain.  5.5.5 Threat: Remote activity  A paradigm on remote activity includes the Botnet utilization in terms of a network of infected machines,  which is controlled by a remote machine and aims to initiate attacks against more victim machines. In terms  of mobile computing and by leveraging the advantages of M2M communications in masking malicious code  propagation, MobiBots can infect and coordinate these devices in a large-scale manner. For example, a  MobiBot can infect a 96-node network in only few minutes and totally can scale up to 10,000-node  networks126.  For instance, when it comes to embedded systems in Home Networking, where sensors are a core  component to study, there are specific needs; i.e. connecting to the Internet for firmware updates.  Nowadays, remote firmware updates do not comply to the myth of ultimate security as they are responsible  for distributing malicious content through the Internet. Another example of malicious firmware is the control  on vehicles and their accelerator. Furthermore, another firmware rootkit is responsible for maliciously  manipulating network packets by controlling the CPU of the network interface card (NIC)129.  126 Han, G., Li, X., Jiang, J., Shu, L. and Lloret, J.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  47  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, Network Domain, Operational  Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.5.6 Threat: Targeted attacks  Mobile participatory sensing130 takes advantage of the sensing resources available in mobile phones for an  in-depth analysis of about the participating individuals and their environment. In this ad-hoc networking  concept, when downloading the tasks from the application server or reporting sensor readings to the server,  the participant’s privacy information131 (e.g. identity and location) can be revealed even if a pseudonym is  used. For example, a reverse look-up address search may reveal their name, as participants typically  commute between their domicile and workplace. Furthermore, the current participants’ location can also  be identified based on the collected sensor readings. For example, pictures, audio samples, and pollution  data may include unique features, exposing the participants’ whereabouts.  Targeted attacks also exist in the physical layer of any sensor communication. The Spectrum Sensing Data  Falsification (SSDF) or else the Byzantine attack132 is conducted in pursuit of two objectives: (a) vandalism  and (b) exploitation. The first objective refers to interference to the primary systems by means of the  malicious users reporting channel vacancy which indicates that the channel is busy. Thus, the sensing data  induce the dedicated node (i.e. the fusion centre – FC) to allow other sensors to have false access to the  channel. The second objective refers to exclusion of idle channels. Here, the attackers send channel busy  information when their sensing data concludes that the channel is idle.  Likewise, the back off mechanism manipulates the back off time for the case of the medium access control  (MAC) and especially the IEEE 802.11. The back off misbehaviour133, or else back off attack, is unpredictable  in such networks and results in a node which intends to acquire the channel with a higher chance by reducing  its back off (i.e. waiting) time.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain and Network Domain.  5.5.7 Threat: Social Engineering  In the scope of M2M communications, as the core of the IoT ecosystem, which also include humans, social  engineering remains a major security threat to individuals and organizations, and is often launched through  phone (phone fraud) or email (phishing). Recent studies argue that a correlation exists between the  individuals’ intention to resist social engineering and their security actions (i.e. self-reported or observed) in  multiple cultural environments134.  The growing trend towards BYOD (bring your own device) has deteriorated the problem. Ad-hoc networking  and vulnerable mobile applications can be misused to conduct attacks for user-ID spoofing or hijack user  130 Holler, J., Tsiatsis, V., Mulligan, C., Karnouskos, S., Avesand, S. and Boyle, D.

As such, the baiting attack refers to attackers who leave malware-infected storage  media in a location where it is likely to be found by future victims. Another example is phishing by means of  the attempt to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity135. Furthermore, the  waterhole attack refers to compromising a website that is likely to be of interest of the chosen victim135.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain and  Network Domain.  5.5.8 Threat: Unauthorized activities  Stealing the identity within an ad-hoc and sensor network can be achieved by unleashing a Sybil attack136.  Here, the adversaries can create many malicious identities either by forging a new identify or by stealing an  identity from a legitimate node.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset group Device Domain.  5.6 Threat Group: Eavesdropping, Interception and Hijacking  This group includes threats that rely on the alteration/manipulation of the communication link between two  parties. These attacks do not require the installation of additional tools or software on the victims’  infrastructure. Insecure network access is a known threat, when connecting to insecure networks (i.e. public  hot-spots) that are exposed to several attacks due to their openness and public characteristics. Usually, they  are lacking security measures and policy rules, which also facilitate the eavesdropping or malicious  activities137.  5.6.1 Threat: Network Reconnaissance  WSNs are highly distributed ad-hoc networks. Due to specific limitations of their nodes communication  radius, they route their traffic through a base station (BS); or else in a hop-by-hop basis. The selective forward  attack is an example in which the attacker places a malicious sensor node on a path between a data source  and a base station138. Hence, the attacker can identify and process network traffic at its illegitimate  advantage.  Due to the unstable wireless channel that is common in such networks, the packet loss rate is high and varies  from time to time. Hence, it is difficult to distinguish between a malicious drop and normal packet loss.  Recent studies propose alternative data forwarding behaviours of sensor nodes per the deviation of the  monitored against the estimated normal loss139.

The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Application Domain, Device Domain, Network  Domain, Operational Domain and Product/business processes Domain.  5.6.2 Threat: Interception of information  Spectrum sensing is at the core of operational techniques seen in a wireless network. Interception of  information may occur. The most famous such action is called primary user emulation (PUE). In such an  incident, the attackers may modify the radio transmission frequency to mimic the primary signal (i.e. the  signal by the primary user – PU). Therefore, the secondary users (SU) erroneously identify the attackers as a  PU. The PUE attackers can be classified as142 (a) selfish and malicious (i.e. stealing bandwidth) and (b) static  and mobile (i.e. per their location).  In the mobile computing environment, various techniques for malware detection exist, such as dynamic  program-execution based mechanisms for the Android operating system. Nevertheless, malicious intruders  can easily prevail on them by deploying dump code blocks and API calls143. The latter is accommodated in an  advanced persistent threat (APT), which results in passively and maliciously capturing information from the  network.  In a company or corporation, the interception of information is one of the tools for corporate espionage or  cyber-espionage144. The high skilled personnel employed by companies today tend to use these skills for  their own profit by intercepting and selling inside information or by operating as external agents and trying  to intercept information of opponent companies. In the first case where they intercept within the company,  the existence of ad-hoc access to the company’s Intranet or the transmission of data over the air, makes  cyber-espionage more easy to be successful.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, Network Domain, and  Product/business processes Domain.  5.6.3 Threat: Man in the middle / Session hijacking  Under certain circumstances, a malicious node can enter the network and pretend to be another node. Once  the node joins the network, then spoofing and data interception may occur. In other cases, this type of attack  is known as man-in-the-middle (MiMA), as the nodes can intercept the communication and receive the  information, and relay wrong information between two parties communicating directly. This threat can lead  140 Al-Hamadi, H. and Chen, I. (2015). Adaptive Network Defence Management for Countering Smart Attack and  Selective Capture in Wireless Sensor Networks.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  50  to system instability or to abnormal behaviour due to fake information and even collisions of packets due to  increased transmission requests or intercepted connections145.  Based on recent research146,147, although ad-hoc and sensor networks as well as RFID systems deploy  distance bounding (DB) cryptographic protocols, they still obtain considerable high security mechanisms to  defend against illegitimate actions. DB protocols are vulnerable in mafia fraud147 (or else grandmaster  problem) and terrorist fraud attacks146. In the mafia fraud, an attacker executes a man-in-the-middle attack  between a verifier (i.e. the one who verifies the location of the user) and a user and erroneously informs the  latter about the location of the user node. An instance of this attack is a physically located ATM machine. In  a terrorist fraud, a dishonest user colludes with a “terrorist” attacker in a way that the latter can erroneously  inform the verifier node about the location of the user node.  Another example is the applications hosted by Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) which are described as  a part of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) ecosystem. These networks include a variety of emerging  applications, such as traffic management and control, nearby information services, and real-time  information routing calculations. Such applications, which belong in the superset of Dedicated Short-Range  Communications (DSRC) applications family, can facilitate cooperative collision warnings148 and emergencies  notifications as well as commercial related applications which enable internet access, map navigation and  fuel savings. In more detail, when it comes to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)  communications using the road-side units (RSUs)149,150, major privacy issues could arise under man-in-the- middle attacks. These attacks are feasible because of the unencrypted communication150 between the RSUs  and the vehicles.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, and  the assets eHealth and cloud-based applications.  5.7 Threat Group: Failures / Malfunction  5.7.1 Threat: Failure of devices or systems  Akin to any other computer machinery, sensor nodes suffer from software bugs that potentially end up in  either a temporal out-of-service condition or in a complete failure of these devices. Offline bug fixing and  self-healing are two techniques151 that can be used to detect and deal with these conditions before the  deployment or during runtime.  145 Dong, Z., Espejo, R., Wan, Y. and Zhuang, W.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  51  In addition to the above, a failure of systems can be dramatically harmful not only for the devices they  employ, but also for the potential impact to the human population they accommodate. For instance, the  computer worm named Stuxnet, employed to attack the Natanz nuclear facility located in Iran, exploited the  PLCs in the industrial control systems infrastructure. This incident152,153 highlighted that machinery design  errors and vulnerabilities as well as the human factor154 can even lead to fatal accidents.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, but  also the assets Manufacturing and Control Systems.  5.7.2 Threat: Failure or disruption of communication links  Jamming attacks have been a major problem for ad-hoc and sensor networks and they are increasingly  concerning the military and disaster response state authorities. The jamming device seeks to choose a  location by choosing the same channel the nodes are using, so that the data is blocked or disrupted from  successful transmission. The disruption of communication links is also threatened in an alternative manner  by155 (a) constant jammer (i.e. who continuously transmits randomly), (b) deceptive jammer (i.e. constantly,  but not randomly), (c) random jammer (i.e. randomly and reserving power), (d) reactive jammer (i.e. listen  to the channel and reserve power). Jamming attacks are considerably severe as the jamming signals are156  (a) resistant to collisions, (b) can travel for longer distances and (c) likely to be transmitted in short durations  (e.g. as an ACK frame).  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, and  the asset Radio.  5.7.3 Threat: Malfunction of equipment  Enterprises and organisations also be affected by equipment failure, e.g. air conditioning, heating or cooling  systems, power supplies.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain, and  the assets Power Supplies and Cooling Systems.  5.7.4 Threat: Disruption of main supply  Electric power transmission and distribution systems are susceptible to attack generally with little risk to the  attacker, a fact well recognized by saboteurs and terrorists.  The assets targeted by these threats include the asset groups Device Domain, and Network Domain.  5.8 Ad-hoc and sensor network assets exposure to threats  In this section the threat exposure of ad-hoc and sensor network assets is summarized and categorized. The  categorization is based on the assessment of the threats’ impact on an asset or an asset group and this  152 Lindsay, J. (2013). Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Warfare.

Threat Agents  In this chapter, we present a list of threat agents categories. Threat agents or threat sources are the  individuals or groups of people who use the threats and vulnerabilities of a system for their purposes. This  study is based on the ENISA Threat Landscape157 2013’s consolidation of several publications. For each threat  agents’ category, we focus on the characteristics158 emission, location, quantity, motivation, rationality,  mobility and skill. The proposed categories are the following:  Corporations often adopt offensive tactics with the motive of gaining an advantage over competitors. They  usually commit attacks as outsiders. Also, corporations are rational attackers since they consider the ratio  of outcome gain and cost of the attack. The level of sophistication of their attack methods is relevant to the  size and sector of the company.  Cyber criminals’ motivation is financial gain or in many cases the hacking itself, as a skill test or obstacle.  They are highly skilled and this factor may lead to irrational attacks, where the risk is bigger than the attack’s  expected outcome. They can work in local, national or international groups.  Cyber terrorists group involves terrorists that exploit the impacts of cyber-attacks in critical infrastructure  like energy production system, telecommunications, government sites, etc. Their level is lower than the  cyber criminals and they commit more rational attacks. Their motivation is usually politics or religion. They  are considered as outside agents and can also work in groups.  Script kiddies use existing computer scripts or code to hack. They lack the expertise to create their own tools.  Their motivation is the thrill of danger. The attacks committed by them are mostly naïve since they do not  have the background to estimate the outcome/risk ratio or it is indifferent to them.  Online social hackers (hacktivists) are activists that use hacking as a tool. This group is like cyber terrorists.  Their motive is also politics or social matters; their skill level may vary and they may work in groups. They  target critical public infrastructure.  Employees are insiders that may be responsible for unintentional damage due to error or nefarious attacks  in collaboration with outsiders intentionally or to make personal profit. They provide inside information and  make the targeted system extremely vulnerable.  Nation states in the cyberwar and cybercrime have developed extremely sophisticated cyber weapons,  systems with resources and high level experts. These characteristics makes them prominent threat agents.  Natural disasters are not controlled by an adversary group; however, they should be considered as a threat  agent for ad-hoc and sensor networks. Mainly sensor networks are vulnerable to natural disaster since the  network nodes could be in a wide area of rough or open to access environments (i.e. underwater,  underground, flying, spread in a wide terrestrial area, etc.).  157 European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

Vulnerabilities and Risks in Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks  Ad-hoc and sensor networks deployment is significantly increasing not only due to the increasing volume of  IoT devices, but also due to the industrial and research interest ad-hoc and sensor networks have attracted  since the '80s. “Smart <anything>” (e.g. cities, buildings, vehicles, home appliances, phones etc.) is a big  trend and, hence, these network vulnerabilities have become a major issue among researchers and  practitioners. Thus, publicly available information on ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M  communications security issues widely originates from research, standardisation and industrial activities.  Henceforth, sensors and their significance on the M2M communications paradigm are about to change some  aspects of what can we consider something as vulnerable. These networks are characterized by flexible  architecture, spatial nature, the communication means, and the complexity of the devices. To extract this  information, we focus on standardization organisations like National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU),  on governmental authorities like Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Qatar's National  Centre for Security but also on published research works. More details are presented in the next chapter.  In this chapter, a short description of the vulnerabilities and risks for ad-hoc and sensor networks is provided.  A thorough assessment of the related good practices is presented in the next chapter.  7.1 Ad-hoc and sensor networks vulnerabilities  The ad-hoc and sensor networks akin to any other IT system suffer from emerging threats and obscure  vulnerabilities in every of the five domains, related to confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy and  authenticity159. More specifically, the major vulnerabilities in these networks concern the device security,  the data protection, the communication integrity and availability (for both the protocols and hardware  involved), the business process availability, privacy, and the operation stability. The device security is mostly  handled with the use of authentication methods and the appropriate monitoring tools. The authentication  methods in collaboration with data classification aim to ensure the protection of data. With the proper  management and specialized protocol techniques, the network communication can be secured. The risk  management procedures also lead to the business process availability and operation stability.  The resource exhaustion of devices is a vulnerability of ad-hoc and sensor networks, because of the nature  of these devices (i.e. small devices, with low-level of power independency)160. This can be eliminated with  data classification, appropriate management and simulation/visualization/testing activities.  The use of wireless communication161 in ad-hoc and sensor networks potentially gives rise to certain  vulnerabilities owning to the nature of the communication channel (i.e. open air, water). Besides, the  159 Ashraf, Q. and Habaebi, M. (2015). Autonomic schemes for threat mitigation in Internet of Things.

Another typical example is the access control violation164 that exploits vulnerabilities,  such as unencrypted transmissions caused by specific protocols used for wireless communication between  an access control reader (e.g. RFID reader) and the controller device.  7.2 Ad-hoc and sensor networks risks  Several risks affect the assets and the operations of ad-hoc and sensor networks. Throughout the literature,  it is highlighted that these networks can often be exploited for nefarious activities and eavesdropping attacks  leading to a high data loss risk. Since these networks have a variety of types of physical positioning  (underwater, underground, etc.), the risk of loss of devices in the case of natural or environmental disasters  (earthquake, flood, tornado) is also significant165.  The variety of physical positioning of ad-hoc and sensor networks, the resource constraints of the devices  and the topology of the networks may lead to the leakage of personal or sensitive data. Notably, the privacy  leakage risk behaviours166 in ad-hoc and sensor networks could threaten even human lives.  Overcoming and managing nefarious activities can be accomplished with tighter risk management and  operational controls, and with the availability of specialized tools and techniques that resolve these risks.  Besides, various other risk management techniques (i.e. risk rating, risk matrices) can be adopted to provide  consistency in prioritizing the risks, present the complex risk data, and facilitate the reviews to allocate the  sufficient resources and mitigation methods.  It should be noted risk assessment is an ongoing procedure and the constant monitoring of the network is a  necessity. Therefore, the continuous feedback and risk assessment from the stakeholders will certainly be  an added value at any point of this procedure.  162 Karygiannis, T., Eydt, B., Barber, G., Bunn, L. and Phillips, T.

Gap Analysis  Ad-hoc and sensor networks mainly consist of distributed nodes processing critical, sensitive, mass, and  several other types of data. Moreover, these nodes often form dynamic topologies and incorporate changing  characteristics such as high mobility and fluctuating bandwidth. These characteristics along with the real- time transmission of data streams, the low energy supply, the low processing power, the routing protocols  and the authentication schemes could raise several security concerns.  Various security concerns could also arise regarding the integrated components used in the sensors.  Typically, PLCs can read signals from different sensors, and the integration of sensors with the PLCs in  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems - aiming to optimize the level of production –  should be examined thoroughly considering any security threats and risks. For instance, the electrification  and water supply of cities could be at risk, if we do not consider on a perpetual basis all the appropriate and  effective security countermeasures. In the same context, the integration of ad-hoc and sensor networks in  domestic appliances enables the remote management of houses and offers increased flexibility; however,  there are various security concerns for smart objects and connected devices (i.e. home-automation systems,  smart TVs and refrigerators) threatening the internet interconnection of houses, because of security  vulnerabilities and data privacy issues. In healthcare environments (i.e. hospitals), the fusion of sensors in  clinical operations targeting to monitor the physiological vital signs of patients, leads to critical technical and  legal considerations, such as business and technical restrictions in the implementation, and regulatory  reviews. For example, a patient has the right to know the names of all the employees who may access the  medical records, but on the flip side in the cases of “break-the-glass” and life-critical operations the average  consultation time should be significantly shorter.  The aim of the current gap analysis is to determine the path towards optimizing the countermeasures and  to establish specific target objectives set by the industry, the academic community, and the research work  by the security experts (e.g. Black Hat Conferences) in working out the needs and resources to improve  security and provide better protection. The gap analysis is performed upon all five areas of the M2M  functional Architecture (see Figure 4 M2M Architecture): 1) Application Domain, 2) Device Domain, 3)  Network Domain, 4) Operational Domain, and 5) Product/business processes Domain.  9.1 Gaps on the Device domain  Gap: The sophistication of attacks targeting the communication amongst mobile devices as well as with  backend servers is greater than the level of security that practices offer.  A wide spectrum of attacks targets the weakest component in the M2M architecture which is the  communication amongst the mobile devices of any ad-hoc network. When it comes to mission critical ad- hoc networks which are met in the military area where the lives of individuals depend on them and in  production environments where designs and concealed information are endangered by disclosure, then the  challenge of mitigating vulnerabilities of complex communications is of great importance. For example, the  RFID tags are exposed to certain threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks (see 5.6.3) and tools such as the  Tastic RFID Thief205. The orchestration of the cover-coding method, the press-to-activate switch and the non- revealing identifier format practices (see 8.2, 8.8), mitigate these threats. Thus, the attackers’ attention is  205 Brown F. (2013). RFID Hacking: Live Free or RFID Hard. Black Hat USA 2013. [online] Available at:  https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Brown-RFID-Hacking-Live-Free-or-RFID-Hard-Slides.pdf [Accessed 18 Nov.  2016].  https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Brown-RFID-Hacking-Live-Free-or-RFID-Hard-Slides.pdf  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  76  diverted to the RFID readers for conducting several attacks by utilizing combinations of vulnerabilities (see  5.6.3) which are appointed by the communication between the readers and the tags.  Access control is another facet which is affected by the gap of susceptible communications in ad-hoc  networks. For example, the practice that leads to emerging security challenges in the context of RFID is  Access control on RFID information (see 8.6). Access controls on RFID readers cannot be achieved when the  Wiegand protocol facilitates communication with upstream devices206.  The Gecko207 and the BLEkey208  exploit vulnerabilities of the Wiegand protocol and have managed to perform passive attacks by violating  the access control transmitted information. The most recent penetration systems facilitate the interception  of RFID data in transit, and could be remotely controlled by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). These systems  must be placed in the RFID readers to be able to perform their malicious activities. To this end, not only the  monitoring of access points should be continuous, but also strict access should be applied to the monitoring  system. This need is of high value, because the success of these attacks depends on whether the attacker  can tamper with the monitoring system as an intermediate stage to the exploitation of the RFID readers.  9.2 Gaps on Network domain  Gap: The continuous assessment to resolve the proper positions and then deploy the WIDS’s required  resources.  It is evident that a host-based intrusion-detection solution cannot be implemented for each node of an ad- hoc and sensor network because of energy constraints. Furthermore, the need to monitor real-time data  prior to their transmission results in delays. In the case of ad-hoc and sensor networks, even though the use  of Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) (see 8.8) enables certain proactive activities which may lead  to the identification of malicious incidents such as real-time data monitoring, detecting anomalies on  network segments of exchanged packets among the sensors, and reporting, WIDS are restrained by specific  challenges. Due to the dynamic topology of such networks, determining the best location for the WIDS’s  sensors, as well as the respective correlation server, is a complex and difficult task. Accordingly, for every  new sensor which establishes a connection with an ad-hoc network, the WIDS’s sensors coverage should be  evaluated. In the case that the new sensor is out of WIDS’s coverage, then a new WIDS sensor should be  integrated. This process reveals a gap, as the sensors connect and disconnect dynamically in ad-hoc  networks. Thus, in the event of leaving a new sensor out of a WIDS’s coverage, the vulnerabilities of this  sensor threaten the ad-hoc network.  Gap: The required time-period between the assessment of firmware updates and their deployment or with  withdrawal depending on the identification of threats.  There is a major concern about the effectiveness of the practice named changing or replacing the base  stations that make it more difficult to compromise the mobile nodes (see 8.8), which increases the level of  security and the complexity in ad-hoc and sensor networks. By adopting this procedure, the networks  operational expenses are also increased due to the topology magnitude and the number of sensors.  206 3M Cogent, (2014).

The expenses discourage any service provider  of ad-hoc networks to implement the examined practice due to the cost-efficient nature of these networks.  The diversity of security mechanisms for each one of the domains in the M2M architecture necessitates  human interaction in order to mitigate the risks and ensure an adequate threat protection. Besides, we need  to efficiently tackle the challenges of the release management (i.e. firmware upgrades, patches, hot-fixes,  OS updates) and attain a high level of security. For instance, the automated firmware updates increase the  security risks by raising potential vulnerabilities in the vehicles Engine Control Unit (ECU) and in distributed  networks sensors. To this end, the automated or remote firmware updates (see 5.5.5) threat is mitigated by  the testing process of this practice. However, the required time period to perform the testing process of the  new updates and patches, leaves the sensors susceptible to vulnerabilities which could be mitigated by the  examined updates as soon as they are approved and deployed. In this time period, the exploitation of any  vulnerability is extremely dangerous, due to the fact that it depends on the capabilities of the attacker and  the sophistication of the exploitation method.  Gap: The standalone characteristics of routing protocols which are employed in MANETs are not sufficient  for threat protection.  By design, the routing protocols in ad-hoc networks and autonomous systems of mobile nodes (MANETs)  are classified into three categories; namely the proactive, the reactive/on-demand and the hybrid ones209.  The protocols also facilitate the exchange of routing information, which allows the ad-hoc and sensor nodes  to learn and adapt to the node or topology changes. However, none of them can adequately safeguard the  operation of such networks against the whole spectrum of attacks such as against DoS attacks (see 5.5.1)  because of trade-offs and limitations which are inherited by their characteristics210. These limitations are not  adequately addressed by the implementation of the practices named design and maintain flat-based,  hierarchical-based, location-based and hierarchical routing protocols (see 8.8), which only partially safeguard  the MANETs’ operation. Thus, the routing protocols are prone to a wider spectrum of malicious attacks such  as jamming (see 5.5.1) and eavesdropping (see 5.6).  9.3 Gaps on the Application Domain  Gap: Security patches and updates do not mitigate zero-day exploits targeting M2M applications.  In the case that the software deficiencies of M2M applications are not known vulnerabilities (e.g. Exploit  Database211) and, consequently, they are not managed and resolved by security patches, updates and  hotfixes, then the M2M applications could be of interest for the perpetrators that leverage the power of  zero-day exploits to obtain access. For instance, the attacks which arise from the threat of nefarious activities  (see 5.5) are highly associated to zero-day exploits and lead to malicious code injection, security  misconfigurations exploitation as well as broken authentication212. Thus, the development of applications  should follow best practices and state-of-the-art solutions, which could prioritize the practical  209 Petearson Anzola, J., Bolanos-Castro, S. and Tarazona-Bermudez, G.

Moreover, the deployment, the updating  and the resolving of security emergency incidents should be guided by Community Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs) spread worldwide. In that vein, the security in the application layer can be reinforced.  Gap: Cloud-based M2M applications cannot be safeguarded by the proposed practices due to the complex  backend environment.  Due to their scaling demand on back-end resources, the M2M applications are increasingly based on the  cloud computing (CC) paradigm and the respective deployment and service models. The CC service models  belong in different layers of abstraction in the architecture and are mutually dependent for provisioning the  end-services. Moreover, there are several security implications among the cloud computing service models.  For example, specific vulnerabilities of the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) could potentially endanger the  secure deployment of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Consequently, the security dependencies between  these models could lead to threats such as in erroneous use or administration of devices and systems (see  5.1.3). With the aim to secure the application layer in accordance with legacy environment practices, such  as with inventory maintenance and update with the information of authorized and unauthorized  software/OS/applications/devices within the network (see 8.6), many vulnerabilities outsourced by the CC  models dependencies are not confronted. For example, the Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations  Manipulations (VENOM)211 vulnerability is leveraged by attackers to target the virtualisation systems of  Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) which use the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model. In that case, the  negative effects of a successful attack impact the Software-as-a-Service operations.  9.4 Gaps on the Operational Domain  Gap: The interaction with human factor and the poor video quality of surveillance systems.  Many ad-hoc networks operate in complex locations such as supply chains and production environments.  These locations are complex since they cannot be locked down to be off-limits to unauthorized personnel.  Thus, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) and surveillance systems213 are employed in the context of the  practice, usage of centralized monitoring systems for security (see 8.3). These systems facilitate real-time  surveillance or capture of footage to assess it later. Their operation is supervised by highly trained employees  who are liable for reporting suspicious activities. However, the response time of CCTV and surveillance  systems in case of alerts is limited due to the human factor. Further, the video quality of many CCTV systems  is poor, leading to inability of usage for forensic purposes. To this end, these gaps harden the success of the  monitoring crime prevention procedures which are applied at ad-hoc networks.  Gap: Physical security is limited when defence-in-depth is implemented.  Even though throughout the operation and life-cycle of ad-hoc networks many mobile devices enter and  leave, the assets of ad-hoc networks are constantly increasing. This situation combined with the practice of  implementing a security plan based on defense-in-depth (see 8.1), leads to a gap which burdens many  providers. By definition, defense in depth separates the M2M architecture into defense layers. Each layer,  consists of certain security mechanisms and measures able to obstruct and prevent criminal activities. In  many use cases, where ad-hoc networks are mounted in remote locations and they are vulnerable to threats  such as loss of devices (see 5.1.4), then the physical layer demands a greater number of security resources.  213 D. Hutter, (2016). Physical Security and Why It Is Important. SANS Institute. [online] Available at:  https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/physical/physical-security-important-37120 [Accessed xx Nov.  2016].  https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/physical/physical-security-important-37120  Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  79  The gap lays on the fact that defense-in-depth necessitates dynamic resource allocation214 of security  mechanisms to cover the dynamic topology of ad-hoc networks. To this event, the linkage amongst this  security plan and the budget of the provider do not fulfill the provider’s cost-effective expectations. Thus,  following defense-in-depth, the physical security which is of great importance, is also limited due to the  spectrum of resources which are required to secure each layer of ad-hoc networks.  Gap: Fraudulent activities are addressed only with security mechanisms on M2M architecture without  functional procedures.  The distributed nature and the shared resources of the M2M architecture expose the business processes to  threats of abusing personal data as well as to nefarious activities. This exposure could potentially lead to  fraudulent activities, which primarily violate the assets integrity and lead to a low-level of trust and privacy.  The existence of operational defensive mechanisms aims to secure the enterprises technical layer (i.e. trust  relationship using mobile-based security agents that use single-sign-on mechanisms or trust management- based techniques (see 8.1)). The implementation of these mechanisms without any support by the functional  layer of the enterprises in which the policies documentation occurs, leads to inconsistencies such as a static  approach against fraud threats.  9.5 Gaps on the Product/Business Processes Domain  Gap: The regulations mitigate only threats against the type of collected and processed data.  The structuring model of the business processes for ad-hoc and sensor networks incorporated in the  enteprises should be based upon a regulatory framework that defines the legality and level of privacy. The  security and operations regulatory framework should define and provide the success factors (e.g.  confidentiality, integrity and level of privacy) for the sensory data and the communication. Then, the threat  of violating rules and regulations (see 5.3.2) can be eliminated and eradicated. However, the regulatory  frameworks take into consideration only the type of the collected and processed data without focusing on  the type of the underlying environment. Accordingly, only threats against the type of collected and  processed data are addressed by the regulations. Thus, the regulatory frameworks do not always pose  certain threat protection methods and techniques to eliminate threats in ad-hoc and sensor networks. As a  result, even if the ad-hoc networks operate according to the regulatory frameworks which also conform to  the law, this is not adequate to achieve a high level of security. Thus, the enteprise is liable to define the  objectives that would eliminate threats such as outages and DDoS attacks.  Gap: The regulations do not necessarily resolve all the responsibilities of individuals concerning the  security activities.  Typically, the regulationsdefine the liabilities and the responsibilities concerning the security activities,  which should be performed by the service providers. For example, the integration of technical and  organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental  loss215 could be employed. The regulatory frameworks do not explicitly define the obligatory actions that  burden the end-users concering their security activities. As a result, the end-users are threatened, since they  are uninformed about the security perspective of the M2M applications. In most cases, applications which  214 Interagency Security Committee, (2015). Best Practices for Planning and Managing Physical Security Resources: An  Interagency Security Committee Guide.

Gap: The attack surface of external components derails security by design.  Every communication layer of an ad-hoc and sensor network is threatened by the lack of planning or design  errors (see 5.1.1) during their initiation phase. The implementation of the practice of planning and  implementing security by design (see 8.1) provides adequate security mechanisms in each layer. However,  the implementation of security by design fails to protect business processes due to their association to the  attack surface of external components216 integrated in ad-hoc and sensor networks. For example, SCADA  systems consist of several external components (e.g. PLCs) facilitating the operational management of ad- hoc and sensor networks. PLCs are usually orchestrated in order to achieve the business’ goals concerning  the level of performance and QoS. With regard to PLCs which are manufactured by specific vendors, existing  vulnerabilities enable arbitrary file disclosure211 and remote control211. The vulnerabilities of PLCs introduce  security risks that could not be mitigated in the context of security by design. Besides, the enteprises owing  SCADA systems, such as power generation and water distribution facilities, can not alter or modify PLCs in  order to eliminate their vulnerabilities because they are subject  to Intellectual Properties Rights (IPR) such  as copyrights and the industrial design rights of the vendors. Another example of this limitation is the fact  that certain sensors operate with a preinstalled OS whcih may have various  vulnerabilities without the  possibility for installation of an updated version of OS or security patches. As a result, the vulnerabilities on  these sensors can not be resolved by the examined practice named security by design, and they are  susceptible to OS exploits (see 5.1.2).To this end, this constrain arises both for sensors and external  components such as Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Automation Controllers (PACs) which  are purchased by vendors. Correspondingly, security by design does not fully mitigate the threat of lack of  planning or design errors, in the context of business processes.  9.6 Recommendations  The above gaps naturally result in a set of recommendations that can improve the overall security  performance and can be classified either as organisational or as technical recommendations.  9.6.1 Organisational recommendations  In the context of security attributes, ad-hoc and sensor network development could be strengthened by  practices that are documented with respect to standards and compliance, for that purpose we propose  functional, policy and regulatory recommendations that can provide a clear guidance to interested  organizations  Functional Recommendations  In the context of security attributes, ad-hoc and sensor network development could be strengthened by  practices that are documented with respect to standards.  There is a growing concern about the natural persons’ privileges that access sensorial datasets to perform a  diversity of management operations (i.e. M2M service provider’s operators). This concern refers to most of  the challenges on the surveillance data management on areas monitored by closed circuit security systems,  and indoor positioning data mainly on supply chains and data streams, which facilitate M2M home  appliances remote control. For this purpose, it is of great significance to identify by whom the data is  accessed, and the conditions they need to access the data. The appropriate roles should be defined to  associate the end-users (e.g. M2M service provider’s employees, clients) with specific segments of collected  216 I. Arce, K. Clark-Fisher, N. Daswani, J.

Ad-hoc & sensor networking for M2M Communications  January 2017  81  data and authorize them with specific privileges concerning the computational operations. This procedure  should be combined with strict monitoring on ad-hoc and sensor network to ensure and enable the secure  collection of sensitive data. Moreover, the M2M applications development and deployment in CC  environments should be performed by adapting and expanding the application security guidelines of  standardization organizations and cover the needs and demands of the M2M architecture.  Policy Recommendations  Due to the privacy issues that should be considered in the ad-hoc and sensor networks with personal,  confidential, sensitive data being exchanged, specific policies should be established about authorising  procedures and sharing agreements regarding the sensorial data. For transparency purposes, policies should  be considered, which relate to the liabilities definition and the management operations description.  Furthermore, a privacy policy should articulate the reasons and methods, which are orchestrated for the  collection as well as for the processing of sensorial data and the mechanisms mitigating threats against  functional and operational procedures. Moreover, privacy compliance should be ensured in the context of a  reliable and consistent M2M application. A standardized documentation concerning the privacy compliance  should be followed; typical examples are the Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) or the Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA). Further to the sensitive data plane, the privacy policy is also associated with additional  documents. For example, in the healthcare sector, the informed consent documents are associated with the  privacy objectives which are set forth by the integrated ad-hoc networks deployed at hospitals environment.  The patients are empowered to control and to approve the concentration as well as the processing of their  sensitive information by the BSNs. In other terms, the patients agree to control the disclosure of their PII to  a trusted and predefined third-party, such as to specific nursing staff and doctors.  The security level of M2M applications is highly affected by the back-end servers’ vulnerabilities. For this  purpose, these servers should be updated using security patches and they should also be subject to  vulnerability management. The components of this management should be a technical assessment as well  as the revaluation of the competent policy which defines acceptable methods to perform the assessment  itself.  Security by design should be implemented for each layer of the ad-hoc network, which means that, on a  higher layer of abstraction, the development of the password-management policy is of great significance for  mitigating various threats. However, prior to the adaptation of this type of policy, many challenges, such as  the mutation of passwords and the intervals of time under which the changing of passwords will take place,  should be addressed. Moreover, the operational implementation of this policy should be ensured in the  context of its compliance by orchestrating appropriate controls and assessments. Furthermore, the technical  practises utilized to secure the RFID interaction between tags and readers should be compliant with  standards and state-of-art security mechanisms.  Regulatory Recommendations  The collection and processing of PII should be performed by following the constraints placed by the European  Directives, such as by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679217, the Cross-Border Healthcare  217 General Data Protection Regulation: officially Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons in regards  to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General  Data Protection Regulation).

However,  the underlying infrastructure of M2M applications and operations should comply with the security and  operations regulatory frameworks regarding the protection of personal data. For example, in two-years’  time, these applications should operate under the guidelines of the General Data Protection Regulation  2016/679217 which follows a risk-based approach and enables privacy by design. Finally, the service providers  of ad-hoc networks should inform the end-users about their responsibilities (e.g. strong credentials, usage  of digital signatures) concerning the PII concealment during the networks’ operation and especially in cases  where MHNs are orchestrated.  Business/Product processes Recommendations  The manufacturing of certain products (e.g. GPS receivers, medical sensors) should be threat-driven to  minimize potential vulnerabilities, which would allow attacks during the deployment and development  phases. The manufacturing enterprises of GPS receivers should also be aware of the constantly growing  attack surface of their products. The GPS operation is based on the transaction of signals between the GPS  receiver and four or more satellites. This transaction of signals takes place so as the GPS receiver can  establish its current three coordinates and synchronize its clock with the constellation’s atomic clocks. The  predominant method, per which GPS operates, can be exploited due to vulnerabilities which enable spoofing  attacks220. The defensive techniques which can be employed to construct a tamper-proof GPS receiver can  only be applied during their manufacturing due to the individuals’ lack of knowledge and resources.  Moreover, end-to-end encryption should be implemented during the communication of GPS receivers and  satellites. Therefore, this issue is recommended to be addressed by the companies during the design and  modelling procedures.  In the context of addressing fraudulent activities inside the M2M architecture, proactive functional  procedures, protocols and policies should be orchestrated aiming to provide fraud prevention and  assurances to the end-users. More specifically, a code of conduct, and a fraud risk control policy consist the  minimum safeguards which should be defined and incorporated in M2M architecture by means of the  authorization policy upon the collected data. These proactive safeguards in the businesses functional layer  should be strengthened by fraud detecting mechanisms.  9.6.2 Technical Recommendations  In order to improve and securely implement sensors networking in M2M communication, we provide  different technical recommendations, with a special focus on authentication/authorization methods and  proactive and reactive defences.  Authentication/Authorization Recommendations  In principle, we should aim to increase the security in the authentication process by deploying strong or  multi-factor authentication methods (MFA), wherever applicable. However, concerning device  authentication for ad-hoc and sensor networks, any device could also rely on certificate-based  authentication and on methods which harden the exploitation procedure by employing a secure network  218 Cross-Border Healthcare Directive 2011/24/EU; officially Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights  in cross-border healthcare.

Furthermore, an elastic type of access control mechanism is recommended to be incorporated  in ad-hoc and sensor networks such as the attribute-based access controls. Hence, these amplified secure  devices could be mounted in non-secure locations and unattended installations. Moreover, in the context  of RFID communication between the tags and the readers, it is recommended that the authentication  process take place in upstream devices to associate unique passwords to individuals.  Proactive Defence Recommendation  In the recent years, there is a growing concern about DDoS and flooding attacks as well as about the  sophistication of their offensive techniques. botnets are utilized in DDoS attacks against ad-hoc and sensor  networks; because of the concealed nature of bots, the botnets may become an unpredictable adversary.  From another perspective, the ad-hoc and sensor networks are targeted with the scope to be compromised  and the devices are enrolled in botnets, which perform DDoS attacks. This method was followed during the  US incident involving a critical internet infrastructure which was targeted by the Mirai-based IoT botnet.  Thus, despite the orchestration of WIDS in the context of ad-hoc networks, the employment of IDS in every  bottleneck of the M2M architecture such as the M2M gateway is recommended. Following the adjustment  of this measure, any incoming junk traffic from the M2M devices targeting entities outside the ad-hoc and  sensors network could be identified and prevented. To this end, the network traffic of every internet- connected device is monitored and proactive detection is orchestrated. Besides, it is recommended to  ensure the continuous update of the IDS sensors’ ruleset in strict time intervals and by following trustful  sources of signatures. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of MANET  routing protocols , it is strongly  recommended that the network security assessment should primarly focus on the routing protocols  vulnerabilities.  Reactive Defence Recommendation  The identification of zero-day exploits is impossible to be implemented by WIDS.The operation of the  defensive mechanisms performing deep packet inspection (DPI) is based upon signatures of known attacks.  Thus, it is recommended to create a defense zone consisting of a honeynet, alongside the ad-hoc and sensor  networks. This network is composed of honeypots emulating the operation of sensors. The honeynet  constitutes a type of darknet which is able to identify new methods of attacks and zero-day exploits. Mobile  Edge Cloud Computing is recommended to be orchestrated so as to develop the honeynet. The operation of  honeynets enables the tracking of malicious activities in order to analyse them and collect forensic  information about the attacks and the attackers behaviour. A network of virtual entities emulating the  operation of sensors should be employed and, in the event of a threatening incident, the malicious traffic  could be offloaded in the Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) in order for this traffic to be recorded and monitored.  Due to the fact that the offloading process increases the overhead of energy consuption, virtual machines  which operate inside the MEC should be utilised in order to avoid performance constraints contrary to the  case of using sensors.

Conclusions  The development of the ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M communications threat landscape in 2016  has been impressive in one thing: it exponentially expands its own borders of impact whilst the industry, the  authorities and the experts analyse the big picture to date.  The threat landscape has evolved in terms of the assets quantitative set which is affected or may  unintentionally contribute to this landscape expansion. By completing the current research document, our  conclusions have been divided into three categories: policy, business and technical (focused on research)  conclusions.  Policy conclusions   Establish specific policies about authorising procedures and sharing agreements. A privacy policy  should articulate the reasons and methods which are orchestrated for the collection as well as for  the processing of sensorial data and the mechanisms mitigating threats against functional and  operational procedures.   Ensure privacy compliance in the context of reliable and consistent M2M applications. Standardized  documentation concerning the privacy compliance should be followed; typical examples are the  Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) or the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).  Business conclusions   Proactive functional procedures, protocols and policies should be orchestrated aiming to provide  fraud prevention and assurances to the end-users. More specifically, a code of conduct, and a fraud  risk control policy should be incorporated in an M2M architecture by means of the authorization  policy upon the collected data.   Ensure that the manufacturing of certain products (e.g. GPS receivers, medical sensors) should be  threat-driven to minimize potential vulnerabilities which would allow attacks during the deployment  and development phases.  Technical conclusions   Incorporate an elastic type of access control mechanism such as the attribute-based access controls.  Hence, these amplified secure devices could be mounted in non-secure locations and unattended  installations.   Employ an IDS in every bottleneck of the M2M architecture such as the M2M gateway. Following  the adjustment of this measure, any incoming junk traffic from the M2M devices targeting entities  outside the ad-hoc and sensors network could be identified and prevented.   Create a defence zone which consists of a honeynet by orchestrating Mobile Edge Cloud Computing  (MEC) to track of malicious activities. A network of virtual entities emulating the operation of sensors  should be employed and, in the event of a threatening incident, the malicious traffic could be  offloaded in the Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) for this traffic to be recorded and monitored.

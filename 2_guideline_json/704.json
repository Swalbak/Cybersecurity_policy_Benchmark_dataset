The  workshop was held on 4 May 2017. Topics discussed at the workshop focused on the European Critical  Information Infrastructures Protection (CIIP).  Due to the time allowed for contributions at the workshop, this paper only partially outlines matters  associated with CIIP.  Workshop organised by the Working Group on Digital Union, ITRE, European Parliament  May 2017  05  1. Status  The European ICT Industry is one of the most advanced in the world. Making the EU's single market fit for  the digital age could contribute €415 billion per year to European economy and create new jobs.  The pervasiveness of high-speed connectivity and the richness and quality of online services in the  European Union are among the best globally.  Such advantages have considerably increased the dependability of European citizens on ICT services. These  two elements, quality of services and customer base, make this industry particularly appealing to global  business. What if this important piece of the global economy becomes a target? And is Europe prepared?  Computer security attacks are increasingly used to perform industrial espionage, lead disinformation  campaigns, manipulate stock markets, leak sensitive information, copy/change customer data, or sabotage  critical infrastructure.  The protection of critical infrastructure was first put on the EU agenda in June 2004, when the European  Council asked for the preparation of an overall strategy. At that time, the main concern was the protection  against terrorist attacks.  Identification of critical information infrastructure is the first step in the process to secure and protect the  availability of critical assets. Several Member States have launched different initiatives regarding this topic  while others are starting now to develop their own approaches.  Experience shows that purely national or regional approaches to tackle the security and resilience  challenges are not enough.  Now, with the adoption of the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive in 2016, companies  working in critical sectors will be required to report major incidents to national authorities and to adopt  risk management practices. This directive also introduces a new term “essential services providers”. Those  providers include sectors such as energy and water, banking and financial market infrastructures,  healthcare, transport, and digital infrastructures. In addition, the NIS Directive introduces a term “digital  services providers”. Since more and more providers of critical infrastructure relay on cloud services, ENISA  is looking into relationship between these two providers  In the context of the NIS Directive, EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) has been  assigned with a role to support the development of the baseline requirements for identification, incident  reporting schemes and minimum security measures for the essential services providers. Based on previous  experience of the Agency (mandatory incident reporting in telecom sector required under the Telecom  Package of 2009), ENISA is already providing support to the European Commission in developing the  implementing acts for such schemes and measures.  The NIS Directive is implemented through two governing bodies, namely the Co-operation Group and the  CSIRTs network. The European Commission is the secretariat for the first body, dealing with strategic and  policy matters. While ENISA is the secretariat of the second body, dealing with technical and operational  matters among CSIRTs. Both bodies will strongly co-operate to provide a consistent and effective approach  to CIIP.  Workshop organised by the Working Group on Digital Union, ITRE, European Parliament  May 2017  06  The swift and effective implementation of the NIS Directive will be key in view of the increasing  digitalisation of economic and societal life (also taking into account the cloud, the Internet of things, and  machine-to-machine communication), growing cross-border interconnection and the fast-evolving cyber- threat landscape. In this context, the EU needs to prepare itself for the possibility of a large-scale cyber  crisis, including for instance simultaneous attacks on critical information systems in several Member  States.  Cyber security is one of those subjects that never remain static. Every month new issues arise to challenge  the digital ecosystem which continues to grow. For example, the use of many small Internet of Things (IoT)  devices in the cyber-attack has been experienced in September 2016 (“Mirai” malware) and on several  other occasions since then. It is important to note that IoT are not covered by the NIS Directive. Having  seen cyber-attacks that have taken place, the question is what is Europe doing to address these challenges.  The other issue that Europe needs to review is the question of software liability, and in particular in the  context of next generation of smart devices and artificial intelligence, which is highly dependent on  software.  These devices will form an integral part of our critical infrastructures, smart X, and industry 4.0.  It should be also noted that in 2017 the European Commission is planning to submit for consideration a  cooperation blueprint to handle large-scale cyber incidents on the EU level .  The experience shows that there is a need for the EU cyber crisis cooperation procedures and a need to  develop an EU cyber crisis cooperation plan.  Crisis management is addressed by conducting regular CIIP-related exercises. Most sector-specific and  cross-sectorial exercises are being conducted in the financial, energy and the telecommunications sector.  Other important sectors are public administrations, transport and logistics, and healthcare.  The cooperation at the European Union level to mitigate a potential crisis, has developed significantly since  ENISA has launched series of the pan European exercises mainly tackling the Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection. The first table top exercise was carried out in 2010. Now these exercises are  carried out once in two years and have reached around 850 experts participating online to ensure business  continuity and, ultimately, to safeguard the European Digital Single Market.  Workshop organised by the Working Group on Digital Union, ITRE, European Parliament  May 2017  07  2. Challenges  Recognising IT security as the backbone of the today’s society, the following challenges should be  considered when discussing the CIIP:   Complex networks and services   Different levels of capabilities of stakeholders   Asymmetric threats allowing remote attacks   Increasing organised cybercrime and industrial espionage  Tools to reduce the gap include:   Capacity building / Hands on / Training   Policy implementation   Recommendations / Good Practices / Standardisation  Cyber security incidents affecting CIIs are considered nowadays global risks that can have “significant  negative impact for several countries or industries within the next 10 years” (source: World Economic  Forum, The Global Risks Report 2016 - 11th Edition, pg. 11.).  As more and more businesses/industries benefit from the advantages of information technology, by  witnessing a tighter cyber-physical systems integration, developed under concept such as Internet of  Things, cyber-attacks or incidents affecting those infrastructures, including critical infrastructures are  increasing dramatically, resulting in a new chapter in information security.  In August 2016 ENISA has published a study on the cost of incidents affecting CIIs . In this study it was  concluded that Finance, ICT and Energy sectors appear to have the highest incident costs. The most  common attack types for Financial sector and ICTs appear to be DoS/DDoS and malicious insiders, with the  latter affecting the Public Administration sector as well. It is very important to highlight that these two  types on their own, collectively constitute approximately half the annualized cost of all cybercrime.  Also, in the above mentioned study ENISA concluded that the most expensive attacks are considered to be  insider threats, followed by DDoS and web based attacks. In terms of country loss, the values provided  reach up to 1.6% of GDP in some EU countries. Other resources mention figures like 425,000 to 20 million  euro per company per year (Germany).  Workshop organised by the Working Group on Digital Union, ITRE, European Parliament  May 2017  08  3. Conclusion  Society and our citizens are increasingly dependent on the proper functioning of the CIIP. There is a need  to ensure that operators are prepared and ready to withstand cyber-attacks. ENISA is supporting this  challenge and with the continuous support of the European Parliament, and ITRE in particular, will  continue to address the ever increasing complexity of these attacks.  In conclusion, the following take away points should be considered:  - Protecting Cyber sovereignty in Europe. Cyber sovereignty is the basis of our society’s digital self- determination. The European cyber security market is dependent on a number of infrastructures that  include software and hardware. Europe is not leading in either of these markets. A consequence of this  situation is that Europe is effectively dependent on third countries for the manufacture and supply of  cyber services and systems.  - Updated EU governance structures with clear roles and responsibilities to address global cyber  challenges: While traditionally Member States addressed cyber security in a national context there is an  increasing need to address cyber security in an EU context. In the last few years, Europe has witnessed the  growth in the Digital Single Market, the interconnected Energy market and the single trading area. Other  sectors such as the banking, the finance markets and the Aviation have become increasingly integrated  across Europe.  - NIS Directive and next steps: a compromise reached over NIS Directive brings a necessity for further  work to be done, in particular in the areas of IoT and crisis management at the EU level.  A common  understanding of criteria and approach across the EU is crucial to address the associated challenges.  - Paradigm shift in liability and ownership of products controlled by software and the liability questions  arising from the use of software. At an EU level, there is a need for a discussion to address this paradigm  shift. ENISA supports a discussion for setting a regulatory framework for this issue.  - Harmonisation of Cyber Products, Services and Skills. The existence of EU cyber security related  standards presents good opportunities for EU manufacturers and service providers to serve the pan EU  marketplace as opposed to addressing individual member state or company specific requirements.

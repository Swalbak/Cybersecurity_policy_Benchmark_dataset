The exercise  engaged around 900 participants, from the public authorities and private companies,  mainly in the Aviation sector, from all 28 EU Member States as well as two European Free  Trade Association (EFTA) countries, Norway and Switzerland.  The exercise simulated an intense realistic crisis caused by a large-number (over 600  hundred) of cybersecurity incidents that occurred during the two-days, 6-7 June 2018. The  exercise was built on three main pillars:  The sound use of business continuity and crisis management plans within an  organisation  National-level cooperation and use of contingency plans  Cross-country cooperation and information exchange  In addition, the exercise gave the opportunity to the technical teams to test their skills  in cybersecurity with a vast variety of technical challenges, including malware analysis,  forensics, mobile malware, APT attacks, network attacks, IoT device infection, etc.  The exercise brought up the importance of cooperation between the different actors  (victims and authorities) of simulated cybersecurity incidents, security providers and  national authorities. It proved to the participants that only by information exchange and  collaboration, it is possible to respond to such extreme situations with a large number of  simultaneous incidents. We have witnessed a large number of instances of public–private  and private–private cooperation. Participants had to follow existing business processes,  agreements, communication protocols and regulations to mitigate effectively the situations  presented to them. Nevertheless, the level of preparedness varied significantly between  participants, the information flow felt sometimes to be unidirectional and structured  private-public cooperation procedures were immature or non-existent. The EU Network  and Information Security (NIS) directive identifies many of the associated shortcomings and  proposes measures to improve the situation.  The EU-level cooperation has been undoubtedly improved over the last years. In  particular, the technical-level cooperation has proven mature and effective. The  introduction of the CSIRTs Network (CNW) as defined in the NIS directive has provided EU  Member States with an effective formal structure to exchange technical information but also  to collaborate in order to resolve complex, large-scale incidents. The exercise proved that at  this level EU is well equipped to respond. Some minor gaps were identified and have been  already tackled by those involved. On the other hand, the operational-level cooperation  was exercised to a lesser extent. It is not so obvious how in real-life these levels will interact  and furthermore how they will implement the strategic vision of the political leaders. Future  exercises shall try to test these aspects as well.  Finally, the technical incidents of the exercise provided an excellent opportunity for the  cybersecurity teams to enhance their capabilities and expertise to deal with a variety of  cybersecurity challenges. The operational capacity as well as the technical skills in all  participating organisation proved to be at the highest level. Participating teams from non- cybersecurity private companies in the Aviation sector analysed the majority of incidents  successfully, and proved that their skillset in certainly very high. The only shortcoming in  some cases was not the lack of skills but the actual number of available resources for IT  security. This is a challenge that has be tackled by the higher management, since the return  on investment (ROI) in cybersecurity expertise is definitely high for such critical sectors.  CYBER EUROPE 2018: AFTER ACTION REPORT 7  KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The information gathered during Cyber Europe 2018 was analysed by ENISA. This resulted in  an extensive list of over 90 concrete observations. Based on the observations we analysed  the consequent challenges and gaps and proposed 80 detailed recommendations.  The list below includes the key findings and recommendations from the exercise.  1.  EU Member States cooperation at technical level has been improved and proved to be  efficient. Minor issues with cooperation structures and tools can be easily treated by the  CNW. Regular exercises, trainings and communication checks are important in order to  keep the knowledge of procedures and usability of cooperation tools at an adequate  level. Responsible: CSIRTs Network and ENISA (as the Secretariat).  2.  EU-level cooperation at operational-level shall be further developed and tested.  Including the interaction between operational and technical levels, and the strategic  guidance of higher political management. The procedures and tools needed in order to  implement the framework defined in the EU-level coordinated response to large-scale  cyber crises (known as the Blueprint) shall be defined and tested. Responsible: the  actors identified in the Blueprint 1.  3.  At national-level countries shall develop procedures and tools for coordinated response,  including structured cooperation and information exchange between private actors  and public authorities. Special care needs to be taken during the development of  such procedures and tools in order to provide incentives to cooperate and exchange  information avoiding unidirectional information flow. When such national-level standard  operational procedures for public-private cooperation are established, they should be  tested by exercises on a regular basis. Responsible: National cybersecurity authorities.  4.  The private sector shall identify IT security as a priority and invest in resources and  expertise. Especially when the services they are providing is essential for the society.  Responsible: private sector entities of essential or critical services.  5.  Organisations, public and private, must ensure that they have crisis communication  protocols in place and that employees in sensitive positions are aware of these  protocols. Responsible: all organisations, private and public, that may be subject to  cybersecurity incidents.  6.  Cyber Europe has been established as the main EU cyber crisis management exercise.  The participants unanimously agreed that the exercise has proven to mature. The  challenge is to keep the exercise standards at the highest level. Responsible: ENISA and  Member State authorities responsible for the planning of the exercise.  1 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584, 13 September 2017, on ‘coordinated response to large-scale  cybersecurity incidents and crises’.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.239.01.0036.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2017:239:FULL https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.239.01.0036.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2017:239:FULL  I  CYBER EUROPE 2018: AFTER ACTION REPORT 9  1.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  Cyber Europe 2018 goals built upon those set in  Cyber Europe 2016, following an in-depth assessment  of their relevance performed in the after action report  of the latter exercise 2.  G1. Test EU-level cooperation processes.  G2.  Provide opportunities for Member States to test  their national-level cooperation processes.  G3. Train EU- and national-level capabilities.  The goals of the exercise are high level. These have  been analysed into concrete objectives that drove  the exercise design. The following table presents the  decomposition of the exercise goals into objectives.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE AND PARTICIPATION  Participation in Cyber Europe 2018 was limited  to organisations from the European Union  institutions, European Union Member States  and European Free Trade Association member  countries, both the public and the private sectors in  these countries.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ce2016-after- action-report  The main target audience of the exercise was  comprised of professionals and organisations  involved in information security activities in the  Aviation sector. Some participants chose to involve  players from other sectors as well, as indicated  in Figure 3.  In total, 892 participants 3 officially registered for  the exercise, representing the 28 EU Member States,  2 EFTA countries (Norway and Switzerland), several  EU institutions and agencies and one international  organisation in the Aviation sector (Eurocontrol/ Network Manager 4).  Out of the total participants, around 60 % were from  the private sector. Figure 3 — Sectorial representation  in CE2018 illustrates the percentage of the different  sectors representation in CE2018.  3 These figures account only for those Participants who  registered in the Cyber Exercise Platform. Several organisations  chose to use one account and distribute exercise information  between multiple participants. As a result, one can assume the  actual total number of Participants was effectively significantly  higher. 4 https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-manager  PART I EXERCISE OVERVIEW  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ce2016-after-action-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ce2016-after-action-report https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-manager kampoio Typewritten Text  kampoio Typewritten Text  10  Strategic goal Objective Metrics/Indicators  G1.

The Cyber Europe 2018 was an all-inclusive  cybersecurity exercise building upon:  technical cybersecurity incident analysis;  business continuity and crisis management,  including media pressure handling;  intra- and inter-organisational cooperation at  national and international levels;  escalation;  situational awareness.  1.4 SCENARIO  The scenario was set around the concept of  the worldwide rise of extremism. This ‘virtually  invisible’ phenomenon has turned into an open and  widespread one with several different facets, from  religion to political beliefs, engaging thousands of  followers and millions of supporters. The number of  radical websites has increased exponentially since  2013 and extremists are utilising social media to  recruit and organise.  The increase of the followers of this extremism lead  to their engagement in cyber-attacks. Radical groups  could use advanced or less advanced techniques to  strike at any time as they revealed the internet to  be a hotbed of radicalisation; ‘Now on the internet,  radicalisation can occur instantly and anonymously  within significantly larger and more geographically  distributed groups’. A new radicalistic movement,  without a central organisation has a powerful arsenal  of cyber-attack techniques with capabilities, such as  exfiltration, traffic capturing and logging, keylogging,  ransomware, hybrid attacks with drones, IoT  infectors, worms, etc.  The exercise realism was enhanced with a large  number of injects being delivered within the Exercise  Universe of ENISA’s Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP).  The Universe included a number of emulated real- world platforms:  Mainstream media outlets  Social media  Websites of key exercise simulated entities  Yellow pages  The detailed scenario of the exercise consisted of  numerous materials including:  Structured and unstructured, useful and  misleading data scattered in simulated online  blogs, magazines, forums and file storage  infrastructure;  Thousands of simulated personal and  professional social media profiles on multiple  simulated platforms;  A simulated news channel, depicting the  event through filmed news in a realistic fashion,  supported by simulated formal news websites  containing hundreds of news articles and  formal news websites;  Hundreds of tailor-made documents supporting  the scenario for Participants to analyse, from  technical incident material to legal and public  affairs documents.  Finally, during the exercise, live media pressure was  simulated by real journalists who were continually  contacting players to ask for information. Real-time  response by the experts was noted, while dynamic  media reactions in simulated social media were  added by the journalists.  1.5 EVALUATION  In order to evaluate the exercise against the  objectives and key performance indicators  presented in Section 1.1, ENISA collected feedback  from Participants of Cyber Europe 2018, as well as  statistics from the different exercise platforms.  Evaluation survey results (see Annex C);  Observation and status reports;  CYBER EUROPE 2018: AFTER ACTION REPORT 13  PART I. Exercise overview  Platforms (5) logs;  National and EU integrated situation reports;  Audioconference minutes.  Observations, challenges, recommendations  and actions drawn from the analysis of the findings  highlighted in the elements mentioned above, are  analysed on the basis of the exercise goals as follows:  Findings related to EU-level cooperation;  Findings related to national-level cooperation;  Findings related to training at national  and EU levels;  Findings related to exercise organisation.  1.6 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS  Based on the findings ENISA proposed 80  recommendations. The key recommendations are  given below:  1.  EU-level cooperation at technical level has been  improved and proved to be efficient. Minor  issues with cooperation structures and tools  can be easily treated by the CNW. Regular  exercises, trainings and communication checks  are important in order to keep the knowledge of  procedures and usability of cooperation tools at  an adequate level. Responsible: CSIRTs Network  and ENISA (as the Secretariat).  2.  EU-level cooperation at operational-level shall  be further developed and tested. Including the  interaction between operational and technical  levels, and the strategic guidance of higher  political management. The procedures and tools  needed in order to implement the framework  defined in the EU-level coordinated response to  large-scale cyber crises (known as the Blueprint)  shall be defined and tested. Responsible: the  actors identified in the Blueprint.  3.  At national-level countries shall develop  procedures and tools for coordinated response,  including structured cooperation and information  exchange between private actors and public  authorities. Special care shall be taken during the  development of such procedures and use of tools  in order to provide incentives to cooperate and  exchange avoiding the negative feelings when  information flow seems to be unidirectional.  When such national-level standard operational  procedures for public-private cooperation are  5 We use the log from the Cyber Exercise Platform as well as the  CSIRTs Network cooperation tools, which were used in exercise  mode during Cyber Europe 2018.  established, they should be tested by exercises  on a regular basis.

The Cyber Europe 2018 was an all-inclusive  cybersecurity exercise building upon:  technical cybersecurity incident analysis;  business continuity and crisis management,  including media pressure handling;  intra- and inter-organisational cooperation at  national and international levels;  escalation;  situational awareness.  1.4 SCENARIO  The scenario was set around the concept of  the worldwide rise of extremism. This ‘virtually  invisible’ phenomenon has turned into an open and  widespread one with several different facets, from  religion to political beliefs, engaging thousands of  followers and millions of supporters. The number of  radical websites has increased exponentially since  2013 and extremists are utilising social media to  recruit and organise.  The increase of the followers of this extremism lead  to their engagement in cyber-attacks. Radical groups  could use advanced or less advanced techniques to  strike at any time as they revealed the internet to  be a hotbed of radicalisation; ‘Now on the internet,  radicalisation can occur instantly and anonymously  within significantly larger and more geographically  distributed groups’. A new radicalistic movement,  without a central organisation has a powerful arsenal  of cyber-attack techniques with capabilities, such as  exfiltration, traffic capturing and logging, keylogging,  ransomware, hybrid attacks with drones, IoT  infectors, worms, etc.  The exercise realism was enhanced with a large  number of injects being delivered within the Exercise  Universe of ENISA’s Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP).  The Universe included a number of emulated real- world platforms:  Mainstream media outlets  Social media  Websites of key exercise simulated entities  Yellow pages  The detailed scenario of the exercise consisted of  numerous materials including:  Structured and unstructured, useful and  misleading data scattered in simulated online  blogs, magazines, forums and file storage  infrastructure;  Thousands of simulated personal and  professional social media profiles on multiple  simulated platforms;  A simulated news channel, depicting the  event through filmed news in a realistic fashion,  supported by simulated formal news websites  containing hundreds of news articles and  formal news websites;  Hundreds of tailor-made documents supporting  the scenario for Participants to analyse, from  technical incident material to legal and public  affairs documents.  Finally, during the exercise, live media pressure was  simulated by real journalists who were continually  contacting players to ask for information. Real-time  response by the experts was noted, while dynamic  media reactions in simulated social media were  added by the journalists.  1.5 EVALUATION  In order to evaluate the exercise against the  objectives and key performance indicators  presented in Section 1.1, ENISA collected feedback  from Participants of Cyber Europe 2018, as well as  statistics from the different exercise platforms.  Evaluation survey results (see Annex C);  Observation and status reports;  CYBER EUROPE 2018: AFTER ACTION REPORT 13  PART I. Exercise overview  Platforms (5) logs;  National and EU integrated situation reports;  Audioconference minutes.  Observations, challenges, recommendations  and actions drawn from the analysis of the findings  highlighted in the elements mentioned above, are  analysed on the basis of the exercise goals as follows:  Findings related to EU-level cooperation;  Findings related to national-level cooperation;  Findings related to training at national  and EU levels;  Findings related to exercise organisation.  1.6 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS  Based on the findings ENISA proposed 80  recommendations. The key recommendations are  given below:  1.  EU-level cooperation at technical level has been  improved and proved to be efficient. Minor  issues with cooperation structures and tools  can be easily treated by the CNW. Regular  exercises, trainings and communication checks  are important in order to keep the knowledge of  procedures and usability of cooperation tools at  an adequate level. Responsible: CSIRTs Network  and ENISA (as the Secretariat).  2.  EU-level cooperation at operational-level shall  be further developed and tested. Including the  interaction between operational and technical  levels, and the strategic guidance of higher  political management. The procedures and tools  needed in order to implement the framework  defined in the EU-level coordinated response to  large-scale cyber crises (known as the Blueprint)  shall be defined and tested. Responsible: the  actors identified in the Blueprint.  3.  At national-level countries shall develop  procedures and tools for coordinated response,  including structured cooperation and information  exchange between private actors and public  authorities. Special care shall be taken during the  development of such procedures and use of tools  in order to provide incentives to cooperate and  exchange avoiding the negative feelings when  information flow seems to be unidirectional.  When such national-level standard operational  procedures for public-private cooperation are  5 We use the log from the Cyber Exercise Platform as well as the  CSIRTs Network cooperation tools, which were used in exercise  mode during Cyber Europe 2018.  established, they should be tested by exercises  on a regular basis. Responsible: national  cybersecurity authorities.  4.  Private sector shall management shall identify IT  security as a priority and invest in resources and  expertise. Especially when the services they are  providing is essential for the society. Responsible:  private sector entities of essential or critical  services.  5.  Organisations, public and private, must ensure  that they have crisis communication protocols in  place and that employees in sensitive positions  are aware of these protocols. Responsible: all  organisations, private and public, that may be  subject to cybersecurity incidents.  6.  Cyber Europe has been established as the main  EU civilian exercise. The participants unanimously  agreed that the exercise has proven to mature.  The challenge is to keep the exercise standards  at the highest level. Responsible: ENISA and  Member State authorities responsible for the  planning of the exercise.

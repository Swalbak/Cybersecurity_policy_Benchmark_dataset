ENISA works with the EU, its member states, the private sector and  Europe’s citizens to develop advice and recommendations on good practice in information  security. It assists EU member states in implementing relevant EU legislation and works to  improve the resilience of Europe’s critical information infrastructure and networks. ENISA seeks  to enhance existing expertise in EU member states by supporting the development of cross-  border communities committed to improving network and information security throughout the  EU.  Since 2019, it has been drawing up cybersecurity certification schemes. More information  about ENISA and its work can be found at www.enisa.europa.eu.

Informing young users about the  importance of maintaining personal privacy is not enough to keep them vigilant when using the  internet. More proactive training is required to teach children to be safe online.  Member States, which are advised to increase their cybersecurity capacity, have made efforts to  raise cybersecurity awareness among their population through initiatives targeting different age  groups of users. With regard to children in particular, the Safer Internet Centers1, co-funded by  the European Commission, have proven to be the main drivers of the majority of initiatives at  the national level and have served as a forum for cooperation and exchange of resources.  In line with the European Cybersecurity Act, Article 102, ENISA has the mission to focus its  efforts in supporting cybersecurity in all levels of education in the Member States. In this  context, ENISA has a mandate to support closer coordination and exchange of best practices  among Member States on cybersecurity awareness and education.  Additionally, the EU Digital Education Action Plan3 identifies two priority areas to prepare the  next generations for the challenges posed by the digital: i) Fostering the development of a high-  performing digital education ecosystem and ii) Enhancing digital skills and competences for the  digital transformation. To address these challenges, ENISA recognises the importance of  addressing and reshaping the existing cybersecurity education programmes and the continuous  changes in the landscape to align the required cybersecurity knowledge and skills.  Through this project, ENISA wants to develop a comprehensive roadmap, towards the  implementation of a collaborative campaign at EU level, for enhancing cybersecurity in  education - targeting primary and secondary schools - across the EU and create a common  platform to foster good practices and knowledge sharing, in order to collaborate with the  European Commission (EC) and Member States in the creation and implementation of the  required actions.  This study brings out interesting conclusions regarding the best practices around cybersecurity  in education across EU Member States, and with-it priorities for ENISA.  Initiatives are often designed by National Cybersecurity Agencies, which then refer to a ministry  responsible for the initiatives, but these initiatives may also be designed by that ministry. This  usually has an impact on the funding of the initiatives (provided by the state or by private  sponsors).  The most recurrent and common key principles to be followed when developing educational  cybersecurity initiatives were the following: undertake a collaborative approach to involve  various stakeholders, undertake a pedagogic approach to ensure the participation of students,  rely on the pareto principle to maximize efforts, construct yearly plans to ensure continuous  improvement, educate the parents instead of creating a chain reaction…  Most of the time, KPIs are deployed to measure the achievement of predefined objectives and  targets (such as completion of a task, gathering information through a satisfaction survey, web  1 Safer Internet Centers: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-centres  2 Cybersecurity Act, Article 10: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3  3 Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) of the European Commission  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-centres https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3 https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/digital-education-action-plan#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Education%20Action%20Plan%20(2021%2D2027)%20is%20a,States%20to%20the%20digital%20age.&text=To%20achieve%20these%20objectives%2C%20the,sets%20out%202%20priority%20areas  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  3  analytics to see how many people have participated in a training course, etc.). However, only a  few Member States collect KPIs that measure the actual performance of users in the activities.  Measuring the impact of cybersecurity education initiatives on the target audience, and whether  and how their educational skills have evolved, is a challenge that Member States are trying to  study and improve in this area.  The main challenges faced by Member States are the rigid culture of the ministries responsible  for educational cybersecurity initiatives, the decentralized approach of some states, the lack of  time and resources (low availability of teachers, staff turnover) and the lack of recognition for  stakeholders.  Many respondents shared advice on how to approach the ministries responsible for the  initiatives, and advice on how to develop initiatives at national level. They would also like to  have visibility on what other Member States are doing in terms of cybersecurity in education,  and finally they showed interest in working with ENISA and the other Member States.  The goal of this report is to present an overview of the Member States’ best practices when  implementing cybersecurity education initiatives - targeting primary and secondary schools - as  well as the challenges faced by the interviewed stakeholders when carrying out the activities.  The aim is to identify the needs and gaps regarding cybersecurity education and determine how  ENISA can provide additional support to the Member States.  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  4  1. INTRODUCTION  There is a common feature in modern cyberattacks: in most cases, basic computer hygiene  such as keeping software updated, using strong passwords, encrypting sensitive data, and  keeping copies in the cloud are sufficient to protect computers from such incidents.  For example, one often-overlooked aspect of the 2017 WannaCry attack is that, even though  more than 400,000 computers in over 150 countries were hit, millions were not affected  because they had updated their software. For this reason, WannaCry was defined as a “tribute  to negligence”4.  As mentioned in the 2017 High Level Group of Scientific Advisors on Cybersecurity to the  European Commission5, many Europeans still fail to take basic cybersecurity measures:  many  say they care a lot about their personal data, but then give them away for free on social  networks. Data are striking: 90% of the data breaches reported by the 2017 Verizon Data  Breach Investigation were the result of phishing. And for those who are successfully phished it  is not over, because they can expect it to happen again at least once during the same year.  Cybersecurity should therefore become a collective responsibility and cyber awareness and  computer hygiene should become an integral part of digital literacy programs. Without  awareness-raising campaigns and smart policies, cybersecurity will always be dogged by  collective action.  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  In line with the European Cybersecurity Act, Article 106, ENISA has the mission to focus its  efforts in supporting cybersecurity in all levels of education in the Member States. In this  context, ENISA has a mandate to support closer coordination and exchange of best practices  among Member States on cybersecurity awareness and education.  The current initiative is consistent with the existing EU Digital Education Action Plan which sets  two priority areas to prepare the next generations to face the challenges raised by the digital: i)  Fostering the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem and ii) Enhancing  digital skills and competences for the digital transformation.  There is a need for reshaping the content of the existing cybersecurity education programmes in  light of the constant evolution of the landscape in order to align the required knowledge and  skills.  Through this project, ENISA wants to develop a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing  cybersecurity in education across the EU and create a common platform to foster good  practices and knowledge sharing, in order to collaborate with the European Commission (EC)  and Member States in the creation and implementation of the required actions.  Through desk research and interviews with key stakeholders, and thus the use of primary and  secondary data, this report summarises insights around cybersecurity in education collected  from Member States.  4 James Lewis (2017), Darwin and Ransomware, CSIS  5 “The two most important ways to defend against security threats”, CSO (2019)  6 More information is available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  5  1.2 METHODOLOGY  The study is based on two initial steps: a desk study on the existing initiatives around  cybersecurity in education in all Member States, and then a series of interviews with a sample of  14 countries. The results obtained were consolidated in this report. Below is a list of the  interviews that were conducted as part of this study.

CONTEXT AND  BACKGROUND  This chapter provides background information on the context of educating children on  cybersecurity issues.  2.1 THE CYBERSECURITY EDUCATIONAL ROADMAP  Along with the increased use of technology in recent decades, the field of cybersecurity has  received more attention due to the greater exposure of citizens to ways in which they can be  subjected to data theft and damage. The role of cybersecurity experts in protecting critical  information and infrastructure, whilst relevant, remains insufficient to cover all internet users due  to the shortage of professionals in the market. The solution, which is to address the  cybersecurity knowledge level of citizens, requires reaching out to internet users of all age  groups, including the new generation.  Schoolchildren are often considered as early introduced to digital technologies and are a critical  group to be addressed to ensure that the next generation is well equipped with the skills to use  the online space more safely. According to the Cybersecurity Act7, respectively article 10,  ENISA is mandated to “raise public awareness of cybersecurity risks and provide guidance on  good practices for individual users aimed at citizens, organisations and businesses, including  cyber-hygiene and cyber-literacy”, demonstrated through initiatives such as European  Cybersecurity Month, European Cyber Security Challenge, European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework, CYBERHEAD – Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. At Member State level,  the introduction of the cybersecurity topic in school curriculums and activities alone can help  ensure that young users are more exposed to and aware of the cybersecurity field and  requirements, potentially leading them to choose this domain professionally and helping  address the shortage in the labour market.  2.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK  The Cybersecurity Act, which conferred ENISA a permanent mandate as an agency of the  European Union for cybersecurity, describes the goal of focusing efforts in supporting the  Member States in “their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity  awareness” (cf. Article 10 Awareness-raising and education).  According to the 2022-2024 Programming Document8, ENISA’s support should be ensured  through complementary actions such as capacity building by increasing the supply of qualified  professionals to meet market demand and promoting cybersecurity education. Activity 9, in  particular, outlines the intention to organise regular awareness campaigns, provide guidance on  best practices and support coordination between Member States on awareness and education.  The goal is to promote the cybersecurity topics, education and good practices on the basis of  the ENISA stakeholders’ strategy.  7 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA and on information  and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  8  ENISA Programming Document 2022–2024 available here: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate- documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  7  3. CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION INITIATIVES IN  EU MEMBER STATES  The mission of introducing young citizens to cybersecurity fundamentals has been expressed in  the national strategies of the Member States, which presented their plans of action focused on  improving the security and resilience of governments, companies and citizens through improved  national infrastructures and increased awareness. With various activities being carried out to  ensure that all target groups of society are involved, the introduction of the best practices to  children helps ensure that future generations are more apt to face an increasingly digital  society.  The table below illustrates the initiatives in cybersecurity education being carried out in the  Member States, where it is observed that governments intend on introducing cybersecurity  topics through the educational curriculum or training plans carried out in the school setting.  From the initiatives corroborated through the desk research and interviews, majority of the  initiatives are carried out at national level and pre-teens and teenagers are the target group  regularly pursued due to the increased independent use of digital technologies as well as the  optimal time to present a new career path before pursuing higher education. Member States like  Italy presented specific regional initiatives that will be carried out in additional regions in the  future.  Some Member States (40%9) showed that on-governmental organization (NGOs) and  institutions already involved in carrying out activities with children and adolescents have  developed additional initiatives that present and teach the principles of cybersecurity through  more practical or engaging approaches such as events, competitions, online platforms, and  games. The promotion of the initiatives is usually carried out online or through traditional media.  The teaching materials, developed for parents and/or teachers or directly aimed at the target  audience, are often available in the institutional or dedicated and available for free.  The list below solely displays the initiatives found through desk research and conducted  interviews, not representing an exhaustive scope of all projects currently being carried out in the  Member States.

CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  20  4. BEST PRACTICES AND  MAIN CHALLENGES  This chapter presents the identified best practices in Europe in terms of cybersecurity in  education for primary and secondary levels in Europe, based on the interviews.  4.1 GOVERNANCE AND PRIORITISATION PROCESS  This section presents the governance in place in some Member States in terms of cybersecurity  in education, as well as the prioritisation process of the educational activities in place.  Governance has been defined to refer to structures and processes (e.g., organisations involved,  reporting process) that are designed to build the initiatives. We found various different practices  regarding the governance in place in each country. Reporting is defined as the process of  regular provision of information to decision-makers – often ministries – within a country to  support them in their work. Prioritisation is defined as the specific process of deciding which  initiative should be developed and when.  Regarding the responsibility for initiatives, two main practices were observed in the Member  State consulted. On one hand (60%10), the National Cybersecurity Agencies manage all  initiatives (a ministry is always accountable, but the initiatives are designed by the Agency). On  the other hand, a ministry itself is responsible for designing the initiatives. The main difference  lies in the funding of the initiatives. In the case of the first practice, the Agency has to convince  the ministry it refers to “release” the necessary budget and implement the initiatives. In the case  of the second, there is no need to find sponsorship. We also saw many different stakeholders  involved in the initiatives (i.e., universities, IT companies, other experts…).  These practices are presented in more detail in the following tables:  Table 3:  Best practices of Member States regarding governance and prioritisation process  Good practice Example from a Member State  Organisation, reporting and prioritisation process  1  The National  Cybersecurity Agency is  responsible for the  initiatives around  cybersecurity in education  and reports to a ministry in  charge.  ANSSI (France) and the Ministry of Education work together towards  developing cybersecurity training and education, but there are no  strong sponsorships for the activities. The topic of cybersecurity  training and education for the youth is identified as a political priority  but remains an emerging challenge to be tackled in years to come in  France.  NUKIB (Czech Republic) ´s director reports directly to the prime  minister. NUKIB cooperates its activities with the Ministry of Education,  Youth and Sports as an equal partner. The ministry is responsible for  overall education strategy and NÚKIB is the coordinator of  cybersecurity educational activities (it makes sure that cybersecurity  education aspects are considered and included).  INCIBE (Spain) reports to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital  Transformation.  10 Based on the interviews conducted with 16 Member States, 9 out of 16 Member States indicated that the National  Cybersecurity Agency designs and takes the lead for all initiatives.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ https://www.nukib.cz/ https://www.incibe.es/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  21  Good practice Example from a Member State  2  A Ministry (or multiple  ministries) is responsible  for the initiatives and plays  a role of sponsor.  It gives the go-ahead to  the National Agency.  In Luxembourg, the Service national de la jeunesse (SNJ) is the  coordinator of the governmental initiative BEE SECURE, and the SNJ  is attached to the Ministry of National Education, Children and Youth;  Three ministries support the initiative (the Ministry of National  Education, Children and Youth, the Ministry of economy, the Ministry  of Family Affairs, Integration and the Greater Region).  3  A community of experts is  involved in the initiatives.  In Italy, ACN has set up a working group of stakeholders from  universities, high schools, and IT companies.  In Malta, MCAST Hackspace, sponsored by eSkills Malta Foundation  and supported by MITA, Cybersecurity Malta and Industry. Hackspace  is a virtual and physical space where students take part in security  dialogues between themselves and with Industry partners and also  include cybersecurity sessions for further learning.  In Estonia, a board of experts lead the initiatives with the help of a  community of teachers.  In Ireland, UCD works with other schools, and a lot of non-for-profit  organisations. This is facilitated by a working group of cybersecurity  education stakeholders, organised by the Ministry for Communications,  which oversees the National Cyber Security Centre.  We also identified two different practices regarding funding. Funding is the means by which the  money required to undertake an initiative is secured and then made available as required. Both  practices depend very much on the reporting presented above. In the first practice, which  usually occurs when initiatives are launched by a ministry, funding is provided entirely by the  ministry. The second occurs when the ministry responsible does not fund the initiatives.  Table 4: Best practices of Member States regarding funding  Good practice Example from a Member State  Funding  4  Funding is  provided by the  state.  In Ireland, UCD receives fundings form the Public Service Innovation Fund in  the Department of the Environment Climate and Communication.  5  Funding is  provided by  private sponsors  (industry) or  other means of  implementing the  initiatives are  found.  In Austria, the Ministry of Education is not implicated in the initiatives and is not  willing to fund those. The CSA thus works with a lot of organisations that do not  charge for their training and courses.  4.2 MEASUREMENT MECHANISM  This section presents the mechanisms that have been implemented in some Member States to  measure and monitor the effectiveness of the initiatives, as well as their completion.  The effectiveness of a project could be defined as the degree to which the objectives are met,  within the deadlines, respecting the agreed budget. The effectiveness of a project or initiative  can be measured by creating indicators (KPIs) to measure the level of performance.  There are different types of indicators, and it is possible to collect indicators them by different  means of data collection, (surveys, metrics (in a website), interviews, etc). After the collection of  data, you need to analyse and interpret the data to be able to make decisions based on the  results obtained.  https://www.acn.gov.it/ https://hackspace.mcast.edu.mt/ https://www.ucd.ie/ https://www.ucd.ie/ https://www.cybersecurityaustria.at/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  22  Regarding the initiatives, the effectiveness can be considered as the degree to which the  students are being educated in cybersecurity.  The KPIs are usually deployed to measure the completion of the objectives: follow up on the  daily activities (task completion); collecting feedback form participants and all stakeholders;  collection of analytics from websites and apps. Only some Member State actually collect KPIs  which measure the performance of the users in the activities. Measuring the impact of initiatives  on the target audience is complex.  Table 5: Best practices of Member State regarding measurement mechanism  Measurement mechanism Example from a Member State  1  Collection of task completion  indicators that reflect on the level of  completion of a specific initiative  NUKIB (Czech Republic) and ACN (Italy) both  implemented a KPI for task completion of its national plan.  2  Feedback collection from participants  of an initiative (teachers and other  stakeholders, students) to measure  the implication of stakeholders  UCD (Ireland) collects feedback from the participants after  each initiative  3  Collection of indicators of number of  people using a service to measure  visibility and attractiveness of those  services  INCIBE (Spain) collects indicators on the number of people  who have used their services: gender, age, geographical  location…  4  Observation of the performance of  the users in the activities  NCSC (Netherlands) observes if users are able to conclude  the objectives or not, and if additional tips should be added  5  Collection of analytics from websites  and apps to measure the  effectiveness  SNJ (Luxembourg) uses analytics from their website, their  social media accounts, and the campaigns they conduct  https://www.nukib.cz/ https://www.acn.gov.it/ https://www.ucd.ie/ https://www.incibe.es/ https://english.ncsc.nl/ https://snj.gouvernement.lu/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  23  4.3 KEY PRINCIPLES  This section presents the key principles that have been followed in developing the initiatives of  the interviewed Member States.  Various key principles were highlighted by the Member States. These principles guided the  approach taken by organisations in designing and deploying the initiatives. We found that the  key principles were often shared by many Member States.  The table below summarises the key principles that are followed by Member States in  implementing and designing their initiatives:  Table 6: Key principles followed by the Member States  Key principle Example from a Member State  1  Collaborative approach: basing the  initiatives on close collaboration with  stakeholders (ministries, schools and  teachers, industries, and other  experts…)  On top of the initiatives presented above with regard to the  experts’ communities: in Slovenia, The URSIV plans to  collaborate with selected secondary schools and faculties  to provide cybersecurity workshops locally, and connect  academia, industry and R&D institutions to attract more  young people to cybersecurity careers.  2  Pedagogic approach: actively involve  students in the activities  In France, ANSSI has created a kit designed for kids to  allow them to develop a cyber game  3  Pareto principle: looking for multipliers  to try to get maximum results by  exploiting the least amount of  resources  In Greece, the NCSA is forming strategic partnerships with  esteemed stakeholders, in order to reach wider audiences  and benefit from their proven know-how.  4  Preparing yearly plans to have a step  ahead of the next initiatives  In Malta, MITA focuses on preparing and executing yearly  plans that address the challenges and trends in the field of  cybersecurity, whilst still maintaining a plan flexible enough  to tackle new problems  5  Educating children through the  parents: creating a chain reaction  which starts with the parents and  reaches all levels of education  The eSkills Malta Foundation leads initiatives for parents  on how to make wise use of social media and the  consequences of misuse (e.g., go to the parent’s place of  work and provide sessions about online safety), in order  for the parents to have the best behaviour and therefore  become good examples for their children.  4.4 COLLABORATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS, INCLUDING  ENISA  This section presents the existing collaborations between organisations, countries, or ENISA, in  the field of cybersecurity education initiatives, in order to streamline activities or learn from each  other, share good practices. The collaboration can have different purposes, such as obtaining  more budget, or gaining expertise.  In conducting the interviews, we often noted that the interviewees stressed that they would  really like (if not already do) to work with ENISA and other Member States.  For most Member  States this is not yet the case. We have noted only a few of these, which are listed in the table  below.  https://projects2014-2020.interregeurope.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/tx_tevprojects/library/file_1634650456.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle https://mindigital.gr/ https://mita.gov.mt/ https://eskills.org.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  24  Table 7: Best practices of Member States regarding collaboration  Collaboration practice Example from a Member State  1 Collaboration between countries  Estonia works on a regular basis with Norway: they  organise a cybersecurity education summer camp and a  cybersecurity competition together.  2  Collaboration with ENISA (use of  ENISA material)  In Italy, ACN uses the European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework -developed by ENISA - for the identification of  professional profiles to be trained at the Lazio Cybersecurity  Academy.  https://www.acn.gov.it/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  25  5. CONCLUSIONS  This chapter presents the main findings of the study, in particular it highlights the main  challenges and obstacles faced by EU Member States in implementing cybersecurity initiatives  in education within their countries and summarises the key priorities that ENISA should focus on  for the EU cybersecurity education roadmap.  5.1 CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED  This section presents any challenges or barriers encountered by the Member States in  implementing the Cybersecurity Education initiatives within their countries. A challenge can be  defined as a fact or process which has made (or still makes) the initiatives difficult to deploy, or  even prevented the initiative from reaching the expected level.  Below is a list of challenges faced by the Member States encountered in the deployment of the  initiatives:  • Rigidity of anchored culture of the ministries responsible for the cybersecurity  initiatives in education: The culture, which leads to cybersecurity being treated as a  secondary topic (as mentioned in the previous section), leads to a slow pace of change  management within these public bodies, which prevents national cybersecurity  agencies - or any other organisation designing the initiatives - from deploying them at  national level.  • Decentralized approach: In Germany and Austria, the country is divided into a  number of federal states, which have a certain amount of autonomy at many levels,  including in terms of educational strategy. This makes it impossible for them to  implement national initiatives, and very difficult to monitor local initiatives.  • Lack of time and resources:  o Teachers’ low availability: In some Member States, initiatives are launched  locally with teachers in their free time, which is very limited. It is then very  difficult to have them participate due to their low availability.  o Staff turnover: In some Member States, there is a high turnover in the teams  working on the initiatives. It is thus difficult to maintain the activities of the  initiatives on a long term.  • Lack of stakeholder recognition: Stakeholders who participate in initiatives,  sometimes in their spare time (e.g., teachers in many Member States), might not  receive enough recognition, which could further motivate them to participate in  initiatives. For example, it was mentioned that teachers could get a certification or a  badge, when they implement an initiative at school and the sense of ownership or  confidence, they are given could motivate them further.  • Need to take into account the different languages spoken in a country: In  Luxembourg, Belgium or Austria, for example, initiatives and especially support  materials need to be developed in the different languages of the country in order to  reach all the students.  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  26  5.2 KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE ENISA ROADMAP  This section presents the key priorities that ENISA should focus on for the EU cybersecurity  educational roadmap.  • Advice on how to approach ministries: For many Member States, the anchored  culture of the ministries responsible for the initiatives relegates cybersecurity, and in  particular the cybersecurity education field to the background. This makes it difficult to  push initiatives at national level and to get funding. Those Member States believe that  ENISA is in a strong position to convince the national authorities of the importance of  cybersecurity education, and to give them the keys on how to address the challenges.  • Advice on how to develop initiatives at national level: In some Member States,  such as Germany and Austria, the autonomy of the federal states within the country  makes it difficult to deploy initiatives at national level, and hampers progress on this  area. Those Member States hope that ENISA has the capacity to be the  backend/coordinator of the topic and identify and encourage local authorities to  develop educational initiatives.  • Visibility on what the other Member States are doing: Many Member States  expressed their willingness to compare and discuss existing initiatives deployed in  other Member States. By doing so, the Member States would be able to learn from  each other and make the most out of each State’s best practices, challenges  encountered, and key lessons regarding those initiatives.  • Encourage Member States to engage in partnerships with the private sector  (e.g., industry): While some Member States already engage in this kind of  partnerships (e.g., Italy, Slovenia…), most Member States miss on this opportunity to  access more technical / operational point of views, and also to build a multi-disciplinary  team. Indeed, this partnership with the private sector would allow to a collaborative  approach around decision making process and implementation of cybersecurity  innovation initiatives.

Informing young users about the  importance of maintaining personal privacy is not enough to keep them vigilant when using the  internet. More proactive training is required to teach children to be safe online.  Member States, which are advised to increase their cybersecurity capacity, have made efforts to  raise cybersecurity awareness among their population through initiatives targeting different age  groups of users. With regard to children in particular, the Safer Internet Centers1, co-funded by  the European Commission, have proven to be the main drivers of the majority of initiatives at  the national level and have served as a forum for cooperation and exchange of resources.  In line with the European Cybersecurity Act, Article 102, ENISA has the mission to focus its  efforts in supporting cybersecurity in all levels of education in the Member States. In this  context, ENISA has a mandate to support closer coordination and exchange of best practices  among Member States on cybersecurity awareness and education.  Additionally, the EU Digital Education Action Plan3 identifies two priority areas to prepare the  next generations for the challenges posed by the digital: i) Fostering the development of a high-  performing digital education ecosystem and ii) Enhancing digital skills and competences for the  digital transformation. To address these challenges, ENISA recognises the importance of  addressing and reshaping the existing cybersecurity education programmes and the continuous  changes in the landscape to align the required cybersecurity knowledge and skills.  Through this project, ENISA wants to develop a comprehensive roadmap, towards the  implementation of a collaborative campaign at EU level, for enhancing cybersecurity in  education - targeting primary and secondary schools - across the EU and create a common  platform to foster good practices and knowledge sharing, in order to collaborate with the  European Commission (EC) and Member States in the creation and implementation of the  required actions.  This study brings out interesting conclusions regarding the best practices around cybersecurity  in education across EU Member States, and with-it priorities for ENISA.  Initiatives are often designed by National Cybersecurity Agencies, which then refer to a ministry  responsible for the initiatives, but these initiatives may also be designed by that ministry. This  usually has an impact on the funding of the initiatives (provided by the state or by private  sponsors).  The most recurrent and common key principles to be followed when developing educational  cybersecurity initiatives were the following: undertake a collaborative approach to involve  various stakeholders, undertake a pedagogic approach to ensure the participation of students,  rely on the pareto principle to maximize efforts, construct yearly plans to ensure continuous  improvement, educate the parents instead of creating a chain reaction…  Most of the time, KPIs are deployed to measure the achievement of predefined objectives and  targets (such as completion of a task, gathering information through a satisfaction survey, web  1 Safer Internet Centers: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-centres  2 Cybersecurity Act, Article 10: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3  3 Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) of the European Commission  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-centres https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3 https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/digital-education-action-plan#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Education%20Action%20Plan%20(2021%2D2027)%20is%20a,States%20to%20the%20digital%20age.&text=To%20achieve%20these%20objectives%2C%20the,sets%20out%202%20priority%20areas  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  3  analytics to see how many people have participated in a training course, etc.). However, only a  few Member States collect KPIs that measure the actual performance of users in the activities.  Measuring the impact of cybersecurity education initiatives on the target audience, and whether  and how their educational skills have evolved, is a challenge that Member States are trying to  study and improve in this area.  The main challenges faced by Member States are the rigid culture of the ministries responsible  for educational cybersecurity initiatives, the decentralized approach of some states, the lack of  time and resources (low availability of teachers, staff turnover) and the lack of recognition for  stakeholders.  Many respondents shared advice on how to approach the ministries responsible for the  initiatives, and advice on how to develop initiatives at national level. They would also like to  have visibility on what other Member States are doing in terms of cybersecurity in education,  and finally they showed interest in working with ENISA and the other Member States.  The goal of this report is to present an overview of the Member States’ best practices when  implementing cybersecurity education initiatives - targeting primary and secondary schools - as  well as the challenges faced by the interviewed stakeholders when carrying out the activities.  The aim is to identify the needs and gaps regarding cybersecurity education and determine how  ENISA can provide additional support to the Member States.  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  4  1. INTRODUCTION  There is a common feature in modern cyberattacks: in most cases, basic computer hygiene  such as keeping software updated, using strong passwords, encrypting sensitive data, and  keeping copies in the cloud are sufficient to protect computers from such incidents.  For example, one often-overlooked aspect of the 2017 WannaCry attack is that, even though  more than 400,000 computers in over 150 countries were hit, millions were not affected  because they had updated their software. For this reason, WannaCry was defined as a “tribute  to negligence”4.  As mentioned in the 2017 High Level Group of Scientific Advisors on Cybersecurity to the  European Commission5, many Europeans still fail to take basic cybersecurity measures:  many  say they care a lot about their personal data, but then give them away for free on social  networks. Data are striking: 90% of the data breaches reported by the 2017 Verizon Data  Breach Investigation were the result of phishing. And for those who are successfully phished it  is not over, because they can expect it to happen again at least once during the same year.  Cybersecurity should therefore become a collective responsibility and cyber awareness and  computer hygiene should become an integral part of digital literacy programs. Without  awareness-raising campaigns and smart policies, cybersecurity will always be dogged by  collective action.  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  In line with the European Cybersecurity Act, Article 106, ENISA has the mission to focus its  efforts in supporting cybersecurity in all levels of education in the Member States. In this  context, ENISA has a mandate to support closer coordination and exchange of best practices  among Member States on cybersecurity awareness and education.  The current initiative is consistent with the existing EU Digital Education Action Plan which sets  two priority areas to prepare the next generations to face the challenges raised by the digital: i)  Fostering the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem and ii) Enhancing  digital skills and competences for the digital transformation.  There is a need for reshaping the content of the existing cybersecurity education programmes in  light of the constant evolution of the landscape in order to align the required knowledge and  skills.  Through this project, ENISA wants to develop a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing  cybersecurity in education across the EU and create a common platform to foster good  practices and knowledge sharing, in order to collaborate with the European Commission (EC)  and Member States in the creation and implementation of the required actions.  Through desk research and interviews with key stakeholders, and thus the use of primary and  secondary data, this report summarises insights around cybersecurity in education collected  from Member States.  4 James Lewis (2017), Darwin and Ransomware, CSIS  5 “The two most important ways to defend against security threats”, CSO (2019)  6 More information is available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477&rid=3  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  5  1.2 METHODOLOGY  The study is based on two initial steps: a desk study on the existing initiatives around  cybersecurity in education in all Member States, and then a series of interviews with a sample of  14 countries. The results obtained were consolidated in this report. Below is a list of the  interviews that were conducted as part of this study.

CONTEXT AND  BACKGROUND  This chapter provides background information on the context of educating children on  cybersecurity issues.  2.1 THE CYBERSECURITY EDUCATIONAL ROADMAP  Along with the increased use of technology in recent decades, the field of cybersecurity has  received more attention due to the greater exposure of citizens to ways in which they can be  subjected to data theft and damage. The role of cybersecurity experts in protecting critical  information and infrastructure, whilst relevant, remains insufficient to cover all internet users due  to the shortage of professionals in the market. The solution, which is to address the  cybersecurity knowledge level of citizens, requires reaching out to internet users of all age  groups, including the new generation.  Schoolchildren are often considered as early introduced to digital technologies and are a critical  group to be addressed to ensure that the next generation is well equipped with the skills to use  the online space more safely. According to the Cybersecurity Act7, respectively article 10,  ENISA is mandated to “raise public awareness of cybersecurity risks and provide guidance on  good practices for individual users aimed at citizens, organisations and businesses, including  cyber-hygiene and cyber-literacy”, demonstrated through initiatives such as European  Cybersecurity Month, European Cyber Security Challenge, European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework, CYBERHEAD – Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. At Member State level,  the introduction of the cybersecurity topic in school curriculums and activities alone can help  ensure that young users are more exposed to and aware of the cybersecurity field and  requirements, potentially leading them to choose this domain professionally and helping  address the shortage in the labour market.  2.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK  The Cybersecurity Act, which conferred ENISA a permanent mandate as an agency of the  European Union for cybersecurity, describes the goal of focusing efforts in supporting the  Member States in “their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity  awareness” (cf. Article 10 Awareness-raising and education).  According to the 2022-2024 Programming Document8, ENISA’s support should be ensured  through complementary actions such as capacity building by increasing the supply of qualified  professionals to meet market demand and promoting cybersecurity education. Activity 9, in  particular, outlines the intention to organise regular awareness campaigns, provide guidance on  best practices and support coordination between Member States on awareness and education.  The goal is to promote the cybersecurity topics, education and good practices on the basis of  the ENISA stakeholders’ strategy.  7 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA and on information  and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  8  ENISA Programming Document 2022–2024 available here: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate- documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  7  3. CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION INITIATIVES IN  EU MEMBER STATES  The mission of introducing young citizens to cybersecurity fundamentals has been expressed in  the national strategies of the Member States, which presented their plans of action focused on  improving the security and resilience of governments, companies and citizens through improved  national infrastructures and increased awareness. With various activities being carried out to  ensure that all target groups of society are involved, the introduction of the best practices to  children helps ensure that future generations are more apt to face an increasingly digital  society.  The table below illustrates the initiatives in cybersecurity education being carried out in the  Member States, where it is observed that governments intend on introducing cybersecurity  topics through the educational curriculum or training plans carried out in the school setting.  From the initiatives corroborated through the desk research and interviews, majority of the  initiatives are carried out at national level and pre-teens and teenagers are the target group  regularly pursued due to the increased independent use of digital technologies as well as the  optimal time to present a new career path before pursuing higher education. Member States like  Italy presented specific regional initiatives that will be carried out in additional regions in the  future.  Some Member States (40%9) showed that on-governmental organization (NGOs) and  institutions already involved in carrying out activities with children and adolescents have  developed additional initiatives that present and teach the principles of cybersecurity through  more practical or engaging approaches such as events, competitions, online platforms, and  games. The promotion of the initiatives is usually carried out online or through traditional media.  The teaching materials, developed for parents and/or teachers or directly aimed at the target  audience, are often available in the institutional or dedicated and available for free.  The list below solely displays the initiatives found through desk research and conducted  interviews, not representing an exhaustive scope of all projects currently being carried out in the  Member States.

CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  20  4. BEST PRACTICES AND  MAIN CHALLENGES  This chapter presents the identified best practices in Europe in terms of cybersecurity in  education for primary and secondary levels in Europe, based on the interviews.  4.1 GOVERNANCE AND PRIORITISATION PROCESS  This section presents the governance in place in some Member States in terms of cybersecurity  in education, as well as the prioritisation process of the educational activities in place.  Governance has been defined to refer to structures and processes (e.g., organisations involved,  reporting process) that are designed to build the initiatives. We found various different practices  regarding the governance in place in each country. Reporting is defined as the process of  regular provision of information to decision-makers – often ministries – within a country to  support them in their work. Prioritisation is defined as the specific process of deciding which  initiative should be developed and when.  Regarding the responsibility for initiatives, two main practices were observed in the Member  State consulted. On one hand (60%10), the National Cybersecurity Agencies manage all  initiatives (a ministry is always accountable, but the initiatives are designed by the Agency). On  the other hand, a ministry itself is responsible for designing the initiatives. The main difference  lies in the funding of the initiatives. In the case of the first practice, the Agency has to convince  the ministry it refers to “release” the necessary budget and implement the initiatives. In the case  of the second, there is no need to find sponsorship. We also saw many different stakeholders  involved in the initiatives (i.e., universities, IT companies, other experts…).  These practices are presented in more detail in the following tables:  Table 3:  Best practices of Member States regarding governance and prioritisation process  Good practice Example from a Member State  Organisation, reporting and prioritisation process  1  The National  Cybersecurity Agency is  responsible for the  initiatives around  cybersecurity in education  and reports to a ministry in  charge.  ANSSI (France) and the Ministry of Education work together towards  developing cybersecurity training and education, but there are no  strong sponsorships for the activities. The topic of cybersecurity  training and education for the youth is identified as a political priority  but remains an emerging challenge to be tackled in years to come in  France.  NUKIB (Czech Republic) ´s director reports directly to the prime  minister. NUKIB cooperates its activities with the Ministry of Education,  Youth and Sports as an equal partner. The ministry is responsible for  overall education strategy and NÚKIB is the coordinator of  cybersecurity educational activities (it makes sure that cybersecurity  education aspects are considered and included).  INCIBE (Spain) reports to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital  Transformation.  10 Based on the interviews conducted with 16 Member States, 9 out of 16 Member States indicated that the National  Cybersecurity Agency designs and takes the lead for all initiatives.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ https://www.nukib.cz/ https://www.incibe.es/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  21  Good practice Example from a Member State  2  A Ministry (or multiple  ministries) is responsible  for the initiatives and plays  a role of sponsor.  It gives the go-ahead to  the National Agency.  In Luxembourg, the Service national de la jeunesse (SNJ) is the  coordinator of the governmental initiative BEE SECURE, and the SNJ  is attached to the Ministry of National Education, Children and Youth;  Three ministries support the initiative (the Ministry of National  Education, Children and Youth, the Ministry of economy, the Ministry  of Family Affairs, Integration and the Greater Region).  3  A community of experts is  involved in the initiatives.  In Italy, ACN has set up a working group of stakeholders from  universities, high schools, and IT companies.  In Malta, MCAST Hackspace, sponsored by eSkills Malta Foundation  and supported by MITA, Cybersecurity Malta and Industry. Hackspace  is a virtual and physical space where students take part in security  dialogues between themselves and with Industry partners and also  include cybersecurity sessions for further learning.  In Estonia, a board of experts lead the initiatives with the help of a  community of teachers.  In Ireland, UCD works with other schools, and a lot of non-for-profit  organisations. This is facilitated by a working group of cybersecurity  education stakeholders, organised by the Ministry for Communications,  which oversees the National Cyber Security Centre.  We also identified two different practices regarding funding. Funding is the means by which the  money required to undertake an initiative is secured and then made available as required. Both  practices depend very much on the reporting presented above. In the first practice, which  usually occurs when initiatives are launched by a ministry, funding is provided entirely by the  ministry. The second occurs when the ministry responsible does not fund the initiatives.  Table 4: Best practices of Member States regarding funding  Good practice Example from a Member State  Funding  4  Funding is  provided by the  state.  In Ireland, UCD receives fundings form the Public Service Innovation Fund in  the Department of the Environment Climate and Communication.  5  Funding is  provided by  private sponsors  (industry) or  other means of  implementing the  initiatives are  found.  In Austria, the Ministry of Education is not implicated in the initiatives and is not  willing to fund those. The CSA thus works with a lot of organisations that do not  charge for their training and courses.  4.2 MEASUREMENT MECHANISM  This section presents the mechanisms that have been implemented in some Member States to  measure and monitor the effectiveness of the initiatives, as well as their completion.  The effectiveness of a project could be defined as the degree to which the objectives are met,  within the deadlines, respecting the agreed budget. The effectiveness of a project or initiative  can be measured by creating indicators (KPIs) to measure the level of performance.  There are different types of indicators, and it is possible to collect indicators them by different  means of data collection, (surveys, metrics (in a website), interviews, etc). After the collection of  data, you need to analyse and interpret the data to be able to make decisions based on the  results obtained.  https://www.acn.gov.it/ https://hackspace.mcast.edu.mt/ https://www.ucd.ie/ https://www.ucd.ie/ https://www.cybersecurityaustria.at/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  22  Regarding the initiatives, the effectiveness can be considered as the degree to which the  students are being educated in cybersecurity.  The KPIs are usually deployed to measure the completion of the objectives: follow up on the  daily activities (task completion); collecting feedback form participants and all stakeholders;  collection of analytics from websites and apps. Only some Member State actually collect KPIs  which measure the performance of the users in the activities. Measuring the impact of initiatives  on the target audience is complex.  Table 5: Best practices of Member State regarding measurement mechanism  Measurement mechanism Example from a Member State  1  Collection of task completion  indicators that reflect on the level of  completion of a specific initiative  NUKIB (Czech Republic) and ACN (Italy) both  implemented a KPI for task completion of its national plan.  2  Feedback collection from participants  of an initiative (teachers and other  stakeholders, students) to measure  the implication of stakeholders  UCD (Ireland) collects feedback from the participants after  each initiative  3  Collection of indicators of number of  people using a service to measure  visibility and attractiveness of those  services  INCIBE (Spain) collects indicators on the number of people  who have used their services: gender, age, geographical  location…  4  Observation of the performance of  the users in the activities  NCSC (Netherlands) observes if users are able to conclude  the objectives or not, and if additional tips should be added  5  Collection of analytics from websites  and apps to measure the  effectiveness  SNJ (Luxembourg) uses analytics from their website, their  social media accounts, and the campaigns they conduct  https://www.nukib.cz/ https://www.acn.gov.it/ https://www.ucd.ie/ https://www.incibe.es/ https://english.ncsc.nl/ https://snj.gouvernement.lu/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  23  4.3 KEY PRINCIPLES  This section presents the key principles that have been followed in developing the initiatives of  the interviewed Member States.  Various key principles were highlighted by the Member States. These principles guided the  approach taken by organisations in designing and deploying the initiatives. We found that the  key principles were often shared by many Member States.  The table below summarises the key principles that are followed by Member States in  implementing and designing their initiatives:  Table 6: Key principles followed by the Member States  Key principle Example from a Member State  1  Collaborative approach: basing the  initiatives on close collaboration with  stakeholders (ministries, schools and  teachers, industries, and other  experts…)  On top of the initiatives presented above with regard to the  experts’ communities: in Slovenia, The URSIV plans to  collaborate with selected secondary schools and faculties  to provide cybersecurity workshops locally, and connect  academia, industry and R&D institutions to attract more  young people to cybersecurity careers.  2  Pedagogic approach: actively involve  students in the activities  In France, ANSSI has created a kit designed for kids to  allow them to develop a cyber game  3  Pareto principle: looking for multipliers  to try to get maximum results by  exploiting the least amount of  resources  In Greece, the NCSA is forming strategic partnerships with  esteemed stakeholders, in order to reach wider audiences  and benefit from their proven know-how.  4  Preparing yearly plans to have a step  ahead of the next initiatives  In Malta, MITA focuses on preparing and executing yearly  plans that address the challenges and trends in the field of  cybersecurity, whilst still maintaining a plan flexible enough  to tackle new problems  5  Educating children through the  parents: creating a chain reaction  which starts with the parents and  reaches all levels of education  The eSkills Malta Foundation leads initiatives for parents  on how to make wise use of social media and the  consequences of misuse (e.g., go to the parent’s place of  work and provide sessions about online safety), in order  for the parents to have the best behaviour and therefore  become good examples for their children.  4.4 COLLABORATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS, INCLUDING  ENISA  This section presents the existing collaborations between organisations, countries, or ENISA, in  the field of cybersecurity education initiatives, in order to streamline activities or learn from each  other, share good practices. The collaboration can have different purposes, such as obtaining  more budget, or gaining expertise.  In conducting the interviews, we often noted that the interviewees stressed that they would  really like (if not already do) to work with ENISA and other Member States.  For most Member  States this is not yet the case. We have noted only a few of these, which are listed in the table  below.  https://projects2014-2020.interregeurope.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/tx_tevprojects/library/file_1634650456.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle https://mindigital.gr/ https://mita.gov.mt/ https://eskills.org.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  24  Table 7: Best practices of Member States regarding collaboration  Collaboration practice Example from a Member State  1 Collaboration between countries  Estonia works on a regular basis with Norway: they  organise a cybersecurity education summer camp and a  cybersecurity competition together.  2  Collaboration with ENISA (use of  ENISA material)  In Italy, ACN uses the European Cybersecurity Skills  Framework -developed by ENISA - for the identification of  professional profiles to be trained at the Lazio Cybersecurity  Academy.  https://www.acn.gov.it/  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  25  5. CONCLUSIONS  This chapter presents the main findings of the study, in particular it highlights the main  challenges and obstacles faced by EU Member States in implementing cybersecurity initiatives  in education within their countries and summarises the key priorities that ENISA should focus on  for the EU cybersecurity education roadmap.  5.1 CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED  This section presents any challenges or barriers encountered by the Member States in  implementing the Cybersecurity Education initiatives within their countries. A challenge can be  defined as a fact or process which has made (or still makes) the initiatives difficult to deploy, or  even prevented the initiative from reaching the expected level.  Below is a list of challenges faced by the Member States encountered in the deployment of the  initiatives:  • Rigidity of anchored culture of the ministries responsible for the cybersecurity  initiatives in education: The culture, which leads to cybersecurity being treated as a  secondary topic (as mentioned in the previous section), leads to a slow pace of change  management within these public bodies, which prevents national cybersecurity  agencies - or any other organisation designing the initiatives - from deploying them at  national level.  • Decentralized approach: In Germany and Austria, the country is divided into a  number of federal states, which have a certain amount of autonomy at many levels,  including in terms of educational strategy. This makes it impossible for them to  implement national initiatives, and very difficult to monitor local initiatives.  • Lack of time and resources:  o Teachers’ low availability: In some Member States, initiatives are launched  locally with teachers in their free time, which is very limited. It is then very  difficult to have them participate due to their low availability.  o Staff turnover: In some Member States, there is a high turnover in the teams  working on the initiatives. It is thus difficult to maintain the activities of the  initiatives on a long term.  • Lack of stakeholder recognition: Stakeholders who participate in initiatives,  sometimes in their spare time (e.g., teachers in many Member States), might not  receive enough recognition, which could further motivate them to participate in  initiatives. For example, it was mentioned that teachers could get a certification or a  badge, when they implement an initiative at school and the sense of ownership or  confidence, they are given could motivate them further.  • Need to take into account the different languages spoken in a country: In  Luxembourg, Belgium or Austria, for example, initiatives and especially support  materials need to be developed in the different languages of the country in order to  reach all the students.  CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION INITIATIVES  IN THE EU MEMBER STATES  DECEMBER 2022  26  5.2 KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE ENISA ROADMAP  This section presents the key priorities that ENISA should focus on for the EU cybersecurity  educational roadmap.  • Advice on how to approach ministries: For many Member States, the anchored  culture of the ministries responsible for the initiatives relegates cybersecurity, and in  particular the cybersecurity education field to the background. This makes it difficult to  push initiatives at national level and to get funding. Those Member States believe that  ENISA is in a strong position to convince the national authorities of the importance of  cybersecurity education, and to give them the keys on how to address the challenges.  • Advice on how to develop initiatives at national level: In some Member States,  such as Germany and Austria, the autonomy of the federal states within the country  makes it difficult to deploy initiatives at national level, and hampers progress on this  area. Those Member States hope that ENISA has the capacity to be the  backend/coordinator of the topic and identify and encourage local authorities to  develop educational initiatives.  • Visibility on what the other Member States are doing: Many Member States  expressed their willingness to compare and discuss existing initiatives deployed in  other Member States. By doing so, the Member States would be able to learn from  each other and make the most out of each State’s best practices, challenges  encountered, and key lessons regarding those initiatives.  • Encourage Member States to engage in partnerships with the private sector  (e.g., industry): While some Member States already engage in this kind of  partnerships (e.g., Italy, Slovenia…), most Member States miss on this opportunity to  access more technical / operational point of views, and also to build a multi-disciplinary  team. Indeed, this partnership with the private sector would allow to a collaborative  approach around decision making process and implementation of cybersecurity  innovation initiatives.

    "abstract": "Today, the internet is a tool used in many educational activities, which increases the amount of time children are exposed to cyberspace and its risks. Informing young users about the importance of maintaining personal privacy is not enough to keep them vigilant when using the internet. More proactive training is required to teach children to be safe online. Member States, which are advised to increase their cybersecurity capacity, have made efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness among their population through initiatives targeting different age groups of users. With regard to children in particular, the Safer Internet Centers1, co-funded by the European Commission, have proven to be the main drivers of the majority of initiatives at the national level and have served as a forum for cooperation and exchange of resources. In line with the European Cybersecurity Act, Article 102, ENISA has the mission to focus its efforts in supporting cybersecurity in all levels of education in the Member States. In this context, ENISA has a mandate to support closer coordination and exchange of best practices among Member States on cybersecurity awareness and education."

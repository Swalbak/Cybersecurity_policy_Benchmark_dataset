The growing relevance of information and communication technologies in the essential  functions of the economy has reinforced the necessity of prevention and protection measures in all  sectors, naturally including the finance sector.  This research aimed at understanding and comparing the obligations relevant to Information Security  within the finance sector in most of the EU28 Member States, to compare them with the Industry’s  prospects, and to draw a clear vision of important priorities for the future.  In order to understand the differences between the regulatory approaches and the priorities of the  Industry, a combined data stock taking approach was elaborated, including:  - A Desktop research, that was used to discover national requirements related to ICT security;  - Interviews of national financial supervisory authorities (NFSA) and information security  related obligations and standards;  - An online questionnaire, was used for collecting information from Industry representatives.  The analysis performed revealed the following key aspects:  - Convergence of regulations appear to be a desirable objective in order to reduce both the  heterogeneity of security levels as well as the overlapping of prescriptions in the field;  - Compliance costs for Companies established in several countries can be cumbersome;  - The definition of operative standards would be more effective for enhancing security levels  than issuing new high level prescriptions;  - International cooperation on security issues in the field might be the most feasible solution in  order to define common and appropriate guidelines.  Based on information collected, further research will be required to comparatively assess costs and  benefits of different potential scenarios for the improvement of information security baselines in the  finance sector.  This report issues four main recommendations:  - EBA and ENISA should consolidate scattered NIS obligations in supervisory guidelines;  - ENISA should establish guidelines on how NIS supervision practices in the Finance-sector apply  by extension to their supply chain, including Cloud providers that operate financial services;  - ENISA should establish guidelines which summarise the key conditions for the adoption of  Cloud-based applications or services in the Finance sector;  - ENISA should support the ECB and the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA) to organise regular and  voluntary NIS stress tests in the Finance sector: the purpose is to identify where possible black  swan risks and uncover to the greatest extent possible “unknown unknowns”.

They interact with National Central Banks, European  platforms (e.g. STEP2, TARGET2), and private networks operated by specialised managed providers.  Financial IT systems are exposed to a number of hazards which require consistent efforts to operate  securely. In recent years, NIS risks have become more complex and their impact can range from low  to very high, including domino effects. Such impacts will not be confined to the “virtual” world; a  major attack outreach would most certainly impact the assets in safekeeping or in transit.  1.1 Objective  As the finance sector overall is a complex aggregation of several players regulated from several  different angles, our aim was to understand both the coverage of Network and Information Security  (NIS) obligations in the European regulatory landscape (both at EU and Member State level), and  compare it with the Industry’s prospects. This comparison has led to a high-level overview of the  situation and to recommendations on the alignment of policies and needs where possible.  1.2 Policy Context  The analysis retained three major policies which have a direct or indirect impact on Finance sector’s  ICT. The reader can find all references in Annex:  - MiFID 2004/39/EC - Commission Directive 2006/73/EC of 10 August 2006 of the European  Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating  conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive;  - Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the  protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data;  - Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures  to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union -  COM(2013) 48 final.  The “Payments Services Directives (PSD) Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 13 November 2007 on Payment Services in the internal market” is also noteworthy as the  scope extent of its current revision (PSD2) is currently debated.  Information Security measures are dispersed overall across many European and National regulations.  Such fragmentation increases the need for common and shared guidelines  as Companies operate  more and more at pan-European level.  In Europe, the proposal for a new NIS Directive and the discussions documentation [COM(2013) 48  final - 2013/0027 (COD)] state that an “insufficient level of protection against network and information  security incidents, risks and threats across the EU [..., may undermine, ed.] the proper functioning of  the Internal market”1. This statement is particularly relevant in the finance sector, where a failure of  critical IT infrastructure can lead to major damages in the financial market.  1  COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT,  Accompanying the document “Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council  Concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and information security across the Union”, [COM(2013)  48 final].  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 6  Overall, three key regulatory categories and one catch-all category were identified, which refer to  policies that could indirectly affect finance sector professionals:  - the Data Protection category refers to regulation and standards which is relevant to the  protection of personal and sensitive data and information;  - ICT security category includes regulations and guidelines impacting ICT infrastructures’  security Governance and Management, regardless of the sector considered;  - Finance Sector Security refers to regulation and standards specific to the security of the  finance sector as a whole;  - Other to be defined, which refers to categorising all remaining references bearing a possible  indirect impact.  Beyond Europe, several other countries have already taken political decisions to reinforce the security  of the finance sector which have impact on foreign companies present in European Countries: e.g. the  U.S. the Homeland Security Department and the Department of the Treasury elaborated in 2010 the  “Banking and Finance Sector-specific plan” as an Annex to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan2.  1.3 Target audience  This document provides relevant information both at a strategic and governance level.  It is primarily intended to CISOs/CIOs/CTOs of the Finance sector, NIS Experts in National Financial  Supervisory Authorities, NIS Experts in the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA), and Professional Associations.  1.4 Methodology  The stock taking process used a three-angles approach:   The Desk research allowed to collect a consistent stock of publicly available regulations and  standards or relevant to Information security / Information assurance in the finance sector.   An Online questionnaire was used to investigate private operators’ security management  approach.   Interviews aimed at bridging the knowledge gaps between the Desktop research and the  questionnaire, while collecting further respondents’ spontaneous considerations and context  about the issue in object.  1.5 Scope  The interviews were elaborated based on the preliminary results of the desktop research and the  questionnaire. Their purpose was to drive in an efficient way the interaction with the National  Financial Supervisory Authorities and the Industry respondents.  Overall, a number of key questions were  used as entry points for obtaining more detailed information:  1.What security measures are relevant to your business activities ?  2.How are security measures implemented?  3.Which security measures are considered “best practices” ?  4.Which of these measures are voluntary and which are obligatory ?  2 US. Homeland and Security Department, and US. Department of Treasury, Banking and Finance Sector-Specific  Plan, Annex to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, 2010  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 7  5.How are threats and vulnerabilities considered within the existing regulatory landscape ?  6.How incidents are detected, managed and addressed ?  The questionnaire collected information and refined the understanding about organisations,  regulation and guidelines in place at national level which may impact directly or not the information  security in the finance sector. It also revealed how private operators approach security management  practically. The questionnaire was structured in three sections, which addresses issues related to a  macro-area in the field of information security:   Section 1 addresses the approach and the competences in the field of security;   Section 2 addresses private operators management approach to security concerns;   Section 3 had been left for additional considerations.  A short report with the main findings of each questionnaire has been elaborated and reported in  integral form in the Annex.  1.6 Document structure  The following pages present the key features of the investigation performed and the relevant  conclusions that emerged. In particular:   Chapter 2 provides high-level background information related to the specifics of the European  Finance System.   Chapter 3 presents a general view of information security related regulations in Europe, and  describes other frameworks considered as Security Baselines thorough the Industry.   Chapter 4 presents an analysis of the feedback collected among Security Professionals of the  Finance sector.   Chapter 5 proposes a number of recommendations for the future of NIS in the Finance sector.  •Sector structure  •Network  Infrastructures  •NIS drivers  •Risks and challenges  Finance Sector  overview  •Coverage  •EU  •National  •MS Differences  Regulatory  Landscape  • Industry's NIS  priorities  •Desirable features  NIS challenges and  opportunities  •Consolidate NIS  obligations  •Cover supply chain  •NIS stress tests  Recommendations  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 8  2 E-communications in the Finance sector  The denomination “finance sector” describes a complex mesh of different actors who achieve  different missions and goals. Their interaction is also complex and is better understood when adopting  an high-level view of the sector and exploring specific areas when required.  2.1 Sector structure  A taxonomy of relevant stakeholders was identified including associations and regulation institutions.  This taxonomy  aims to identify where information security concerns could be of relevance.  Figure 1  – Taxonomy of stakeholders presents a high-level view of the European Finance sector main actors,  including the relevant authorities.  Figure 1 – Taxonomy of stakeholders  The resulting taxonomy considered categorises stakeholders according to four main categories,  namely:  - Banks,  - Service Providers,  - Professional Associations  - Authorities.  In the area of Financial Authorities, we can distinguish two different levels:  - National Supervisory Authorities are in charge of financial institutions supervision.  Finance sector  Banks  Retail bank Private bank  Institutional  banks  IT providers  Messages Service  Providers  Infrastructure  Providers  Owned  Shared  FI Services  providers  Investment firm Payment  processors  RTGS managers Central  Counterparty  Clearing Houses  Professional  Associations  National EU / International  Authorities  National  Authorities  Central Banks  Supervisors  EU Institutions  European  Authorities  ECB ESMA  EBA EIOPA  International  Authorities  IMF BIS  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 9  - European Supervisory Authorities work to improve the functioning of the internal market by  ensuring appropriate and harmonised European regulation.  The term Financial Service activities encompasses the “Banks” and “FI Service Providers” categories.  These non IT/ICT activities can be considered as “core business” and consist overall in redistributing  funds other than insurance, pension funding or compulsory social security. The following activities are  considered:  - Monetary Intermediation (Central banking, other monetary intermediation): this group includes  transferable deposits (i.e. funds, obtained on a day-to-day basis not only from central banking,  but from other non-financial sources);  - Holding companies: this class includes the units that hold the assets (owning controlling-levels of  equity) of a group of subsidiary corporations which own the group; the holding companies in this  class do not provide any other service to the businesses in which the equity is held (i.e. they do  not administer or manage other units);  - Trust, funds and similar financial entities: this class includes legal entities organized to pool  without managing securities or other financial assets on behalf of shareholders or beneficiaries;  the portfolios are customised to achieve specific investment characteristics such as diversification,  risk, rate of return and price volatility. These entities earn interest, dividends and other property  income, but have little or no employment and no revenue from the sale of services;  - Other financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding: this group includes  financial service activities except those conducted by monetary institutions.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 10  2.2 Communications flows  The historical purpose of the finance sector is to  provide three types of services:  - Safe storage for financial assets;  - Financial assets movements capabilities  (and transactional support);  - Access to financial instruments  (Payments, Funds, Securities, Trade).  Overall, financial institutions (e.g. Banks,  Corporate and Investment companies) act as  brokers to borrowers on one side and lenders on  the other side. They rely on several  intermediaries, who provide services ranging  from depositaries to communications activities.  The key function of the finance sector is therefore the safe storage and communications of assets  (cash, gold, securities, etc.). This implies that financial institutions must be able to:  - Store those assets in a secure fashion;  - Communicate with comparable security levels with their counterparts, i.e. their customers,  their providers, their central banks, etc.  The protection of stored assets is comparable to a medieval fortress: for ages, banks have built vaults,  safes, and those were protected by safeguards. Nowadays, ledger books are entirely digital; physical  assets are rarely moved, but banks keep track records of each account statements and transactions in  their books.  The protection of assets in transit (i.e. transactions) require specific dedicated protection measures to  avoid crime, theft or fraud. The usual technologies are used (cryptography, tunnels, etc.), over a  variety of infrastructures that are detailed at a later stage.  The finance sector is actually a mesh of smaller, very specific functions which need permanent  communication channels with their counterparts. For example, Banks need to be able to communicate  on request with:  - Clearing Houses, both at National and European levels;  - Settlement platforms (e.g. TARGET2, national platforms now provide a bridge to the central  bank since the adoption of the Euro).  - Stock Markets;  - Payments processors.  - Etc.  Some of these smaller functions may be grouped within a larger holding company, and therefore  communications may happen internally in those finance groups. Indeed, over the past 30 years a  consolidation of several Banks or other financial functions through mergers and acquisitions was  observed. In such large groups, all communications happen on entirely private networks.  Banks and Payment processors need to relate themselves to National and European reserves, and  therefore use their settlement platforms when a movement of funds is operated (after it is cleared).  Depending on their size, they either have a direct connection to these platforms, or they may use  “service providers” who can register them as participants.  Retail Banks /  Intermediaries  Borrower s /  Spenders  Financial  Markets  Central  Banks  Lenders /  Savers  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 11  In Europe, an international dimension is present in addition  to the national dimension in many cases;  high volumes of transactions are processed cross-border.  Figure 2 below pictures information flows between Banks, Clearing Houses and Settlement platforms  (European and National).  Figure 2 - European Finance communications overview  2.3 Network infrastructures  Overall, the means for communications that financial institutions use are numerous. They tend to  make equal use of public and private networks, for which they can either be fully in control or be  totally dependent on their providers’ security and resilience features and operations.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 12  2.3.1 Infrastructure types  Four main categories of networks are used in the finance sector:  - Public (i.e. telephone networks, internet, etc.), which are used mostly for customer  interaction. In this case, Resilience is managed by the ICT provider, and Security by the  financial institution.  - Shared Leased / Owned (information networks e.g. Reuters and some Trade Markets) which  are used to access “business” networks. Resilience and Security are both managed mostly by  the service provider.  - Leased / Owned (private) lines usually connect headquarters to local branches or to  datacentres, or to their worldwide branches. They are provided by ICT Operators and financial  institutions use those lines for all internal connectivity (voice, data, multimedia). Resilience is  managed by the ICT provider (although financial institutions may choose to establish  redundant connectivity), and security is fully managed by the financial institution.  - Provided lines come with the subscription to a service or a platform, and are completely out  of the financial institutions’ control, except at the moment of deciding which type of  installation is contracted (e.g. SWIFT).  Figure 3 - Network types  •Ususually provided by  Telecom Operators  •Worldwide head office to  head office connectivity  •Head office to datacenter  connectivity  •Service providers also  provide Infrastructure and  Security services  •Fully owned, managed and  secured by SP  •Access to global finance  networks  •Information  •Quotes  •Trade Markets  •Security managed by  the Finance Institution  •Connectivity managed  by the ICT provider  •Customer Interaction:  •VPN tunnels to  partners  •SSL/TLS Internet  Leased /  Owned  (shared)  Leased /  Owned  (private)  Provided  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 13  International Networks  Banks may often establish one to one private links with counterparts to cut costs and avoid the fees  imposed by IT service providers. Many respondents however prefer to use IT service providers for  such purpose.  Many respondents referred to SWIFTnet as an IT service provider: SWIFT (The Society for Worldwide  Interbank Financial Telecommunication) provides a proprietary information network enabling  financial institutions to communicate financial messages in a standardised, secure and trustworthy  environment. SWIFT operates in 200+ countries and therefore provides an access point to many types  of international markets and counterparts. SWIFT provides the infrastructure, the software,  standardised message formats, input validation and many associated services to their customers.  SWIFT participants have however no control on the security and resilience measures of the software  or the network; they have to trust that both their main and backup gateways will operate and that  messages flow is never interrupted.  National and European Networks  At National and European levels, the same scenario may occur as described above. However, the  access to Euro settlement platforms (and therefore to the European Central Bank) is a specific service  to the TARGET2 platform.  European countries have implemented national gateways to the TARGET2 SSP (Single Shared  Platform), which is operated by the Central Banks of Germany, France and Italy3. For a few years now,  participants are required to interact through the SSP, and no longer through their National Central  Bank. The SSP includes a SWIFT gateway, however “Each TARGET2 participant has to subscribe to the  relevant SWIFT service according to its own participation profile”.  In Italy, SIANET4 is a private network provider, which can also route all national interbank commercial  payments (commercial payments, credit card transactions, check truncation, etc.) according to the  standards defined for RNI (Rete Nazionale Interbancaria). In Interbanking communications taking  place through SIANET, all messages are authenticated and depending on the use, encrypted.  2.3.2 IT service providers  The primary function of the Finance sector is traditionally far from information technology  preoccupations, and the Finance sector’s IT Banks and financial institutions faced major challenges in  automating their business processing. They built entire internal IT functions to address the arising  needs. These daughter companies are often however legally separated from their parent company,  and obtain a specific status (e.g. PSF “professionels du secteur financier” in Luxembourg) and  therefore a specific regulation.  Those IT Service Providers are often fully dedicated to provide their mother company with internal  services. In some cases, they also externalise some services to other companies. Their status remains  however the same as regards to the law as they need to demonstrate compliance to their mother  company’s regulatory requirements by extension. They however are usually ahead of regulations as  they apply a risk-based security governance which is driven by the security of their assets.  In some cases also, these companies have been established as joint-ventures.

Communication between such players usually takes place over the Internet, analogous  to companies connecting to their banks to make payment instructions or to retrieve account  information5,6, 7, 8. Many of these providers have a European presence, but can also operate from non- European countries.  2.4 Network and Information Security (NIS) drivers in Finance  Overall, the Industry uses three main layers for their information systems’ security governance:  - External oversight describes both the impact of standards and regulations which impact  networks and information security directly or not.  - Internal governance describes the strategic alignment to business objectives, depending on  which types of NIS architecture are necessary to support the business model.  - NIS operations describe the managed activities that allows the actual security to operate on a  daily basis.  According to Industry participants, international standards usually serve as a reference, but some  national standards also exist in larger European countries which are taken into account when  regulation is high-level.  Figure 4 - NIS drivers  2.4.1 About the influence of foreign regulations  The influence of international regulations and standards is significant for several reasons. Two  influential examples are significant:  - Basel III requires better liquidity provisioning; this will lead to a need for banks to be able to  reconstitute liquidity stocks at the end of day on the Interbanking market. Banks tend to  develop such provisioning with a trusted counterpart (i.e. call “operational intimacy). A secure  communication link is therefore critical for such type of communications;  5 http://www.ingcb.com/media/296564/ingserviceforswiftnet.pdf  6 http://www.bbp.ch/en/home.html  7 http://financialsystems.sungard.com/solutions/corporate-liquidity/syntesys-swift-services  8 http://www.tieto.com/services/business-process-services/business-information-exchange/bank-connectivity  External Oversight  EU regulations  National regulations  Supervisory  requirements  Compliance (AML,  ...)

Both sections do not list which internal controls are required, which lead in the  finance sector to largely adopt COSO or CoBIT as control frameworks. As a consequence,  Security is covered as voluntary measures under the following pillars: Security policy,  standards, access and authentication, network security, monitoring, and segregation of  duties, physical security 9. Companies regulated under SOX which have a European presence  are therefore required to follow SOX requirements.  2.4.2 Standards and Supervision  International and National Standards are also often used as a mechanism to further define some  specific, non-regulatory guidance on NIS matters. Several voluntary standards [such as the German IT- Grundschutz Manual, the UNI CEI ISO/IEC 27001:2006 Standard and the Industrial Standard PCI Data  Security Standard (PCI DSS)] are frequently highlighted by the involved respondents.  This approach appears to provide a double benefit: it improves security measures’ technical adequacy  (while regulations’ requirements remain at a general/service level) and provides Supervisory  Authorities with a clear and immediate understanding of the approach adopted: Supervisory  authorities prefer to understand whether or not the operator adopted sound security controls instead  of providing evidences of a specific technical measures in place.  The implementation of commonly recognised standards serves this purpose. For instance, the  Industrial Standard PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was designed by the association of several  payment providers (American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa  International) in order to improve the security baselines of major payment channels. This standard  was mentioned by many respondents as a key point of reference in the field, besides regulations, and  extended beyond the payment industry.  At Member State level, Regulations for Finance’s Technology vary widely both in depth and scope  coverage. National central banks and National Financial Supervisory Authorities10 form the National  regulatory foundation.  Banks are responsible for ensuring that their systems pass their supervision audits, and also that they  contractually provision adequate security levels from their service providers. Typically, supervisors  analyse and challenge the security specifications and practices (whether the implementing party will  be the banks themselves or external system and service providers).  Typically, Supervisors analyse and challenge the security specifications and practices (whether the  implementing party will be the banks themselves or external system and service providers).  9 http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/legal/overview-sarbanes-oxley-information-security-professional-1426  10  Typically there is one or two supervisory authority in addition to the national central bank. Eg., for UK they are Prudential  Regulatory  Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The typical mechanisms observed therefore are:  - Regulations define high-level obligations;  - Supervisory Authorities use Standards (national or international) to assess the application  of regulation.  http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/legal/overview-sarbanes-oxley-information-security-professional-1426  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 16  Beyond the international standards cited by all, Member States have developed standards that  address more specifically their own needs, e.g.:  - Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (Mindestanforderungen an das  Risikomanagement – The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority)  The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Baffin) provides a framework for risk  management for German financial institutes. It is based on EU Directive 2004/39/EC.  This framework relates to Senior Management’s responsibilities, general requirements for risk  management and resources including personnel, systems, technical facilities and related processes as  well as contingency plans. It includes references to the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues of the Federal  Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – BSI) and the  ISO/ICE 27002.  - Banking Act (Gesetz üben das Kreditwesen): The German Federal Financial Supervisory  Authority:  The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) refers to the Banking Act  (Kreditwesengetz – KWG) in banking supervision. The Banking Act lays down rules for banks which  they have to observe when they are being established and when they are carrying on their business.  Rules are designed to enable smooth functioning of the banking system, and it includes top-level  description of very basic requirements. For example, the Banking Act states that:  - The credit institution and BaFin shall put in place state-of-the-art measures to safeguard data  protection and data security.  - They shall guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the retrieved and transmitted data.  This state of the art is defined by BaFin in consultation with the Federal Office for Information Security;  actual measures are not described in the Banking Act.  - Swiss National Bank: The National Banking Act 3/2004  The Swiss National Banking Act obliges the National Bank to oversee systems operating clearing,  settlement and other financial instruments. The text applies also to operators that are domiciled  abroad, provided that substantial parts of the operation or leading participants are located in  Switzerland. The Banking Act states that the National Bank may demand that minimum security  requirements are fulfilled.  - The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority: Management of operational risk, standard 4.4b  The supervision standard establishes an obligation for operational risk management in financial  organisations. It provides detailed instructions on special subjects such as process management, staff,  information and payment systems, information security, continuity planning, and legal risks.  Chapter 6.8 covers payment systems and payment services. There are eight (8) controls that banks  \"shall adopt\". These include payment systems characterisation, means of payment, stating principles  for fund transfers in payment systems, ensuring internal control for efficient and secure payment  services.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 17  3 European Regulatory Landscape  The regulations and standards identified as relevant to the Finance Sector’s Security of IT assets were  categorised under a meta-framework for security measures developed during the implementation  phase of the telecom package’s Art.13a.11. The benefits of using this framework are numerous:  - The framework in substance covers most of the security measures and domains already used  in worldwide standards and can easily be mapped with them (e.g. ISO, CoBIT, …);  - It covers most of the areas of concern at this stage;  - It provides a sound and measureable means of comparison between different regulatory  models.  The framework is organised in domains and sub-domains. The figure below provides the framework’s  skeleton:  Figure 5: security measures meta-framework  Based on the above framework, several different security strategies were horizontally compared. This  revealed which categories are covered by binding regulations and which ones are delegated to  voluntary measures or commonly recognised standards.  The information obtained was further merged to identify possible gaps and attract the attention of  decision makers.  3.1 Regulations’ provisioning for NIS  Based on the information collected during the initial phase, a representative sample of 8 EU countries  was defined and a preliminary analysis was performed in order to understand which category of  security measures are typically covered by regulations.  3.1.1 European level  At the European level, the financial supervision is still relatively recent (2011 for EBA, ESMA and  EIOPA); it was established as a response to the financial crisis and covers mostly the regulation of  financial instruments and practices.

Their role  in the supervision of the finance sector’s information technology domain is however not their main  focus.12  EU Directives overview  The preliminary identified set of EU regulations had also been analysed in order to identify the topic  addressed by EU prescriptions. Regulations are usually rather high level; our analysis attempted to  identify both direct references to NIS-related obligations, or obligations which indirectly impact NIS  measures and organisations. In cases of indirect impact, the precise reference of the regulatory text  in the directive is referenced.  The information analysed is reported in the following table:  Reference Contents  Proposal for a Directive on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) -  COM(2012) 11 final    D1-SO1 Information security policy (Chapter III)    D1-SO3 Security roles and responsibilities (Chapter IV  Section 4)   D3-SO12 Integrity of network and information security  (Chapter IV Section 1 and 2)   D7-SO24 Security assessment (Chapter IV Section 3)  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the  Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of  network and information security across the Union - COM(2013)  48 final   D5-SO18 Incident reporting and communication   D4-SO13 Operational procedures  Opinion 03/2014 on Personal Data Breach Notification -  693/14/EN WP 213 - Adopted on 25 March 2014 - Article 29 Data  Protection Working Party   D5-SO18 Incident reporting and communication (Article  2)  Financial and Compliance Audit Manual, European Court of  Auditors, 2012   D7-SO24 Compliance monitoring  Directive 2004/39/EC on market on financial instruments, 2004  D1-SO1 Information security policy  Directive 2002/58/CE concerning the processing of personal data  and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications  sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communication), 2002   D3-SO11 Access control to network and information  systems  Directive 2000/12/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the  business of credit institutions   D1-SO1 Information security policy (Article 30)  Table 1 - European Regulations mapping  SecuRePay recommendations  In October 2013, the European Central Bank (ECB) published the “Recommendations for the security  of internet payments”, often referred to as “Secure Pay recommendations” 13. These requirements  directly impact Payment Processors and ecommerce companies.  These include the obligation to ensure:  -  regular risk assessments, gap analyses;  - breach/incident monitoring and reporting;  - risk control and mitigation;  - transaction traceability;  12  http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_general_framework/index_en.htm  13 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversionafterpc201301en.pdf  http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_general_framework/index_en.htm https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversionafterpc201301en.pdf  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 19  - customer identification and strong authentication;  - adoption of strong authentication tools delivered to the customer;  - transaction monitoring;  - protection of sensitive transaction data;  - customer/end-user education.  These recommendations are focused on systems security; they impact directly the security  governance of payments processors and merchants. Indirectly, they influence the specifications and  engineering of future payments means (3D secure, mobile payments, etc.) and increase the criticality  of network communications.  Impact of MiFID II / MiFIR  MiFID II / MiFID (Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments) does not contain any NIS  specific measures to be implemented. However, the obligation of transactions reporting have an  indirect impact that has been cited by a few respondents: the obligation of traceability for transactions  leads, in terms of security, to the requirements that all transactions must be non-repudiable14, which  also introduce integrity assurance. As a result, stronger authentication mechanisms and complete  transaction history is an obligation for all players in the Securities market. Typically, Transaction  Reporting and Recordkeeping (MiFIR, recitals 32-36, Articles 24-27; MiFID, Article 66; MiFID II, recitals  52, 57, 71, Article 16) are the main drivers for improved NIS15.  Several central banks and supervisors require that financial institutions report the incidents which  affect their operations. For example in the UK, the financial institutions are required to report to the  relevant authority (BoE, FCA) about operational interruptions of a payment system provider  (regardless of the cause of this interruption, which could be, e.g. a cyber-incident). According to  respondents, the communication channels used between banks and authorities are “of course  adequately secured” but no further details were provided.  The incidence of national regulations on Finance NIS is therefore scattered across many different  regulations also at National level.  3.1.2 Member States’ approaches and cultural differences  Following the analysis of the European regulations, the objective was to understand if Member States  implemented those directives together with additional requirements.  In the selected countries, the differences are based in the nature of obligations (either Regulatory or  Legal). In several Member States, financial institutions are required to report to national authorities  many different aspects of their operations (such as operational risks, issues in payment processing or  transfers, outsourcing, and so on). This reporting is often specified in detail and leads to  recommendations issues by the supervisor to the financial institution. The scope consists of the types  of communication channels and the methods of securing them. Also, it is of interest whether financial  institutions are required to report various cyber incidents and similar issues to the national authorities.  Based on the information collected, the topics covered during the supervision exercises vary widely in  nature and in depth.  14 www.linklaters.com/pdfs/mkt/london/MiFID2-Fact-sheet.pdf  15 http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/mifid/index_en.htm  http://www.linklaters.com/pdfs/mkt/london/MiFID2-Fact-sheet.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/mifid/index_en.htm  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 20  BE FR DE IT NL PT ES UK EU  D1: Governance and risk  management  SO 1 Information security policy  •  • • •  SO 2 Governance and risk  management  • • •  •  SO 3 Security roles and  responsibilities  • •  •  SO 4 Security of third party assets  • • •  • •  D2: Human resources  security  SO 5 Background checks  •  SO 6 Security knowledge and  training  •  •  SO 7 Personnel changes  •  •  SO 8 Handling violations  D3: Security of systems  and facilities  SO 9 Physical and environmental  security  •  •  SO 10 Security of supplies  SO 11 Access control to network and  information systems  • •  •  SO 12 Integrity of network and  information systems  • •  • • • •  D4: Operations  management  SO 13 Operational procedures •  •  • •  SO 14 Change management  •  SO 15 Asset management  D5: Incident management SO 16 Incident management  procedures  • •  •  SO 17 Incident detection capability  SO 18 Incident reporting and  communication  •  •  •  D6: Business continuity  management  SO 19 Service continuity strategy and  contingency plans  • •  • •  SO 20 Disaster recovery capabilities  •  D7: Monitoring, auditing  and testing  SO 21 Monitoring and logging policies  • • • •  •  SO 22 Exercise contingency plans  SO 23 Network and information  systems testing  SO 24 Security assessments  • • •  • •  SO 25 Compliance monitoring  •  Table 2 - Comparative overview of the Information security-related topic addressed at national level  In order to complete the overall landscape, the data was enriched with a column to visually compare  the delta of National regulation with EU directives. Typically, Member States should have  implemented those directives in National regulations; in other cases, the regulations remain high level  and the control that the obligation is fulfilled is performed at the supervisory level.  In addition to the security measures found in the meta-framework we used, we noticed that National  regulations frequently addressed additional topics. Those topics are either sub-sector specific (i.e.  payments or Finance IS professionals) or they are an extension of financial supervisory rules. The  following are noteworthy:   Third parties and outsourcing [e.g. Danish Executive Order in outsourcing significant areas of  actitivy, or the Spanish CIRCULAR 3/2008, de 22 de mayo, del Banco de España, a entidades  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 21  de crédito, sobre determinación y control de los recursos propios mínimos]; Various situations  concerning the requirements imposed to third parties For example in Spain no additional  contractual requirements were imposed on third parties on information security levels. In  Germany, third parties are bound by contract to allow finance sector supervisory authority to  audit their activities.   Contingency plan and data recovery requirements [egg. Mindestanforderungen an das  Risikomanagement (MaRisk, Minimum Requirements for Risk Management)];   E-payments security.  The data collected reveals differences in terms of regulatory coverage depending on the Member  States. Darker colours mean that one or several regulation(s)/standards cover from different angles a  given domain. In essence, those regulations may cover the same topic, but in different parts of the  industry (Retail, Corporate, Payments …).  Only the countries in scope are coloured. The others are greyed out.

The distribution of the most frequently covered domains in different regulations is reported in the  following graph. The Y-axis shows the percentage of Member States from our sample that refer to a  given domain.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 23  Figure 13 – Security measures recurrence  3.2.1 Lack of coverage and emerging trends  Several topics defined remain out of the scope of the regulations. The topics not covered relate to  topics which can be qualified as “how” to comply with proper security measures, e.g.:  - Handling Violations [D2.SO8]  - Assets Management [D4.SO15];  - Incident Detection Capability [D5.SO17];  - Exercise Contingency plans [D7.SO22];  - Network and Information Systems testing [D7.SO23];  - Compliance monitoring [D7.SO25].  From this standpoint, the absence of such specifications make sense in the regulatory foundation;  laws and implementing laws typically remain at a level of abstraction which provides freedom of action  within boundaries.  One aspect, however, is on the verge of becoming more regulated, as the trends indicate: the topic  “security of supplies” [D3.SO10] is now on the radar of several member states: this is the case of the  Danish Executive order on IT audit in datacentres owned by financial institutions. Besides a few major  banks which manage IT internally the majority of smaller banks rely on datacentres which are jointly  owned and managed by the banks. The regulations dedicated to such shared data centres pertain to  requirements and procedures for supervision practices almost exclusively.  This situation might be considered under two different perspectives:  - On one hand, the auditing process is facilitated by having one single service provider to control  the information security of all the financial operators. All operators which rely on the same  data centre will have a standardised level of security;  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 24  - On the other hand, the collection of data and information on a single provider might be a  vulnerability for the system; an attack to a single datacentre might impact a number or even  all finance operators relying on that single service provider.  Security of supplies is however to be considered as a much broader topic than simply the provisioning  of supplies for financial institutions; each point of the financial mesh is both receiving and supplying.  In this respect, such regulations’ scope will be under scrutiny to understand whether new texts  adopted address both upwards and downwards Supply Chain Management (SCM).  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 25  4 Industry’s prospect  Often, Industry perceives regulations as yet an additional constraint that they have to comply with;  this is a strong dichotomy with the original intent of regulations and standards. The natural step after  assessing the regulatory landscape is not intended to increase the depth or scope of such regulations,  but to better understand which mechanisms can help the sector altogether to improve their security  baseline.  The Industry’s concerns are usually orthogonal to the usual scope covered in the Regulatory  landscape. This can be easily explained:  - Mature companies already comply with regulatory requirements, and their maturity level  allows them to consider further risks;  - Less mature companies are essentially driven by threats and risks and address these in a less  proactive manner.  The purpose of studying this dimension is to better understand where the needs are, to define  recommendations for future support to industry beyond their usual compliance exercise.  4.1 Risks and Challenges  In general, large international banking groups demonstrated a good understanding of the Risk  Landscape and the available Security schemes. Many companies follow a clear Information Security  Management System (ISMS), and adopt Standards and Control frameworks as part of their Security  Governance.  Many banks have introduced further good practices especially in the area of IT governance (e.g.: roles  and responsibilities; certification to the International Standards like ISO27001 and 22301) and  demonstrate a clear information security strategic vision. Security related prescriptions are mostly  reported in national regulations or are defined by sector-internal strategies. In some Member States,  industry stakeholders publish high-level security and compliance strategies and participate in  exercises planned by their Central Bank.  Medium-sized stakeholders demonstrate limited top management involvement, limited capacity to  be certified against current international standards, and a de-prioritisation of security investments.  Such difference of situation is not new, it is also not specific to the Finance sector. The aim is to  understand where such prospects could impair Financial resilience altogether.  Risk Management Domains  Typical risk management practices and threats are well known and understood by respondents.  Respondents especially mentioned that “Risk Management” was not NIS-specific, which was later  confirmed by literature review. The finance sector manages mainly risk in “sectors”, and they make a  clear distinction between Financial, Operational and IT risks.  Figure 14 sets the Information Security risk domain in the overall perspective; it expands broadly  across all categories.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 26  Figure 14 – Information security risks in Financial risks landscape  Typically, NIS therefore belongs to the information risk area despite having a potential impact on the  three pillars above mentioned. In the opinion of several respondents, NIS risk is a horizontal risk that  pertains to all the others:  - Poor input controls may lead to fraud risks;  - Insider threats were reported by many as a “hot topic” in several member states, which could  be both categorised under “Finance risk” or “Information Security Risk”;  - Payment being almost entirely digital nowadays also relates more to an Information security  risk than a purely financial risk;  - Etc.  Security governance  At present, the Security Governance and the NIS Risk management are therefore typically part of the  Technology divisions.  Interviews revealed that in many cases, top management is only formally involved once a year, as this  constitutes in many Member States a binding prescription. Respondents underlined that, as the CISO  often reports to the CIO, both budget lines conflict in times of ICT budget restrictions. In particular,  CISOs suggested that the Security budget (Safety, ICT Security, and Security Continuity) should be  separated from all other budgets and be approved directly by the Board of Directors. In addition, the  Board of Directors should appoint one of its members as a delegate for the company’s security.  In light of these considerations, this topic should possibly be further discussed and pragmatic solutions  be presented in the light of the upcoming directives (NIS and PSD2).  Security assessments  The replies collected concerning the usual security assessment practices were in line with the  requirements usually found in international standards. Several statements support this observation,  e.g.: «CISO defines policies, structures and techniques …», « Vulnerability analysis is carried out every  year…»; «Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis at least annually»; «all security incidents are  Information Security  Risk  Security Specific Threats /  Vulnerabilities  Identity and Access  Management  Encryption  Web Security Infrastructure  Specific  Security Monitoring Defense in Depth  Attacks  Systems Financial Assets  ...  Operational Risks  Fraud Money Laundering  Payment Insider Threats  ...  Business Risks  Credit Lending  Cash Flow Reputation  ...  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 27  logged, classified, analysed, and discussed with internal audit and at the periodical management’s  review meeting».  The answers collected on the “systematic security assessments” topic suggest that most actors  operate in an adequate way fulfilling all regulatory and standards requirements. Other aspects of the  feedback received also suggest that the approaches implemented, the binding prescriptions, the  voluntary measures / strategies aim at enhancing information security both globally and in-depth.  4.1.1 Mitigation limitations  Three dimensions of complexity  The structure of the finance sector is complex overall. Threats and potential weaknesses vary  according to the business type and the security model adopted: for instance, Investment banks or  high frequency trading (HFT) might face difficulty in ensuring the continuous and balanced provision  of information security in their activities.  Customer-facing operators might be more exposed to risks related with the rapidly evolving  technological environment. On the other hand, while the technological environment is rapidly  changing, the business and financial services landscape is also rapidly evolving (e.g. new competitors,  emerging market models, etc.). The combination of these trends influence the degree of complexity  of the financial sector itself and of the information security management requirements.  Supply chain in security measures  The key issue reported by participants during our interview process relates to the dichotomy between  the security objectives / obligations of their company, and the fact that many aspects are totally under  3rd party control: this remark applies both to messages / networks service providers. Likewise this  issue seems to extend to other supply areas: Banks are responsible for instance for the protection  against data leaks, but cannot always configure entirely the devices they purchase (mobile phones,  tablets, laptops, servers, operating systems, etc.).  Another issue was reported several times and is noteworthy: the need for including the entire supply  chain as part of principle security measures. Respondents mentioned several outsourcing contracts  with major providers (e.g. Telecom Operators, SWIFT, IBM, Microsoft, …). They perceived that such  world-class providers implement and maintain satisfactory security levels on their services.  Smaller providers are also used, and respondents felt that these might be more subject to breaches;  such attacks might be aimed those weaker links as a way to enter the target victim.  Last but not least, when required, respondents mentioned many international standards (ISO 27001,  31000, 22301) but none cited ISO 28000, confirming that supply chain security requires more  attention.  Privacy considerations  Current technology allows both private companies and public authorities to use personal data on an  unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Individuals increasingly make personal  information available publicly and globally. Because of the close relation between information  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 28  technology’s evolution and economic development16, personal data protection play a central role in  the Digital Agenda for Europe, and more generally in the Europe 2020 Strategy. A “personal data  breach” is defined by Directive 2002/58/EC in Article 2 as “a breach of security leading to the  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal  data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed in connection with the provision of a publicly available  electronic communications service in the Community” 17.  Skills shortage  Finally, although risk and security issues are very well understood among operators, many issues still  remain. The finance sector operators manifest a positive tendency to invest in IT security, with a  growth in the amounts invested varying from +6% to +10% in the past years. Nevertheless, a lack of  skilled and competence staffing persists in the field of IT security in the finance sector, which leads  many finance operators to contract external experts or consultancy companies to secure their  infrastructures and communications. Such security functions should however be considered more  critical since those experts are requested to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).  4.2  Desirable features  The NIS management instruments mentioned are numerous in the sector, and many of them  expressed limited concerns related to their ability to manage an adequate security level. In some  cases, a few of them hoped for:  - Company cultural change to integrate more future security insights;  - Improved corporate NIS awareness and involvement;  - Consolidated standards and guidelines for implementing sustainable security strategies;  - Voluntary NIS exercises both at national or European level, with the inclusion of their supply  chain.  The first topics may be addressed by additional supervisory requirements, in the member states where  NIS governance is covered by the law. In the others, raising the awareness on such issues may be a  possible alternative.  The two following topics (NIS guidance and cooperation) are further detailed below:  - From Compliance to Sustainable Security Objectives  The finance sector, overall, is perceived as being a “state of the art” implementation of sustainable  security measures in almost all areas (e.g. Web Banking security, internal security procedures). In most  cases, the compliance to Supervisors’ requirements comes usually as an addition to high-level  regulations and is a compliance exercise.  However, Supervisory requirements on Information Security differ widely from one country to  another and the compliance exercise can become extremely complex. Unlike business areas –where  finance instruments are already supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)- the  supervision convergence for network and information security is still a work in progress. Additionally,  Financial Services that operate worldwide are also bound by foreign legislation. This compliance  overhaul is increased when IT Infrastructures are either outsourced or physically reside under remote  16  DORANTES C., KO M., “Impact of Information security breaches on financial performances of the  breached firm: an empirical investigation”, in Journal of Information Technology Management, Vol. XVII,  n.2, 2006; PONEMON INSTITUTE, Ponemon Study Shows the Cost of a Data Breach Continues to Increase,  2012.  17 Opinion 693/14/EN WP 213  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 29  legislations: the use of Cloud Computing creates much supervisory and compliance concerns. Many  respondents also related that they are rarely fully aware of all the implications and impact of  regulatory requirements; they felt these were scattered across several different texts, and that a single  implementation guideline would be precious (See Figure 15).  Figure 15 - from compliance to security objectives  Furthermore, current regulations were criticised for considering mostly the prevention of “Financial  Incidents”. The risks arising from information security, data confidentiality or business continuity  could be encompassed as critical component of the financial stability. This reveals a demand for  assessing the financial system’s resilience globally; a combined Business/IT stress-testing was also  advocated at large scale.  - Cross Sector / Cross Border Cooperation opportunity  The extra-mile to enhanced security and resilience was recommended to be approached using self- commitment and cooperation, possibly supported by the guidance of National IT Supervisors.  Furthermore, since Regulation should establish principles rather than specific measures, Interviewees  felt that recommendations should not lead to strengthen regulation as a result. Self-commitment to  guidelines and standards is perceived as a practical and pragmatic method. Such guidance would  benefit greatly to smaller institutions which do not face the same challenges as larger ones.  Global European cooperation and Good Practices sharing could allow a better understanding of the  Risks and Security challenges faced by the Finance Sector. Any means of cooperation should include  the relevant stakeholders from regulators, banks, system and service providers, clearing houses, and  other relevant parties.  - Contingency planning and exercises  A majority of respondents stressed the importance of contingency plans’ testing recurrence. Besides  being able to demonstrate that information security is managed, and that contingency plans are  established, there is a need to demonstrate its periodical testing and update. Respondents suggested  that an optimal recurrence for such exercises would need to follow a two-fold principle:  1. contingency plans testing is requested at least once a year, although for very critical  components and infrastructures it would be even most appropriate to having it test twice a  year;  2. contingency plans testing is necessary each time major changes occur in the management  structure or in the physical infrastructure: this helps to ensure that the plan is consistent to  the changed conditions are eventually appropriately updated.  Affordable Security Security Objectives  Standards Guidelines  National  Regulations National  Supervisory  Requiremen  ts  EU  Regulations  EU  Supervisory  Requiremen  ts  Security  Assurance  Frameworks  Security Compliance  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 30  In a few Member States, operators are required to periodically test their contingency plans, and also  to develop scenarios in cooperation with their partners and service providers to guarantee that the  entire supply chain is appropriately tested.  Respondents mentioned the fact that finance sector operators might be required to comply to  regulations related to critical infrastructure security (egg. in the case of Spain, where selected major  financial operator are requested to comply with the requirements of the Ley 8/2011, de 28 de abril,  por la que se establecen medidas para la protección de las infraestructuras críticas).  This approach, while it improves practical security levels, demands additional compliance efforts from  finance sector operators. These efforts might required guidance by specialised Government bodies or  CERTs.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 31  5 Recommendations  Based on the information collected and reported a number of desirable measures, tools and objectives  can be formulated in the field of Information Security in the finance sector:   A European Security Guidebook: the definition of a common set of guidelines would  represent a possible solution for the implementation of common operative security standards  rather than defining service-level regulations. Among finance sector operators, standards  appear to be frequently used to ensure both prevention, detection and response to security  concerns. In addition, common guidelines on how to assess the cost-benefits of Information  Security investments and how to effectively involve top management in security investment  decisions is key;   Supply Chain Security: Operators could find several benefits in implementing risk  transparency between them and their immediate operational circle.   Security Intelligency: International cooperation of finance sector operators might be the  most effective approach in defining a common set of indications. It could ensure both a  consistent level of technicality on the elaborated guidelines and an appropriate “operator- friendly” approach to realistic security measures. Moreover, cooperative occasions could  potentially include regular NIS stress-tests in the finance-sector;  The figure below summarises this three pillars approach and their desired effect:  Figure 16 - Recommendations structure  European Security  Guidebook  •Clarify security  regulations  •Common Security  Criteria  •Security guidance  •Customer Data  Protection  Supply chain Security  •Cloud Computing  •Cooperation with  SCM  •SCM upwards  requirements  •SCM downwards  Security Intelligence  •Risk/Threats  •Preparedness  •Exercises / SOPs  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 32  Those objectives are translated into recommendations below.  1. Establish a European NIS guidebook  This guidebook should contain useful guidance for CISOs of the Finance sector, independent from the  size of their company, which comprehends:  - A clear set of security measures, aligned with National standards used by Supervisors;  - An evaluation framework.  Recommendation: ENISA will support EBA in building a guidebook on horizontal, pan-European  security measures.  This guidebook would by no means need to be mandatory; it should however be an authoritative  source for good practices and recommendations. For instance, it would cast in stone the need for a  separate executive management line between CISO and CTO/CIOs, in order to secure funding for NIS  matters, as suggested by many respondents.  ENISA proposes to consider the Security domains used in Chapter 3 to evaluate the scope of  regulations in the Member States. Those seven domains can be studied and discussed, and measures  be defined only if there is a rationale to do so.  2. Enable systematic cooperation between the Finance Sector and their supply chain  In many cases, respondents mentioned that they were liable for several security aspects that were  outsourced and outside of their control. While contractually they are allowed to perform security  assessments for these outsourced contracts, they felt that the inclusion of their supply chain in  supervision frameworks could address several issues. However, these aspects need to be defined  comprehensively.  ENISA will support the identification of specific issues in the supply chain’s NIS.  3. The case for Cloud Computing  As the European Commission encourages the European companies to use Cloud Computing to  increase their mobility and resilience, the Finance sector will be likely to request that extra security  guarantees are given so their data and processing remain safe (or even safer).  Recommendation: EBA and ENISA should define the conditions for adoption of Cloud-based services  and applications in the Finance sector. The special case of services already used by the Finance sector  which are cloud-based are identified and that they can apply by extension the measures contained in  existing supervisory frameworks.  4. Stress tests and global security intelligence  The objective and scope of security intelligence is to provision for extreme NIS issues, or even issues  qualified as “Unknown unknowns”.  Those stress tests’ purpose would be to evaluate the maturity level of the Finance-Sector when  compared against the NIS Guidebook; instead of performing a checklist audit, the stress test would be  based on a realistic incident scenario to which participants would be able to voluntarily participate.  ENISA would support extensively those tests.  Recommendation: ENISA should develop a Good Practice Guide based on Industry’s input on:  - Extension of NIS Guidebook to Supply Chain (upwards and downwards);  - Existing NIS standards and baselines.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 33  The objective is therefore to improve the efficiency of security measures by testing them in fictious  scenarios (i.e. exercises).  Recommendation: ENISA should support the ECB and the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA) to organise regular  and voluntary NIS stress tests in the Finance sector.  The results of the stress tests will help to identify global and structural NIS weaknesses. They will be  anonymised and key conclusions circulated after the test among participants.

The table below summarises the  scope of each of them:  Table 3 - EU regulators  The supervision of the IT is typically a national competence. European authorities however influence  the national practices: a single market requires a single rule book adoption which EBA typically  supports. NIS Supervisory rules are also considered and discussed during EBA’s IT supervisory boards.  C.2 National Authorities  Based on the information preliminary collected at national level, regulators’ mission is typically  twofold: regulation and supervision. In some cases, they support the implementation of specific, one- off regulations. In the EU28, the following is generally observed:  - National Central Banks (NCB) are usually in charge of regulations. They are supported by the  relevant ministries or technical committees.  - Supervision is often the responsibility of a specific branch of the NCB or may be delegated to  other institutions.  Such setup however depends greatly on the size of the Member State. In some Member States, some  functions may be merged or organised differently. The initial interviews performed confirmed the  preliminary hypothesised scheme of roles and competences: Supervisors and Regulators are often  hosted within the same entity. Three different models exist, and their function can either be:   Part of a dedicated department of the National Central Bank, as in the case of Banco de  Span Directorate General Banking Supervision, or in the case of Banca d’Italia;   A shared responsibility between the National Central Bank and an Agency, which is the  case for BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) working in close  cooperation with the Deutsche Bundesbank.  ESFS (European System of  Financial Supervision)  Competences and functions  ECB  European Central Bank  The central bank for Europe’s single currency is mainly committed to maintain price  stability in the euro area. The ECB is expected to have an active role concerning banking  supervision under the upcoming Single Supervisory Mechanism.  EBA  European Banking  Authority  It is an independent EU Authority responsible for prudential regulation and supervisor of  the European banking sector. Its main aim is to provide a single set of harmonised  prudential rules for financial institutions throughout the EU.  EIOPA  European Insurance and  Occupational Pensions  Authority  “EIOPA is part of the European System of Financial Supervision consisting of three European  Supervisory Authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board. It is an independent  advisory body to the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the  European Commission”.  “EIOPA’s core responsibilities are to support the stability of the financial system,  transparency of markets and financial products as well as the protection of insurance  policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries.”  ESMA  European Security and  Markets Authority  ESMA is an independent EU Authority committed to contribute to ensure the integrity,  transparency, efficiency and functioning of the securities markets, particularly enhancing  investor protection and by fostering supervision convergence at EU level.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 38   Be performed autonomously by a dedicated institution, as in the case of the Danish  Finanstilsynet.  The organisation within one country does however not affect the principle: both Regulation and  Supervision are typically covered in every Member State.

Operational risks)  C.4 Professional Associations  Professional Associations are worth mentioning as they often constitute a representation of the  European Finance Sector to the Authorities. They are therefore typically within the network reach of  public decision makers, they voice the interests of the Industry on the verge of new discussions on  legislation matters.  Beyond this type of activities, associations are also setup with other objectives: Information Sharing,  Security Awareness Raising, Education, Professional Training, Conferences, Analytics, etc.  Many European-based associations exist; a number of associations or non-profit organisations have  also arrived from other continents and develop similar activities both with European and non- European members.  To complete the overview of the framework of organizations operating in the finance sector, some of  the European and international professional associations deserved to be mentioned:  Association  Profile  EACB  European Association of Co-operative  Banks  This association commits to “represent, promote and defend the common  interest of its member institutions concerning banking and co-operative  legislation. It acts as official spokesperson for its members toward  European institutions”.

It aims at promoting the dialogue between the CSD community,  European public authorities and all other stakeholders with the final aim  to improve the regulatory framework for clearing and settlement”.  EFAMA  European Fund and Asset Management  Association  EFAMA represents the European investment management industry. It  “promotes governance standards, enhances the smooth functioning of  the European single market for investment management, strengthens the  competitiveness of the industry and promotes industry visibility at  international level.”  ESBG  European Saving Banks Group  It is a European banking association that “represents the industry  interests in front of EU institutions, with a specific focus on retail banking  issues. It works as a research centre on legislative issues, and cooperation  forum among participants members.”  FESE  Federation of European Securities  Exchanges  A trade association representing 41 public regulated markets at European  level. Its objectives are to “foster the competitiveness of European  exchanges, to promote the public recognition of the exchanges and their  contribution to the European and global economy, and to allow the  debate on capital markets.”  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 40  Annex D:  Terminology  Following terms and definitions are used throughout this report.

Figure 17 – Workflow overview  E.1 Interviews  The interviews were elaborated based on the preliminary results of the desktop research and the  questionnaire. Their purpose was to drive in an efficient way the interaction with the National  Financial Supervisory Authorities and the Industry respondents.  This interview approach was selected for two reasons:  1. It allows the collection of relevant qualitative information: respondents have the opportunity  to stress their points of major interests, best practices and relevant qualitative information  they are willing to share. On the other hand, and in order to avoid bias or missing answers, a  set of indications on the objectives of each open question were provided to respondents, in  order to structure answers.  2. It provides means of comparison for the evaluation of the information collected.

The growing relevance of information and communication technologies in the essential  functions of the economy has reinforced the necessity of prevention and protection measures in all  sectors, naturally including the finance sector.  This research aimed at understanding and comparing the obligations relevant to Information Security  within the finance sector in most of the EU28 Member States, to compare them with the Industry’s  prospects, and to draw a clear vision of important priorities for the future.  In order to understand the differences between the regulatory approaches and the priorities of the  Industry, a combined data stock taking approach was elaborated, including:  - A Desktop research, that was used to discover national requirements related to ICT security;  - Interviews of national financial supervisory authorities (NFSA) and information security  related obligations and standards;  - An online questionnaire, was used for collecting information from Industry representatives.  The analysis performed revealed the following key aspects:  - Convergence of regulations appear to be a desirable objective in order to reduce both the  heterogeneity of security levels as well as the overlapping of prescriptions in the field;  - Compliance costs for Companies established in several countries can be cumbersome;  - The definition of operative standards would be more effective for enhancing security levels  than issuing new high level prescriptions;  - International cooperation on security issues in the field might be the most feasible solution in  order to define common and appropriate guidelines.  Based on information collected, further research will be required to comparatively assess costs and  benefits of different potential scenarios for the improvement of information security baselines in the  finance sector.  This report issues four main recommendations:  - EBA and ENISA should consolidate scattered NIS obligations in supervisory guidelines;  - ENISA should establish guidelines on how NIS supervision practices in the Finance-sector apply  by extension to their supply chain, including Cloud providers that operate financial services;  - ENISA should establish guidelines which summarise the key conditions for the adoption of  Cloud-based applications or services in the Finance sector;  - ENISA should support the ECB and the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA) to organise regular and  voluntary NIS stress tests in the Finance sector: the purpose is to identify where possible black  swan risks and uncover to the greatest extent possible “unknown unknowns”.

They interact with National Central Banks, European  platforms (e.g. STEP2, TARGET2), and private networks operated by specialised managed providers.  Financial IT systems are exposed to a number of hazards which require consistent efforts to operate  securely. In recent years, NIS risks have become more complex and their impact can range from low  to very high, including domino effects. Such impacts will not be confined to the “virtual” world; a  major attack outreach would most certainly impact the assets in safekeeping or in transit.  1.1 Objective  As the finance sector overall is a complex aggregation of several players regulated from several  different angles, our aim was to understand both the coverage of Network and Information Security  (NIS) obligations in the European regulatory landscape (both at EU and Member State level), and  compare it with the Industry’s prospects. This comparison has led to a high-level overview of the  situation and to recommendations on the alignment of policies and needs where possible.  1.2 Policy Context  The analysis retained three major policies which have a direct or indirect impact on Finance sector’s  ICT. The reader can find all references in Annex:  - MiFID 2004/39/EC - Commission Directive 2006/73/EC of 10 August 2006 of the European  Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating  conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive;  - Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the  protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data;  - Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures  to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union -  COM(2013) 48 final.  The “Payments Services Directives (PSD) Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 13 November 2007 on Payment Services in the internal market” is also noteworthy as the  scope extent of its current revision (PSD2) is currently debated.  Information Security measures are dispersed overall across many European and National regulations.  Such fragmentation increases the need for common and shared guidelines  as Companies operate  more and more at pan-European level.  In Europe, the proposal for a new NIS Directive and the discussions documentation [COM(2013) 48  final - 2013/0027 (COD)] state that an “insufficient level of protection against network and information  security incidents, risks and threats across the EU [..., may undermine, ed.] the proper functioning of  the Internal market”1. This statement is particularly relevant in the finance sector, where a failure of  critical IT infrastructure can lead to major damages in the financial market.  1  COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT,  Accompanying the document “Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council  Concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and information security across the Union”, [COM(2013)  48 final].  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 6  Overall, three key regulatory categories and one catch-all category were identified, which refer to  policies that could indirectly affect finance sector professionals:  - the Data Protection category refers to regulation and standards which is relevant to the  protection of personal and sensitive data and information;  - ICT security category includes regulations and guidelines impacting ICT infrastructures’  security Governance and Management, regardless of the sector considered;  - Finance Sector Security refers to regulation and standards specific to the security of the  finance sector as a whole;  - Other to be defined, which refers to categorising all remaining references bearing a possible  indirect impact.  Beyond Europe, several other countries have already taken political decisions to reinforce the security  of the finance sector which have impact on foreign companies present in European Countries: e.g. the  U.S. the Homeland Security Department and the Department of the Treasury elaborated in 2010 the  “Banking and Finance Sector-specific plan” as an Annex to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan2.  1.3 Target audience  This document provides relevant information both at a strategic and governance level.  It is primarily intended to CISOs/CIOs/CTOs of the Finance sector, NIS Experts in National Financial  Supervisory Authorities, NIS Experts in the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA), and Professional Associations.  1.4 Methodology  The stock taking process used a three-angles approach:   The Desk research allowed to collect a consistent stock of publicly available regulations and  standards or relevant to Information security / Information assurance in the finance sector.   An Online questionnaire was used to investigate private operators’ security management  approach.   Interviews aimed at bridging the knowledge gaps between the Desktop research and the  questionnaire, while collecting further respondents’ spontaneous considerations and context  about the issue in object.  1.5 Scope  The interviews were elaborated based on the preliminary results of the desktop research and the  questionnaire. Their purpose was to drive in an efficient way the interaction with the National  Financial Supervisory Authorities and the Industry respondents.  Overall, a number of key questions were  used as entry points for obtaining more detailed information:  1.What security measures are relevant to your business activities ?  2.How are security measures implemented?  3.Which security measures are considered “best practices” ?  4.Which of these measures are voluntary and which are obligatory ?  2 US. Homeland and Security Department, and US.

The questionnaire collected information and refined the understanding about organisations,  regulation and guidelines in place at national level which may impact directly or not the information  security in the finance sector. It also revealed how private operators approach security management  practically. The questionnaire was structured in three sections, which addresses issues related to a  macro-area in the field of information security:   Section 1 addresses the approach and the competences in the field of security;   Section 2 addresses private operators management approach to security concerns;   Section 3 had been left for additional considerations.  A short report with the main findings of each questionnaire has been elaborated and reported in  integral form in the Annex.  1.6 Document structure  The following pages present the key features of the investigation performed and the relevant  conclusions that emerged. In particular:   Chapter 2 provides high-level background information related to the specifics of the European  Finance System.   Chapter 3 presents a general view of information security related regulations in Europe, and  describes other frameworks considered as Security Baselines thorough the Industry.   Chapter 4 presents an analysis of the feedback collected among Security Professionals of the  Finance sector.   Chapter 5 proposes a number of recommendations for the future of NIS in the Finance sector.  •Sector structure  •Network  Infrastructures  •NIS drivers  •Risks and challenges  Finance Sector  overview  •Coverage  •EU  •National  •MS Differences  Regulatory  Landscape  • Industry's NIS  priorities  •Desirable features  NIS challenges and  opportunities  •Consolidate NIS  obligations  •Cover supply chain  •NIS stress tests  Recommendations  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 8  2 E-communications in the Finance sector  The denomination “finance sector” describes a complex mesh of different actors who achieve  different missions and goals. Their interaction is also complex and is better understood when adopting  an high-level view of the sector and exploring specific areas when required.  2.1 Sector structure  A taxonomy of relevant stakeholders was identified including associations and regulation institutions.  This taxonomy  aims to identify where information security concerns could be of relevance.  Figure 1  – Taxonomy of stakeholders presents a high-level view of the European Finance sector main actors,  including the relevant authorities.  Figure 1 – Taxonomy of stakeholders  The resulting taxonomy considered categorises stakeholders according to four main categories,  namely:  - Banks,  - Service Providers,  - Professional Associations  - Authorities.  In the area of Financial Authorities, we can distinguish two different levels:  - National Supervisory Authorities are in charge of financial institutions supervision.  Finance sector  Banks  Retail bank Private bank  Institutional  banks  IT providers  Messages Service  Providers  Infrastructure  Providers  Owned  Shared  FI Services  providers  Investment firm Payment  processors  RTGS managers Central  Counterparty  Clearing Houses  Professional  Associations  National EU / International  Authorities  National  Authorities  Central Banks  Supervisors  EU Institutions  European  Authorities  ECB ESMA  EBA EIOPA  International  Authorities  IMF BIS  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 9  - European Supervisory Authorities work to improve the functioning of the internal market by  ensuring appropriate and harmonised European regulation.  The term Financial Service activities encompasses the “Banks” and “FI Service Providers” categories.  These non IT/ICT activities can be considered as “core business” and consist overall in redistributing  funds other than insurance, pension funding or compulsory social security. The following activities are  considered:  - Monetary Intermediation (Central banking, other monetary intermediation): this group includes  transferable deposits (i.e. funds, obtained on a day-to-day basis not only from central banking,  but from other non-financial sources);  - Holding companies: this class includes the units that hold the assets (owning controlling-levels of  equity) of a group of subsidiary corporations which own the group; the holding companies in this  class do not provide any other service to the businesses in which the equity is held (i.e. they do  not administer or manage other units);  - Trust, funds and similar financial entities: this class includes legal entities organized to pool  without managing securities or other financial assets on behalf of shareholders or beneficiaries;  the portfolios are customised to achieve specific investment characteristics such as diversification,  risk, rate of return and price volatility. These entities earn interest, dividends and other property  income, but have little or no employment and no revenue from the sale of services;  - Other financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding: this group includes  financial service activities except those conducted by monetary institutions.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 10  2.2 Communications flows  The historical purpose of the finance sector is to  provide three types of services:  - Safe storage for financial assets;  - Financial assets movements capabilities  (and transactional support);  - Access to financial instruments  (Payments, Funds, Securities, Trade).  Overall, financial institutions (e.g. Banks,  Corporate and Investment companies) act as  brokers to borrowers on one side and lenders on  the other side. They rely on several  intermediaries, who provide services ranging  from depositaries to communications activities.  The key function of the finance sector is therefore the safe storage and communications of assets  (cash, gold, securities, etc.). This implies that financial institutions must be able to:  - Store those assets in a secure fashion;  - Communicate with comparable security levels with their counterparts, i.e. their customers,  their providers, their central banks, etc.  The protection of stored assets is comparable to a medieval fortress: for ages, banks have built vaults,  safes, and those were protected by safeguards. Nowadays, ledger books are entirely digital; physical  assets are rarely moved, but banks keep track records of each account statements and transactions in  their books.  The protection of assets in transit (i.e. transactions) require specific dedicated protection measures to  avoid crime, theft or fraud. The usual technologies are used (cryptography, tunnels, etc.), over a  variety of infrastructures that are detailed at a later stage.  The finance sector is actually a mesh of smaller, very specific functions which need permanent  communication channels with their counterparts. For example, Banks need to be able to communicate  on request with:  - Clearing Houses, both at National and European levels;  - Settlement platforms (e.g. TARGET2, national platforms now provide a bridge to the central  bank since the adoption of the Euro).  - Stock Markets;  - Payments processors.  - Etc.  Some of these smaller functions may be grouped within a larger holding company, and therefore  communications may happen internally in those finance groups. Indeed, over the past 30 years a  consolidation of several Banks or other financial functions through mergers and acquisitions was  observed. In such large groups, all communications happen on entirely private networks.  Banks and Payment processors need to relate themselves to National and European reserves, and  therefore use their settlement platforms when a movement of funds is operated (after it is cleared).  Depending on their size, they either have a direct connection to these platforms, or they may use  “service providers” who can register them as participants.  Retail Banks /  Intermediaries  Borrower s /  Spenders  Financial  Markets  Central  Banks  Lenders /  Savers  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 11  In Europe, an international dimension is present in addition  to the national dimension in many cases;  high volumes of transactions are processed cross-border.  Figure 2 below pictures information flows between Banks, Clearing Houses and Settlement platforms  (European and National).  Figure 2 - European Finance communications overview  2.3 Network infrastructures  Overall, the means for communications that financial institutions use are numerous. They tend to  make equal use of public and private networks, for which they can either be fully in control or be  totally dependent on their providers’ security and resilience features and operations.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 12  2.3.1 Infrastructure types  Four main categories of networks are used in the finance sector:  - Public (i.e. telephone networks, internet, etc.), which are used mostly for customer  interaction. In this case, Resilience is managed by the ICT provider, and Security by the  financial institution.  - Shared Leased / Owned (information networks e.g. Reuters and some Trade Markets) which  are used to access “business” networks. Resilience and Security are both managed mostly by  the service provider.  - Leased / Owned (private) lines usually connect headquarters to local branches or to  datacentres, or to their worldwide branches. They are provided by ICT Operators and financial  institutions use those lines for all internal connectivity (voice, data, multimedia). Resilience is  managed by the ICT provider (although financial institutions may choose to establish  redundant connectivity), and security is fully managed by the financial institution.  - Provided lines come with the subscription to a service or a platform, and are completely out  of the financial institutions’ control, except at the moment of deciding which type of  installation is contracted (e.g. SWIFT).

Many respondents however prefer to use IT service providers for  such purpose.  Many respondents referred to SWIFTnet as an IT service provider: SWIFT (The Society for Worldwide  Interbank Financial Telecommunication) provides a proprietary information network enabling  financial institutions to communicate financial messages in a standardised, secure and trustworthy  environment. SWIFT operates in 200+ countries and therefore provides an access point to many types  of international markets and counterparts. SWIFT provides the infrastructure, the software,  standardised message formats, input validation and many associated services to their customers.  SWIFT participants have however no control on the security and resilience measures of the software  or the network; they have to trust that both their main and backup gateways will operate and that  messages flow is never interrupted.  National and European Networks  At National and European levels, the same scenario may occur as described above. However, the  access to Euro settlement platforms (and therefore to the European Central Bank) is a specific service  to the TARGET2 platform.  European countries have implemented national gateways to the TARGET2 SSP (Single Shared  Platform), which is operated by the Central Banks of Germany, France and Italy3. For a few years now,  participants are required to interact through the SSP, and no longer through their National Central  Bank. The SSP includes a SWIFT gateway, however “Each TARGET2 participant has to subscribe to the  relevant SWIFT service according to its own participation profile”.  In Italy, SIANET4 is a private network provider, which can also route all national interbank commercial  payments (commercial payments, credit card transactions, check truncation, etc.) according to the  standards defined for RNI (Rete Nazionale Interbancaria). In Interbanking communications taking  place through SIANET, all messages are authenticated and depending on the use, encrypted.  2.3.2 IT service providers  The primary function of the Finance sector is traditionally far from information technology  preoccupations, and the Finance sector’s IT Banks and financial institutions faced major challenges in  automating their business processing. They built entire internal IT functions to address the arising  needs. These daughter companies are often however legally separated from their parent company,  and obtain a specific status (e.g. PSF “professionels du secteur financier” in Luxembourg) and  therefore a specific regulation.  Those IT Service Providers are often fully dedicated to provide their mother company with internal  services. In some cases, they also externalise some services to other companies. Their status remains  however the same as regards to the law as they need to demonstrate compliance to their mother  company’s regulatory requirements by extension. They however are usually ahead of regulations as  they apply a risk-based security governance which is driven by the security of their assets.  In some cases also, these companies have been established as joint-ventures.  Service Gateways  3 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ANNEX4TARGET24thprogress.pdf  4 http://www.sia.eu/Engine/RAServePG.php/P/294510011600/M/256010011617  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ANNEX4TARGET24thprogress.pdf http://www.sia.eu/Engine/RAServePG.php/P/294510011600/M/256010011617 http://www.sia.eu/Engine/RAServePG.php/P/294510011600/M/256010011617  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 14  Many service providers offer gateway services to SWIFTnet, and their customers are typically smaller  participants. Communication between such players usually takes place over the Internet, analogous  to companies connecting to their banks to make payment instructions or to retrieve account  information5,6, 7, 8. Many of these providers have a European presence, but can also operate from non- European countries.  2.4 Network and Information Security (NIS) drivers in Finance  Overall, the Industry uses three main layers for their information systems’ security governance:  - External oversight describes both the impact of standards and regulations which impact  networks and information security directly or not.  - Internal governance describes the strategic alignment to business objectives, depending on  which types of NIS architecture are necessary to support the business model.  - NIS operations describe the managed activities that allows the actual security to operate on a  daily basis.  According to Industry participants, international standards usually serve as a reference, but some  national standards also exist in larger European countries which are taken into account when  regulation is high-level.  Figure 4 - NIS drivers  2.4.1 About the influence of foreign regulations  The influence of international regulations and standards is significant for several reasons. Two  influential examples are significant:  - Basel III requires better liquidity provisioning; this will lead to a need for banks to be able to  reconstitute liquidity stocks at the end of day on the Interbanking market. Banks tend to  develop such provisioning with a trusted counterpart (i.e. call “operational intimacy). A secure  communication link is therefore critical for such type of communications;  5 http://www.ingcb.com/media/296564/ingserviceforswiftnet.pdf  6 http://www.bbp.ch/en/home.html  7 http://financialsystems.sungard.com/solutions/corporate-liquidity/syntesys-swift-services  8 http://www.tieto.com/services/business-process-services/business-information-exchange/bank-connectivity  External Oversight  EU regulations  National regulations  Supervisory  requirements  Compliance (AML,  ...)

Both sections do not list which internal controls are required, which lead in the  finance sector to largely adopt COSO or CoBIT as control frameworks. As a consequence,  Security is covered as voluntary measures under the following pillars: Security policy,  standards, access and authentication, network security, monitoring, and segregation of  duties, physical security 9. Companies regulated under SOX which have a European presence  are therefore required to follow SOX requirements.  2.4.2 Standards and Supervision  International and National Standards are also often used as a mechanism to further define some  specific, non-regulatory guidance on NIS matters. Several voluntary standards [such as the German IT- Grundschutz Manual, the UNI CEI ISO/IEC 27001:2006 Standard and the Industrial Standard PCI Data  Security Standard (PCI DSS)] are frequently highlighted by the involved respondents.  This approach appears to provide a double benefit: it improves security measures’ technical adequacy  (while regulations’ requirements remain at a general/service level) and provides Supervisory  Authorities with a clear and immediate understanding of the approach adopted: Supervisory  authorities prefer to understand whether or not the operator adopted sound security controls instead  of providing evidences of a specific technical measures in place.  The implementation of commonly recognised standards serves this purpose. For instance, the  Industrial Standard PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was designed by the association of several  payment providers (American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard and Visa  International) in order to improve the security baselines of major payment channels. This standard  was mentioned by many respondents as a key point of reference in the field, besides regulations, and  extended beyond the payment industry.  At Member State level, Regulations for Finance’s Technology vary widely both in depth and scope  coverage. National central banks and National Financial Supervisory Authorities10 form the National  regulatory foundation.  Banks are responsible for ensuring that their systems pass their supervision audits, and also that they  contractually provision adequate security levels from their service providers. Typically, supervisors  analyse and challenge the security specifications and practices (whether the implementing party will  be the banks themselves or external system and service providers).  Typically, Supervisors analyse and challenge the security specifications and practices (whether the  implementing party will be the banks themselves or external system and service providers).  9 http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/legal/overview-sarbanes-oxley-information-security-professional-1426  10  Typically there is one or two supervisory authority in addition to the national central bank. Eg., for UK they are Prudential  Regulatory  Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The typical mechanisms observed therefore are:  - Regulations define high-level obligations;  - Supervisory Authorities use Standards (national or international) to assess the application  of regulation.  http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/legal/overview-sarbanes-oxley-information-security-professional-1426  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 16  Beyond the international standards cited by all, Member States have developed standards that  address more specifically their own needs, e.g.:  - Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (Mindestanforderungen an das  Risikomanagement – The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority)  The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Baffin) provides a framework for risk  management for German financial institutes. It is based on EU Directive 2004/39/EC.  This framework relates to Senior Management’s responsibilities, general requirements for risk  management and resources including personnel, systems, technical facilities and related processes as  well as contingency plans. It includes references to the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues of the Federal  Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik – BSI) and the  ISO/ICE 27002.  - Banking Act (Gesetz üben das Kreditwesen): The German Federal Financial Supervisory  Authority:  The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) refers to the Banking Act  (Kreditwesengetz – KWG) in banking supervision. The Banking Act lays down rules for banks which  they have to observe when they are being established and when they are carrying on their business.  Rules are designed to enable smooth functioning of the banking system, and it includes top-level  description of very basic requirements. For example, the Banking Act states that:  - The credit institution and BaFin shall put in place state-of-the-art measures to safeguard data  protection and data security.  - They shall guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the retrieved and transmitted data.  This state of the art is defined by BaFin in consultation with the Federal Office for Information Security;  actual measures are not described in the Banking Act.  - Swiss National Bank: The National Banking Act 3/2004  The Swiss National Banking Act obliges the National Bank to oversee systems operating clearing,  settlement and other financial instruments. The text applies also to operators that are domiciled  abroad, provided that substantial parts of the operation or leading participants are located in  Switzerland. The Banking Act states that the National Bank may demand that minimum security  requirements are fulfilled.  - The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority: Management of operational risk, standard 4.4b  The supervision standard establishes an obligation for operational risk management in financial  organisations. It provides detailed instructions on special subjects such as process management, staff,  information and payment systems, information security, continuity planning, and legal risks.  Chapter 6.8 covers payment systems and payment services. There are eight (8) controls that banks  \"shall adopt\". These include payment systems characterisation, means of payment, stating principles  for fund transfers in payment systems, ensuring internal control for efficient and secure payment  services.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 17  3 European Regulatory Landscape  The regulations and standards identified as relevant to the Finance Sector’s Security of IT assets were  categorised under a meta-framework for security measures developed during the implementation  phase of the telecom package’s Art.13a.11. The benefits of using this framework are numerous:  - The framework in substance covers most of the security measures and domains already used  in worldwide standards and can easily be mapped with them (e.g. ISO, CoBIT, …);  - It covers most of the areas of concern at this stage;  - It provides a sound and measureable means of comparison between different regulatory  models.  The framework is organised in domains and sub-domains. The figure below provides the framework’s  skeleton:  Figure 5: security measures meta-framework  Based on the above framework, several different security strategies were horizontally compared. This  revealed which categories are covered by binding regulations and which ones are delegated to  voluntary measures or commonly recognised standards.  The information obtained was further merged to identify possible gaps and attract the attention of  decision makers.  3.1 Regulations’ provisioning for NIS  Based on the information collected during the initial phase, a representative sample of 8 EU countries  was defined and a preliminary analysis was performed in order to understand which category of  security measures are typically covered by regulations.  3.1.1 European level  At the European level, the financial supervision is still relatively recent (2011 for EBA, ESMA and  EIOPA); it was established as a response to the financial crisis and covers mostly the regulation of  financial instruments and practices. These are part of the European System for Financial Supervision  11 ENISA – Minimum Security Measures – Art.13a of the eComms package  D1 - Governance  and risk  management  SO 1: Information  security policy  SO 2: Governance  and risk  management  SO 3: Security  roles and  responsibilities  SO 4: Security of  third party assets  D2 - Human  resources security  SO 5: Background  checks  SO 6: Security  knowledge and  training  SO 7: Personnel  changes  SO 8: Handling  violations  D3 - Security of  systems and  facilities  SO 9: Physical and  environmental  security  SO 10: Security of  supplies  SO 11: Access  control to  network and  information  systems  SO 12: Integrity of  network and  information  systems  D4 - Operations  management  SO 13:  Operational  procedures  SO 14: Change  management  SO 15: Asset  management  D5 - Incident  management  SO 16: Incident  management  procedures  SO 17: Incident  detection  capability  SO 18: Incident  reporting and  communication  D6 - Business  continuity  management  SO 19: Service  continuity  strategy and  contingency plans  SO 20: Disaster  recovery  capabilities  D7 - Monitoring,  auditing and  testing  SO 21: Monitoring  and logging  policies  SO 22: Exercise  contingency plans  SO 23: Network  and information  systems testing  SO 24: Security  assessments  SO 25:  Compliance  monitoring  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 18  (ESFS), and typically are instruments to equalise national regulations so a financial institution would  not competitively benefit from less stringent regulations in one member state or another. Their role  in the supervision of the finance sector’s information technology domain is however not their main  focus.12  EU Directives overview  The preliminary identified set of EU regulations had also been analysed in order to identify the topic  addressed by EU prescriptions. Regulations are usually rather high level; our analysis attempted to  identify both direct references to NIS-related obligations, or obligations which indirectly impact NIS  measures and organisations. In cases of indirect impact, the precise reference of the regulatory text  in the directive is referenced.  The information analysed is reported in the following table:  Reference Contents  Proposal for a Directive on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) -  COM(2012) 11 final    D1-SO1 Information security policy (Chapter III)    D1-SO3 Security roles and responsibilities (Chapter IV  Section 4)   D3-SO12 Integrity of network and information security  (Chapter IV Section 1 and 2)   D7-SO24 Security assessment (Chapter IV Section 3)  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the  Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of  network and information security across the Union - COM(2013)  48 final   D5-SO18 Incident reporting and communication   D4-SO13 Operational procedures  Opinion 03/2014 on Personal Data Breach Notification -  693/14/EN WP 213 - Adopted on 25 March 2014 - Article 29 Data  Protection Working Party   D5-SO18 Incident reporting and communication (Article  2)  Financial and Compliance Audit Manual, European Court of  Auditors, 2012   D7-SO24 Compliance monitoring  Directive 2004/39/EC on market on financial instruments, 2004  D1-SO1 Information security policy  Directive 2002/58/CE concerning the processing of personal data  and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications  sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communication), 2002   D3-SO11 Access control to network and information  systems  Directive 2000/12/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the  business of credit institutions   D1-SO1 Information security policy (Article 30)  Table 1 - European Regulations mapping  SecuRePay recommendations  In October 2013, the European Central Bank (ECB) published the “Recommendations for the security  of internet payments”, often referred to as “Secure Pay recommendations” 13. These requirements  directly impact Payment Processors and ecommerce companies.  These include the obligation to ensure:  -  regular risk assessments, gap analyses;  - breach/incident monitoring and reporting;  - risk control and mitigation;  - transaction traceability;  12  http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_general_framework/index_en.htm  13 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversionafterpc201301en.pdf  http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_general_framework/index_en.htm https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/recommendationssecurityinternetpaymentsoutcomeofpcfinalversionafterpc201301en.pdf  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 19  - customer identification and strong authentication;  - adoption of strong authentication tools delivered to the customer;  - transaction monitoring;  - protection of sensitive transaction data;  - customer/end-user education.  These recommendations are focused on systems security; they impact directly the security  governance of payments processors and merchants. Indirectly, they influence the specifications and  engineering of future payments means (3D secure, mobile payments, etc.) and increase the criticality  of network communications.  Impact of MiFID II / MiFIR  MiFID II / MiFID (Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments) does not contain any NIS  specific measures to be implemented. However, the obligation of transactions reporting have an  indirect impact that has been cited by a few respondents: the obligation of traceability for transactions  leads, in terms of security, to the requirements that all transactions must be non-repudiable14, which  also introduce integrity assurance. As a result, stronger authentication mechanisms and complete  transaction history is an obligation for all players in the Securities market. Typically, Transaction  Reporting and Recordkeeping (MiFIR, recitals 32-36, Articles 24-27; MiFID, Article 66; MiFID II, recitals  52, 57, 71, Article 16) are the main drivers for improved NIS15.  Several central banks and supervisors require that financial institutions report the incidents which  affect their operations. For example in the UK, the financial institutions are required to report to the  relevant authority (BoE, FCA) about operational interruptions of a payment system provider  (regardless of the cause of this interruption, which could be, e.g. a cyber-incident). According to  respondents, the communication channels used between banks and authorities are “of course  adequately secured” but no further details were provided.  The incidence of national regulations on Finance NIS is therefore scattered across many different  regulations also at National level.  3.1.2 Member States’ approaches and cultural differences  Following the analysis of the European regulations, the objective was to understand if Member States  implemented those directives together with additional requirements.  In the selected countries, the differences are based in the nature of obligations (either Regulatory or  Legal). In several Member States, financial institutions are required to report to national authorities  many different aspects of their operations (such as operational risks, issues in payment processing or  transfers, outsourcing, and so on). This reporting is often specified in detail and leads to  recommendations issues by the supervisor to the financial institution. The scope consists of the types  of communication channels and the methods of securing them. Also, it is of interest whether financial  institutions are required to report various cyber incidents and similar issues to the national authorities.  Based on the information collected, the topics covered during the supervision exercises vary widely in  nature and in depth.  14 www.linklaters.com/pdfs/mkt/london/MiFID2-Fact-sheet.pdf  15 http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/mifid/index_en.htm  http://www.linklaters.com/pdfs/mkt/london/MiFID2-Fact-sheet.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/mifid/index_en.htm  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 20  BE FR DE IT NL PT ES UK EU  D1: Governance and risk  management  SO 1 Information security policy  •  • • •  SO 2 Governance and risk  management  • • •  •  SO 3 Security roles and  responsibilities  • •  •  SO 4 Security of third party assets  • • •  • •  D2: Human resources  security  SO 5 Background checks  •  SO 6 Security knowledge and  training  •  •  SO 7 Personnel changes  •  •  SO 8 Handling violations  D3: Security of systems  and facilities  SO 9 Physical and environmental  security  •  •  SO 10 Security of supplies  SO 11 Access control to network and  information systems  • •  •  SO 12 Integrity of network and  information systems  • •  • • • •  D4: Operations  management  SO 13 Operational procedures •  •  • •  SO 14 Change management  •  SO 15 Asset management  D5: Incident management SO 16 Incident management  procedures  • •  •  SO 17 Incident detection capability  SO 18 Incident reporting and  communication  •  •  •  D6: Business continuity  management  SO 19 Service continuity strategy and  contingency plans  • •  • •  SO 20 Disaster recovery capabilities  •  D7: Monitoring, auditing  and testing  SO 21 Monitoring and logging policies  • • • •  •  SO 22 Exercise contingency plans  SO 23 Network and information  systems testing  SO 24 Security assessments  • • •  • •  SO 25 Compliance monitoring  •  Table 2 - Comparative overview of the Information security-related topic addressed at national level  In order to complete the overall landscape, the data was enriched with a column to visually compare  the delta of National regulation with EU directives.

In addition to the security measures found in the meta-framework we used, we noticed that National  regulations frequently addressed additional topics. Those topics are either sub-sector specific (i.e.  payments or Finance IS professionals) or they are an extension of financial supervisory rules. The  following are noteworthy:   Third parties and outsourcing [e.g. Danish Executive Order in outsourcing significant areas of  actitivy, or the Spanish CIRCULAR 3/2008, de 22 de mayo, del Banco de España, a entidades  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 21  de crédito, sobre determinación y control de los recursos propios mínimos]; Various situations  concerning the requirements imposed to third parties For example in Spain no additional  contractual requirements were imposed on third parties on information security levels. In  Germany, third parties are bound by contract to allow finance sector supervisory authority to  audit their activities.   Contingency plan and data recovery requirements [egg. Mindestanforderungen an das  Risikomanagement (MaRisk, Minimum Requirements for Risk Management)];   E-payments security.  The data collected reveals differences in terms of regulatory coverage depending on the Member  States. Darker colours mean that one or several regulation(s)/standards cover from different angles a  given domain. In essence, those regulations may cover the same topic, but in different parts of the  industry (Retail, Corporate, Payments …).  Only the countries in scope are coloured. The others are greyed out.

The distribution of the most frequently covered domains in different regulations is reported in the  following graph. The Y-axis shows the percentage of Member States from our sample that refer to a  given domain.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 23  Figure 13 – Security measures recurrence  3.2.1 Lack of coverage and emerging trends  Several topics defined remain out of the scope of the regulations. The topics not covered relate to  topics which can be qualified as “how” to comply with proper security measures, e.g.:  - Handling Violations [D2.SO8]  - Assets Management [D4.SO15];  - Incident Detection Capability [D5.SO17];  - Exercise Contingency plans [D7.SO22];  - Network and Information Systems testing [D7.SO23];  - Compliance monitoring [D7.SO25].  From this standpoint, the absence of such specifications make sense in the regulatory foundation;  laws and implementing laws typically remain at a level of abstraction which provides freedom of action  within boundaries.  One aspect, however, is on the verge of becoming more regulated, as the trends indicate: the topic  “security of supplies” [D3.SO10] is now on the radar of several member states: this is the case of the  Danish Executive order on IT audit in datacentres owned by financial institutions. Besides a few major  banks which manage IT internally the majority of smaller banks rely on datacentres which are jointly  owned and managed by the banks. The regulations dedicated to such shared data centres pertain to  requirements and procedures for supervision practices almost exclusively.  This situation might be considered under two different perspectives:  - On one hand, the auditing process is facilitated by having one single service provider to control  the information security of all the financial operators. All operators which rely on the same  data centre will have a standardised level of security;  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 24  - On the other hand, the collection of data and information on a single provider might be a  vulnerability for the system; an attack to a single datacentre might impact a number or even  all finance operators relying on that single service provider.  Security of supplies is however to be considered as a much broader topic than simply the provisioning  of supplies for financial institutions; each point of the financial mesh is both receiving and supplying.  In this respect, such regulations’ scope will be under scrutiny to understand whether new texts  adopted address both upwards and downwards Supply Chain Management (SCM).  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 25  4 Industry’s prospect  Often, Industry perceives regulations as yet an additional constraint that they have to comply with;  this is a strong dichotomy with the original intent of regulations and standards. The natural step after  assessing the regulatory landscape is not intended to increase the depth or scope of such regulations,  but to better understand which mechanisms can help the sector altogether to improve their security  baseline.  The Industry’s concerns are usually orthogonal to the usual scope covered in the Regulatory  landscape. This can be easily explained:  - Mature companies already comply with regulatory requirements, and their maturity level  allows them to consider further risks;  - Less mature companies are essentially driven by threats and risks and address these in a less  proactive manner.  The purpose of studying this dimension is to better understand where the needs are, to define  recommendations for future support to industry beyond their usual compliance exercise.  4.1 Risks and Challenges  In general, large international banking groups demonstrated a good understanding of the Risk  Landscape and the available Security schemes. Many companies follow a clear Information Security  Management System (ISMS), and adopt Standards and Control frameworks as part of their Security  Governance.  Many banks have introduced further good practices especially in the area of IT governance (e.g.: roles  and responsibilities; certification to the International Standards like ISO27001 and 22301) and  demonstrate a clear information security strategic vision. Security related prescriptions are mostly  reported in national regulations or are defined by sector-internal strategies. In some Member States,  industry stakeholders publish high-level security and compliance strategies and participate in  exercises planned by their Central Bank.  Medium-sized stakeholders demonstrate limited top management involvement, limited capacity to  be certified against current international standards, and a de-prioritisation of security investments.  Such difference of situation is not new, it is also not specific to the Finance sector. The aim is to  understand where such prospects could impair Financial resilience altogether.  Risk Management Domains  Typical risk management practices and threats are well known and understood by respondents.  Respondents especially mentioned that “Risk Management” was not NIS-specific, which was later  confirmed by literature review. The finance sector manages mainly risk in “sectors”, and they make a  clear distinction between Financial, Operational and IT risks.  Figure 14 sets the Information Security risk domain in the overall perspective; it expands broadly  across all categories.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 26  Figure 14 – Information security risks in Financial risks landscape  Typically, NIS therefore belongs to the information risk area despite having a potential impact on the  three pillars above mentioned. In the opinion of several respondents, NIS risk is a horizontal risk that  pertains to all the others:  - Poor input controls may lead to fraud risks;  - Insider threats were reported by many as a “hot topic” in several member states, which could  be both categorised under “Finance risk” or “Information Security Risk”;  - Payment being almost entirely digital nowadays also relates more to an Information security  risk than a purely financial risk;  - Etc.  Security governance  At present, the Security Governance and the NIS Risk management are therefore typically part of the  Technology divisions.  Interviews revealed that in many cases, top management is only formally involved once a year, as this  constitutes in many Member States a binding prescription. Respondents underlined that, as the CISO  often reports to the CIO, both budget lines conflict in times of ICT budget restrictions. In particular,  CISOs suggested that the Security budget (Safety, ICT Security, and Security Continuity) should be  separated from all other budgets and be approved directly by the Board of Directors. In addition, the  Board of Directors should appoint one of its members as a delegate for the company’s security.  In light of these considerations, this topic should possibly be further discussed and pragmatic solutions  be presented in the light of the upcoming directives (NIS and PSD2).  Security assessments  The replies collected concerning the usual security assessment practices were in line with the  requirements usually found in international standards. Several statements support this observation,  e.g.: «CISO defines policies, structures and techniques …», « Vulnerability analysis is carried out every  year…»; «Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis at least annually»; «all security incidents are  Information Security  Risk  Security Specific Threats /  Vulnerabilities  Identity and Access  Management  Encryption  Web Security Infrastructure  Specific  Security Monitoring Defense in Depth  Attacks  Systems Financial Assets  ...  Operational Risks  Fraud Money Laundering  Payment Insider Threats  ...  Business Risks  Credit Lending  Cash Flow Reputation  ...  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 27  logged, classified, analysed, and discussed with internal audit and at the periodical management’s  review meeting».  The answers collected on the “systematic security assessments” topic suggest that most actors  operate in an adequate way fulfilling all regulatory and standards requirements. Other aspects of the  feedback received also suggest that the approaches implemented, the binding prescriptions, the  voluntary measures / strategies aim at enhancing information security both globally and in-depth.  4.1.1 Mitigation limitations  Three dimensions of complexity  The structure of the finance sector is complex overall. Threats and potential weaknesses vary  according to the business type and the security model adopted: for instance, Investment banks or  high frequency trading (HFT) might face difficulty in ensuring the continuous and balanced provision  of information security in their activities.  Customer-facing operators might be more exposed to risks related with the rapidly evolving  technological environment. On the other hand, while the technological environment is rapidly  changing, the business and financial services landscape is also rapidly evolving (e.g. new competitors,  emerging market models, etc.). The combination of these trends influence the degree of complexity  of the financial sector itself and of the information security management requirements.  Supply chain in security measures  The key issue reported by participants during our interview process relates to the dichotomy between  the security objectives / obligations of their company, and the fact that many aspects are totally under  3rd party control: this remark applies both to messages / networks service providers. Likewise this  issue seems to extend to other supply areas: Banks are responsible for instance for the protection  against data leaks, but cannot always configure entirely the devices they purchase (mobile phones,  tablets, laptops, servers, operating systems, etc.).  Another issue was reported several times and is noteworthy: the need for including the entire supply  chain as part of principle security measures. Respondents mentioned several outsourcing contracts  with major providers (e.g. Telecom Operators, SWIFT, IBM, Microsoft, …). They perceived that such  world-class providers implement and maintain satisfactory security levels on their services.  Smaller providers are also used, and respondents felt that these might be more subject to breaches;  such attacks might be aimed those weaker links as a way to enter the target victim.  Last but not least, when required, respondents mentioned many international standards (ISO 27001,  31000, 22301) but none cited ISO 28000, confirming that supply chain security requires more  attention.  Privacy considerations  Current technology allows both private companies and public authorities to use personal data on an  unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Individuals increasingly make personal  information available publicly and globally. Because of the close relation between information  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 28  technology’s evolution and economic development16, personal data protection play a central role in  the Digital Agenda for Europe, and more generally in the Europe 2020 Strategy. A “personal data  breach” is defined by Directive 2002/58/EC in Article 2 as “a breach of security leading to the  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal  data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed in connection with the provision of a publicly available  electronic communications service in the Community” 17.  Skills shortage  Finally, although risk and security issues are very well understood among operators, many issues still  remain. The finance sector operators manifest a positive tendency to invest in IT security, with a  growth in the amounts invested varying from +6% to +10% in the past years. Nevertheless, a lack of  skilled and competence staffing persists in the field of IT security in the finance sector, which leads  many finance operators to contract external experts or consultancy companies to secure their  infrastructures and communications. Such security functions should however be considered more  critical since those experts are requested to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).  4.2  Desirable features  The NIS management instruments mentioned are numerous in the sector, and many of them  expressed limited concerns related to their ability to manage an adequate security level. In some  cases, a few of them hoped for:  - Company cultural change to integrate more future security insights;  - Improved corporate NIS awareness and involvement;  - Consolidated standards and guidelines for implementing sustainable security strategies;  - Voluntary NIS exercises both at national or European level, with the inclusion of their supply  chain.  The first topics may be addressed by additional supervisory requirements, in the member states where  NIS governance is covered by the law. In the others, raising the awareness on such issues may be a  possible alternative.  The two following topics (NIS guidance and cooperation) are further detailed below:  - From Compliance to Sustainable Security Objectives  The finance sector, overall, is perceived as being a “state of the art” implementation of sustainable  security measures in almost all areas (e.g. Web Banking security, internal security procedures). In most  cases, the compliance to Supervisors’ requirements comes usually as an addition to high-level  regulations and is a compliance exercise.  However, Supervisory requirements on Information Security differ widely from one country to  another and the compliance exercise can become extremely complex. Unlike business areas –where  finance instruments are already supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)- the  supervision convergence for network and information security is still a work in progress. Additionally,  Financial Services that operate worldwide are also bound by foreign legislation. This compliance  overhaul is increased when IT Infrastructures are either outsourced or physically reside under remote  16  DORANTES C., KO M., “Impact of Information security breaches on financial performances of the  breached firm: an empirical investigation”, in Journal of Information Technology Management, Vol. XVII,  n.2, 2006; PONEMON INSTITUTE, Ponemon Study Shows the Cost of a Data Breach Continues to Increase,  2012.  17 Opinion 693/14/EN WP 213  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 29  legislations: the use of Cloud Computing creates much supervisory and compliance concerns. Many  respondents also related that they are rarely fully aware of all the implications and impact of  regulatory requirements; they felt these were scattered across several different texts, and that a single  implementation guideline would be precious (See Figure 15).  Figure 15 - from compliance to security objectives  Furthermore, current regulations were criticised for considering mostly the prevention of “Financial  Incidents”. The risks arising from information security, data confidentiality or business continuity  could be encompassed as critical component of the financial stability. This reveals a demand for  assessing the financial system’s resilience globally; a combined Business/IT stress-testing was also  advocated at large scale.  - Cross Sector / Cross Border Cooperation opportunity  The extra-mile to enhanced security and resilience was recommended to be approached using self- commitment and cooperation, possibly supported by the guidance of National IT Supervisors.  Furthermore, since Regulation should establish principles rather than specific measures, Interviewees  felt that recommendations should not lead to strengthen regulation as a result. Self-commitment to  guidelines and standards is perceived as a practical and pragmatic method. Such guidance would  benefit greatly to smaller institutions which do not face the same challenges as larger ones.  Global European cooperation and Good Practices sharing could allow a better understanding of the  Risks and Security challenges faced by the Finance Sector. Any means of cooperation should include  the relevant stakeholders from regulators, banks, system and service providers, clearing houses, and  other relevant parties.  - Contingency planning and exercises  A majority of respondents stressed the importance of contingency plans’ testing recurrence. Besides  being able to demonstrate that information security is managed, and that contingency plans are  established, there is a need to demonstrate its periodical testing and update. Respondents suggested  that an optimal recurrence for such exercises would need to follow a two-fold principle:  1. contingency plans testing is requested at least once a year, although for very critical  components and infrastructures it would be even most appropriate to having it test twice a  year;  2. contingency plans testing is necessary each time major changes occur in the management  structure or in the physical infrastructure: this helps to ensure that the plan is consistent to  the changed conditions are eventually appropriately updated.  Affordable Security Security Objectives  Standards Guidelines  National  Regulations National  Supervisory  Requiremen  ts  EU  Regulations  EU  Supervisory  Requiremen  ts  Security  Assurance  Frameworks  Security Compliance  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 30  In a few Member States, operators are required to periodically test their contingency plans, and also  to develop scenarios in cooperation with their partners and service providers to guarantee that the  entire supply chain is appropriately tested.  Respondents mentioned the fact that finance sector operators might be required to comply to  regulations related to critical infrastructure security (egg. in the case of Spain, where selected major  financial operator are requested to comply with the requirements of the Ley 8/2011, de 28 de abril,  por la que se establecen medidas para la protección de las infraestructuras críticas).  This approach, while it improves practical security levels, demands additional compliance efforts from  finance sector operators. These efforts might required guidance by specialised Government bodies or  CERTs.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 31  5 Recommendations  Based on the information collected and reported a number of desirable measures, tools and objectives  can be formulated in the field of Information Security in the finance sector:   A European Security Guidebook: the definition of a common set of guidelines would  represent a possible solution for the implementation of common operative security standards  rather than defining service-level regulations. Among finance sector operators, standards  appear to be frequently used to ensure both prevention, detection and response to security  concerns. In addition, common guidelines on how to assess the cost-benefits of Information  Security investments and how to effectively involve top management in security investment  decisions is key;   Supply Chain Security: Operators could find several benefits in implementing risk  transparency between them and their immediate operational circle.   Security Intelligency: International cooperation of finance sector operators might be the  most effective approach in defining a common set of indications. It could ensure both a  consistent level of technicality on the elaborated guidelines and an appropriate “operator- friendly” approach to realistic security measures. Moreover, cooperative occasions could  potentially include regular NIS stress-tests in the finance-sector;  The figure below summarises this three pillars approach and their desired effect:  Figure 16 - Recommendations structure  European Security  Guidebook  •Clarify security  regulations  •Common Security  Criteria  •Security guidance  •Customer Data  Protection  Supply chain Security  •Cloud Computing  •Cooperation with  SCM  •SCM upwards  requirements  •SCM downwards  Security Intelligence  •Risk/Threats  •Preparedness  •Exercises / SOPs  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 32  Those objectives are translated into recommendations below.  1. Establish a European NIS guidebook  This guidebook should contain useful guidance for CISOs of the Finance sector, independent from the  size of their company, which comprehends:  - A clear set of security measures, aligned with National standards used by Supervisors;  - An evaluation framework.  Recommendation: ENISA will support EBA in building a guidebook on horizontal, pan-European  security measures.  This guidebook would by no means need to be mandatory; it should however be an authoritative  source for good practices and recommendations. For instance, it would cast in stone the need for a  separate executive management line between CISO and CTO/CIOs, in order to secure funding for NIS  matters, as suggested by many respondents.  ENISA proposes to consider the Security domains used in Chapter 3 to evaluate the scope of  regulations in the Member States. Those seven domains can be studied and discussed, and measures  be defined only if there is a rationale to do so.  2. Enable systematic cooperation between the Finance Sector and their supply chain  In many cases, respondents mentioned that they were liable for several security aspects that were  outsourced and outside of their control. While contractually they are allowed to perform security  assessments for these outsourced contracts, they felt that the inclusion of their supply chain in  supervision frameworks could address several issues. However, these aspects need to be defined  comprehensively.  ENISA will support the identification of specific issues in the supply chain’s NIS.  3. The case for Cloud Computing  As the European Commission encourages the European companies to use Cloud Computing to  increase their mobility and resilience, the Finance sector will be likely to request that extra security  guarantees are given so their data and processing remain safe (or even safer).  Recommendation: EBA and ENISA should define the conditions for adoption of Cloud-based services  and applications in the Finance sector. The special case of services already used by the Finance sector  which are cloud-based are identified and that they can apply by extension the measures contained in  existing supervisory frameworks.  4. Stress tests and global security intelligence  The objective and scope of security intelligence is to provision for extreme NIS issues, or even issues  qualified as “Unknown unknowns”.  Those stress tests’ purpose would be to evaluate the maturity level of the Finance-Sector when  compared against the NIS Guidebook; instead of performing a checklist audit, the stress test would be  based on a realistic incident scenario to which participants would be able to voluntarily participate.  ENISA would support extensively those tests.  Recommendation: ENISA should develop a Good Practice Guide based on Industry’s input on:  - Extension of NIS Guidebook to Supply Chain (upwards and downwards);  - Existing NIS standards and baselines.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 33  The objective is therefore to improve the efficiency of security measures by testing them in fictious  scenarios (i.e. exercises).  Recommendation: ENISA should support the ECB and the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA) to organise regular  and voluntary NIS stress tests in the Finance sector.  The results of the stress tests will help to identify global and structural NIS weaknesses. They will be  anonymised and key conclusions circulated after the test among participants.

The table below summarises the  scope of each of them:  Table 3 - EU regulators  The supervision of the IT is typically a national competence. European authorities however influence  the national practices: a single market requires a single rule book adoption which EBA typically  supports. NIS Supervisory rules are also considered and discussed during EBA’s IT supervisory boards.  C.2 National Authorities  Based on the information preliminary collected at national level, regulators’ mission is typically  twofold: regulation and supervision. In some cases, they support the implementation of specific, one- off regulations. In the EU28, the following is generally observed:  - National Central Banks (NCB) are usually in charge of regulations. They are supported by the  relevant ministries or technical committees.  - Supervision is often the responsibility of a specific branch of the NCB or may be delegated to  other institutions.  Such setup however depends greatly on the size of the Member State. In some Member States, some  functions may be merged or organised differently. The initial interviews performed confirmed the  preliminary hypothesised scheme of roles and competences: Supervisors and Regulators are often  hosted within the same entity. Three different models exist, and their function can either be:   Part of a dedicated department of the National Central Bank, as in the case of Banco de  Span Directorate General Banking Supervision, or in the case of Banca d’Italia;   A shared responsibility between the National Central Bank and an Agency, which is the  case for BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) working in close  cooperation with the Deutsche Bundesbank.  ESFS (European System of  Financial Supervision)  Competences and functions  ECB  European Central Bank  The central bank for Europe’s single currency is mainly committed to maintain price  stability in the euro area. The ECB is expected to have an active role concerning banking  supervision under the upcoming Single Supervisory Mechanism.  EBA  European Banking  Authority  It is an independent EU Authority responsible for prudential regulation and supervisor of  the European banking sector. Its main aim is to provide a single set of harmonised  prudential rules for financial institutions throughout the EU.  EIOPA  European Insurance and  Occupational Pensions  Authority  “EIOPA is part of the European System of Financial Supervision consisting of three European  Supervisory Authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board. It is an independent  advisory body to the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the  European Commission”.  “EIOPA’s core responsibilities are to support the stability of the financial system,  transparency of markets and financial products as well as the protection of insurance  policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries.”  ESMA  European Security and  Markets Authority  ESMA is an independent EU Authority committed to contribute to ensure the integrity,  transparency, efficiency and functioning of the securities markets, particularly enhancing  investor protection and by fostering supervision convergence at EU level.  Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector  Regulatory landscape and Industry priorities  December 2014  Page 38   Be performed autonomously by a dedicated institution, as in the case of the Danish  Finanstilsynet.  The organisation within one country does however not affect the principle: both Regulation and  Supervision are typically covered in every Member State.

Operational risks)  C.4 Professional Associations  Professional Associations are worth mentioning as they often constitute a representation of the  European Finance Sector to the Authorities. They are therefore typically within the network reach of  public decision makers, they voice the interests of the Industry on the verge of new discussions on  legislation matters.  Beyond this type of activities, associations are also setup with other objectives: Information Sharing,  Security Awareness Raising, Education, Professional Training, Conferences, Analytics, etc.  Many European-based associations exist; a number of associations or non-profit organisations have  also arrived from other continents and develop similar activities both with European and non- European members.  To complete the overview of the framework of organizations operating in the finance sector, some of  the European and international professional associations deserved to be mentioned:  Association  Profile  EACB  European Association of Co-operative  Banks  This association commits to “represent, promote and defend the common  interest of its member institutions concerning banking and co-operative  legislation.

Figure 17 – Workflow overview  E.1 Interviews  The interviews were elaborated based on the preliminary results of the desktop research and the  questionnaire. Their purpose was to drive in an efficient way the interaction with the National  Financial Supervisory Authorities and the Industry respondents.  This interview approach was selected for two reasons:  1. It allows the collection of relevant qualitative information: respondents have the opportunity  to stress their points of major interests, best practices and relevant qualitative information  they are willing to share. On the other hand, and in order to avoid bias or missing answers, a  set of indications on the objectives of each open question were provided to respondents, in  order to structure answers.  2. It provides means of comparison for the evaluation of the information collected.

The concept of Governmental Cloud (Gov Cloud)  has been proposed by ENISA, as well as other international agencies/public institutions since 2010-11.  In the report “Security and Resilience in Governmental Clouds” and the “Good practice Guide for  securely deploying Governmental Clouds” ENISA proposed, among others, the following:  “…Cloud computing service delivery model satisfies the most of the needs of public administrations, on  the one hand, since it offers scalability, elasticity, high performance, resilience and security. However,  many public bodies have not yet built a model for assessing their organizational risks related to security  and resilience.”  It also recommended that:   National governments should prepare a strategy on Cloud computing that takes into account  the implications for security;   National governments and European Union institutions to further investigate the concept of a  European Governmental Cloud as a supra national virtual space where a consistent and  harmonized set of rules could be applied, both in terms of legislation and security policy and  where interoperability and standardization could be fostered;   National governmental and Member States should foster the adoption of baseline security  measures for all cloud deployment models;  This present study builds on those conclusions and recommendations to provide formalization of a  generic security framework for governmental clouds. The proposed security framework is based on a  collection and analysis of existing Cloud computing security literature, other relevant security best  practises, and on the few existing real life case studies of Governmental Clouds in Europe.  The final result is a security framework modelled into four (4) phases, nine (9) security activities and  fourteen (14) steps that details the set of actions that we believe each Member States should follow  for the definition and implementation of a secure Gov Cloud. The generic security framework has been  empirically validated through the analysis of four (4) Gov Cloud case studies namely Estonia, Greece,  Spain and UK. The real life validation of the security framework also serves the purpose of defining  examples on how some EU Member States are implementing security into their Gov Cloud  approaches.  As a concluding remark, we want to highlight (based on the information collected until September  2014), that very few EU Member States have currently developed approaches for Cloud computing  based on a well-defined and thorough cloud security strategy (including risk profiles, classification of  assets, security objectives and measures).  The objective of the proposed security framework, and the accompanying case studies, is to serve as  guidance to other EU Members States towards a seamless and more secure adoption of Cloud  computing.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary ......................................................................................................... iv  1 Introduction .............................................................................................................. 1  1.1 Target audience .................................................................................................................................. 1  1.2 Scope .................................................................................................................................................. 2  1.3 Policy Context ..................................................................................................................................... 2  1.4 Definitions........................................................................................................................................... 3  1.5 Methodology....................................................................................................................................... 3  1.6 Structure ............................................................................................................................................. 4  2 State of the art in Gov Cloud activities ....................................................................... 5  2.1 Desk research ...................................................................................................................................... 5  2.2 Findings and conclusions ..................................................................................................................... 7  3 Security Framework for Governmental Clouds ........................................................... 9  3.1 Roles ................................................................................................................................................... 9  3.2 Logic Model ....................................................................................................................................... 10  4 Framework through use cases .................................................................................. 20  4.1 Selected use cases ............................................................................................................................. 20  4.2 Use Cases Validation ......................................................................................................................... 22  5 Conclusions ............................................................................................................. 31  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  1  1 Introduction  The compelling business and financial benefits for adopting Cloud services, highlighted in the  European Commission’s European Cloud Strategy1, have motivated a number of EU countries to  develop a Cloud computing national strategy2. However currently not many Member States (MS) have  operational governmental Cloud infrastructures supporting public administration (so called Gov  Clouds). Not many public administrations are actively procuring Cloud services nor are they launching  any test bed projects on Cloud computing (e.g. the European project “Cloud for Europe”).  As the topic of governmental clouds constitutes ongoing exploration and development, there is  naturally a conspicuous dearth of information about the experiences of such early Gov Cloud adopters,  in particular related to the adopted security frameworks (including requirements, architectures, and  best-practices). National experts, policy makers and other interested stakeholders often struggle to  find use cases and, thus, cannot benefit from the valuable experience of well-established European  Gov Cloud’s. The need for detailed information related to the steps a governmental body should take  to adopt Cloud services, is the starting point for this report on security frameworks for governmental  clouds.  Against this background, this report compiles, analyses and makes available four (4) relevant cases  studies on national Cloud security approaches (namely Estonia, Greece, Spain, and United Kingdom)  in order to define a reference framework for Gov Cloud security. The contributed framework also  integrates relevant findings from topical academic/practitioner literature, and aims to offer value to  both the MSs that are starting to define their Cloud computing strategy, and those MSs that already  have a Gov Cloud in place but want to assess it with respect to other baselines. This framework  indicates the possible approaches, thus offering solutions to the governmental bodies regardless of  their maturity. In this report, the technical and security aspects associated to the selected Gov Cloud  use cases were analysed through four different perspectives based on a widely used security life-cycle  approach (i.e., Plan-Do-Check-Act or PDCA3).Following this project management approach would  assist in clarifying and categorising the distinct steps.  It must be noted that the framework (thus the specific steps) suggested in this report can be followed,  with some minor adjustments, also from other types of cloud customers, not only public  administration; however the target audience of this report frames it to focus on governmental cloud  deployments.  1.1 Target audience  The results of this report, in particular the developed framework for Gov Cloud security, targets mostly  national experts, governmental bodies and public administration in the EU countries interested in  recommendations for defining their national Cloud security strategy, or obtaining a baseline for  analysing their existing Gov Cloud deployment from the security perspectives, or to support them in  filling in their procurement requirements in security.  However in an indirect manner, this report can be helpful for:  1 Available online http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF  2 Available online http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely- deploying-governmental-clouds  3 Also known as Deming cycle, PDCA is a four step management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of  processes and products. The PDCA  was identified as a suitable continuous process to model information security management systems in  Gov Clouds as distinct steps have to be followed and control and continuous monitoring is a notion needed in the gov cloud deployment  procedure.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF http://www.cloudforeurope.eu/  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  2   EU policymakers desiring concise information about state of the art Gov Cloud security  strategies from MS in order to decide on further economic, legal and technological incentives  for improving the uptake of Cloud computing in the public sector.   EU private sector, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), where more  experienced studies and guidance are needed to develop the full potential of Cloud  computing.   Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and Cloud Brokers seeking further guidance related to security  approaches adopted by existing MS Gov Cloud, in order to identify and better understand  specific needs and requirements that might be used to better tune their existing Cloud service  offerings.  1.2 Scope  This report is based on the recommendations made in the ENISA “Good practice guide on how to  securely deploy governmental clouds”, namely the need for a common security framework for  deploying cloud services in public administration. The aim of this study is to develop a security  framework. A framework is a basic structure underlying a system that is used in this case for  establishing a set of general terms, concepts and practices to embed “good enough” information  security in the implementation of a Gov Cloud. The framework shall serve as a reference to relevant  stakeholders (cf., Section 1.1) for supporting Cloud deployments by public administrations.  1.3 Policy Context  Cloud computing drives the vast spectrum of both current and emerging applications, products and  services, and is also a key technology enabler for the Future Internet. Its direct economic value to the  European Union is unambiguously substantial. Cloud computing is an accepted enabler for innovation  and also widely advocated as such by the European Commission (EC) in their Digital Agenda. The EC  considers that Cloud computing will be a game changer in our economy and the main obstacles  impeding Cloud adoption are standards, certification, data protection, interoperability, lock-in, and  legal certainty4.  In September 2012, the EC published, , the European Cloud Strategy, a policy strategy document that  contains the key actions that EC policy makers have identified to support the uptake of Cloud  computing in Europe. The European Cloud Strategy has two main objectives:   Making Europe Cloud-friendly and Cloud-active.   Connecting digital agenda initiatives.  Achieving these two objectives requires the execution of three key actions:  1. Standards and certification.  2. Safe and fair contract terms.  3. A European Cloud Partnership  This report is part of ENISA’s contributions to the implementation of the European Cloud Strategy, in  particular related to the development of a security framework for governmental Cloud’s aimed to  provide stakeholders (cf., Section 1.1) efficiency savings and take them one step closer to the “Every  European Digital” goal.  4 Warwick A. “Neelie Kroes calls for speedy EU uptake of Cloud computing”. Online:  http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240114460/Neelie-Kroes-calls-for-speedy-EU-uptake-of-Cloud-computing  2012  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/com/com_Cloud.pdf%202013  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  3  1.4 Definitions  A standard definition for the term Gov Cloud is currently lacking. However, for the analysis presented  in the rest of this document we adopt the Gov Cloud definition introduced by ENISA 2013 report, as:   “A Gov Cloud is an environment running services compliant with governmental and EU  legislations on security, privacy and resilience (what)   A Gov Cloud is a secure and trustworthy way (private Cloud or public Cloud) to run services  under public body governance (how)   A Gov Cloud is a deployment model to build and deliver services to state agencies (internal  delivery of services), to citizens and to enterprises (external delivery of services to society) (for  who)”  An additional definition required in this report, relates to the notion of “security framework”. This is  as a conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for the creation of a secure  information system. In this document, the intention of the proposed security framework is to serve as  a comprehensive guideline for the creation, deployment, assessment and improvement of a secure  Gov Cloud. The proposed security framework is to be understood as a first step towards improving  the European Gov Cloud landscape. Furthermore, it should be considered as the beginning of a  continuous enhancement process by incorporating emerging elements, and by considering the lessons  learned from its real-world application.  1.5 Methodology  The methodology to elaborate such a logic model for a security framework follows a bottom-up  approach for information processing and knowledge ordering. The technical methodology focused on:  a) Defining the generic security framework based on the input collected from the analysis of  available literature, and information obtained from operational Gov Clouds in European  Member States. The proposed framework is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.  The structure of the framework is flexible enough to be extended when new use-cases will  be analysed (future work).  b) Surveying and identifying four Gov Cloud use cases from MS (i.e., Estonia, Greece, Spain, and  United Kingdom). The use cases were selected for being representative of Gov Cloud  adoption (or mature enough) and also for their willingness to provide the required  documentation to conduct the validation  c) Use case scenarios of the initially defined generic security framework through the analysis of  the strategies adopted by selected case studies from the security life cycle perspective. In  order to accomplish this, we identified and engaged relevant stakeholders/representatives  from the selected Gov Cloud use cases through e.g., telephone interviews and email  communications.  The adopted methodology allowed us to characterise the Gov Cloud use cases from different security  angles (e.g. requirements, certifications, SLAs and contracts), and taking into consideration relevant  security challenges (e.g., resilience, portability, continuous monitoring, and access control). This  methodological approach resulted on a comprehensive analysis of selected Gov Cloud security  frameworks provided as use cases, hence promoting the definition of a reference Cloud security  strategy blueprint.  In summary, the core framework describes what to do when deploying secure Gov Cloud services,  whereas the workflows, questionnaires and reference implementations detail how to do it. All these  instruments are to be collectively used by the governmental organizations and public administrations  (who), to define and implement secure Cloud-based services.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  4  1.6 Structure  This document is organized as folllows: Section 2 details  the proposed security framework for Gov  Clouds, and also introduces the underlying roles and definitions. Section 3 introduces the MS use  cases, and  validates the proposed security framework (cf., Section 2) through the four selected Gov  Cloud use cases (Estonia, Greece,  Spain and United Kingdom). Section 4 summarizes the main  conclusions and recommendations drawn from this report. Annexes A and B presents the full version  of the questionnaires used during the interviews with the selected Gov Cloud representatives. Annex  C discusses the results of our desktop research, by presenting the relevant state of the art/practice on  the topic of security frameworks for Gov Clouds. Annex D contains the questionnaire template used  for the interviews with the selected use cases. This questionnaire is a concrete result of the security  framework presented in this report.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  5  2 State of the art in Gov Cloud activities  Previous to the design of the framework, a desk research was conducted to identify and analyse  relevant work in the field of Governmental Cloud computing, since the gap analysis performed in the  ENISA 2013 Gov clouds guide. This task was supported by the need to understand the following  questions:   Which is the state of deployment in various Member States (running pilots, plans, etc) since  2013?   What are the challenges, requirements and barriers in the “cloudification” of governmental  services?   What are the state-of-the-art techniques to analyse Cloud security in governmental  deployments? Is there any existing generic security framework?  This preliminary study helped in setting the basis for the rationale behind the proposed security  framework. In the next paragraphs, we summarize the related work (references [29]-[42]) considering  the research questions posed above.  2.1 Desk research  The work in [29] evaluates eight European countries on their use of Cloud Computing in e-Government  and compares them: Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and UK. The  comparative analysis is synthetized in Table 1.  This study shows that, while the majority of countries are still in the development or planning phase,  three of them -namely UK, Spain and Denmark- have already adopted Cloud Computing and hence  are in an executional stage. It is to note also that, five of the eight researched countries have anchored  the adoption of Cloud computing in the public sector in some kind of national strategy. Nevertheless,  the full implementation of their National Cloud Computing strategy will still take another few years  (conclusion derived in the ENISA 2013 guide). The most frequent planned and developed Cloud  Computing deployment models amongst the evaluated countries are the private and the community  Cloud. On the other hand, when comparing Cloud computing service models, 50% of the evaluated  countries rely on the most common service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a  Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).  The guide elaborated by the law firm Bird&Bird [30] covers the legal issues to take into account when  setting up a Cloud service on a pan-European basis, including data security and data privacy  regulations. The research covers twelve countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,  Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, UAE and UK) and, for each of these case studies, they include  questions regarding Cloud computing usage in the public sector, such as information about operating  government clouds or best practice guides for public bodies.  Gongolidis et al. [31] identified the major functional and non-functional requirements to migrate  governmental applications to the Cloud. Based on the reports provided by the European Union for  i2010 initiatives [32], United Nations reports for eGovernment Systems characteristics, and the Greek  Interoperability Framework [34], the authors elicit the following requirements: interoperability,  eAccesibility, single sign-on, transparency, scalability, adaptability, use of prototypes, availability,  maintenance, and security and privacy. The paper includes also a mapping of these requirements to  the different deployment models that are subject of their applicability.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  6  Table 1 Comparison of Cloud computing in e-Government across eight European countries made in [29] (for Finland and  Germany no further information was available to compare them against the other countries)  Wyld [35] examines non-military uses of Cloud computing in governments across the globe (Unites  States, Europe and Asia), which builds the basis of his proposed 6-step “Cloud Migration Strategy” for  governmental agencies to shift to Cloud computing. In this study, as well as in a previous deeper  research on Cloud for governments by the same author [36], Security and Privacy are pointed out as  key requirements to enable Cloud computing migration. Furthermore, Wyld highlights the need for  the development of Cloud pilots to test the utility of the technology and assess the ability to manage  and bring such a project to fruition. These efforts, he remarks, should be supported—and reported  within and outside the organization—so that others in IT and wider community can learn of the  successes and the downsides of operating on Cloud. Thus, it will be vitally important to share both  “best practices” and “lessons learned”, since these demonstrations will drive the eventual acceptance  and adoption of Cloud computing in governmental environments and beyond.  Tripathi and Parihar [37] provide a brief overview of e-governance challenges, categorizing them in  technical, economic and social barriers. Security is again identified as a key requirement to overcome  before migration of governmental services to Cloud happens.  The work carried out by Smitha et al. in [38] presents a survey on Cloud-based E-Governance systems,  where E-governance is defined as “the application of information and communication technologies to  exchange information between government and citizens, government and business organizations, and  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  7  between government organizations.” They focus on identifying the main challenges and benefits of  relying on the Cloud paradigm, pointing out again security and privacy as indispensable requirements.  Paquette et al. [39] identify the security risks involved in the governmental use of Cloud computing.  The base on specific cases of the USA federal Cloud computing strategy and discuss the tangible and  intangible risks associated with its use. The paper argues that a defined risk management program  focused on Cloud computing is an essential part of the government IT environment. As they point out,  there are risks linked to the implementation of the emerging Cloud computing paradigm, including  policy changes, implementation of dynamic applications, and securing the dynamic environment. They  also remark the importance of defining detailed SLAs as a mean to formalize security aspects to be  covered and cope with risk.  The survey carried out in [39] is centered on the analysis of the readiness (i.e., maturity state) of E- government Information systems (EGIS) and Cloud Computing. The study concludes that e- government readiness is a major concern, and that currently there is little availability of  comprehensive assessment methods for e-government readiness and most of the assessment  frameworks are varied in terms of philosophies, objectives, methodologies, approaches, and results.  As a guide for future work, the paper proposes a new framework with the aim to provide a modeling  and analysis method to guide the assessment of EGIS systems migration readiness. The framework  considers four dimensions, namely: Technical, Organizational, Stakeholders and Environment and  Society. Security and privacy are to be considered as key components of the identified assessment  dimensions.  Finally, a close related work is the “Analysis of Cloud best practices and pilots for the public sector”  [40] published in 2013 by the European commission. This report aims at analysing the current national  initiatives for the deployment of clouds in the public sector in ten Member States, and the  methodological approach builds on interviews and desk research. The study concludes that so far, in  the analysed Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,  Portugal, Spain, and United Kingdom), the deployment of Cloud in the public sector (at the national  level) is at a very early stage. The Member States have taken very different approaches regarding  Cloud in terms of applications covered (citizen-type, employee-type, vertical, critical, sensitive), type  of infrastructure (public Cloud versus private Cloud), relationships with e-government applications  (development from scratch or just migration of existing applications), or global policy. Thise analysis  is centered around the kind of deployment models, general features and existing barriers; but there  is no assessment with regard to security.  2.2 Findings and conclusions  In summary, after studying the state-of-the art, we can conclude that:   The state of deployment of Governmental Cloud computing is in general at a very early stage.  Not many changes have been noted since the ENISA 2013 study 5  that presented cloud  adoption levels in the EU. The changes are depicted in the image below. The information on  this diagram is based on the desk research and only discusses 13 countries of the EU (based  on information from the desk research).   Security and privacy issues are considered as key factors to take into account for migration,  and at the same time are the main barriers for adoption. Protection of sensitive data is still an  issue seeking solution, spanning from the SLA provisions to the actual technological  mechanisms i.e encryption etc. Even though most countries recognize the benefits from  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-  clouds/at_download/fullReport  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds/at_download/fullReport  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  8  adopting a business model like cloud (scalability, resilience, portability), they are reluctant to  take the next step and migrate services to the cloud.   There is a clear need for Cloud pilots (like Cloud4Europe project) and prototypes in order to  test the utility of the technology. There is also a need for best practices and success stories to  be disseminated in the EU public administration community. Furthermore, it is crucial to  report these efforts within and outside the organizations so that it raises awareness among  the broad IT community of the actual advantages and the disadvantages of operating in the  clouds6.   The main security challenges, requirements and barriers in the cloudification of governmental  services are related to: data protection and compliance, interoperability and data portability,  identity and access management, auditing, adaptability and availability, as well as risk  management and detailed security SLA formalization.   There are no current studies that comprehensively analyse the security frameworks of  currently running or planned governmental Cloud deployments. Hence, there are no  guidelines to define a generic security framework that allows to assess and benchmark Gov  Cloud security.

It is to mention that this work builds on two previous ENISA  studies: the first one 7  was centered on defining a decision-making model to be used by senior  management to determine how operational, legal and information security requirements, can drive  the identification of the Gov Cloud architectural solution that best suits the needs of their  organization. The second work [42] performs a gap analysis the Member States based on the  government Cloud infrastructures and underlines the diversity of Cloud adoption in the public sector  in Europe and the need of a common framework.  6 As stated in [36] “it will be vitally important to share both “best practices” and “lessons learned”, since these demonstrations will drive the  eventual acceptance and adoption of Cloud computing in governmental environments and beyond.”  7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-  governmental-clouds  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  9  3 Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  Based on input collected during the desk research and some preliminary interviews, a logic model for  a security framework for governmental clouds was sketched including the specific activities and steps.  In addition to that, a description of the different roles of the involved parties (cloud customer, cloud  provider, citizens, so on) is included and their responsibilities/involvement to each of the phases of  the lifecycle is defined.  3.1 Roles  The (common) relevant roles found in the definition and implementation of the analysed Gov Cloud  use cases explained below:   Cloud Owner relates to the organization that legally owns the Gov Cloud and defines policies  and requirements.  Example: the Greek Research and Technology Network S.A. (GRNET S.A.) provides Cloud  services to the academic and research community in the case of the Greek Gov Cloud  (Okeanos and ViMa)8.   Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is the organization that provides Cloud services to the Gov Cloud  and takes responsibility for making them available to the Cloud Customers. Provision of  services is defined according to the requirements specified by the Cloud Owner, and usually  described on Service Level Agreements (SLA) and other contracts. CSP’s might own and/or  manage the IT infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and applications (SaaS) that are made  available to Cloud Customers, or provide applications (PaaS or SaaS) on top of an  infrastructure and/platform fully managed by the Cloud Owner.  Example: in the Spanish Gov Cloud the Cloud Owner also provides Cloud services9 , whereas  in the case of U.K. the Cloud services are provided by accredited public CSP’s10.   Cloud Customer is the organization/public administration using the Cloud services provided  by the CSP through the Cloud Owner.  Example: in Spain the Gov Cloud offers services to the Spanish Public Administration e.g., the  @firma platform for e-certificate validation.  Finally, it should be emphasized that different roles may be adopted at the same time by the same  entity, for example the Spanish Public Administration owns and provisions Cloud services through the  SARA11 network (owner and provider). In the same context, the role of the customer and the owner  can be filled by one authority i.e. a governmental authority that want to provide cloud services for  internal communication to its staff.  We explain in each security step of the lifecycle how these different stakeholders are involved, what  are their specific roles based on the three definitions presented above, and finally which their  responsibilities are. The roles are depicted below:  8 More information can be found on Section 4.1.1.  9 cf., Section 4.1.3  10 cf., Section 4.1.4  11 SARA is an acronym that in English stands for “Spanish Public Administrations Network”.

Gov Cloud roles.  3.2 Logic Model  Based on the preliminary analysis of the state of the art and use cases presented in this document,  together with the feedback obtained from the individual interviews, the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)12  was identified as a suitable continuous process to model information security management systems  in Gov Clouds. In consequence, the PDCA cycle leads to the definition of the proposed security  framework for governmental Clouds presented in this report. This model is very often adopted in  information security as it clearly identifies the individual steps of a process and it includes the notion  on evaluation (check) and adjustment/update (act) which is very important in all network and  information security aspects. It has to be noted that this Framework should be part of a greater plan  the governmental bodies will design for procuring cloud services; this Framework covers the security  perspective of the decision.  The PDCA model (also called “Deming cycle”) encompasses the following phases:  1. Plan: This phase focuses on setting policies along with a strategy for implementing controls to  achieve security objectives.  2. Do: This phase involves implementing and operating the controls, i.e., controls are executed  in the DO Phase.  3. Check: This phase is focused on the review and evaluation of the performance (efficiency and  effectiveness) of the system. Tests are performed to ensure that controls are operating as  intended and meet objectives.  4. Act: This phase involves the remediation to deficiencies or gaps identified in the CHECK Phase.  Changes are made to improve the approach or when necessary to bring the system back to  the planned performance.  Our study identified these phases as the general steps a governmental agency/public administration  typically follows to deploy a secure service in the Cloud.  Each phase of the cycle is sub-divided into a number of sample tasks/actions that are considered to  be necessary to reflect the specific needs and requirements of a country’s public administration. The  conclusion to these phases was based on the desk research conducted and initial input from the  existing gov cloud deployments. The list of tasks identified and suggested is not meant to be  considered as exhaustive; the framework is flexible enough to accommodate more or less  requirements and can be adjusted accordingly. The different tasks proposed for each stage, together  with their inputs and outputs, are detailed in the next sections. For all the phases we provide examples  12 http://kaizensite.com/learninglean/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Evolution-of-PDCA.pdf,  http://kaizensite.com/learninglean/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Evolution-of-PDCA.pdf  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  11  to support the factuality of this framework, back to back with the existing Gov Cloud implementations.  Additionally, for each phase, a template is provided (cf., Annex C) to identify the security-related  information that must be collected and used by the governmental agency during the PDCA cycle.

Table 2 Overview of the logic model  Let see now in detail the specific phases:  3.2.1 PLAN Phase  When taking the decision of moving a service to the Cloud, the first critical step is planning. From a  security point of view, planning involves the definition of a risk profile and the identification of security  requirements. Thus, the final goal of the PLAN phase is to design a security programme built on risk  analysis. The tasks or activities to be carried out in the PLAN phase are shown in the flow diagram in  Figure 3.  Figure 3. PLAN Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  13  The first part of the planning requires the Gov Cloud Customer to categorize its assets depending on  the criticality of the services provided and the information handled. The selection of an asset category  is based on risk, which implies considering the impact and the probability (potential loss) that an  adverse event affecting the security of the information or systems would have on the organization.  For example, the data managed by a governmental healthcare service are more sensitive and require  stricter security measures than a service for consulting traffic information.  This process of categorization is called “Risk Profiling” and involves Steps 1 to 4 in the flow diagram  shown before. Its input is the set of assets of the customer, and the output is a category or risk profile.  The steps needed to obtain a risk profile are:  1. Select the set of services (and associated assets) likely to be moved to the Cloud;  2. Select the security dimensions/properties that are relevant for each considered service (e.g.  C-I-A: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability);  3. Evaluate the potential impact to the organization of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and its  likelihood to happen (i.e., impact assessment);  4. Determine the risk category of the service under evaluation;  5. Determine the overall risk profile.  During the risk profiling process, multiple information sources are utilized including risk policies,  security guidelines, best practice documents, etc.  After determining the risk profile, the organization should decide on the architecture. This task, called  “Architectural Model”, encompasses Step 5 in the PLAN workflow, and implies the selection of:  1. A deployment model: Private, Public, Hybrid or Community.  2. A service model: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS  It is worth noting that boundaries of responsibilities between the Gov Cloud customer and CSP vary  significantly depending on the selected service model, being bare minimum in IaaS and more CSP  responsibilities in SaaS models16.  Public organizations must explicitly address compliance to security requirements depending on  whether the Gov Cloud infrastructure is property of and/or is administered by a third party, or it is  owned by the organization itself. If the public administration is also the Gov Cloud owner, then the  verification of adequacy and also the fulfilment of security norms is a specific task for this organization  to perform. However, if a third party owns the infrastructure then compliance requirements must also  be addressed by it.  Another aspect of the deployment-service model is subcontracting. The public administration should  consider if it allows the CSP to subcontract the provided Cloud service. An example would be the case  of a public SaaS provider which computing/storage infrastructure is subcontracted to another public  CSP that offers IaaS. This is called supply chain phenomenon and is very important in cloud offerings  that all compliance, service level obligations and responsibilities should narrow down to the vendors  16 Refer to diagram in the ENISA SME security guide  Example: During the risk profiling process the UK’s Gov Cloud defines three categories (Official,  Secret, Top Secret), to profile the risk associated with the assets to “cloudify” these are based on  the criticality of the information and systems.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  14  and subcontractors in the supply chain.  In summary, the decision of the architectural model serves to  distinguish which security requirements will be under the CSP’s responsibility, and which ones are  going to be managed by the customer.  Note: The step of choosing the architectural model doesn’t exist in the studies Gov Cloud structures in  EU, however it is an important intermediate decision that can deliver clearer results as input for the  next steps i.e. according to the requirements (performance and security)  in service the Cloud owner  should decide on the most cost-efficient and lean cloud solution.  Thus, the governmental organization must identify the list of security requirements associated to its  risk profile, which will be materialized in the DO Phase. This is the last step of the PLAN Phase, called  “Security and Privacy Requirements”, and Step 6 of the workflow contemplates it.  The security and privacy requirements should be categorized (e.g. technical, operational, legal, and  others), and organized according to the actor responsible of fulfilling them (e.g., in-house vs.  outsourced requirements).  What do the different actors have to do in the PLAN phase: a summary of the activities to be  performed by each role during the PLAN phase is presented below.  VO:  Activity  Cloud Customer All six activities comprising the PLAN stage.  Cloud Owner Might support Cloud Customers during the different steps comprising  the PLAN stage. For example, providing information related to the  supported deployment/service models (Step 5). If the cloud owner is  also the cloud customer then should take all the steps of the PLAN  phase.  Cloud Service Provider Usually the potential providers are not involved in this phase. However  the provider might provide information about own resources/services  to fine-tune elicited security and privacy requirements.  Table 3. PLAN: roles and activities.  Example: The Greek Gov Cloud defines a set of baseline requirements for CSP’s based on national  ICT requirements on security and on national law (data protection and privacy requirements).  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  15  3.2.2  DO Phase  The DO phase includes the implementation of the specific security controls or security measures that  are required to fulfil the security requirements elicited during the PLAN stage. Based on the results of  the PLAN phase, the identification of the risk profile for each asset category along with the selection  of the most suitable service and deployment model, the public administration will proceed to  implement the appropriate security measures. The tasks or activities to be carried out during the DO  phase are shown in Figure 4.  As shown there, the initial inputs are both (a) the list of in-house security requirements, and (b) the  list of requirements to be outsourced to the CSP. The workflow is composed of two major activities:  1. “Security Controls”: This task is the first step for this phase and consists of selecting the  appropriate security controls, which are capable of fulfilling the security requirements elicited  in the PLAN phase.  Note: The step of designating security requirements to security controls doesn’t exist in the already  studied Gov Cloud structures in EU, however it is an important intermediate decision that can  deliver clearer results as input for the next steps i.e. specific controls can make easier for the  provider to understand the needs of the customer.  2. “Implementation, Deployment and Accreditation”: This task, which involves Steps 2, 3 and  4, implies the actual formalization and implementation of the selected security controls, as  well as starting the operation of the Gov Cloud service. In-house controls are to be described  in a local policy document, whereas outsourced controls are usually formalized in a SLA (or  some other class of contract). This task also contemplates the ex-ante verification or  accreditation to assess the suitability of a CSP to provide a “good enough” level of assurance  within the Gov Cloud.  Example: In the Spanish Gov Cloud the roles of each actor are identified (client, provider), and the  policy is applied accordingly. The segregation of roles in the scheme is decided by the stakeholders  in collaboration, according to the law provisions.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  16  Figure 4. DO Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  After the activities described above are completed the Cloud service shifts to an operational state,  and its correct implementation (from the security point of view) is assessed during the CHECK Phase.  What do the different actors have to do in the DO phase: a summary of the activities to be performed  by each role during the DO phase is presented below.  Gov Cloud Role  Activity  Cloud Customer Perform all four activities for those requirements to be fulfilled  in-house.  Cloud Owner Mostly in charge of Step 3 (e.g., accreditation of CSP’s), although  could also have responsibility for establishing policies and SLA’s  (Step 2).  Cloud Service Provider Fulfilment of outsourced security controls (Steps 1 and 2),  procedures for accreditation on the Gov Cloud (Step 3), and  operation of the service (Step 4).  Table 4. PLAN: roles and activities.  3.2.3 CHECK Phase  During the CHECK phase the deployed security controls are monitored to verify both their  effectiveness and efficiency. Consequently, the CHECK phase involves two activities:  1. “Log/Monitoring”, which involves the monitoring of activities and evidences for further  analysis and reporting (Step 1).  Example: In Estonia they follow an approach of continuous monitoring and logs are kept only for  specific services.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  17  2. “Audit”, which performs periodic/continuous checks based on the monitored data to assess  if the security controls fulfil the security levels agreed on the SLA’s and contracts (Step 2).  Figure 5. CHECK Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  The CHECK phase might involve some level of automation to monitor the implemented controls,  although the Gov Cloud owner/CSP might also take into account that some of the security controls  usually require humans (e.g., auditors) for the assessment process. If a monitored value deviates  (beyond a threshold) from the agreed objective, then the ACT phase is triggered.  What do the different actors have to do in the CHECK phase: a summary of the activities to be  performed by each role during the CHECK phase is presented below.  Gov Cloud Role  Activity  Cloud Customer Might receive the outputs from both Step 1 and Step 2 (for  outsourced services). In-house services should implement both  Steps 1 and 2.  Cloud Owner Mostly in charge of Step 2, although Step 1 is also in scope  depending on the responsibility shared with the CSP.  Cloud Service Provider Responsible for Step 1 and also involved in Step 2 (along with  the Cloud Owner).  Table 5. CHECK: roles and activities.  3.2.4 ACT Phase  The ACT Phase, summarized by the workflow shown in Figure 6, involves the actions to be taken when  the activities deployed on the CHECK Phase (for continuously monitoring and testing the security of  the system) detect an anomalous event (e.g. a violation of the agreed SLA). Whenever this occurs, the  Gov Cloud owner/CSP will perform a set of remediation actions that might have different  characteristics e.g. change the implementation of a control, negotiate a different SLA with the Cloud  customer etc. In general, the actions taking place during the ACT phase can be grouped under two  tasks:  Example: In Spain they perform internally an audit every two years, and in some extraordinary  cases they perform ad hoc targeted audits. Audit team is created ad hoc and is comprised by  internal or/and external personnel, supervised by an audit leader. The audit team members have  to prove accreditation and/or experience in regard to information systems and security, and a  confidentiality agreement must be signed before the audit.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  18  1. “Changes Management”: this task involves those actions that are related to changes in the  operation of the service, such as for example changes affecting the actual Cloud service  provision and requiring to renegotiate the agreed SLA (e.g. upgrading the encryption system),  or events that may lead to the application of pro-active measures to avoid the actual violation  of the SLA/contract.  2. “Exit Management”: this task involves the finalization of the Cloud service whether voluntarily  or due to other reasons such as SLA violation or poor security performance in the Gov Cloud.  Figure 6. ACT Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  Example: Extra requirements by the provider have to be considered by the CISO, then approved by  the management board and then implemented (change in the terms of use, all customers accept  etc.)  Example: There is a clause in the Collaboration Agreement related to finalization. Both parties can  ask for termination with one month notice.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  19  What do the different actors have to do in the ACT phase: a summary of the activities to be performed  by each role during the ACT phase is presented below.  Gov Cloud Role  Activity  Cloud Customer Mostly participates on Step 2 (e.g., requesting finalization), and  Step 3 (e.g., upon termination receiving returned data).  Cloud Owner Might participate on all three activities within the ACT stage  (depending on how the responsibility is shared with the CSP’s).  Cloud Service Provider Participates during all three activities within the ACT stage.  Table 6. CHECK: roles and activities.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  20  4 Framework through use cases  This section presents the examples of the developed Gov Cloud security framework, by applying it to  the selected MS use cases of Estonia, Greece, Spain, and United Kingdom.  4.1 Selected use cases  Using the criteria discussed in Section 1.5, this report considered for its analysis four use cases based  on Gov Clouds operating in MS17. This section provides general background information related to  those use cases. The four countries use cases mapped against the framework questionnaire are in  Annex A.  Estonia Greece Spain United Kingdom  Systems in cloud Public  administration  services  Educational and  academic  community  Services of  general and  regional  administration  Service of the  public sector  Deployment  model  Public/Private Public cloud Private Public  Cloud Strategy Yes No Yes Yes  Service model IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS IaaS SaaS IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS  Status of  deployment  In planning phase Deployed Deployed Deployed  4.1.1 Estonia  In 2013, the Government of Estonia took the first steps to deploy a Gov Cloud by consolidating the  networking and datacenter layers in order to develop high-quality and cost-effective services. An  analysis carried out to this end, revealed a set of requirements that resulted on three main principles  guiding the development of the Estonian Gov Cloud:  i. Using Cloud solutions located within Estonia’s national borders,  ii. Using international private Cloud resources, and  iii. Using Data Embassies.  The Estonian government has built the foundation of a highly developed information society, and its  ICT development has taken Estonia to a stage where many registries and services only exist in digital  form. This development requires a flexible and secure Gov Cloud solution, the growth of which and  future capacity requirements cannot be predicted today. Nevertheless, sufficient flexibility has to be  planned in advance. The consolidation of domestic server rooms into standards-compliant  datacenters, flexible involvement of private sector resources (both inside and outside the state’s  borders), and the deployment of the Data Embassy network will create a strong foundation for the  Estonian Gov Cloud. Please note that the governmental cloud is still under development.  17 The use cases were selected at the instance of ENISA for being representative of Gov Cloud adoption and also  for their willingness to provide the needed documentation to conduct the validation.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  21  The “State Infocommunication Foundation” leads the Gov-Cloud development, which is responsible  for the consolidation of server resources and provision of high-quality server hosting services within  Estonia’s national borders.  4.1.2 Greece  The Greek Gov Cloud is comprised of Okeanos18 and ViMa, which are Cloud services provided by the  Greek Research and Technology Network S.A. (GRNET). The Greek Gov Cloud serves to the national  academic and research community in order to promote academic, educational and research aims.  Okeanos is a Cloud service with customers in the academic and research community. Okeanos offers  two main services: Cyclades (a virtual desktop), and Pithos+ (Cloud storage). The ViMa19  (Virtual  Machines) Cloud service provides Virtual Private Servers (VPS) to GRNET peers. ViMa aims to provide  shared computing and network resources to the educational and academic community, with  production-level quality.  In order to be able to ensure high availability, both Okeanos and ViMa are hosted on multiple  computing clusters distributed in several data centres in Greece. The Gov Cloud network  infrastructure ensures seamless connection to the telecommunications backbone (and Internet), at  very high speeds. Okeanos and ViMa are based on open source software.  4.1.3 Spain  The Spanish public administration has taken important steps related to Gov Cloud, by using available  infrastructure and resources. This is the case of SARA (Spanish Public Administrations Network)  Network, which is connected to the TESTA (Trans European Services for Telematics between  Administrations) network deployed by the European Commission. The initial strategy of Spain’s Gov  Cloud was to offer services to the Public Administration as a private CSP. The operation of the SARA  network for delivering Cloud services started in 2010, but further upgrades and new deployments  were made in 2011 and 2013. The SARA project connects and provides services to the General  Administration, as well as to Regional and Local Governments. Currently, SARA offers Cloud services  to the Spanish Public Administration, such as the @firma platform for e-certificate validation.  4.1.4 United Kingdom  The UK Gov Cloud (better known as “G-Cloud”) consists of a framework for the provisioning of Cloud  services to the UK public sector, and a marketplace called CloudStore 20 . The latter is an online  catalogue of Gov Cloud services containing details about CSP’s and their offered Cloud services.  Currently, CloudStore comprises more than 1,200 providers, and approximately 13,000 Cloud services  spread across four types of Cloud service models (“Lots”):  1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)  3. Software as a Service (SaaS)  4. Specialist Cloud Services (SCS)  CSP membership to G-Cloud is based on an accreditation process21, which defines a minimum set of  controls to be implemented by the (prospective) provider. At a glance, the CPS being accredited should  provide information about the offered Cloud service’s interoperability (including supporting  18 Please refer to https://okeanos.grnet.gr/home/  19 Please refer to https://vima.grnet.gr/about/info/en/  20 Please refer to https://www.gov.uk/how-to-use-cloudstore  21 Please refer to https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g-Cloud-service-definitions  https://www.gov.uk/how-to-use-cloudstore  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  22  standards), data portability, extraction and removal. Despite the components of the G-Cloud are  expected to be delivered by multiple CSP’s/organisations, they must be interconnected and available  to all customers, thus creating a single private Cloud.  4.2 Use Cases Validation  During our study, the case studies were used as examples to the security framework introduced in  Section 3. Based on the suggested framework, we mapped these four use cases to indicate the  different approaches each country has followed according to their needs and the national security  requirements. We decided to depict this in a visual way, so that it would be evident how follow the  proposed workflows.  For  each visual we  give an example follow a specific path (indicated in red).  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  23  4.2.1 PLAN phase  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  24  Exemplar uses of the logic model:  On the first activity of the PLAN phase, Risk Profiling, the first step the cloud owner would have to take  is to identify the services they would like to deploy on cloud. For this step we see four different  approaches (one per country use case):   Classification of information assets (nature of assets)   Classification based on data sensitivity (nature and criticality of data)   Classification based on risk– three risk classes- against the three security dimensions  (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) – multi criteria classification   Classification based on predefined security levels (clearly defined security levels in the  strategy)  Following the path of the PLAN phase on the Architectural Model, the specific activity is called  deployment model decision. On this topic the steps on decision making can be split in two different  topics: the cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and the cloud deployment model (public, private,  hybrid etc).  As depicted, none of the four use case countries specifications are in place to make an informative  decision on the cloud model based on the security requirements. The same applied for the  deployment model. In the latter case, the offerings are different in each country and this is defined in  the national cloud strategy (if any).

For this step we present four  different approaches based on the country use cases. The formalisation can be included in:   Publicly available policy document   In internal handling policy   In national regulation   In formal decision by the national security body  In this case there is a sub-step that should be taken into account in this process, namely the handling  of international data. Again here we present four different cases:   The data is marked as sensitive or official and treated accordingly (different procedure for  sensitive data)   International data transferred is not provisioned thus it is not taking place   Specific controls based on the  national data protection framework are implemented and a  specific procedure is followed   Data protection authority has to give confirmation before the transfer takes place.

More specifically a step to be taken towards that approach is monitoring of requirements,  again here we present four different approaches:   Monitoring aspects such as network (traffic) web applications and systems;   No specific requirements for monitoring  open to the customers to decide (non obligatory)   The customer is responsible to decide the approach (obligatory)   Monitoring is continuous  Part of monitoring is the specification of the scope, in this sub-step we define two different  approaches (and countries are divided):   Operational and administrative scope for monitoring   No specified scope  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  29  4.2.4 ACT phase  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  30  Exemplar uses of the logic model:  In the last phase of the logic model, the ACT phase, in one of the two activities, namely exit  management, under the step of contract termination, the approaches noticed are four:   Contracts can have a predefined maximum duration, leaving the customers free to end the  contract whenever they want prior to a 30 days’ notice (as states in the guidelines).   The customer can request termination of contract and ask the data to be removed (following  a specific data migration plan including logs, metadata etc) .   Finalisation has to be agreed by both parties of the collaboration agreement   No specific provision is applicable.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  31  5 Conclusions  This report proposed a security framework for Gov Clouds, structured through the widely used Plan- Do-Check-Act security cycle. The presented framework was developed based on comprehensive  research that included coverage of relevant state of the art/practice, and was also iteratively validated  thanks to the valuable feedback from Gov Cloud experts in the four selected use cases (Estonia,  Greece, Spain, and United Kingdom).  The main conclusions drawn from the report are:   Despite considerable efforts from the EC, ENISA and other international organisations and  market actors (e.g. CSP’s) the level of adoption of Gov Clouds is still low. Some EU MS have  already defined a Cloud strategy, some others show a tactical or opportunistic adoption of  Cloud services, but very few (actually only UK and Spain) have defined and implemented a  national wide Cloud strategy. This security framework will be one more reason to support the  systematic adoption of Cloud security strategies and actual governmental cloud deployment.   The report’s analysis made evident that “common security denominators” exist across the MS  deployed Gov Clouds, in particular related to aspects like defined roles, use of standards, and  adopted security controls. It is our expectation that the discovered commonalities will be the  basis to develop homogeneous security best practices, SLA’s and contracts for Gov Clouds in  the short term.   The analysis of the input collected from Estonia, Greece, Spain and UK also shows that these  Gov Clouds apply different practices in the registration of evidences, selection of monitoring  tools, SLA violation management, types and frequency of performed audits, and accreditation  procedures.   From the consideration of change-management practices, all the use cases portend  mechanisms for the continuous improvement of the implemented security frameworks  (policies, mechanisms).   The analysed Gov Clouds have established policies for incident management. However, the  adopted approaches do not directly appear under the ACT phase, but are scattered among  the other stages of the framework. This means that incident management is not only one step  in the lifecycle but is a horizontal activity that has to be considered in all different stages.   The security framework proposed in this report (a) encompasses the analysed Gov Clouds,  and (b) is projected to be flexible for extension and adaptation to new security needs and  requirements from other Gov Clouds in the EU. This was demonstrated by its empirical  validation through four selected use cases. This framework is also meant to be used during  the design phase of new Gov Clouds, as it contains specific guidance related to different  security features/best-practices that should be taken into account by practitioners and Cloud  security architects. On the other hand, the framework can be also used by existing Gov Clouds  as a baseline for analysing side-by-side different deployments from MS.  In summary, this novel framework for Gov Clouds should become part of the public administrations’  toolbox when planning their migration to the Cloud, and when assessing the effectiveness of the  deployed security controls and procedures.

The concept of Governmental Cloud (Gov Cloud)  has been proposed by ENISA, as well as other international agencies/public institutions since 2010-11.  In the report “Security and Resilience in Governmental Clouds” and the “Good practice Guide for  securely deploying Governmental Clouds” ENISA proposed, among others, the following:  “…Cloud computing service delivery model satisfies the most of the needs of public administrations, on  the one hand, since it offers scalability, elasticity, high performance, resilience and security. However,  many public bodies have not yet built a model for assessing their organizational risks related to security  and resilience.”  It also recommended that:   National governments should prepare a strategy on Cloud computing that takes into account  the implications for security;   National governments and European Union institutions to further investigate the concept of a  European Governmental Cloud as a supra national virtual space where a consistent and  harmonized set of rules could be applied, both in terms of legislation and security policy and  where interoperability and standardization could be fostered;   National governmental and Member States should foster the adoption of baseline security  measures for all cloud deployment models;  This present study builds on those conclusions and recommendations to provide formalization of a  generic security framework for governmental clouds. The proposed security framework is based on a  collection and analysis of existing Cloud computing security literature, other relevant security best  practises, and on the few existing real life case studies of Governmental Clouds in Europe.  The final result is a security framework modelled into four (4) phases, nine (9) security activities and  fourteen (14) steps that details the set of actions that we believe each Member States should follow  for the definition and implementation of a secure Gov Cloud. The generic security framework has been  empirically validated through the analysis of four (4) Gov Cloud case studies namely Estonia, Greece,  Spain and UK. The real life validation of the security framework also serves the purpose of defining  examples on how some EU Member States are implementing security into their Gov Cloud  approaches.  As a concluding remark, we want to highlight (based on the information collected until September  2014), that very few EU Member States have currently developed approaches for Cloud computing  based on a well-defined and thorough cloud security strategy (including risk profiles, classification of  assets, security objectives and measures).  The objective of the proposed security framework, and the accompanying case studies, is to serve as  guidance to other EU Members States towards a seamless and more secure adoption of Cloud  computing.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary ......................................................................................................... iv  1 Introduction .............................................................................................................. 1  1.1 Target audience .................................................................................................................................. 1  1.2 Scope .................................................................................................................................................. 2  1.3 Policy Context ..................................................................................................................................... 2  1.4 Definitions........................................................................................................................................... 3  1.5 Methodology....................................................................................................................................... 3  1.6 Structure ............................................................................................................................................. 4  2 State of the art in Gov Cloud activities ....................................................................... 5  2.1 Desk research ...................................................................................................................................... 5  2.2 Findings and conclusions ..................................................................................................................... 7  3 Security Framework for Governmental Clouds ........................................................... 9  3.1 Roles ................................................................................................................................................... 9  3.2 Logic Model ....................................................................................................................................... 10  4 Framework through use cases .................................................................................. 20  4.1 Selected use cases ............................................................................................................................. 20  4.2 Use Cases Validation ......................................................................................................................... 22  5 Conclusions ............................................................................................................. 31  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  1  1 Introduction  The compelling business and financial benefits for adopting Cloud services, highlighted in the  European Commission’s European Cloud Strategy1, have motivated a number of EU countries to  develop a Cloud computing national strategy2. However currently not many Member States (MS) have  operational governmental Cloud infrastructures supporting public administration (so called Gov  Clouds). Not many public administrations are actively procuring Cloud services nor are they launching  any test bed projects on Cloud computing (e.g. the European project “Cloud for Europe”).  As the topic of governmental clouds constitutes ongoing exploration and development, there is  naturally a conspicuous dearth of information about the experiences of such early Gov Cloud adopters,  in particular related to the adopted security frameworks (including requirements, architectures, and  best-practices). National experts, policy makers and other interested stakeholders often struggle to  find use cases and, thus, cannot benefit from the valuable experience of well-established European  Gov Cloud’s. The need for detailed information related to the steps a governmental body should take  to adopt Cloud services, is the starting point for this report on security frameworks for governmental  clouds.  Against this background, this report compiles, analyses and makes available four (4) relevant cases  studies on national Cloud security approaches (namely Estonia, Greece, Spain, and United Kingdom)  in order to define a reference framework for Gov Cloud security. The contributed framework also  integrates relevant findings from topical academic/practitioner literature, and aims to offer value to  both the MSs that are starting to define their Cloud computing strategy, and those MSs that already  have a Gov Cloud in place but want to assess it with respect to other baselines. This framework  indicates the possible approaches, thus offering solutions to the governmental bodies regardless of  their maturity. In this report, the technical and security aspects associated to the selected Gov Cloud  use cases were analysed through four different perspectives based on a widely used security life-cycle  approach (i.e., Plan-Do-Check-Act or PDCA3).Following this project management approach would  assist in clarifying and categorising the distinct steps.  It must be noted that the framework (thus the specific steps) suggested in this report can be followed,  with some minor adjustments, also from other types of cloud customers, not only public  administration; however the target audience of this report frames it to focus on governmental cloud  deployments.  1.1 Target audience  The results of this report, in particular the developed framework for Gov Cloud security, targets mostly  national experts, governmental bodies and public administration in the EU countries interested in  recommendations for defining their national Cloud security strategy, or obtaining a baseline for  analysing their existing Gov Cloud deployment from the security perspectives, or to support them in  filling in their procurement requirements in security.  However in an indirect manner, this report can be helpful for:  1 Available online http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF  2 Available online http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely- deploying-governmental-clouds  3 Also known as Deming cycle, PDCA is a four step management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of  processes and products. The PDCA  was identified as a suitable continuous process to model information security management systems in  Gov Clouds as distinct steps have to be followed and control and continuous monitoring is a notion needed in the gov cloud deployment  procedure.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF http://www.cloudforeurope.eu/  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  2   EU policymakers desiring concise information about state of the art Gov Cloud security  strategies from MS in order to decide on further economic, legal and technological incentives  for improving the uptake of Cloud computing in the public sector.   EU private sector, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), where more  experienced studies and guidance are needed to develop the full potential of Cloud  computing.   Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and Cloud Brokers seeking further guidance related to security  approaches adopted by existing MS Gov Cloud, in order to identify and better understand  specific needs and requirements that might be used to better tune their existing Cloud service  offerings.  1.2 Scope  This report is based on the recommendations made in the ENISA “Good practice guide on how to  securely deploy governmental clouds”, namely the need for a common security framework for  deploying cloud services in public administration. The aim of this study is to develop a security  framework. A framework is a basic structure underlying a system that is used in this case for  establishing a set of general terms, concepts and practices to embed “good enough” information  security in the implementation of a Gov Cloud. The framework shall serve as a reference to relevant  stakeholders (cf., Section 1.1) for supporting Cloud deployments by public administrations.  1.3 Policy Context  Cloud computing drives the vast spectrum of both current and emerging applications, products and  services, and is also a key technology enabler for the Future Internet. Its direct economic value to the  European Union is unambiguously substantial. Cloud computing is an accepted enabler for innovation  and also widely advocated as such by the European Commission (EC) in their Digital Agenda. The EC  considers that Cloud computing will be a game changer in our economy and the main obstacles  impeding Cloud adoption are standards, certification, data protection, interoperability, lock-in, and  legal certainty4.  In September 2012, the EC published, , the European Cloud Strategy, a policy strategy document that  contains the key actions that EC policy makers have identified to support the uptake of Cloud  computing in Europe. The European Cloud Strategy has two main objectives:   Making Europe Cloud-friendly and Cloud-active.   Connecting digital agenda initiatives.  Achieving these two objectives requires the execution of three key actions:  1. Standards and certification.  2. Safe and fair contract terms.  3. A European Cloud Partnership  This report is part of ENISA’s contributions to the implementation of the European Cloud Strategy, in  particular related to the development of a security framework for governmental Cloud’s aimed to  provide stakeholders (cf., Section 1.1) efficiency savings and take them one step closer to the “Every  European Digital” goal.  4 Warwick A. “Neelie Kroes calls for speedy EU uptake of Cloud computing”. Online:  http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240114460/Neelie-Kroes-calls-for-speedy-EU-uptake-of-Cloud-computing  2012  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/com/com_Cloud.pdf%202013  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  3  1.4 Definitions  A standard definition for the term Gov Cloud is currently lacking. However, for the analysis presented  in the rest of this document we adopt the Gov Cloud definition introduced by ENISA 2013 report, as:   “A Gov Cloud is an environment running services compliant with governmental and EU  legislations on security, privacy and resilience (what)   A Gov Cloud is a secure and trustworthy way (private Cloud or public Cloud) to run services  under public body governance (how)   A Gov Cloud is a deployment model to build and deliver services to state agencies (internal  delivery of services), to citizens and to enterprises (external delivery of services to society) (for  who)”  An additional definition required in this report, relates to the notion of “security framework”. This is  as a conceptual structure intended to serve as a support or guide for the creation of a secure  information system. In this document, the intention of the proposed security framework is to serve as  a comprehensive guideline for the creation, deployment, assessment and improvement of a secure  Gov Cloud. The proposed security framework is to be understood as a first step towards improving  the European Gov Cloud landscape. Furthermore, it should be considered as the beginning of a  continuous enhancement process by incorporating emerging elements, and by considering the lessons  learned from its real-world application.  1.5 Methodology  The methodology to elaborate such a logic model for a security framework follows a bottom-up  approach for information processing and knowledge ordering. The technical methodology focused on:  a) Defining the generic security framework based on the input collected from the analysis of  available literature, and information obtained from operational Gov Clouds in European  Member States. The proposed framework is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.  The structure of the framework is flexible enough to be extended when new use-cases will  be analysed (future work).  b) Surveying and identifying four Gov Cloud use cases from MS (i.e., Estonia, Greece, Spain, and  United Kingdom). The use cases were selected for being representative of Gov Cloud  adoption (or mature enough) and also for their willingness to provide the required  documentation to conduct the validation  c) Use case scenarios of the initially defined generic security framework through the analysis of  the strategies adopted by selected case studies from the security life cycle perspective. In  order to accomplish this, we identified and engaged relevant stakeholders/representatives  from the selected Gov Cloud use cases through e.g., telephone interviews and email  communications.  The adopted methodology allowed us to characterise the Gov Cloud use cases from different security  angles (e.g. requirements, certifications, SLAs and contracts), and taking into consideration relevant  security challenges (e.g., resilience, portability, continuous monitoring, and access control). This  methodological approach resulted on a comprehensive analysis of selected Gov Cloud security  frameworks provided as use cases, hence promoting the definition of a reference Cloud security  strategy blueprint.  In summary, the core framework describes what to do when deploying secure Gov Cloud services,  whereas the workflows, questionnaires and reference implementations detail how to do it. All these  instruments are to be collectively used by the governmental organizations and public administrations  (who), to define and implement secure Cloud-based services.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  4  1.6 Structure  This document is organized as folllows: Section 2 details  the proposed security framework for Gov  Clouds, and also introduces the underlying roles and definitions. Section 3 introduces the MS use  cases, and  validates the proposed security framework (cf., Section 2) through the four selected Gov  Cloud use cases (Estonia, Greece,  Spain and United Kingdom). Section 4 summarizes the main  conclusions and recommendations drawn from this report. Annexes A and B presents the full version  of the questionnaires used during the interviews with the selected Gov Cloud representatives. Annex  C discusses the results of our desktop research, by presenting the relevant state of the art/practice on  the topic of security frameworks for Gov Clouds. Annex D contains the questionnaire template used  for the interviews with the selected use cases. This questionnaire is a concrete result of the security  framework presented in this report.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  5  2 State of the art in Gov Cloud activities  Previous to the design of the framework, a desk research was conducted to identify and analyse  relevant work in the field of Governmental Cloud computing, since the gap analysis performed in the  ENISA 2013 Gov clouds guide. This task was supported by the need to understand the following  questions:   Which is the state of deployment in various Member States (running pilots, plans, etc) since  2013?   What are the challenges, requirements and barriers in the “cloudification” of governmental  services?   What are the state-of-the-art techniques to analyse Cloud security in governmental  deployments? Is there any existing generic security framework?  This preliminary study helped in setting the basis for the rationale behind the proposed security  framework. In the next paragraphs, we summarize the related work (references [29]-[42]) considering  the research questions posed above.  2.1 Desk research  The work in [29] evaluates eight European countries on their use of Cloud Computing in e-Government  and compares them: Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and UK. The  comparative analysis is synthetized in Table 1.  This study shows that, while the majority of countries are still in the development or planning phase,  three of them -namely UK, Spain and Denmark- have already adopted Cloud Computing and hence  are in an executional stage. It is to note also that, five of the eight researched countries have anchored  the adoption of Cloud computing in the public sector in some kind of national strategy. Nevertheless,  the full implementation of their National Cloud Computing strategy will still take another few years  (conclusion derived in the ENISA 2013 guide). The most frequent planned and developed Cloud  Computing deployment models amongst the evaluated countries are the private and the community  Cloud. On the other hand, when comparing Cloud computing service models, 50% of the evaluated  countries rely on the most common service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a  Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).  The guide elaborated by the law firm Bird&Bird [30] covers the legal issues to take into account when  setting up a Cloud service on a pan-European basis, including data security and data privacy  regulations. The research covers twelve countries (Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,  Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, UAE and UK) and, for each of these case studies, they include  questions regarding Cloud computing usage in the public sector, such as information about operating  government clouds or best practice guides for public bodies.  Gongolidis et al. [31] identified the major functional and non-functional requirements to migrate  governmental applications to the Cloud. Based on the reports provided by the European Union for  i2010 initiatives [32], United Nations reports for eGovernment Systems characteristics, and the Greek  Interoperability Framework [34], the authors elicit the following requirements: interoperability,  eAccesibility, single sign-on, transparency, scalability, adaptability, use of prototypes, availability,  maintenance, and security and privacy. The paper includes also a mapping of these requirements to  the different deployment models that are subject of their applicability.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  6  Table 1 Comparison of Cloud computing in e-Government across eight European countries made in [29] (for Finland and  Germany no further information was available to compare them against the other countries)  Wyld [35] examines non-military uses of Cloud computing in governments across the globe (Unites  States, Europe and Asia), which builds the basis of his proposed 6-step “Cloud Migration Strategy” for  governmental agencies to shift to Cloud computing. In this study, as well as in a previous deeper  research on Cloud for governments by the same author [36], Security and Privacy are pointed out as  key requirements to enable Cloud computing migration. Furthermore, Wyld highlights the need for  the development of Cloud pilots to test the utility of the technology and assess the ability to manage  and bring such a project to fruition. These efforts, he remarks, should be supported—and reported  within and outside the organization—so that others in IT and wider community can learn of the  successes and the downsides of operating on Cloud. Thus, it will be vitally important to share both  “best practices” and “lessons learned”, since these demonstrations will drive the eventual acceptance  and adoption of Cloud computing in governmental environments and beyond.  Tripathi and Parihar [37] provide a brief overview of e-governance challenges, categorizing them in  technical, economic and social barriers. Security is again identified as a key requirement to overcome  before migration of governmental services to Cloud happens.  The work carried out by Smitha et al. in [38] presents a survey on Cloud-based E-Governance systems,  where E-governance is defined as “the application of information and communication technologies to  exchange information between government and citizens, government and business organizations, and  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  7  between government organizations.” They focus on identifying the main challenges and benefits of  relying on the Cloud paradigm, pointing out again security and privacy as indispensable requirements.  Paquette et al. [39] identify the security risks involved in the governmental use of Cloud computing.  The base on specific cases of the USA federal Cloud computing strategy and discuss the tangible and  intangible risks associated with its use. The paper argues that a defined risk management program  focused on Cloud computing is an essential part of the government IT environment. As they point out,  there are risks linked to the implementation of the emerging Cloud computing paradigm, including  policy changes, implementation of dynamic applications, and securing the dynamic environment. They  also remark the importance of defining detailed SLAs as a mean to formalize security aspects to be  covered and cope with risk.  The survey carried out in [39] is centered on the analysis of the readiness (i.e., maturity state) of E- government Information systems (EGIS) and Cloud Computing. The study concludes that e- government readiness is a major concern, and that currently there is little availability of  comprehensive assessment methods for e-government readiness and most of the assessment  frameworks are varied in terms of philosophies, objectives, methodologies, approaches, and results.  As a guide for future work, the paper proposes a new framework with the aim to provide a modeling  and analysis method to guide the assessment of EGIS systems migration readiness. The framework  considers four dimensions, namely: Technical, Organizational, Stakeholders and Environment and  Society. Security and privacy are to be considered as key components of the identified assessment  dimensions.  Finally, a close related work is the “Analysis of Cloud best practices and pilots for the public sector”  [40] published in 2013 by the European commission. This report aims at analysing the current national  initiatives for the deployment of clouds in the public sector in ten Member States, and the  methodological approach builds on interviews and desk research. The study concludes that so far, in  the analysed Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,  Portugal, Spain, and United Kingdom), the deployment of Cloud in the public sector (at the national  level) is at a very early stage. The Member States have taken very different approaches regarding  Cloud in terms of applications covered (citizen-type, employee-type, vertical, critical, sensitive), type  of infrastructure (public Cloud versus private Cloud), relationships with e-government applications  (development from scratch or just migration of existing applications), or global policy. Thise analysis  is centered around the kind of deployment models, general features and existing barriers; but there  is no assessment with regard to security.  2.2 Findings and conclusions  In summary, after studying the state-of-the art, we can conclude that:   The state of deployment of Governmental Cloud computing is in general at a very early stage.  Not many changes have been noted since the ENISA 2013 study 5  that presented cloud  adoption levels in the EU. The changes are depicted in the image below. The information on  this diagram is based on the desk research and only discusses 13 countries of the EU (based  on information from the desk research).   Security and privacy issues are considered as key factors to take into account for migration,  and at the same time are the main barriers for adoption. Protection of sensitive data is still an  issue seeking solution, spanning from the SLA provisions to the actual technological  mechanisms i.e encryption etc. Even though most countries recognize the benefits from  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-  clouds/at_download/fullReport  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds/at_download/fullReport  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  8  adopting a business model like cloud (scalability, resilience, portability), they are reluctant to  take the next step and migrate services to the cloud.   There is a clear need for Cloud pilots (like Cloud4Europe project) and prototypes in order to  test the utility of the technology. There is also a need for best practices and success stories to  be disseminated in the EU public administration community. Furthermore, it is crucial to  report these efforts within and outside the organizations so that it raises awareness among  the broad IT community of the actual advantages and the disadvantages of operating in the  clouds6.   The main security challenges, requirements and barriers in the cloudification of governmental  services are related to: data protection and compliance, interoperability and data portability,  identity and access management, auditing, adaptability and availability, as well as risk  management and detailed security SLA formalization.   There are no current studies that comprehensively analyse the security frameworks of  currently running or planned governmental Cloud deployments. Hence, there are no  guidelines to define a generic security framework that allows to assess and benchmark Gov  Cloud security.

It is to mention that this work builds on two previous ENISA  studies: the first one 7  was centered on defining a decision-making model to be used by senior  management to determine how operational, legal and information security requirements, can drive  the identification of the Gov Cloud architectural solution that best suits the needs of their  organization. The second work [42] performs a gap analysis the Member States based on the  government Cloud infrastructures and underlines the diversity of Cloud adoption in the public sector  in Europe and the need of a common framework.  6 As stated in [36] “it will be vitally important to share both “best practices” and “lessons learned”, since these demonstrations will drive the  eventual acceptance and adoption of Cloud computing in governmental environments and beyond.”  7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-  governmental-clouds  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  9  3 Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  Based on input collected during the desk research and some preliminary interviews, a logic model for  a security framework for governmental clouds was sketched including the specific activities and steps.  In addition to that, a description of the different roles of the involved parties (cloud customer, cloud  provider, citizens, so on) is included and their responsibilities/involvement to each of the phases of  the lifecycle is defined.  3.1 Roles  The (common) relevant roles found in the definition and implementation of the analysed Gov Cloud  use cases explained below:   Cloud Owner relates to the organization that legally owns the Gov Cloud and defines policies  and requirements.  Example: the Greek Research and Technology Network S.A. (GRNET S.A.) provides Cloud  services to the academic and research community in the case of the Greek Gov Cloud  (Okeanos and ViMa)8.   Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is the organization that provides Cloud services to the Gov Cloud  and takes responsibility for making them available to the Cloud Customers. Provision of  services is defined according to the requirements specified by the Cloud Owner, and usually  described on Service Level Agreements (SLA) and other contracts. CSP’s might own and/or  manage the IT infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and applications (SaaS) that are made  available to Cloud Customers, or provide applications (PaaS or SaaS) on top of an  infrastructure and/platform fully managed by the Cloud Owner.  Example: in the Spanish Gov Cloud the Cloud Owner also provides Cloud services9 , whereas  in the case of U.K. the Cloud services are provided by accredited public CSP’s10.   Cloud Customer is the organization/public administration using the Cloud services provided  by the CSP through the Cloud Owner.  Example: in Spain the Gov Cloud offers services to the Spanish Public Administration e.g., the  @firma platform for e-certificate validation.  Finally, it should be emphasized that different roles may be adopted at the same time by the same  entity, for example the Spanish Public Administration owns and provisions Cloud services through the  SARA11 network (owner and provider). In the same context, the role of the customer and the owner  can be filled by one authority i.e. a governmental authority that want to provide cloud services for  internal communication to its staff.  We explain in each security step of the lifecycle how these different stakeholders are involved, what  are their specific roles based on the three definitions presented above, and finally which their  responsibilities are. The roles are depicted below:  8 More information can be found on Section 4.1.1.  9 cf., Section 4.1.3  10 cf., Section 4.1.4  11 SARA is an acronym that in English stands for “Spanish Public Administrations Network”.

Gov Cloud roles.  3.2 Logic Model  Based on the preliminary analysis of the state of the art and use cases presented in this document,  together with the feedback obtained from the individual interviews, the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)12  was identified as a suitable continuous process to model information security management systems  in Gov Clouds. In consequence, the PDCA cycle leads to the definition of the proposed security  framework for governmental Clouds presented in this report. This model is very often adopted in  information security as it clearly identifies the individual steps of a process and it includes the notion  on evaluation (check) and adjustment/update (act) which is very important in all network and  information security aspects. It has to be noted that this Framework should be part of a greater plan  the governmental bodies will design for procuring cloud services; this Framework covers the security  perspective of the decision.  The PDCA model (also called “Deming cycle”) encompasses the following phases:  1. Plan: This phase focuses on setting policies along with a strategy for implementing controls to  achieve security objectives.  2. Do: This phase involves implementing and operating the controls, i.e., controls are executed  in the DO Phase.  3. Check: This phase is focused on the review and evaluation of the performance (efficiency and  effectiveness) of the system. Tests are performed to ensure that controls are operating as  intended and meet objectives.  4. Act: This phase involves the remediation to deficiencies or gaps identified in the CHECK Phase.  Changes are made to improve the approach or when necessary to bring the system back to  the planned performance.  Our study identified these phases as the general steps a governmental agency/public administration  typically follows to deploy a secure service in the Cloud.  Each phase of the cycle is sub-divided into a number of sample tasks/actions that are considered to  be necessary to reflect the specific needs and requirements of a country’s public administration. The  conclusion to these phases was based on the desk research conducted and initial input from the  existing gov cloud deployments. The list of tasks identified and suggested is not meant to be  considered as exhaustive; the framework is flexible enough to accommodate more or less  requirements and can be adjusted accordingly. The different tasks proposed for each stage, together  with their inputs and outputs, are detailed in the next sections. For all the phases we provide examples  12 http://kaizensite.com/learninglean/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Evolution-of-PDCA.pdf,  http://kaizensite.com/learninglean/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Evolution-of-PDCA.pdf  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  11  to support the factuality of this framework, back to back with the existing Gov Cloud implementations.  Additionally, for each phase, a template is provided (cf., Annex C) to identify the security-related  information that must be collected and used by the governmental agency during the PDCA cycle.  In table 2 we present an overview of our security framework based on the PDCA lifecycle:  Lifecycle  Phase Security Activity Security Steps Example13  PLAN  This phase focuses on  setting policies, a strategy  for implementing controls  to achieve security  objectives  Risk Profiling  Identify services to “cloudify” The UK’s Gov Cloud defines  three categories (Official,  Secret, Top Secret), to  profile the risk associated  with the assets to  “cloudify”.

Exit Management  Contract termination, return of  data to customer and data  deletion  Cloud Customers can  request deletion of their  data from the Greek Gov  Cloud on termination of  contract.  Table 2 Overview of the logic model  Let see now in detail the specific phases:  3.2.1 PLAN Phase  When taking the decision of moving a service to the Cloud, the first critical step is planning. From a  security point of view, planning involves the definition of a risk profile and the identification of security  requirements. Thus, the final goal of the PLAN phase is to design a security programme built on risk  analysis. The tasks or activities to be carried out in the PLAN phase are shown in the flow diagram in  Figure 3.  Figure 3. PLAN Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  13  The first part of the planning requires the Gov Cloud Customer to categorize its assets depending on  the criticality of the services provided and the information handled. The selection of an asset category  is based on risk, which implies considering the impact and the probability (potential loss) that an  adverse event affecting the security of the information or systems would have on the organization.  For example, the data managed by a governmental healthcare service are more sensitive and require  stricter security measures than a service for consulting traffic information.  This process of categorization is called “Risk Profiling” and involves Steps 1 to 4 in the flow diagram  shown before. Its input is the set of assets of the customer, and the output is a category or risk profile.  The steps needed to obtain a risk profile are:  1. Select the set of services (and associated assets) likely to be moved to the Cloud;  2. Select the security dimensions/properties that are relevant for each considered service (e.g.  C-I-A: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability);  3. Evaluate the potential impact to the organization of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and its  likelihood to happen (i.e., impact assessment);  4. Determine the risk category of the service under evaluation;  5. Determine the overall risk profile.  During the risk profiling process, multiple information sources are utilized including risk policies,  security guidelines, best practice documents, etc.  After determining the risk profile, the organization should decide on the architecture. This task, called  “Architectural Model”, encompasses Step 5 in the PLAN workflow, and implies the selection of:  1. A deployment model: Private, Public, Hybrid or Community.  2. A service model: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS  It is worth noting that boundaries of responsibilities between the Gov Cloud customer and CSP vary  significantly depending on the selected service model, being bare minimum in IaaS and more CSP  responsibilities in SaaS models16.  Public organizations must explicitly address compliance to security requirements depending on  whether the Gov Cloud infrastructure is property of and/or is administered by a third party, or it is  owned by the organization itself. If the public administration is also the Gov Cloud owner, then the  verification of adequacy and also the fulfilment of security norms is a specific task for this organization  to perform. However, if a third party owns the infrastructure then compliance requirements must also  be addressed by it.  Another aspect of the deployment-service model is subcontracting. The public administration should  consider if it allows the CSP to subcontract the provided Cloud service. An example would be the case  of a public SaaS provider which computing/storage infrastructure is subcontracted to another public  CSP that offers IaaS. This is called supply chain phenomenon and is very important in cloud offerings  that all compliance, service level obligations and responsibilities should narrow down to the vendors  16 Refer to diagram in the ENISA SME security guide  Example: During the risk profiling process the UK’s Gov Cloud defines three categories (Official,  Secret, Top Secret), to profile the risk associated with the assets to “cloudify” these are based on  the criticality of the information and systems.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  14  and subcontractors in the supply chain.  In summary, the decision of the architectural model serves to  distinguish which security requirements will be under the CSP’s responsibility, and which ones are  going to be managed by the customer.  Note: The step of choosing the architectural model doesn’t exist in the studies Gov Cloud structures in  EU, however it is an important intermediate decision that can deliver clearer results as input for the  next steps i.e. according to the requirements (performance and security)  in service the Cloud owner  should decide on the most cost-efficient and lean cloud solution.  Thus, the governmental organization must identify the list of security requirements associated to its  risk profile, which will be materialized in the DO Phase. This is the last step of the PLAN Phase, called  “Security and Privacy Requirements”, and Step 6 of the workflow contemplates it.  The security and privacy requirements should be categorized (e.g. technical, operational, legal, and  others), and organized according to the actor responsible of fulfilling them (e.g., in-house vs.  outsourced requirements).  What do the different actors have to do in the PLAN phase: a summary of the activities to be  performed by each role during the PLAN phase is presented below.  VO:  Activity  Cloud Customer All six activities comprising the PLAN stage.  Cloud Owner Might support Cloud Customers during the different steps comprising  the PLAN stage. For example, providing information related to the  supported deployment/service models (Step 5). If the cloud owner is  also the cloud customer then should take all the steps of the PLAN  phase.  Cloud Service Provider Usually the potential providers are not involved in this phase. However  the provider might provide information about own resources/services  to fine-tune elicited security and privacy requirements.  Table 3. PLAN: roles and activities.  Example: The Greek Gov Cloud defines a set of baseline requirements for CSP’s based on national  ICT requirements on security and on national law (data protection and privacy requirements).  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  15  3.2.2  DO Phase  The DO phase includes the implementation of the specific security controls or security measures that  are required to fulfil the security requirements elicited during the PLAN stage. Based on the results of  the PLAN phase, the identification of the risk profile for each asset category along with the selection  of the most suitable service and deployment model, the public administration will proceed to  implement the appropriate security measures. The tasks or activities to be carried out during the DO  phase are shown in Figure 4.  As shown there, the initial inputs are both (a) the list of in-house security requirements, and (b) the  list of requirements to be outsourced to the CSP. The workflow is composed of two major activities:  1. “Security Controls”: This task is the first step for this phase and consists of selecting the  appropriate security controls, which are capable of fulfilling the security requirements elicited  in the PLAN phase.  Note: The step of designating security requirements to security controls doesn’t exist in the already  studied Gov Cloud structures in EU, however it is an important intermediate decision that can  deliver clearer results as input for the next steps i.e. specific controls can make easier for the  provider to understand the needs of the customer.  2. “Implementation, Deployment and Accreditation”: This task, which involves Steps 2, 3 and  4, implies the actual formalization and implementation of the selected security controls, as  well as starting the operation of the Gov Cloud service. In-house controls are to be described  in a local policy document, whereas outsourced controls are usually formalized in a SLA (or  some other class of contract). This task also contemplates the ex-ante verification or  accreditation to assess the suitability of a CSP to provide a “good enough” level of assurance  within the Gov Cloud.  Example: In the Spanish Gov Cloud the roles of each actor are identified (client, provider), and the  policy is applied accordingly. The segregation of roles in the scheme is decided by the stakeholders  in collaboration, according to the law provisions.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  16  Figure 4. DO Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  After the activities described above are completed the Cloud service shifts to an operational state,  and its correct implementation (from the security point of view) is assessed during the CHECK Phase.  What do the different actors have to do in the DO phase: a summary of the activities to be performed  by each role during the DO phase is presented below.  Gov Cloud Role  Activity  Cloud Customer Perform all four activities for those requirements to be fulfilled  in-house.  Cloud Owner Mostly in charge of Step 3 (e.g., accreditation of CSP’s), although  could also have responsibility for establishing policies and SLA’s  (Step 2).  Cloud Service Provider Fulfilment of outsourced security controls (Steps 1 and 2),  procedures for accreditation on the Gov Cloud (Step 3), and  operation of the service (Step 4).  Table 4. PLAN: roles and activities.  3.2.3 CHECK Phase  During the CHECK phase the deployed security controls are monitored to verify both their  effectiveness and efficiency. Consequently, the CHECK phase involves two activities:  1. “Log/Monitoring”, which involves the monitoring of activities and evidences for further  analysis and reporting (Step 1).  Example: In Estonia they follow an approach of continuous monitoring and logs are kept only for  specific services.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  17  2. “Audit”, which performs periodic/continuous checks based on the monitored data to assess  if the security controls fulfil the security levels agreed on the SLA’s and contracts (Step 2).  Figure 5. CHECK Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  The CHECK phase might involve some level of automation to monitor the implemented controls,  although the Gov Cloud owner/CSP might also take into account that some of the security controls  usually require humans (e.g., auditors) for the assessment process. If a monitored value deviates  (beyond a threshold) from the agreed objective, then the ACT phase is triggered.  What do the different actors have to do in the CHECK phase: a summary of the activities to be  performed by each role during the CHECK phase is presented below.  Gov Cloud Role  Activity  Cloud Customer Might receive the outputs from both Step 1 and Step 2 (for  outsourced services). In-house services should implement both  Steps 1 and 2.  Cloud Owner Mostly in charge of Step 2, although Step 1 is also in scope  depending on the responsibility shared with the CSP.  Cloud Service Provider Responsible for Step 1 and also involved in Step 2 (along with  the Cloud Owner).  Table 5. CHECK: roles and activities.  3.2.4 ACT Phase  The ACT Phase, summarized by the workflow shown in Figure 6, involves the actions to be taken when  the activities deployed on the CHECK Phase (for continuously monitoring and testing the security of  the system) detect an anomalous event (e.g. a violation of the agreed SLA). Whenever this occurs, the  Gov Cloud owner/CSP will perform a set of remediation actions that might have different  characteristics e.g. change the implementation of a control, negotiate a different SLA with the Cloud  customer etc. In general, the actions taking place during the ACT phase can be grouped under two  tasks:  Example: In Spain they perform internally an audit every two years, and in some extraordinary  cases they perform ad hoc targeted audits. Audit team is created ad hoc and is comprised by  internal or/and external personnel, supervised by an audit leader. The audit team members have  to prove accreditation and/or experience in regard to information systems and security, and a  confidentiality agreement must be signed before the audit.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  18  1. “Changes Management”: this task involves those actions that are related to changes in the  operation of the service, such as for example changes affecting the actual Cloud service  provision and requiring to renegotiate the agreed SLA (e.g. upgrading the encryption system),  or events that may lead to the application of pro-active measures to avoid the actual violation  of the SLA/contract.  2. “Exit Management”: this task involves the finalization of the Cloud service whether voluntarily  or due to other reasons such as SLA violation or poor security performance in the Gov Cloud.  Figure 6. ACT Phase workflow: activities, inputs and outputs.  Example: Extra requirements by the provider have to be considered by the CISO, then approved by  the management board and then implemented (change in the terms of use, all customers accept  etc.)  Example: There is a clause in the Collaboration Agreement related to finalization. Both parties can  ask for termination with one month notice.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  19  What do the different actors have to do in the ACT phase: a summary of the activities to be performed  by each role during the ACT phase is presented below.  Gov Cloud Role  Activity  Cloud Customer Mostly participates on Step 2 (e.g., requesting finalization), and  Step 3 (e.g., upon termination receiving returned data).  Cloud Owner Might participate on all three activities within the ACT stage  (depending on how the responsibility is shared with the CSP’s).  Cloud Service Provider Participates during all three activities within the ACT stage.  Table 6. CHECK: roles and activities.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  20  4 Framework through use cases  This section presents the examples of the developed Gov Cloud security framework, by applying it to  the selected MS use cases of Estonia, Greece, Spain, and United Kingdom.  4.1 Selected use cases  Using the criteria discussed in Section 1.5, this report considered for its analysis four use cases based  on Gov Clouds operating in MS17. This section provides general background information related to  those use cases. The four countries use cases mapped against the framework questionnaire are in  Annex A.  Estonia Greece Spain United Kingdom  Systems in cloud Public  administration  services  Educational and  academic  community  Services of  general and  regional  administration  Service of the  public sector  Deployment  model  Public/Private Public cloud Private Public  Cloud Strategy Yes No Yes Yes  Service model IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS IaaS SaaS IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS  Status of  deployment  In planning phase Deployed Deployed Deployed  4.1.1 Estonia  In 2013, the Government of Estonia took the first steps to deploy a Gov Cloud by consolidating the  networking and datacenter layers in order to develop high-quality and cost-effective services. An  analysis carried out to this end, revealed a set of requirements that resulted on three main principles  guiding the development of the Estonian Gov Cloud:  i. Using Cloud solutions located within Estonia’s national borders,  ii. Using international private Cloud resources, and  iii. Using Data Embassies.  The Estonian government has built the foundation of a highly developed information society, and its  ICT development has taken Estonia to a stage where many registries and services only exist in digital  form. This development requires a flexible and secure Gov Cloud solution, the growth of which and  future capacity requirements cannot be predicted today. Nevertheless, sufficient flexibility has to be  planned in advance. The consolidation of domestic server rooms into standards-compliant  datacenters, flexible involvement of private sector resources (both inside and outside the state’s  borders), and the deployment of the Data Embassy network will create a strong foundation for the  Estonian Gov Cloud. Please note that the governmental cloud is still under development.  17 The use cases were selected at the instance of ENISA for being representative of Gov Cloud adoption and also  for their willingness to provide the needed documentation to conduct the validation.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  21  The “State Infocommunication Foundation” leads the Gov-Cloud development, which is responsible  for the consolidation of server resources and provision of high-quality server hosting services within  Estonia’s national borders.  4.1.2 Greece  The Greek Gov Cloud is comprised of Okeanos18 and ViMa, which are Cloud services provided by the  Greek Research and Technology Network S.A. (GRNET). The Greek Gov Cloud serves to the national  academic and research community in order to promote academic, educational and research aims.  Okeanos is a Cloud service with customers in the academic and research community. Okeanos offers  two main services: Cyclades (a virtual desktop), and Pithos+ (Cloud storage). The ViMa19  (Virtual  Machines) Cloud service provides Virtual Private Servers (VPS) to GRNET peers. ViMa aims to provide  shared computing and network resources to the educational and academic community, with  production-level quality.  In order to be able to ensure high availability, both Okeanos and ViMa are hosted on multiple  computing clusters distributed in several data centres in Greece. The Gov Cloud network  infrastructure ensures seamless connection to the telecommunications backbone (and Internet), at  very high speeds. Okeanos and ViMa are based on open source software.  4.1.3 Spain  The Spanish public administration has taken important steps related to Gov Cloud, by using available  infrastructure and resources. This is the case of SARA (Spanish Public Administrations Network)  Network, which is connected to the TESTA (Trans European Services for Telematics between  Administrations) network deployed by the European Commission. The initial strategy of Spain’s Gov  Cloud was to offer services to the Public Administration as a private CSP. The operation of the SARA  network for delivering Cloud services started in 2010, but further upgrades and new deployments  were made in 2011 and 2013. The SARA project connects and provides services to the General  Administration, as well as to Regional and Local Governments. Currently, SARA offers Cloud services  to the Spanish Public Administration, such as the @firma platform for e-certificate validation.  4.1.4 United Kingdom  The UK Gov Cloud (better known as “G-Cloud”) consists of a framework for the provisioning of Cloud  services to the UK public sector, and a marketplace called CloudStore 20 . The latter is an online  catalogue of Gov Cloud services containing details about CSP’s and their offered Cloud services.  Currently, CloudStore comprises more than 1,200 providers, and approximately 13,000 Cloud services  spread across four types of Cloud service models (“Lots”):  1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)  3. Software as a Service (SaaS)  4. Specialist Cloud Services (SCS)  CSP membership to G-Cloud is based on an accreditation process21, which defines a minimum set of  controls to be implemented by the (prospective) provider. At a glance, the CPS being accredited should  provide information about the offered Cloud service’s interoperability (including supporting  18 Please refer to https://okeanos.grnet.gr/home/  19 Please refer to https://vima.grnet.gr/about/info/en/  20 Please refer to https://www.gov.uk/how-to-use-cloudstore  21 Please refer to https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g-Cloud-service-definitions  https://www.gov.uk/how-to-use-cloudstore  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  22  standards), data portability, extraction and removal. Despite the components of the G-Cloud are  expected to be delivered by multiple CSP’s/organisations, they must be interconnected and available  to all customers, thus creating a single private Cloud.  4.2 Use Cases Validation  During our study, the case studies were used as examples to the security framework introduced in  Section 3. Based on the suggested framework, we mapped these four use cases to indicate the  different approaches each country has followed according to their needs and the national security  requirements. We decided to depict this in a visual way, so that it would be evident how follow the  proposed workflows.  For  each visual we  give an example follow a specific path (indicated in red).  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  23  4.2.1 PLAN phase  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  24  Exemplar uses of the logic model:  On the first activity of the PLAN phase, Risk Profiling, the first step the cloud owner would have to take  is to identify the services they would like to deploy on cloud. For this step we see four different  approaches (one per country use case):   Classification of information assets (nature of assets)   Classification based on data sensitivity (nature and criticality of data)   Classification based on risk– three risk classes- against the three security dimensions  (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) – multi criteria classification   Classification based on predefined security levels (clearly defined security levels in the  strategy)  Following the path of the PLAN phase on the Architectural Model, the specific activity is called  deployment model decision. On this topic the steps on decision making can be split in two different  topics: the cloud service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and the cloud deployment model (public, private,  hybrid etc).  As depicted, none of the four use case countries specifications are in place to make an informative  decision on the cloud model based on the security requirements. The same applied for the  deployment model. In the latter case, the offerings are different in each country and this is defined in  the national cloud strategy (if any).

For this step we present four  different approaches based on the country use cases. The formalisation can be included in:   Publicly available policy document   In internal handling policy   In national regulation   In formal decision by the national security body  In this case there is a sub-step that should be taken into account in this process, namely the handling  of international data. Again here we present four different cases:   The data is marked as sensitive or official and treated accordingly (different procedure for  sensitive data)   International data transferred is not provisioned thus it is not taking place   Specific controls based on the  national data protection framework are implemented and a  specific procedure is followed   Data protection authority has to give confirmation before the transfer takes place.

More specifically a step to be taken towards that approach is monitoring of requirements,  again here we present four different approaches:   Monitoring aspects such as network (traffic) web applications and systems;   No specific requirements for monitoring  open to the customers to decide (non obligatory)   The customer is responsible to decide the approach (obligatory)   Monitoring is continuous  Part of monitoring is the specification of the scope, in this sub-step we define two different  approaches (and countries are divided):   Operational and administrative scope for monitoring   No specified scope  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  29  4.2.4 ACT phase  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  30  Exemplar uses of the logic model:  In the last phase of the logic model, the ACT phase, in one of the two activities, namely exit  management, under the step of contract termination, the approaches noticed are four:   Contracts can have a predefined maximum duration, leaving the customers free to end the  contract whenever they want prior to a 30 days’ notice (as states in the guidelines).   The customer can request termination of contract and ask the data to be removed (following  a specific data migration plan including logs, metadata etc) .   Finalisation has to be agreed by both parties of the collaboration agreement   No specific provision is applicable.  Security Framework for Governmental Clouds  All steps from design to deployment  February 2015  Page  31  5 Conclusions  This report proposed a security framework for Gov Clouds, structured through the widely used Plan- Do-Check-Act security cycle. The presented framework was developed based on comprehensive  research that included coverage of relevant state of the art/practice, and was also iteratively validated  thanks to the valuable feedback from Gov Cloud experts in the four selected use cases (Estonia,  Greece, Spain, and United Kingdom).  The main conclusions drawn from the report are:   Despite considerable efforts from the EC, ENISA and other international organisations and  market actors (e.g. CSP’s) the level of adoption of Gov Clouds is still low. Some EU MS have  already defined a Cloud strategy, some others show a tactical or opportunistic adoption of  Cloud services, but very few (actually only UK and Spain) have defined and implemented a  national wide Cloud strategy. This security framework will be one more reason to support the  systematic adoption of Cloud security strategies and actual governmental cloud deployment.   The report’s analysis made evident that “common security denominators” exist across the MS  deployed Gov Clouds, in particular related to aspects like defined roles, use of standards, and  adopted security controls. It is our expectation that the discovered commonalities will be the  basis to develop homogeneous security best practices, SLA’s and contracts for Gov Clouds in  the short term.   The analysis of the input collected from Estonia, Greece, Spain and UK also shows that these  Gov Clouds apply different practices in the registration of evidences, selection of monitoring  tools, SLA violation management, types and frequency of performed audits, and accreditation  procedures.   From the consideration of change-management practices, all the use cases portend  mechanisms for the continuous improvement of the implemented security frameworks  (policies, mechanisms).   The analysed Gov Clouds have established policies for incident management. However, the  adopted approaches do not directly appear under the ACT phase, but are scattered among  the other stages of the framework. This means that incident management is not only one step  in the lifecycle but is a horizontal activity that has to be considered in all different stages.   The security framework proposed in this report (a) encompasses the analysed Gov Clouds,  and (b) is projected to be flexible for extension and adaptation to new security needs and  requirements from other Gov Clouds in the EU. This was demonstrated by its empirical  validation through four selected use cases. This framework is also meant to be used during  the design phase of new Gov Clouds, as it contains specific guidance related to different  security features/best-practices that should be taken into account by practitioners and Cloud  security architects. On the other hand, the framework can be also used by existing Gov Clouds  as a baseline for analysing side-by-side different deployments from MS.  In summary, this novel framework for Gov Clouds should become part of the public administrations’  toolbox when planning their migration to the Cloud, and when assessing the effectiveness of the  deployed security controls and procedures.

    "abstract": "ENISA after having analysed the present state of play of governmental Cloud deployment in 2013 report, presents a guide on the steps public administration has to take to deploy cloud computing. This report gives guidance on the process from pre-procurement till finalisation and exit from a cloud contract, explaining which are the steps to take when focusing on security and privacy. It offers example approaches, based on four already deployed governmental cloud models in a national level namely: Estonia, Greece, Spain and United Kingdom. As this report is not only a guide but also a tool, in the Annex the reader will find the actual questionnaire template to use."

It defines trust services for supporting  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  website authentication.  The eIDAS Regulation represented a big step forward in building a digital single market as it provides one  common legal framework for all parties relying or providing on those kind of services. Indeed, various  sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing economy, trading, etc.)  where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication, legal certainty of  evidences, will clearly be positively affected by the eIDAS Regulation. This latter will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to meet such obligations for any (cross-border) electronic  transaction as they will now be able to use the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services. In  particular, a qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature  and, when based on a qualified certificate issued in one Member State, shall be recognised as a qualified  electronic signature in all other Member States.  This document addresses qualified electronic signatures and is one out of a series of five documents which  target to assist parties aiming to use qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, eDelivery or  website authentication certificates to understand the subject correctly as-well-as the potential benefits,  amongst others, by giving examples of possible application. This series of documents also targets to give  those parties some advice on how to correctly use the related (qualified) trust services.  After explaining what a qualified eSignature is and what properties/function it does and does not provide,  concrete examples of use are given for inspiration to the readers. Next to them, and as even the most  secure / trusted service becomes insecure and unreliable if not being integrated or used correctly, some  key recommendations are given for correct integration and use, pertaining:   Both the signatory and the relying party should look for the EU trust mark for qualified trust  services when selecting providers.   The relying party shall follow the applicable Certification Authority’s terms and conditions  and/or other contractual documentation.   The first level of augmentation consists in time-stamping the signature   In a signature with Long Term Validation Data, the set of validation material or references to it  should be sufficient to ascertain the validation status of all end-entity certificates contained in  the signature.   Before algorithms, keys, and other cryptographic data used at the time a signature was built  become weak and the cryptographic functions become vulnerable, or the certificates  supporting previous time stamp tokens expire or are revoked, the signed data, the signature as  well as any additional information should be protected by applying time stamp tokens.   QES services should be further supported by ancillary qualified trust services.   The relying party should verify that the provider is duly qualified is to check its presence in the  trusted list of the Member State where it operates.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  07  1. Introduction  1.1 General context/the eIDAS Regulation on eID and trust services  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 ([1], hereafter the eIDAS2 Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a predictable regulatory environment  for electronic identification and a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time  stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication.  It is possible to use these trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess  these electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  Whether you a large company, a SME or a citizen willing to complete an electronic transaction in another  EU country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in another EU Member State (MS), besides  reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure  cross-border recognition of national eID and electronic trust  services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence, it  will boost trust, security and convenience.  Since 1st July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation  are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member States’ legal  framework overcoming problems of fragmented national  regimes. It provides legal certainty and fosters the usage of  eID means and electronic trust services for online access  and online transactions at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability  across borders and are considered equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  1.2 Opportunities brought by eIDAS Regulation  An array of opportunities resides in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making  national and cross-border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and  benefiting from legal certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.  OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73–114.  2 See Glossary.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  08  To this end, various sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication,  legal certainty of evidences, will be  positively affected. The eIDAS  Regulation indeed allows citizens,  businesses and public administrations to  conveniently meet such obligations for  any cross-border electronic transaction  using the recognised eID means and  (qualified) trust services of their choice.  Without undergoing identity verification  based on physical presence, but by using  MS notified eID means of a level “high”,  one should for example be able to use  public services in another country or  banks may accept such eID to open a  bank account3.  By relying on a qualified  time stamp, one will benefit, across the  EU, from the presumption of the  accuracy of the date and the time it  indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  1.3 Specific role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  1.4 Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations4.  3 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  4 See glossary  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  09  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service  output, e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so-called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list5. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from  inception until termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.  Note: A TSP cannot be qualified without providing at least one qualified trust service (cfr Art.3.20 of the  eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust service  covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the provisioning of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status for the issuance of qualified time stamps; it  must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and have its granted qualified status for the  provision of qualified time stamp published explicitly in the national trusted list before issuing qualified  time stamps in addition to the provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures. There are nine  different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS Regulation for which a qualified status is granted  separately: provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures, provision of qualified certificates  for electronic seals, provision of qualified certificates for website authentication, qualified preservation  service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals,  qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified validation service for qualified  electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps services, and qualified electronic registered delivery  services.6  7  5 See glossary.  6 See Annex A.7 for further details.  7 See Annex A.7 for further details.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  10  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.8  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified services that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met.  Figure 1: EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark9, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit the  competent supervisory body with a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an  accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  1.5 A focus on qualified electronic signatures  Today, it is possible to electronically sign data and to achieve the same effects as when using a hand- written signature. Such electronic signatures that benefit from a full legal recognition thanks to the eIDAS  Regulation are called qualified electronic signatures.  8 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 128, 23.5.2015, p. 13–15.  9 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark for more guidance on the use of that trust  mark, downloadable images, user manual and answers to frequently asked questions.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2015.128.01.0013.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  11  The eIDAS Regulation addresses various services  that can be used to support different types of  electronic transactions and electronic signatures  in particular.  Beside the legal framework, the technical  framework is nowadays very mature. Citizens  routinely sign data electronically e.g. when they use a credit card or debit card to make a payment.  The use of qualified electronic signatures should help the development of online business and services in  Europe by securing online transactions and services in Europe and beyond in many sectors: e-business, e- administration, e-banking, online games, e-services, online contracts, etc.  1.6 Scope of the present document and relationship with other recommendations  This document proposes security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures. The  objective of the document is to support relying parties and end users of qualified electronic signature  services to securely use these services.  The target audience of the document are end users and relying parties of qualified electronic signature  services. This could comprise individuals, businesses and public administrations. For example, it could be a  public administration that wishes to use qualified electronic signatures for their electronic interactions  with citizens, and which would like to ensure it is utilizing these services:   In compliance with the eIDAS Regulation.   In a proper and secure manner that guarantees that the security properties of the service are  maintained.  The structure of the document, from the next sections, is organised to provide information and guidance  with regards to the following aspects of qualified electronic signature:   What is it?   What key properties does it provide?   What properties can it not provide?   What are the potential use cases?   What are the usage best practices?   Example of tools & practical usage aspects.  Four other linked documents propose security guidelines on the appropriate use respectively of qualified  electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps, qualified website authentication certificates and  qualified electronic registered delivery.10  Although each of these qualified trust services share some technical backgrounds or tools and thus provide  some common functionalities, such as those illustrated below, each of them has its own objectives and  core functionalities as summarised in the following table:  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services.

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  13  2. Qualified electronic signature – what is it?  2.1 Legal definition of (qualified) electronic signatures  The eIDAS Regulation defines an electronic signature as “data in electronic form which is attached to or  logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign”.  A signature is “generated” by a signatory, possibly “augmented” (i.e. completed with related proofs or  evidences – see section 6), “validated” by the receiver of the signed data (so-called “relying party”), and  possibly preserved, in some cases for a long term.  The way these features are used determines the level of strength, assurance and longevity of the qualified  signatures. In particular, TSPs, qualified or not, can be called for the qualified signature creation,  validation and/or preservation.  Looking at the definition above, as such, an electronic signature can be created using many technologies,  ranging from the extremely weak (such as pasting a scanned signature image in a document) to the very  strong (such as signing using an electronic identity card protected by a fingerprint).  Electronic signatures are created by an electronic signature creation device, which is defined in the eIDAS  Regulation as “a configured software or hardware used to create an electronic signature by means of an  ‘electronic signature creation data’ (i.e. “a unique data which is used by the signatory to create an  electronic signature”)”.  In these definitions, the “unique data” is to be seen as a personal element that belongs to the signatory  and that can be compared to the very personal behaviour of a signatory signing in the paper world (i.e. the  graphics, speed, pressure that make that a signature can be unambiguously linked to a person). In the  same way that signatory keeps these elements private in the paper word, the electronic signature creation  data also needs to be protected in the electronic world. Typically, it will be securely stored on a device (e.g.  a smart card like a bank card) that can be activated by its owner only, e.g. by means of a PIN code, or  biometry (e.g. fingerprint).  Electronic signatures in general shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal  proceedings. Within the electronic signature family, the eIDAS Regulation defines subsets of electronic  signatures that provide increasing legal predictability up to a level, the qualified electronic signature, which  benefits from the legal equivalence to handwritten signatures:   the electronic signature (presented above)   the advanced electronic signature (AdES) – which requires some security features that ensure it is  uniquely linked to the signatory, it is capable of identifying the signatory and it is linked to the data in  such a manner that any subsequent change of the data is detectable   the qualified electronic signature (QES) – which is an advanced electronic signature which provides  additional level of assurance on the identity of the signatory and an enhanced protection and level of  assurance on the signature creation. A special device is required for the creation of QES (a qualified  signature creation device, QSCD).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  14  Figure 3: Types of electronic signatures  A QES shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature and shall be recognised as a  qualified electronic signature in all Member States.  This equivalence is gained from the fact that qualified electronic signatures are supported by i) trustworthy  process technology, similar to advanced electronic signatures, ii) qualified electronic signature creation  devices and iii) qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) which are supervised by EU MS appointed  supervisory bodies.  2.2 Public Key Cryptography as technical foundations for (Q)ES  In the current state of the art, QES are implemented by means of asymmetric cryptography. With this  technology, each signatory owns a key pair made of a private and a public key (the technology is called the  public key cryptography) and the so produced electronic signatures are called digital signatures.  The signature creation and verification process as follows:  1. The signatory uses the private key to sign a text:  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  15  Figure 4: Digitally signing data with a private key to produce an electronic signature  The private key is in fact a secret code used by a mathematical function in order to render a data  unintelligible (i.e. encrypt data). In the illustration the data is put in a box closed by the padlock. The  private key corresponds to the so-called ‘signature creation data’ as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.  In the paper world the “private key” concept can be compared to the unique behaviour of the signatory;  what distinguishes a handwritten signature is the speed, the pressure, the graphic, that are in theory  only reproducible by the signatory.  2. The verifier (also called relying party in the eIDAS Regulation) uses the signatory’s public key to verify  the signature:  Figure 5: Verifying a signature with sender’s public key.  The public key is in fact a code used by the reverse mathematical function to retrieve the initial data  from the encrypted data. In the illustration the data is retrieved from the box thanks to the public key.  In the paper world the “public key” concept can be compared to an “official” example of a signature that  a verifier can compare with a received signature.  The verification of a signature with a certain public key means that the signature was computed with the  corresponding private key (in the illustration the public key can only open one particular padlock). Only the  signatory in possession of the private key can be at the origin of the signature. As a consequence, the  person that owns the private key matching the public key (i.e. the signatory) cannot deny to be at the  origin of such signature; this non-repudiation feature is the foundation of any signature (electronic or  paper-based).  Another characteristic of digital signatures is that if the signed text has been modified after the signature,  the verification of the signature will fail (because the signature computation mixed the private key and the  data to be signed the verification computation will always disclose the very same data).  (In the illustration  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  16  the data in the box cannot be retrieved or replaced or modified by other data until the box is opened). As a  consequence, successful signature verification also ensures data integrity.  Of course, there are some technical tricks to ensure that only the person that owns the private key  matching the public key is able to create the signature (and not a third person that would be able to  imitate the signatory’s signature):   it is likely impossible to discover the private key from the knowledge of the public key. Any  stakeholder in possession of a public key is able to verify that a signed data has been made by the  corresponding private key, without being able to play the role of the signatory since (s)he cannot  guess the private key. The size of the key is an important parameter for the security of the algorithm.   A different unique key pair is allocated to each signatory.   The signatory shall protect the private key (in the same way as (s)he would not explain to third party  how to imitate her signature).  2.3 Certification services as trust foundation for (Q)ES  The technical foundations presented above, alone, are not sufficient to ensure the full confidence in the  system. Indeed, trust in signatures relies on the guarantee that a certain Public Key belongs to a particular  signatory, owner (and sole controller) of the corresponding private key. For this purpose, an entity, trusted  by the community, called a certification authority (also called a Certification Service Provider, CSP, which is  a particular type of TSP as defined in the eIDAS Regulation), certifies the link {public key – signatory} in a  public key certificate. In general, one finds the information on the identity of the signatory in the  certificate, and sometimes one can also find other attributes relating to this person, such as his/her role  within an organisation.  Figure 6: A digital certificate  The certificate is a signed statement by the CA; the CA’s signature is trusted because the CA’s key is  published in a media trusted by the community (the official journal, e.g.). The procedures, techniques and  mechanisms put in place to realise such certification services is commonly called Public Key Infrastructure  (or PKI). The certificate officialises the link between a signatory and its key pair in the same way an identity  card officialises the link between a citizen and his/her handwritten signature represented on the card.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  17  The trust in certificates relies on the quality of the CA and its certification services. The CA must follow  sound policies: strong cryptography, secure CA premises and devices, signature creation devices for  signatories of a good quality, trusted personnel, insurances, etc.  It also relies in the possibility to revoke certificates that are not trusted anymore and to publish revocation  status (i.e. black list of revoked certificates) to verifying parties (i.e. validation services). This can happen if  the signatory has lost his/her signature creation device and fears that someone uses it to impersonate  him/her.  Finally, trust in CA policies relies on the level of assurance that the CA indeed correctly implements these  policies. For this purpose, the CA can be audited.  2.4 The electronic signature process  The signature creation workflow  A signatory, to create a signature in a document, works in a certain environment (e.g. a laptop) to access  signing functionalities made of:  a. the signature creation application (e.g. a pdf application residing on the laptop) and  b. the signature creation device that  i. holds the signature creation data (private key);  ii. shall be able to authenticate the signatory (to guarantee his/her sole control on the  private key);  iii. computes the signature (using the signer's signature creation data);  iv. may hold the signing certificate (or unambiguous references to it).  Figure 7: Signature creation process  Concretely, how does it work?  1. The signatory prepares the document like any kind of document (e.g. a PDF file).  2. The application prepares the data to be signed (i.e. the PDF) in a condensate (called a hash) and  present it to the signature creation device.  3. The signature creation device asks the authorisation to the signatory to sign the data, in general,  though a windows that pops up on the screen. The signatory authenticates to the device (e.g. (s)he  enters a PIN code, or a fingerprint).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  18  4. The signature creation device computes the signature and sends the result to the application that  integrates the signature into the document.  At this stage, it is important to note that in general, the signatory’s certificate is provided with the  signature. This enables the identification of the signatory and the verification of the signature since the  public key is immediately available from the certificate. If there are attributes relating to the signatory in  the certificate, one can also validate these attribute(s) (e.g. the person may sign in quality of director of an  organisation and this title is certified), but nothing prevents the signatory to (also) add a sentence in the  signed document that says “I'm signing in quality of director”. This is a self-claim similar to what is done in  the paper world.  The augmentation for more resilience  Augmenting signatures is the process by which certain material (e.g. time stamps, validation data and even  archival-related material) is incorporated to the signatures for making them more resilient to change or for  enlarging their longevity.  The augmentation can be done either by the signatory, or by the relying party or by a TSP that validates or  preserve the signature on behalf of the signatory or the relying party. E.g. if someone asks another person  to sign an acknowledgement of debt, it is likely to be the case that the first person has some interest in the  preservation of the signature (which is not necessarily the case of the signatory). On the contrary, if the  signature is not verified immediately by the relying party, the signatory may have some interest in  completing the signature, e.g., with a trusted time stamp in order to provide a trusted evidence of the  signing time. By this way it will be difficult for the relying party to reject the signature in case of a  subsequent problem with regard to the signature (e.g. expiration of the signing certificate).  2.5 Qualified electronic signatures  As mentioned above, qualified electronic signatures enjoy, all over the EU, the equivalent legal effect of a  handwritten signature.  To achieve a QES, the eIDAS Regulation requires a qualified signature creation device (i.e. a signature  creation device that follows the requirements listed in the eIDAS Regulation and will be certified  accordingly).  In addition, the eIDAS Regulation also requires a qualified certificate for electronic signatures: the qualified  certificate follows the requirements listed in the eIDAS Regulation, and the issuing CA will be a qualified  trust service provider. Pursuant to the eIDAS Regulation, the CA will be audited and if the Member State in  which the CA is established receives a suitable audit report and verifies the eIDAS requirements, the CA  will be listed as qualified trust service provider in the corresponding national trusted list.   Qualified certificates for electronic signatures provides high assurance of the identity of the  signatory   QSCDs provide high assurance on the security of the signature  Moreover, the eIDAS Regulation offers the possibility to use qualified trust services (QTS) for the  validation and/or the preservation of QES. Such services are offered by QTSPs.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  19  There is no obligation to call such QTS for the validation or the preservation of (qualified) signature, but as  any other qualified service, their use provide the users with a pretty good legal protection (i.e. in case of  litigation the burden of the proof lies on the QTPS).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  20  3. Qualified electronic signature – what key properties does it provide?  3.1 Legal properties  Signing with the same legal value as with a handwritten signature  As presented above, QES benefit from a full legal recognition thanks to the eIDAS Regulation to achieve the  same effects as when using a hand-written signature.  Such electronic signatures thanks to the obligations set by the eIDAS Regulation on both the TSP managing  them (in particular the CAs) and on the underlying technologies: warrant data integrity, identify the  signatory with a high level of certainty, and ensure the non-repudiation of signing.  At this stage, it is important to note that like handwritten signature, (qualified) electronic signatures are  created by human beings (i.e. natural persons). Indeed, under the eIDAS Regulation, a legal person is not  legally permitted to electronically sign. Rather, the eIDAS Regulation allows legal persons to electronically  seal data. The concept of electronic seal for legal persons is very similar to the concept of electronic  signature for natural persons and is the topic of dedicated security guidelines within the series.  3.2 Security properties  Data integrity  As mentioned in the introduction, the use of public key cryptography to implement QES (and AdES in  general) ensures data integrity (i.e. any change in the signed data after the signature process is detected).  Data origin authentication  The use of public key cryptography to implement QES (and AdES in general) warrants the proof of origin of  the signed data since only the person in possession of the private key can be at the point of origin of data  signed with the corresponding public key. For QES, in addition, there is a high level of assurance on the  identity of the person owning such private key (see below).  3.3 Functional Properties  Non-repudiation of signing  As mentioned in the introduction, the use of public key cryptography to implement QES (and AdES in  general) provides for non-repudiation of having signed.  Secure identification of the signatory  The qualified digital certificate ensures the identification of signatory with a very high level of assurance,  thanks to the controls of the TSP on one hand, but also thanks to the requirements on the content of the  signatory’s certificate imposed by the eIDAS Regulation.  Creating huge amount of signatures and/or signatures on huge data  The involvement of a human being signatory is not always needed when electronically signing; signing (it  applies to QES but more broadly for any type of AdES) may be an automated process. E.g. a director of a  hospital, may have to sign hundreds of documents per day. To ease her/his life, his/her signature creation  device may be implemented on server where the private key stays activated for several hours; provided  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  21  the data to be signed submission process is secure, as well as the access to the server, a perfectly valid  signature can be created without the need to enter the director’s PIN code for each and every signature  applied.  Also, a signature can be applied to data of any type and any size; a contract in a pdf format, e.g. will only  require one single electronic signature to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the whole file. No  need to sign each and every page like in the paper world, by virtue of the data integrity featured by the  Public Key Cryptography technology underlying QES.  3.4 Other Properties  Signing with a signature that is understood and verifiable worldwide  Basic signatures, like non-qualified AdES, benefit from the non-discrimination rule. This means that a Court  in an EU Member State cannot reject them automatically as being invalid simply because they are in  electronic form. However, their dependability is still lower than that of a QES because the signatory may  be required to prove the security of the technology being used if the validity of the signature is disputed  before a court. This requires significant costs and efforts that could be avoided with relative ease by opting  for the more established and standardised advanced and qualified signature solutions. It may also be the  case that the relying parties have no applications or tools to validate such signature, when not based on  standards; in such a scenario, the signature may be legally valid and technologically robust, but of limited  use.  For these interoperability reasons, QES that are based on recognised EU standards are preferable unless  the parties operate purely in a local context where the acceptance and usability of the chosen signature  solution is sufficiently certain.  Beyond the technical interoperability, the eIDAS Regulation also ensures the (international) recognition of  electronic signatures. See also the “FAQ” on this topic.  Signing “in quality of”  It is possible to certify elements that are bound to the signatory such as a title (e.g. Director), a link with its  employer, etc. Because the QCA is trusted for verifying the information it certifies, the Relying Party can  get a high level of confidence in such information conveyed with the signature through the signatory’s  certificate.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  22  4.  Qualified electronic signature – what properties can it not provide?  4.1 Legal properties not provided by QES  “Signature” by a legal person  As mentioned above (qualified) electronic signatures are performed by human beings (i.e. natural  persons).  It is not possible for an organisation or a legal person to create a (qualified) electronic signature. Rather,  they will use another concept introduced by the eIDAS Regulation, namely the (qualified) electronic seal.  Granting that the content of the signed data is meaningful, fair or true  Exactly like in the paper world, it is not because a contract is signed that the terms of the contract are fair.  4.2 Security properties not provided by QES  Confidentiality  The signature protocol used alone does not provide confidentiality, although the Public Key Cryptography  can be used to offer encryption. Indeed, if the signature process presented above is reverted (i.e. someone  is using the public key of a recipient to encrypt a text), then only the recipient that owns the  correspondent private key can decrypt the text.  Like for electronic signature, a certificate attesting the link between the recipient and its key pair is to be  provided by a TSP (i.e. a CA).  One needs to superpose the two protocols to achieve electronic signature and confidentiality. First the  signatory signs and then (s)he may encrypt the signed document to the attention of a recipient, provided  (s)he has the encryption certificate of this person. If the signed document needs to be sent to many  recipients, then the encryption protocol needs to be repeated as many times as there are recipients.  4.3 Functional properties not offered by QES  Time stamping  Although the technique underlying the (Q)ES can be used by a special sort of “signatory” (i.e. a time  stamping authority), a QES does not provide any proof on the signing time; unless a trusted timestamp is  added to the signature (see below), the time that is appended to a QES is a self-declaration from the  signatory and not an official proof.  4.4 Other properties not offered by QES  Management of delegation  The relying party verifying a signature will not necessarily be ensured that the signatory is authorised to  sign (e.g. to commit in the name of a certain organisation). Again this problem is not unique to electronic  signatures; it exists in paper signatures as well (and arguably more so, since electronic signatures can more  easily convey highly trustworthy identity information).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  23  Electronic signatures do permit the implementation of solutions to this problem by incorporating  authorisation management solutions. It is also possible to certify, in the certificate, elements that are  bound to the signatory such as a title (e.g. Director), a link with its employer, etc. However, this is not  provided by default. And it is not because the title Director is certified that the director is effectively  empowered to sign any type of commitments in the name of the organisation (s)he represents.  Eternal integrity  There is no guarantee that the content of the signed document cannot be changed if (long term)  preservation features are not implemented (see BASIC / RECOMMENED / ENANCED below).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  24  5. Qualified electronic signature – what are the potential use cases?  5.1 Overview and context of the given examples  In general and to put qualified electronic signatures into context, they only provide signatures.  As  mentioned above, they do not establish the exact time on when the document was signed, they do not  necessarily provide the commitment of a potential legal entity behind the signatory, and they do not  confirm delivery of the signed message. Hence, qualified electronic signatures (QES) are most often seen  coming in addition of other identification and/or trust services as part of a broader solution.  In this context, and although the properties of QES have been described in the previous sections, the  following properties are key for the use case examples mentioned below:   QES to establish the originator of a signed document.   QES to provide integrity of a signed document.   QES to provide non-repudiation of having signed document.  Those properties allow several “types of use cases” which can be applied in many areas of application as  show in the present section. The table below highlight the identified types of use cases. The mapping on  areas of applications in no way tries to be exhaustive but only tries to indicate the huge potential of QES.

Indeed, in the days of phishing it is for  many people very difficult to see if a  document or a message really originates  from where it seems to come from.  Applying qualified electronic signatures on  documents/messages can easily and  swiftly provide a solution for this.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  25  Examples of concrete application are:   B2B: Organisations can easily introduce as practice to start signing, with QES, all their outgoing  documents and messages and other hand validate incoming messages/documents.   G2C: Governments should make it a standard to have outgoing documents/messages either using  qualified electronic seals (cfr the eSeals Guideline document) or qualified electronic signatures.  5.3 Signing of a document/declaration  People or organisations can use QES to sign documents/declarations when submitting them e.g. to  government as proof of their  authenticity/origin and their  endorsement of the content non- repudiation.  This provides a  significant amount of time as, in  contrast to filling in forms and/or  putting things on paper, people can  now prepare their declaration fully  electronically signed (with QES) and  submit them in one single digital  flow.  Examples of concrete application are:   C2C/C2B: One person giving e.g. a relative or an accountant a mandate for a month.   B2G: Submitting declarations to government (which needs to be signed by mandated person).  5.4 Signing a (commercial) proposal  A SME might choose to use qualified electronic signatures for the submission of bids in public  procurement. This is an area which  is traditionally mired by large  amounts of paperwork that creates  significant efforts and costs that  could easily be diminished, while  increasing the reliability of the  process, through the application of  qualified electronic signatures.  Examples of concrete application are:   B2C:  Companies using signing of proposals/offers towards their (potentials) clients (endorsing thereby  the proposals).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  26   B2G: Companies participating in the eProcurement-process of government and being more and more  obliged to submit their offer electronically.  5.5 Signing of an official document/attestation  Certain government documents have to be signed by an official instead of by an administration (the later  would be an electronic seal for which we refer to the respective other document in this series). In the day  and age of qualified electronic signatures, it is no longer needed to do all this on paper. Officials can  (depending on the specific form factors obliged by law) generate official documents/attestations and sign  them electronically.  Examples of concrete application are:   G2C: Creation/signing of e-permits or an attestation of residence.   G2B: Creation/signing of VAT-attestations, signing of custom documents, etc.  5.6 Signing of a legal consent / an eMandate / …  In many cases, one needs to know if a client agrees with the terms and conditions, or opts into certain  services, or consents with certain processing of his/her data or gives a mandate to a third party to act on  his/her/its behalf.  Especially when entering into a relationship (not being in a closed system yet) or when  e.g. mandate with might have effect on third parties need to be given the use of qualified electronic  signatures is advisable or even mandatory.  Examples of concrete application are:   B2C: Signing of the general terms and conditions when becoming a client of a bank   B2B: Giving an accountant a mandate to act on one’s behalf and to do financial transfers on one’s  behalf.  5.7 Signing of a contract  The number of cases in which contracts are being concluded between parties is huge.  Such processes  could be accelerated and rendered way more efficiently if they could be digitized and supported by  electronic signatures ensuring legal certainty and equivalence to hand written signatures. This is exactly  what a qualified electronic signature now allows.  Parties can sign contracts and exchange them 24/7 and  across borders in Europe whilst being certain of the legal recognition of the electronic signatures.  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B: A person signing a rental or buying agreement.   B2B: A company subscribing to an insurance contract.   B2G: Signing off for a government project-start.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  27  6. Qualified electronic signature – what are the usage best practices?  6.1 Security Guidelines & Levels  In this section, we propose recommendations, through existing best practices, according to three levels  which represent the “strength/rigorousness” with which qualified electronic signature services should be  applied in a specific context. This “strength/rigorousness” of course depends on the use case or type of  application / environment in which qualified time stamping services are being applied. Dimensions that  could have an impact on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality  of the processes and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the  respective qualified trust service.  This, every organization has to determine for itself based on a risk  assessment.  For inspiration possible mapping of basic/recommended/enhanced vs business criticality  and/or data protection is being given in Annex B.  In short the three levels of recommendations are in increasing order (whereby the higher level suppose  that the lower level is also taken into account):  BASIC for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with normal  levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in implementing  trust services (technology).  RECOMMENDED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with  important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  ENHANCED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with data of  sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  6.2 BASIC  When looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of security  and legal certainty of trust services. Qualified electronic signatures enjoy, all over the EU, the equivalent  legal effect of a handwritten signature.  As a basic recommendation, both the signatory and the relying party should look for the EU trust mark  for qualified trust services when selecting providers. In addition, the relying party shall follow the  applicable CA’s terms and conditions11 and/or other contractual documentation.  Such documentation may be accessible via the certificate itself: e.g. a PDS, that is an instrument of  disclosure and notice by a TSP, can be found from a link present in the signatory’s certificate in all  certificates issued by CAs conforming to the ETSI standards designed to support the eIDAS Regulation (see  [2]). In general, the CA will ask the relying party to validate the revocation status of the certificate against  its validation status information services (also accessible from links provided within the certificates). It is  11 Essentially Certification Practice Statement (CPS) and Certificate Policies (CP)  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  28  important to note that most applications available on the market perform such validation automatically. In  particular, to comply with best practices and with the eIDAS requirement for the validation of qualified  electronic signatures (article 32) that request the confirmation that the certificate was valid at the time of  signing.  As a fundamental recommendation, a signatory shall never share its signature activation data (e.g. PIN  number).  6.3 RECOMMENDED  Augmenting signatures is the process by which certain material (e.g. time stamps, validation data and even  archival-related material) is incorporated to the signatures for making them more resilient to change or for  enlarging their longevity. Indeed, when the signature needs to be validated after its creation it is necessary  to check, e.g., that the certificate was not revoked at the time of the signature. If a revocation occurred  between the time of the signature and the time of validation, the verifier needs to be sure that the  signature was created BEFORE that time of revocation. The augmentation can be done either by the  signatory, or by the relying party or by a TSP that validates or preserve the signature on behalf of the  signatory or the relying party. E.g. if someone asks another person to sign an acknowledgement of debt, it  is likely to be the case that the first person has some interest in the preservation of the signature (which is  not necessarily the case of the signatory). On the contrary, if the signature is not verified immediately by  the relying party, the signatory may have some interest in completing the signature, e.g., with a trusted  time stamp in order to provide a trusted evidence of the signing time. By this way it will be difficult for the  relying party to reject the signature in case of a subsequent problem with regard to the signature (e.g.  expiration of the signing certificate).  It is recommended that the first level of augmentation consists in time-stamping the signature.  Typically, the date of signing will be indicated in the signed document, at least if this plays a role in its legal  value or legal meaning but this may not be sufficient. For electronic documents, time stamping is a  possibility to avoid risks of tampering. An electronic time stamp is a data in electronic form which binds  other electronic data to a particular time establishing evidence that this data existed at that time. Time  stamping the signature provides the proof that it was created before the date indicated in the electronic  time stamp. This allows the verifier to position the date of the creation with regard to the date of a  possible revocation. This is not a condition sine qua non, but implementing it will remove a risk, support  validation, and enhance legal certainty.  In a signature with Long Term Validation Data, the set of validation material or references to it is  sufficient to ascertain the validation status of all end-entity certificates (signer certificate, time stamps  certificates, attribute certificates, etc.) contained in the signature.  There can be more elements than necessary and can also be fewer elements than necessary if it is  expected that recipients have an alternative mean of obtaining relevant proofs of existence on these  elements.  Before algorithms, keys, and other cryptographic data used at the time a signature was built become  weak and the cryptographic functions become vulnerable, or the certificates supporting previous time  stamp tokens expire or are revoked, the signed data, the signature as well as any additional information  should be protected by applying time stamp tokens.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  29  Such additional time stamp tokens are called archive validation data. The time stamping process should be  repeated in time before the protection provided by a previous time stamp token becomes weak and  should make use of stronger algorithms or longer key lengths than those that have been used in the  original signatures or time stamp tokens. These evidences added to the signature are often called Long- Term Validation Data.  6.4 ENHANCED  It is recommended that QES is further supported by ancillary qualified trust services.  Either for the simple validating of the QES, but also for its augmentation according to the term of  preservation, it is possible to request the support of qualified services:   qualified timestamps (as defined in Article 42 of the eIDAS Regulation)   qualified validation of QES (as defined in Article 33 of the eIDAS Regulation)   qualified preservation of QES (as defined in Article 34 of the eIDAS Regulation).  The way to verify that the provider is duly qualified is to check its presence in the trusted list of the  Member State where it operates. The presence of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services on the CPS  web site or folders is also a good indicator.  There is no obligation to call such QTS for the validation or the preservation of signature, but as any other  Qualified Service, their use provides users with a pretty good legal protection (i.e. in case of litigation the  burden of the proof lies on the QTPS).  Note:  Importance of evidences and proofs in case of disputes  In case of a dispute over an electronic signature message, one needs to look at all available evidences in  order to validate the signature and resolve the dispute.  The issues of the dispute may for example be that the signer denies having performed the signature at all,  or that the signer acknowledges having performed the signature, but for a different message, etc. Most of  the technical evidence can be found in the signed message and in documents that it refers to, such as the  certificate, the certification practices statement published by the CA (CPS) and the possibly used signature  policy, as described below. However, it should be noted that the signature may also require evidence of  the context in which the signature was created. For example, regardless of all technical evidence, the  signatory may still have been deceived or forced by violence to sign, or the signatory may not have  understood the document (e.g. it needs to be established that the document was written in a language  understandable to the signer).  Evidence present in the signature  Digital signatures generally bear with them a series of pieces of evidence, provided they are correctly  formatted (the reader may read CEN 419 040 for more detailed info). E.g. an unambiguous reference to  the signer’s certificate (the certificate itself or a reference to it), a time stamp and a certificate status  information that proves that the certificate was valid at the claimed time of signature-creation, etc. The  signature may also contain:   A commitment type, indicating the purpose of the signature.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  30   A location indicator, specifying the claimed location of the signatory,   A role under which the signature is applied,   A reference to the Signature Policy under which the signature is to be validated (see below)  The qualified certificate contains the following additional pieces of evidence:   a reference to the Certificate Policy and/or Certificate Practice Statement followed by the CA when  issuing the certificate (amongst other describing the security procedures for the CA, for example  relating to the protection of the signing key of the CA, the registration of the signatory, etc.);   different information to enquire about the validity status of the certificate (links toward Online  Certification Status Protocol (OCSP), blacklist of certificates (CRLs)), the period of validity of the  certificate, a link toward the CA certificate, a claim that the private key is located in a qualified  electronic signature creation device).  Optionally, the certificate may also contain:   limitations on the scope of use of the certificate, if applicable;   limits on the value of transactions for which the certificate can be used, if applicable.  Evidence through a Signature Policy  A signature policy is a set of rules for the creation and validation of an electronic signature, under which  the signature can be determined to be valid (see [3] and bibliography (b)), (as these considerations are not  in the scope of the eIDAS Regulation). A given legal/contractual context may recognise a particular  signature policy as meeting its requirements. An example of signature policy is the “evidence agreement”  through which Parties agree to accept the validity of signature type X to sign transactions. This is typically  included in terms and conditions of online banking application.  A signature policy may be issued, for example, by a party relying on the electronic signatures and selected  by the signer for use with that relying party. Alternatively, a signature policy may be established through  an electronic trading association for use amongst its members. Both the signer and verifier use the same  signature policy.  A signature policy may be implicit or explicit. The signature policy may be provided as part of the signed  document, out of band, or by other means. The signature policy may be explicitly identified or may be  implied by the semantics of the data being signed and/or other external data, like a contract being  referenced which itself refers to a signature policy, as well as by the signing context. An explicit signature  policy for open usage has a globally unique reference, which is bound to an electronic signature by the  signer as part of the signature calculation.  The signature policy may include the following:   rules for certification path construction/verification (including indication of trusted root  certificates to be used)   rules for use of revocation status information (e.g. CRLs or OCSP responses);   rules for use of timing information, time-marking and/or time stamping;   signature validation data to be provided by the signer;   signature validation data to be collected by the verifier.   the period during which signatures can be performed under that policy,  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  31   a list of recognised commitment types;   rules for the use of signer roles;   any constraints on signature algorithms and key lengths;   other signature policy rules required to meet the objectives of the signature.   rules for multiple signatures:  o for documents signed by multiple signers, it may be necessary to establish the order of  signing, and if all signers were present at the same place for signing.  o the signature policy should provide guidance on the actions to take (both at creation and  verification sides), if one or more of the signature(s) are not valid, etc.  Additional evidence that may be required:   Place of signing. In some contractual situations this is of importance, and may have to be proven.   Legal system to be applicable for the signed document.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  32  7. Qualified electronic signatures – example of tools & practical usage  aspects  7.1 Implementing qualified electronic signatures (user perspective)  Signature creation tools  As mentioned previously, for creating a QES, the signatory needs (access to):   a qualified signature certificate,   a qualified signature creation device (QSCD) protecting the private key and enabling the signature  creation process (e.g. cryptographic computation),   a signature creation application managing the signature creation process (e.g. preparing the data  to be signed, allowing the signatory to use the QSCD, to enter the PIN, to select the certificate and  other signature creation parameters when applicable).  The signatory does not need to have all these elements in hand. A (Q)TSP may manage (some of) them on  his/her behalf. The strict minimum is that the signatory must be able to control the activation of the  private key.  Qualified certificate  Very probably, the first stakeholder that the signatory will meet in the framework of electronic signature  will be the CSP. There is even not necessarily a need to search for a CSP since in many European countries,  citizens are provided with electronic identity cards that bear digital certificate(s), and very often the  signature certificate is a qualified certificate.  When the signatory is required to acquire the certificate by himself, (s)he may be presented with several  options with regard to the information to be certified: the certificate may contain in addition to the “civil  identity” of the signatory, the name and identifier of an organisation with whom the citizen is associated  (e.g. his/her employer) and/or the indication of a role or mandate within an organisation.  Arguments for choice: a certificate with attributes help to evidence a role, function or belonging to an  organisation but needs to be re-issued if any one of these attributes changes.  Qualified signature creation device  With regard to the QSCD, the signatory may opt for a device in his/her hand, within his/her own  environment, or remotely managed by a TSP. When the QSCD is managed by a TSP, the device and the TSP  must be qualified. The way to verify that the provider is duly qualified is to check its presence in the trusted  list of the member state where it is established. The way to verify that the device is duly qualified is to check  its presence in the EC list of certified devices.  Arguments for choice: in the first case, the control by the signatory is higher, in the second case, the  mobility is enhanced.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  33  Signature creation application  There is no regulatory requirement on signature creation application. There are a variety of ways to  implement the signature creation.  On the one hand, the signature can be entirely performed within the signatory’s environment; the  signatory holds his/her signature creation device and signs with an application residing on his/her  computer. Quite a commonly used creation device is the smart card.  Example: a typical use case is the citizen that signs a pdf attestation thanks to his/her national electronic identity card.  The signatory may sign using his/her qualified signature creation device (e.g. eID) to create a QES on a data  (e.g. a PDF, a form) prepared by a server.  Example: a typical use case is the signature of the tax declaration, prepared by the government on its servers, possibly  completed online by the citizen, and whose fingerprint is locally signed by the citizen, with his/her eID card.  On the other hand, the signatory may rely on remote signature creation devices and facilities. As illustrated  below, it is possible to delegate a more or less important part of the signature creation process to a TSP. The  strict minimum is that the signatory must be able to control the activation of the private key. For this  purpose, the signatory must have the sole control on the authentication to her/his key. All the rest, even  including the management of the private key (generation, storage), may be delegated to a TSP and  implemented through a private key container. This may be really interesting from a user friendliness  perspective; the mobility is increased since the authentication towards the TSP may be limited to few  components (e.g. a mobile phone).  However, the signatory needs to trust the TSP for the sound protection of the private key when this one is  managed by the TSP. Thanks to the eIDAS Regulation, with regards to QES, the signature creation device  must be qualified (QSCD) and the TSP managing the private key(s) must be qualified (QTSP) and will be  supervised as part of the QSCD certification.  Example: a typical use case is the signature of bank transfers. This scenario can be concretised by a banking apps on a smart  phone through which the user connects to his/her bank. Via the apps the user enters the figures required for the bank transfer.  When the info is ready to be signed, a SMS containing a challenge is sent to the phone and the user needs to copy the challenge  via the apps to be authenticated; this allows the central server to activate and use the user’s private key to sign the transfer.  The authentication is considered as a strong authentication since the mobile phone communications are secure and the mobile  phone is supposed to be under the sole control of its owner. A variant of this example is the use of the mobile phone for the  authentication only, while the data to be signed preparation and the reception of the challenge occur via a web interface on the  user laptop; this a bit more secure since two distinct channels are used to convey the information (the laptop and the internet,  on the one hand, the mobile phone and the GPRS connection on the other hand).  Arguments for choice: When holding private keys, “in hands” the control by the signatory is higher. When  using remote signature creation facilities and devices, the mobility is enhanced.  Augmentation and preservation tools  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  34  As stated previously, for any type of AdES, where the signature is not verified immediately by the relying  party, the signatory (or relying party) may have some interest in completing the signature with a trusted  time stamp in order to provide a trusted evidence of the signing time. By this way it will be difficult for the  relying party to reject the signature in case of a subsequent problem with regard to the signature (e.g.  expiration of the signing certificate). Time stamping is not mandatory; it depends on the needs of the  relying party to be protected against potential repudiation of the signature by the signatory. Other events  may also affect the possibility to (re)validate the signature; e.g. the revocation of another certificate linked  to the signatory certificate (e.g. the CA certificate), the end of availability of information on the certificate  status by the CSP, etc. Hence, the signature should also be further enhanced with adequate proofs and  evidence by the relying party to overcome such events.  Concretely, the signatory (or relying party) may need to use an application that is able to:   Request time stamps from a time stamp service provider and to integrate the time stamp within the  signature. Generally, time stamping is a paying service that the signatory needs to buy on-the-fly or  needs to pay in advance.   Collect the required validation evidences and correctly format the signature according to the terms of  preservation.  The signatory (or relying party) may use the services of a TSP to do so. When the signature creation  application is provided in a remote way by a TSP, the service generally covers the augmentation and  preservation aspects. The TSP may further enhance the offering with storage (archiving) services.  Validation tools  The validation application needs to execute the validation process of a qualified electronic signature as  provisioned in Article 32 of the eIDAS Regulation. On top of the strictly cryptographic validation that the  digital signature is technically valid, the application must enable the relying party to validate the fact that  the signature is a QES: among others that the signatory’s certificate was issued by a QTSP, that the  certificate was both qualified and valid at the time of signing, the signature creation device is a QSCD, the  signatory’s data are correctly presented to the relying party, etc. Validations tools should consequently be  able to consume the EU MS national trusted lists to verify the qualified status of a QTSP/QTS.  For this purpose, the verifier may use an off-the shelf application, or can make use of the services from a  TSP that will perform the validation for him. In that latter case, the use of QTSP providing qualified  validation services of QES will bring more confidence and assurance to the verifier that the validation  process is correctly executed as the QTSP and the qualified services it provides will be under supervision  for meeting the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  7.2 Relevant standards regarding qualified electronic signatures (expert perspective)  Signature formats  When an organisation (e.g. administration, SME) decides to develop its own signature creation application  (whether to deploy it on its users environment or to offer it as a central service), the first recommendation  is to use standard and recognised signature formats, namely those referred to by CID (EU) 2015/1506  pursuant to Article 27 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  35  Such standards are defined in ETSI TS 103 171 v.2.1.1. (XAdES Baseline Profile), ETSI TS 103 173 v.2.2.1.  (CAdES Baseline Profile), ETSI TS 103 172 v.2.2.2. (PAdES Baseline Profile) and ETSI TS 103 174 v2.2.1  (Associated Signature Container Baseline Profile). These standards support different formats and forms of  signatures, suitable for different terms of preservation (until very long term). Implementers are  recommended, whenever possible, to use the most advanced forms allowing for best guarantees not only  for long term, but also in case of many types of security breaches that might occur in the mid-term as well.  Newer versions of those standards are also available respectively as EN 319 122/132/142/162 series (see  ETSI TR 119 00012 for further guidance).  Specific implementations  When specific implementations are in place, e.g. for mass signing, they shall ensure:   that no data can be introduced in the flow of data to be signed (network and application protection  required);   that the user is aware that more than one document is to be signed that the data to be signed are  correctly “displayed”.  EC funded DSS Open source libraries  With regards to off-the-shelf toolkits allowing more integrated solutions, the EC funded the development  of the DSS toolkits, as part of the CEF eSignature building block, available from Join-up where a cookbook  is also made available for use and integration of such toolkits for the creation and validation of QES.13  Policies and security requirements for applications for signature creation and signature validation  ETSI TS 119 101 provides general security and policy requirements for applications for signature creation,  validation and augmentation. The document covers legal driven policy requirements, information security  (management system) requirements, signature creation, signature validation and signature augmentation  processes requirements, development and coding policy requirements and additional general  requirements. Protection Profiles (PP) for signature creation applications and signature validation  applications are out of scope and are defined in the CEN EN 419 111 standard \"Protection Profiles for  Signature Creation & Validation Applications\".  An important tool for relying Parties is probably ETSI TS 119 172 [3] series on signature policies. This series  of standards allows the definition and specifications of the rules to be applied during creation,  augmentation and/or validation of signatures, and how to fix the parameters for declaring a signature  conformant to the specified rules.  12 ETSI TR 119 000 V1.2.1 (2016-04): “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); The framework for  standardization of signatures: overview”.  13 EC funded eSignature's DSS has been published on both JoinUp and the CEF Digital Portal, issues are handled via  the DSS JIRA. All future releases and issue management will be available through the CEF Digital portal.  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119000_119099/119000/01.02.01_60/tr_119000v010201p.pdf https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/asset_release/all https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=23003381 https://esig-dss.atlassian.net/projects/DSS/issues  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  36  Annex A - Glossary  eIDAS – What is it?  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification (eID) and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  Electronic seal  An electronic seal is a piece of data in electronic form, created by a legal person, which is attached to or  logically associated with an electronic document (or data) to ensure its origin and integrity.  It is similar in the paper world to the dry seal of a company on a piece of paper to indicate that the  document originates from the company and make it authentic and official.  Hash value (of a file)  A hash value is a standardised and unique summary of a message, which is obtained by applying a specific  cryptographic tool called a cryptographic hash function.  A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed  size, with slight differences in input data producing very big differences in output data.  A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which has specific security properties:   It is considered practically impossible to recreate the input message from its hash value;   It is considered practically impossible to compute from a specific message a second message that  has the same hash value (i.e. different messages lead to different hash values);   It is considered practically impossible to find two different messages that would lead to the same  hash value (no collisions)  With such properties, when applied to the same message repetitively the hash value is always the same,  while if the message is slightly modified (even by one single bit) the hash value will always be different.  That allows to verify the integrity of a message compared to the message on which the hash was  previously computed; when the hash values are identical, then the messages are identical.  As cryptographic hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, they are  often used with digital signatures. Signing a hash value is more efficient than signing the larger value.  Intellectual property  Intellectual property is the collective term for rights to intellectual creations such as books, music,  trademarks, designs, inventions, software, texts and photographs. A single creation may be protected by  multiple rights at the same time. The best-known intellectual property rights are trademark rights,  copyrights and patent rights.  Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information related to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  37  No 910/2014. Those lists have constitutive value and are primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status is or has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. It shall be clearly indicated  that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust  service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure high-level  security of the qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:  - Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  - Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTS. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.  - Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.  - Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.  - Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.  - Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  - Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  - Up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to ensure  continuity of service;  - Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  - Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  - Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  - Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  - Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  - Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  - Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received, even after cessation of  activities.  - Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  38  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, i.e. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  CEF eSignature building blocks  The Connecting Europe Facility14 (CEF) supports trans- European networks and infrastructures in the  sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy. It provides public administrations and businesses of  reusable building blocks. Building blocks supported so far include: eIdentification; eSignature; eInvoicing;  eDelivery; and Automated Translation.  The eSignature building block helps public administrations and businesses to accelerate the creation and  verification of electronic signatures. The deployment of this building block in a Member State facilitates  the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, so that the legal value of  electronic documents can be recognized in other countries than the country of origin of the signer. This  means that public administrations and businesses can trust and use eSignatures that are valid and  structured in EU interoperable formats15,16.  The CEF eSignature solution17 consists of open source advisory services (Libraries, including source code,  artefacts, bundle for demonstration and cookbook) managed by the European Commission allowing the  creation and verification of electronic signatures, including the use of time stamps.  For more information about these services, please refer to the Digital Signature Service available from  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  14 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility.  15 CID (EU) 2011/130 establishing minimum requirements for the cross-border processing of documents signed  electronically by competent authorities under Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.  16 CID (EU) 2015/1506 laying down specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced  seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on  eID and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  17 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature.  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  39  Qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that  person. Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e.  mainly to express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference  from the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime where an electronic signature, which could be  used by legal persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the  entity who creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person.  Therefore, certificates for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead  legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified)  electronic signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic  signatures. Instead legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic  attestations that link electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that  person. The aim of an electronic seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic  data/document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and  integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to  create qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of  the data and of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is  linked.  3. The provision of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and  SMEs) that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy  information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such  qualified certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their  supervision regime. As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality  of the service offered to users, accountability of providers with regard to security of their services,  trustworthiness of the data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological  neutrality of services and solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  40  periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological  changes.  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of  time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process  aims to confirm the validity of an electronic signature.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified  electronic signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic seal.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  seal in order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU,  from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the  identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of  sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.

However, and depending  on the concrete environment the use case is applied in, the “strength/rigorousness” with which the  recommendations should be applied might be less or more severe.  Dimensions that could have an impact  on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the processes  and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective qualified  trust service. So, without intending to be complete as a risk assessment depends of the concrete  environment/context in which the organization is operating, some dimensions which might be considered  to determine the risk-profile of the process and/or data being protected (and therefor the minimum  “strength/rigorousness” to apply) are:   Business critical data & processes:  organizations store or process information that can have a less  or more significant impact on their own organization and/or their partners and/or their clients.  Examples of potential risks are e.g. loss of integrity of a database, compromise of business- confidential data, incorrect contracting-data, etc.   Data & processes with potential financial impact:  organization (especially but not only financial  industry related organizations) have several processes which might have direct financial impact for  themselves, for their partners and/or their clients ranging from amounts e.g. below a thousand  euros to amounts going into millions of euros. Examples of potential risks are e.g.: faulty validation  of signatures on mandates or payment instructions, rogue / criminal impersonation of third party  providers, hacking of personnel or corporate accounts, false invoices, etc.   Personal data (processing):  Personal data is clearly a very complex and high risk matter. The  scope of personal data is very broad, ranging from less delicate personal data, to directly  identifiable information to sensitive personal data. The more sensitive the data the stronger and  more rigorous one should apply the recommendations. Examples of potential risks are:  fines of up  to 4% of the global annual revenues of a company, embarrassment due to faulty access personal  information, unauthorized access/manipulation to e.g. biometric data, responding to a request- for-info based on an incorrect signed request, health data getting exposed / delivered incorrectly,  authenticity/integrity of critical health records being non-verifiable, etc.  Note:  We stress that the above are just examples of possible areas to consider to assess the risk-profile of  the process and/or data being protected. Depending on the reader’s environment other dimensions might  apply depending on regulation, corporate policies, contractual obligations, etc.  B.2 Determining applicable criticality-levels and derive resulting minimum applicable  recommendations  Following the above, it is proposed that organizations do their own analyses and following map their  processes / data-to-be-processed onto the following “criticality-levels”:   “Standard” would entail any usage of a trust service under normal circumstance like but not  limited to use cases e.g. involving financial exchange of a rather limited amount, personal records  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  45  with limited potential impact, or access to data/services of a limited classification level (e.g.  internal/restraint).   “Advanced” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where more precautions /  prudence is to be advised like cases which involve financial exchange of a rather important  magnitude, personal records with rather important impact if going wrong, or access to  data/services of a higher classification level like company-confidential.   “Sensitive” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where sensitive data is being  involved, e.g. involving financial exchanges of a significant amount, personal record access of  personal sensitive information, or access to data/services of a high classification level  like company-/commercial-secret.  Based on the above “criticality-levels”, one can easily see how the levels (Basic, Recommended, Enhanced)  can match to these levels:   Basic would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “standard” level of criticality.   Recommended would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is  involved in a (trans)action that involves data/services of an “advanced” level of criticality.   Enhanced would be the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “sensitive” level of criticality.

OJ L 109, 26.4.2016, p. 40–42  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  47  Annex D - Frequently asked questions  What about the (international) recognition of electronic signatures (within  Europe)?  A qualified electronic signature (QES) shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature and  shall be recognised as a qualified electronic signature in all Member States; since QES bear with them the  proofs (or the links enabling the automatic validation through trusted sources) that they are qualified, they  shall never be refused by anybody in any European Member States. In case of litigation it is up to the  requesting party to proof that the signature is not qualified. There is quasi no risk of rejection with QES.  AdES also benefit from a legal recognition, but the burden of proving that the AdES is an AdES as per the  EU Regulation N° 910/2014 is on the signatory. In case of litigation the confirmation or information will  come from experts hired by the tribunal. There is a risk of rejection with AdES (depending on the quality of  the AdES; i.e. level of quality and of assurance on the CA and level of quality and assurance on the SCDev).  In all cases, the EU Regulation N° 910/2014 further supports the recognition of AdES through its Article 46  on electronic documents; “an electronic document shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as  evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in electronic form”. It means that no one can  refuse an AdES because the signed document is not in a paper form.  What about the (international) recognition of electronic signatures (outside  Europe)?  From a legal perspective, the automatic mutual recognition of QES will come from international  agreements between the Union and the foreign countries. Per Article 14 of the EU Regulation N°  910/2014, such agreements shall ensure that;  (a) the requirements applicable to qualified trust service providers established in the Union and the qualified  trust services they provide are met by the trust service providers in the third country or international  organisations with which the agreement is concluded, and by the trust services they provide;  (b) the qualified trust services provided by qualified trust service providers established in the Union are  recognised as legally equivalent to trust services provided by trust service providers in the third country  or international organisation with which the agreement is concluded.  Even in the absence of such agreement, and this is anyway true for the AdES (non-QES), thanks to the  international standards, the international recognition is possible. Many countries use schemes for  assessing the security of their trust service provider; both the assessment process and the criteria used  to assess the TSPs follow standards that, when not exactly the same as the ones used within Europe,  are comparable to our standards. Yet probably not easy for the citizen, it is not that complex for an IT  professional to assess whether an AdES received from a third country is comparable to an AdES issued  in Europe. For international relationships, the citizen is encouraged to take advice from his/her CA, e.g.  in order to verify interoperability of his/her signature.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  48  eIDAS Regulation – Questions and answers on rules applicable to trust services as  of 1 July 2016  The European Commission complied a Q&A document to help fully understanding the new legal  framework in order to implement it or reap the benefits of electronic transactions.  The complied a Q&A document is available from https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas.  The Commission launched the eIDAS Observatory - an online collaborative platform for exchanging views  and positions, sharing ideas and good practices. It is a virtual community of stakeholders whose aim is to  build a common understanding of the issues relating to the implementation and uptake of the eIDAS  Regulation and to facilitate the use of cross-border electronic identification and trust services. You can join  the eIDAS Observatory and take part in the discussions.  How can I find a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified certificates for  electronic signatures?

It defines trust services for supporting  electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and  website authentication.  The eIDAS Regulation represented a big step forward in building a digital single market as it provides one  common legal framework for all parties relying or providing on those kind of services. Indeed, various  sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing economy, trading, etc.)  where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication, legal certainty of  evidences, will clearly be positively affected by the eIDAS Regulation. This latter will indeed allow citizens,  businesses and public administrations to meet such obligations for any (cross-border) electronic  transaction as they will now be able to use the recognised eID means and (qualified) trust services. In  particular, a qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature  and, when based on a qualified certificate issued in one Member State, shall be recognised as a qualified  electronic signature in all other Member States.  This document addresses qualified electronic signatures and is one out of a series of five documents which  target to assist parties aiming to use qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, eDelivery or  website authentication certificates to understand the subject correctly as-well-as the potential benefits,  amongst others, by giving examples of possible application. This series of documents also targets to give  those parties some advice on how to correctly use the related (qualified) trust services.  After explaining what a qualified eSignature is and what properties/function it does and does not provide,  concrete examples of use are given for inspiration to the readers. Next to them, and as even the most  secure / trusted service becomes insecure and unreliable if not being integrated or used correctly, some  key recommendations are given for correct integration and use, pertaining:   Both the signatory and the relying party should look for the EU trust mark for qualified trust  services when selecting providers.   The relying party shall follow the applicable Certification Authority’s terms and conditions  and/or other contractual documentation.   The first level of augmentation consists in time-stamping the signature   In a signature with Long Term Validation Data, the set of validation material or references to it  should be sufficient to ascertain the validation status of all end-entity certificates contained in  the signature.   Before algorithms, keys, and other cryptographic data used at the time a signature was built  become weak and the cryptographic functions become vulnerable, or the certificates  supporting previous time stamp tokens expire or are revoked, the signed data, the signature as  well as any additional information should be protected by applying time stamp tokens.   QES services should be further supported by ancillary qualified trust services.   The relying party should verify that the provider is duly qualified is to check its presence in the  trusted list of the Member State where it operates.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  07  1. Introduction  1.1 General context/the eIDAS Regulation on eID and trust services  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 ([1], hereafter the eIDAS2 Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a predictable regulatory environment  for electronic identification and a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time  stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication.  It is possible to use these trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess  these electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  Whether you a large company, a SME or a citizen willing to complete an electronic transaction in another  EU country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in another EU Member State (MS), besides  reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation will ensure  cross-border recognition of national eID and electronic trust  services supporting your electronic transaction. Hence, it  will boost trust, security and convenience.  Since 1st July 2016, most provisions of the eIDAS Regulation  are directly applicable in the 28 EU Member States’ legal  framework overcoming problems of fragmented national  regimes. It provides legal certainty and fosters the usage of  eID means and electronic trust services for online access  and online transactions at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation will ensure that people and businesses can use their national eIDs to access public  services in other EU countries where eIDs are required for such an access at national level. It also creates  an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring their recognition and workability  across borders and are considered equivalent to traditional paper based processes.  1.2 Opportunities brought by eIDAS Regulation  An array of opportunities resides in leveraging eID and electronic trust services as key enablers for making  national and cross-border electronic transactions more secure, more convenient, trustworthy and  benefiting from legal certainty.  The broader adoption of EU-wide recognised eID means and of electronic trust services will facilitate and  boost the digital transformation of organisations, be it public administrations or businesses, enhance  customer experience, improve the security of electronic transactions and stimulate the provisioning of  new and innovative services.  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.  OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 73–114.  2 See Glossary.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  08  To this end, various sectors of the economy (e.g. finance, banking, transport, insurance, health, sharing  economy, trading, etc.) where obligations exist for security, reliable identification, strong authentication,  legal certainty of evidences, will be  positively affected. The eIDAS  Regulation indeed allows citizens,  businesses and public administrations to  conveniently meet such obligations for  any cross-border electronic transaction  using the recognised eID means and  (qualified) trust services of their choice.  Without undergoing identity verification  based on physical presence, but by using  MS notified eID means of a level “high”,  one should for example be able to use  public services in another country or  banks may accept such eID to open a  bank account3.  By relying on a qualified  time stamp, one will benefit, across the  EU, from the presumption of the  accuracy of the date and the time it  indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  1.3 Specific role of the qualified trust services  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of whatever qualified trust service  or product is used or provided and, as a consequence, are granted a higher presumption of their legal  effect.  Therefore, when looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of  security and legal certainty of trust services. E.g., qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the  EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to  which the date and time are bound.  1.4 Initiation and supervision of qualified trust services  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an active  supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they  provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent supervisory body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations4.  3 National legislations on prevention of money laundering may currently may force identity verification to be based  on physical presence. Furthermore, the use by the private sector of electronic identification means under a notified  scheme is on a voluntarily basis only (see Recital 17 of the eIDAS Regulation).  4 See glossary  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  09  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before providing the very first qualified trust service  output, e.g. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (QTSP/QTS), it will be subject to a pre-authorisation process –  the so-called initiation process. QTSPs may only begin to provide the qualified trust service after the  qualified status has been granted by the competent supervisory body and indicated in the national trusted  list5. From there, the supervision scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from  inception until termination.  In practice, where TSPs, without qualified status, intend to start providing qualified trust services, they  shall submit to the supervisory body a notification of their intention together with a conformity  assessment report issued by an “eIDAS” accredited conformity assessment body. Before notifying the  competent supervisory body of their intention to start providing qualified trust services, the future  QTSP/QTS must hence successfully pass an external assessment (audit) to confirm it fulfils the eIDAS  requirements. That audit must be conducted by a conformity assessment body specifically accredited to  carry out assessments of QTSP/QTS. The audit results in a formal conformity statement confirming - if such  is the case - that the QTSP/QTS meets all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Based on  the notified information including the report of such an audit, the competent SB will formally verify that  the candidate QTSP/QTS meets the applicable eIDAS requirements and, in case of positive verification, it  will undertake the publication of the grant of the qualified status for that QTSP/QTS in the national trusted  list.  It is only when its qualified status is published in the corresponding national trusted list that the QTSP/QTS  is authorised to provide the corresponding QTS.  Note: A TSP cannot be qualified without providing at least one qualified trust service (cfr Art.3.20 of the  eIDAS Regulation). A TSP is granted a qualified status separately for each type of qualified trust service  covered by the eIDAS Regulation. E.g. a QTSP qualified for the provisioning of qualified certificates for  electronic signatures is not per se granted a qualified status for the issuance of qualified time stamps; it  must first complete the full pre-authorisation process and have its granted qualified status for the  provision of qualified time stamp published explicitly in the national trusted list before issuing qualified  time stamps in addition to the provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures. There are nine  different types of QTSs defined by the eIDAS Regulation for which a qualified status is granted  separately: provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures, provision of qualified certificates  for electronic seals, provision of qualified certificates for website authentication, qualified preservation  service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals,  qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures, qualified validation service for qualified  electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps services, and qualified electronic registered delivery  services.6  7  5 See glossary.  6 See Annex A.7 for further details.  7 See Annex A.7 for further details.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  10  For marketing purposes, once qualified, a QTSP/QTS may use the EU Trust Mark for qualified trust services  when promoting its QTS. That trust mark shown in Figure 1 can only be used by a QTSP to “label” its QTS. It  can be used on any support provided it meets requirements from Art.23 of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. a link  to the corresponding national trusted list where consumers may verify the granted qualified status must  be displayed on the QTSP’s website) and rules of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806.8  Basically, this secondary legislation sets the form, colour and size of the EU trust mark, sets the obligation  to clearly indicate the qualified services that the EU trust mark pertains to, and allows association with  other graphical or textual elements provided that certain conditions are met.  Figure 1: EU trust mark for qualified trust services  The use of the EU trust mark9, which is voluntary, aims to foster transparency of the market and help  consumers distinguishing between qualified trust services and non-qualified ones.  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass, and submit the  competent supervisory body with a two-yearly conformity assessment report (CAR) issued by an  accredited CAB confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the  Regulation. Competent supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to  audit themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited CAB to perform  an ad hoc audit.  QTSPs and their QTSs are supervised for their entire lifecycle, from their genesis to their termination. In  particular, in order to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs, as well as to ensure proper termination  and user’s confidence in their provision, QTSPs must maintain, at all times, an up-to-date termination plan.  That plan is to be agreed by the SB upon initiation and regularly checked for compliance during the life of  the QTSP/QTS.  1.5 A focus on qualified electronic signatures  Today, it is possible to electronically sign data and to achieve the same effects as when using a hand- written signature. Such electronic signatures that benefit from a full legal recognition thanks to the eIDAS  Regulation are called qualified electronic signatures.  8 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services (Text with EEA relevance). OJ L 128, 23.5.2015, p. 13–15.  9 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark for more guidance on the use of that trust  mark, downloadable images, user manual and answers to frequently asked questions.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2015.128.01.0013.01.ENG https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-trust-mark  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  11  The eIDAS Regulation addresses various services  that can be used to support different types of  electronic transactions and electronic signatures  in particular.  Beside the legal framework, the technical  framework is nowadays very mature. Citizens  routinely sign data electronically e.g. when they use a credit card or debit card to make a payment.  The use of qualified electronic signatures should help the development of online business and services in  Europe by securing online transactions and services in Europe and beyond in many sectors: e-business, e- administration, e-banking, online games, e-services, online contracts, etc.  1.6 Scope of the present document and relationship with other recommendations  This document proposes security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures. The  objective of the document is to support relying parties and end users of qualified electronic signature  services to securely use these services.  The target audience of the document are end users and relying parties of qualified electronic signature  services. This could comprise individuals, businesses and public administrations. For example, it could be a  public administration that wishes to use qualified electronic signatures for their electronic interactions  with citizens, and which would like to ensure it is utilizing these services:   In compliance with the eIDAS Regulation.   In a proper and secure manner that guarantees that the security properties of the service are  maintained.  The structure of the document, from the next sections, is organised to provide information and guidance  with regards to the following aspects of qualified electronic signature:   What is it?   What key properties does it provide?   What properties can it not provide?   What are the potential use cases?   What are the usage best practices?   Example of tools & practical usage aspects.  Four other linked documents propose security guidelines on the appropriate use respectively of qualified  electronic seals, qualified electronic time stamps, qualified website authentication certificates and  qualified electronic registered delivery.10  Although each of these qualified trust services share some technical backgrounds or tools and thus provide  some common functionalities, such as those illustrated below, each of them has its own objectives and  core functionalities as summarised in the following table:  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/qualified-trust-services.

Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  13  2. Qualified electronic signature – what is it?  2.1 Legal definition of (qualified) electronic signatures  The eIDAS Regulation defines an electronic signature as “data in electronic form which is attached to or  logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign”.  A signature is “generated” by a signatory, possibly “augmented” (i.e. completed with related proofs or  evidences – see section 6), “validated” by the receiver of the signed data (so-called “relying party”), and  possibly preserved, in some cases for a long term.  The way these features are used determines the level of strength, assurance and longevity of the qualified  signatures. In particular, TSPs, qualified or not, can be called for the qualified signature creation,  validation and/or preservation.  Looking at the definition above, as such, an electronic signature can be created using many technologies,  ranging from the extremely weak (such as pasting a scanned signature image in a document) to the very  strong (such as signing using an electronic identity card protected by a fingerprint).  Electronic signatures are created by an electronic signature creation device, which is defined in the eIDAS  Regulation as “a configured software or hardware used to create an electronic signature by means of an  ‘electronic signature creation data’ (i.e. “a unique data which is used by the signatory to create an  electronic signature”)”.  In these definitions, the “unique data” is to be seen as a personal element that belongs to the signatory  and that can be compared to the very personal behaviour of a signatory signing in the paper world (i.e. the  graphics, speed, pressure that make that a signature can be unambiguously linked to a person). In the  same way that signatory keeps these elements private in the paper word, the electronic signature creation  data also needs to be protected in the electronic world. Typically, it will be securely stored on a device (e.g.  a smart card like a bank card) that can be activated by its owner only, e.g. by means of a PIN code, or  biometry (e.g. fingerprint).  Electronic signatures in general shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal  proceedings. Within the electronic signature family, the eIDAS Regulation defines subsets of electronic  signatures that provide increasing legal predictability up to a level, the qualified electronic signature, which  benefits from the legal equivalence to handwritten signatures:   the electronic signature (presented above)   the advanced electronic signature (AdES) – which requires some security features that ensure it is  uniquely linked to the signatory, it is capable of identifying the signatory and it is linked to the data in  such a manner that any subsequent change of the data is detectable   the qualified electronic signature (QES) – which is an advanced electronic signature which provides  additional level of assurance on the identity of the signatory and an enhanced protection and level of  assurance on the signature creation. A special device is required for the creation of QES (a qualified  signature creation device, QSCD).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  14  Figure 3: Types of electronic signatures  A QES shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature and shall be recognised as a  qualified electronic signature in all Member States.  This equivalence is gained from the fact that qualified electronic signatures are supported by i) trustworthy  process technology, similar to advanced electronic signatures, ii) qualified electronic signature creation  devices and iii) qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) which are supervised by EU MS appointed  supervisory bodies.  2.2 Public Key Cryptography as technical foundations for (Q)ES  In the current state of the art, QES are implemented by means of asymmetric cryptography. With this  technology, each signatory owns a key pair made of a private and a public key (the technology is called the  public key cryptography) and the so produced electronic signatures are called digital signatures.  The signature creation and verification process as follows:  1. The signatory uses the private key to sign a text:  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  15  Figure 4: Digitally signing data with a private key to produce an electronic signature  The private key is in fact a secret code used by a mathematical function in order to render a data  unintelligible (i.e. encrypt data). In the illustration the data is put in a box closed by the padlock. The  private key corresponds to the so-called ‘signature creation data’ as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.  In the paper world the “private key” concept can be compared to the unique behaviour of the signatory;  what distinguishes a handwritten signature is the speed, the pressure, the graphic, that are in theory  only reproducible by the signatory.  2. The verifier (also called relying party in the eIDAS Regulation) uses the signatory’s public key to verify  the signature:  Figure 5: Verifying a signature with sender’s public key.  The public key is in fact a code used by the reverse mathematical function to retrieve the initial data  from the encrypted data. In the illustration the data is retrieved from the box thanks to the public key.  In the paper world the “public key” concept can be compared to an “official” example of a signature that  a verifier can compare with a received signature.  The verification of a signature with a certain public key means that the signature was computed with the  corresponding private key (in the illustration the public key can only open one particular padlock). Only the  signatory in possession of the private key can be at the origin of the signature. As a consequence, the  person that owns the private key matching the public key (i.e. the signatory) cannot deny to be at the  origin of such signature; this non-repudiation feature is the foundation of any signature (electronic or  paper-based).  Another characteristic of digital signatures is that if the signed text has been modified after the signature,  the verification of the signature will fail (because the signature computation mixed the private key and the  data to be signed the verification computation will always disclose the very same data).  (In the illustration  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  16  the data in the box cannot be retrieved or replaced or modified by other data until the box is opened). As a  consequence, successful signature verification also ensures data integrity.  Of course, there are some technical tricks to ensure that only the person that owns the private key  matching the public key is able to create the signature (and not a third person that would be able to  imitate the signatory’s signature):   it is likely impossible to discover the private key from the knowledge of the public key. Any  stakeholder in possession of a public key is able to verify that a signed data has been made by the  corresponding private key, without being able to play the role of the signatory since (s)he cannot  guess the private key. The size of the key is an important parameter for the security of the algorithm.   A different unique key pair is allocated to each signatory.   The signatory shall protect the private key (in the same way as (s)he would not explain to third party  how to imitate her signature).  2.3 Certification services as trust foundation for (Q)ES  The technical foundations presented above, alone, are not sufficient to ensure the full confidence in the  system. Indeed, trust in signatures relies on the guarantee that a certain Public Key belongs to a particular  signatory, owner (and sole controller) of the corresponding private key. For this purpose, an entity, trusted  by the community, called a certification authority (also called a Certification Service Provider, CSP, which is  a particular type of TSP as defined in the eIDAS Regulation), certifies the link {public key – signatory} in a  public key certificate. In general, one finds the information on the identity of the signatory in the  certificate, and sometimes one can also find other attributes relating to this person, such as his/her role  within an organisation.  Figure 6: A digital certificate  The certificate is a signed statement by the CA; the CA’s signature is trusted because the CA’s key is  published in a media trusted by the community (the official journal, e.g.). The procedures, techniques and  mechanisms put in place to realise such certification services is commonly called Public Key Infrastructure  (or PKI). The certificate officialises the link between a signatory and its key pair in the same way an identity  card officialises the link between a citizen and his/her handwritten signature represented on the card.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  17  The trust in certificates relies on the quality of the CA and its certification services. The CA must follow  sound policies: strong cryptography, secure CA premises and devices, signature creation devices for  signatories of a good quality, trusted personnel, insurances, etc.  It also relies in the possibility to revoke certificates that are not trusted anymore and to publish revocation  status (i.e. black list of revoked certificates) to verifying parties (i.e. validation services). This can happen if  the signatory has lost his/her signature creation device and fears that someone uses it to impersonate  him/her.  Finally, trust in CA policies relies on the level of assurance that the CA indeed correctly implements these  policies. For this purpose, the CA can be audited.  2.4 The electronic signature process  The signature creation workflow  A signatory, to create a signature in a document, works in a certain environment (e.g. a laptop) to access  signing functionalities made of:  a. the signature creation application (e.g. a pdf application residing on the laptop) and  b. the signature creation device that  i. holds the signature creation data (private key);  ii. shall be able to authenticate the signatory (to guarantee his/her sole control on the  private key);  iii. computes the signature (using the signer's signature creation data);  iv. may hold the signing certificate (or unambiguous references to it).  Figure 7: Signature creation process  Concretely, how does it work?  1. The signatory prepares the document like any kind of document (e.g. a PDF file).  2. The application prepares the data to be signed (i.e. the PDF) in a condensate (called a hash) and  present it to the signature creation device.  3. The signature creation device asks the authorisation to the signatory to sign the data, in general,  though a windows that pops up on the screen. The signatory authenticates to the device (e.g. (s)he  enters a PIN code, or a fingerprint).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  18  4. The signature creation device computes the signature and sends the result to the application that  integrates the signature into the document.  At this stage, it is important to note that in general, the signatory’s certificate is provided with the  signature. This enables the identification of the signatory and the verification of the signature since the  public key is immediately available from the certificate. If there are attributes relating to the signatory in  the certificate, one can also validate these attribute(s) (e.g. the person may sign in quality of director of an  organisation and this title is certified), but nothing prevents the signatory to (also) add a sentence in the  signed document that says “I'm signing in quality of director”. This is a self-claim similar to what is done in  the paper world.  The augmentation for more resilience  Augmenting signatures is the process by which certain material (e.g. time stamps, validation data and even  archival-related material) is incorporated to the signatures for making them more resilient to change or for  enlarging their longevity.  The augmentation can be done either by the signatory, or by the relying party or by a TSP that validates or  preserve the signature on behalf of the signatory or the relying party. E.g. if someone asks another person  to sign an acknowledgement of debt, it is likely to be the case that the first person has some interest in the  preservation of the signature (which is not necessarily the case of the signatory). On the contrary, if the  signature is not verified immediately by the relying party, the signatory may have some interest in  completing the signature, e.g., with a trusted time stamp in order to provide a trusted evidence of the  signing time. By this way it will be difficult for the relying party to reject the signature in case of a  subsequent problem with regard to the signature (e.g. expiration of the signing certificate).  2.5 Qualified electronic signatures  As mentioned above, qualified electronic signatures enjoy, all over the EU, the equivalent legal effect of a  handwritten signature.  To achieve a QES, the eIDAS Regulation requires a qualified signature creation device (i.e. a signature  creation device that follows the requirements listed in the eIDAS Regulation and will be certified  accordingly).  In addition, the eIDAS Regulation also requires a qualified certificate for electronic signatures: the qualified  certificate follows the requirements listed in the eIDAS Regulation, and the issuing CA will be a qualified  trust service provider. Pursuant to the eIDAS Regulation, the CA will be audited and if the Member State in  which the CA is established receives a suitable audit report and verifies the eIDAS requirements, the CA  will be listed as qualified trust service provider in the corresponding national trusted list.   Qualified certificates for electronic signatures provides high assurance of the identity of the  signatory   QSCDs provide high assurance on the security of the signature  Moreover, the eIDAS Regulation offers the possibility to use qualified trust services (QTS) for the  validation and/or the preservation of QES. Such services are offered by QTSPs.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  19  There is no obligation to call such QTS for the validation or the preservation of (qualified) signature, but as  any other qualified service, their use provide the users with a pretty good legal protection (i.e. in case of  litigation the burden of the proof lies on the QTPS).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  20  3. Qualified electronic signature – what key properties does it provide?  3.1 Legal properties  Signing with the same legal value as with a handwritten signature  As presented above, QES benefit from a full legal recognition thanks to the eIDAS Regulation to achieve the  same effects as when using a hand-written signature.  Such electronic signatures thanks to the obligations set by the eIDAS Regulation on both the TSP managing  them (in particular the CAs) and on the underlying technologies: warrant data integrity, identify the  signatory with a high level of certainty, and ensure the non-repudiation of signing.  At this stage, it is important to note that like handwritten signature, (qualified) electronic signatures are  created by human beings (i.e. natural persons). Indeed, under the eIDAS Regulation, a legal person is not  legally permitted to electronically sign. Rather, the eIDAS Regulation allows legal persons to electronically  seal data. The concept of electronic seal for legal persons is very similar to the concept of electronic  signature for natural persons and is the topic of dedicated security guidelines within the series.  3.2 Security properties  Data integrity  As mentioned in the introduction, the use of public key cryptography to implement QES (and AdES in  general) ensures data integrity (i.e. any change in the signed data after the signature process is detected).  Data origin authentication  The use of public key cryptography to implement QES (and AdES in general) warrants the proof of origin of  the signed data since only the person in possession of the private key can be at the point of origin of data  signed with the corresponding public key. For QES, in addition, there is a high level of assurance on the  identity of the person owning such private key (see below).  3.3 Functional Properties  Non-repudiation of signing  As mentioned in the introduction, the use of public key cryptography to implement QES (and AdES in  general) provides for non-repudiation of having signed.  Secure identification of the signatory  The qualified digital certificate ensures the identification of signatory with a very high level of assurance,  thanks to the controls of the TSP on one hand, but also thanks to the requirements on the content of the  signatory’s certificate imposed by the eIDAS Regulation.  Creating huge amount of signatures and/or signatures on huge data  The involvement of a human being signatory is not always needed when electronically signing; signing (it  applies to QES but more broadly for any type of AdES) may be an automated process. E.g. a director of a  hospital, may have to sign hundreds of documents per day. To ease her/his life, his/her signature creation  device may be implemented on server where the private key stays activated for several hours; provided  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  21  the data to be signed submission process is secure, as well as the access to the server, a perfectly valid  signature can be created without the need to enter the director’s PIN code for each and every signature  applied.  Also, a signature can be applied to data of any type and any size; a contract in a pdf format, e.g. will only  require one single electronic signature to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the whole file. No  need to sign each and every page like in the paper world, by virtue of the data integrity featured by the  Public Key Cryptography technology underlying QES.  3.4 Other Properties  Signing with a signature that is understood and verifiable worldwide  Basic signatures, like non-qualified AdES, benefit from the non-discrimination rule. This means that a Court  in an EU Member State cannot reject them automatically as being invalid simply because they are in  electronic form. However, their dependability is still lower than that of a QES because the signatory may  be required to prove the security of the technology being used if the validity of the signature is disputed  before a court. This requires significant costs and efforts that could be avoided with relative ease by opting  for the more established and standardised advanced and qualified signature solutions. It may also be the  case that the relying parties have no applications or tools to validate such signature, when not based on  standards; in such a scenario, the signature may be legally valid and technologically robust, but of limited  use.  For these interoperability reasons, QES that are based on recognised EU standards are preferable unless  the parties operate purely in a local context where the acceptance and usability of the chosen signature  solution is sufficiently certain.  Beyond the technical interoperability, the eIDAS Regulation also ensures the (international) recognition of  electronic signatures. See also the “FAQ” on this topic.  Signing “in quality of”  It is possible to certify elements that are bound to the signatory such as a title (e.g. Director), a link with its  employer, etc. Because the QCA is trusted for verifying the information it certifies, the Relying Party can  get a high level of confidence in such information conveyed with the signature through the signatory’s  certificate.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  22  4.  Qualified electronic signature – what properties can it not provide?  4.1 Legal properties not provided by QES  “Signature” by a legal person  As mentioned above (qualified) electronic signatures are performed by human beings (i.e. natural  persons).  It is not possible for an organisation or a legal person to create a (qualified) electronic signature. Rather,  they will use another concept introduced by the eIDAS Regulation, namely the (qualified) electronic seal.  Granting that the content of the signed data is meaningful, fair or true  Exactly like in the paper world, it is not because a contract is signed that the terms of the contract are fair.  4.2 Security properties not provided by QES  Confidentiality  The signature protocol used alone does not provide confidentiality, although the Public Key Cryptography  can be used to offer encryption. Indeed, if the signature process presented above is reverted (i.e. someone  is using the public key of a recipient to encrypt a text), then only the recipient that owns the  correspondent private key can decrypt the text.  Like for electronic signature, a certificate attesting the link between the recipient and its key pair is to be  provided by a TSP (i.e. a CA).  One needs to superpose the two protocols to achieve electronic signature and confidentiality. First the  signatory signs and then (s)he may encrypt the signed document to the attention of a recipient, provided  (s)he has the encryption certificate of this person. If the signed document needs to be sent to many  recipients, then the encryption protocol needs to be repeated as many times as there are recipients.  4.3 Functional properties not offered by QES  Time stamping  Although the technique underlying the (Q)ES can be used by a special sort of “signatory” (i.e. a time  stamping authority), a QES does not provide any proof on the signing time; unless a trusted timestamp is  added to the signature (see below), the time that is appended to a QES is a self-declaration from the  signatory and not an official proof.  4.4 Other properties not offered by QES  Management of delegation  The relying party verifying a signature will not necessarily be ensured that the signatory is authorised to  sign (e.g. to commit in the name of a certain organisation). Again this problem is not unique to electronic  signatures; it exists in paper signatures as well (and arguably more so, since electronic signatures can more  easily convey highly trustworthy identity information).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  23  Electronic signatures do permit the implementation of solutions to this problem by incorporating  authorisation management solutions. It is also possible to certify, in the certificate, elements that are  bound to the signatory such as a title (e.g. Director), a link with its employer, etc. However, this is not  provided by default. And it is not because the title Director is certified that the director is effectively  empowered to sign any type of commitments in the name of the organisation (s)he represents.  Eternal integrity  There is no guarantee that the content of the signed document cannot be changed if (long term)  preservation features are not implemented (see BASIC / RECOMMENED / ENANCED below).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  24  5. Qualified electronic signature – what are the potential use cases?  5.1 Overview and context of the given examples  In general and to put qualified electronic signatures into context, they only provide signatures.  As  mentioned above, they do not establish the exact time on when the document was signed, they do not  necessarily provide the commitment of a potential legal entity behind the signatory, and they do not  confirm delivery of the signed message. Hence, qualified electronic signatures (QES) are most often seen  coming in addition of other identification and/or trust services as part of a broader solution.  In this context, and although the properties of QES have been described in the previous sections, the  following properties are key for the use case examples mentioned below:   QES to establish the originator of a signed document.   QES to provide integrity of a signed document.   QES to provide non-repudiation of having signed document.  Those properties allow several “types of use cases” which can be applied in many areas of application as  show in the present section. The table below highlight the identified types of use cases. The mapping on  areas of applications in no way tries to be exhaustive but only tries to indicate the huge potential of QES.

Indeed, in the days of phishing it is for  many people very difficult to see if a  document or a message really originates  from where it seems to come from.  Applying qualified electronic signatures on  documents/messages can easily and  swiftly provide a solution for this.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  25  Examples of concrete application are:   B2B: Organisations can easily introduce as practice to start signing, with QES, all their outgoing  documents and messages and other hand validate incoming messages/documents.   G2C: Governments should make it a standard to have outgoing documents/messages either using  qualified electronic seals (cfr the eSeals Guideline document) or qualified electronic signatures.  5.3 Signing of a document/declaration  People or organisations can use QES to sign documents/declarations when submitting them e.g. to  government as proof of their  authenticity/origin and their  endorsement of the content non- repudiation.  This provides a  significant amount of time as, in  contrast to filling in forms and/or  putting things on paper, people can  now prepare their declaration fully  electronically signed (with QES) and  submit them in one single digital  flow.  Examples of concrete application are:   C2C/C2B: One person giving e.g. a relative or an accountant a mandate for a month.   B2G: Submitting declarations to government (which needs to be signed by mandated person).  5.4 Signing a (commercial) proposal  A SME might choose to use qualified electronic signatures for the submission of bids in public  procurement. This is an area which  is traditionally mired by large  amounts of paperwork that creates  significant efforts and costs that  could easily be diminished, while  increasing the reliability of the  process, through the application of  qualified electronic signatures.  Examples of concrete application are:   B2C:  Companies using signing of proposals/offers towards their (potentials) clients (endorsing thereby  the proposals).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  26   B2G: Companies participating in the eProcurement-process of government and being more and more  obliged to submit their offer electronically.  5.5 Signing of an official document/attestation  Certain government documents have to be signed by an official instead of by an administration (the later  would be an electronic seal for which we refer to the respective other document in this series). In the day  and age of qualified electronic signatures, it is no longer needed to do all this on paper. Officials can  (depending on the specific form factors obliged by law) generate official documents/attestations and sign  them electronically.  Examples of concrete application are:   G2C: Creation/signing of e-permits or an attestation of residence.   G2B: Creation/signing of VAT-attestations, signing of custom documents, etc.  5.6 Signing of a legal consent / an eMandate / …  In many cases, one needs to know if a client agrees with the terms and conditions, or opts into certain  services, or consents with certain processing of his/her data or gives a mandate to a third party to act on  his/her/its behalf.  Especially when entering into a relationship (not being in a closed system yet) or when  e.g. mandate with might have effect on third parties need to be given the use of qualified electronic  signatures is advisable or even mandatory.  Examples of concrete application are:   B2C: Signing of the general terms and conditions when becoming a client of a bank   B2B: Giving an accountant a mandate to act on one’s behalf and to do financial transfers on one’s  behalf.  5.7 Signing of a contract  The number of cases in which contracts are being concluded between parties is huge.  Such processes  could be accelerated and rendered way more efficiently if they could be digitized and supported by  electronic signatures ensuring legal certainty and equivalence to hand written signatures. This is exactly  what a qualified electronic signature now allows.  Parties can sign contracts and exchange them 24/7 and  across borders in Europe whilst being certain of the legal recognition of the electronic signatures.  Examples of concrete application are:   C2B: A person signing a rental or buying agreement.   B2B: A company subscribing to an insurance contract.   B2G: Signing off for a government project-start.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  27  6. Qualified electronic signature – what are the usage best practices?  6.1 Security Guidelines & Levels  In this section, we propose recommendations, through existing best practices, according to three levels  which represent the “strength/rigorousness” with which qualified electronic signature services should be  applied in a specific context. This “strength/rigorousness” of course depends on the use case or type of  application / environment in which qualified time stamping services are being applied. Dimensions that  could have an impact on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality  of the processes and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the  respective qualified trust service.  This, every organization has to determine for itself based on a risk  assessment.  For inspiration possible mapping of basic/recommended/enhanced vs business criticality  and/or data protection is being given in Annex B.  In short the three levels of recommendations are in increasing order (whereby the higher level suppose  that the lower level is also taken into account):  BASIC for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with normal  levels of criticality of data and therefor can live with a lower maturity in implementing  trust services (technology).  RECOMMENDED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with  important business data and therefor need to be able to rely on a medium to higher  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  ENHANCED for recommendations to be followed by entities or in processes dealing with data of  sensitive/high level of criticality and therefor need to be able to rely on a (very) high  maturity of implementation of trust services (technology).  6.2 BASIC  When looking for trust services, selecting qualified ones ensures benefiting from a high level of security  and legal certainty of trust services. Qualified electronic signatures enjoy, all over the EU, the equivalent  legal effect of a handwritten signature.  As a basic recommendation, both the signatory and the relying party should look for the EU trust mark  for qualified trust services when selecting providers. In addition, the relying party shall follow the  applicable CA’s terms and conditions11 and/or other contractual documentation.  Such documentation may be accessible via the certificate itself: e.g. a PDS, that is an instrument of  disclosure and notice by a TSP, can be found from a link present in the signatory’s certificate in all  certificates issued by CAs conforming to the ETSI standards designed to support the eIDAS Regulation (see  [2]). In general, the CA will ask the relying party to validate the revocation status of the certificate against  its validation status information services (also accessible from links provided within the certificates). It is  11 Essentially Certification Practice Statement (CPS) and Certificate Policies (CP)  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  28  important to note that most applications available on the market perform such validation automatically. In  particular, to comply with best practices and with the eIDAS requirement for the validation of qualified  electronic signatures (article 32) that request the confirmation that the certificate was valid at the time of  signing.  As a fundamental recommendation, a signatory shall never share its signature activation data (e.g. PIN  number).  6.3 RECOMMENDED  Augmenting signatures is the process by which certain material (e.g. time stamps, validation data and even  archival-related material) is incorporated to the signatures for making them more resilient to change or for  enlarging their longevity. Indeed, when the signature needs to be validated after its creation it is necessary  to check, e.g., that the certificate was not revoked at the time of the signature. If a revocation occurred  between the time of the signature and the time of validation, the verifier needs to be sure that the  signature was created BEFORE that time of revocation. The augmentation can be done either by the  signatory, or by the relying party or by a TSP that validates or preserve the signature on behalf of the  signatory or the relying party. E.g. if someone asks another person to sign an acknowledgement of debt, it  is likely to be the case that the first person has some interest in the preservation of the signature (which is  not necessarily the case of the signatory). On the contrary, if the signature is not verified immediately by  the relying party, the signatory may have some interest in completing the signature, e.g., with a trusted  time stamp in order to provide a trusted evidence of the signing time. By this way it will be difficult for the  relying party to reject the signature in case of a subsequent problem with regard to the signature (e.g.  expiration of the signing certificate).  It is recommended that the first level of augmentation consists in time-stamping the signature.  Typically, the date of signing will be indicated in the signed document, at least if this plays a role in its legal  value or legal meaning but this may not be sufficient. For electronic documents, time stamping is a  possibility to avoid risks of tampering. An electronic time stamp is a data in electronic form which binds  other electronic data to a particular time establishing evidence that this data existed at that time. Time  stamping the signature provides the proof that it was created before the date indicated in the electronic  time stamp. This allows the verifier to position the date of the creation with regard to the date of a  possible revocation. This is not a condition sine qua non, but implementing it will remove a risk, support  validation, and enhance legal certainty.  In a signature with Long Term Validation Data, the set of validation material or references to it is  sufficient to ascertain the validation status of all end-entity certificates (signer certificate, time stamps  certificates, attribute certificates, etc.) contained in the signature.  There can be more elements than necessary and can also be fewer elements than necessary if it is  expected that recipients have an alternative mean of obtaining relevant proofs of existence on these  elements.  Before algorithms, keys, and other cryptographic data used at the time a signature was built become  weak and the cryptographic functions become vulnerable, or the certificates supporting previous time  stamp tokens expire or are revoked, the signed data, the signature as well as any additional information  should be protected by applying time stamp tokens.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  29  Such additional time stamp tokens are called archive validation data. The time stamping process should be  repeated in time before the protection provided by a previous time stamp token becomes weak and  should make use of stronger algorithms or longer key lengths than those that have been used in the  original signatures or time stamp tokens. These evidences added to the signature are often called Long- Term Validation Data.  6.4 ENHANCED  It is recommended that QES is further supported by ancillary qualified trust services.  Either for the simple validating of the QES, but also for its augmentation according to the term of  preservation, it is possible to request the support of qualified services:   qualified timestamps (as defined in Article 42 of the eIDAS Regulation)   qualified validation of QES (as defined in Article 33 of the eIDAS Regulation)   qualified preservation of QES (as defined in Article 34 of the eIDAS Regulation).  The way to verify that the provider is duly qualified is to check its presence in the trusted list of the  Member State where it operates. The presence of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services on the CPS  web site or folders is also a good indicator.  There is no obligation to call such QTS for the validation or the preservation of signature, but as any other  Qualified Service, their use provides users with a pretty good legal protection (i.e. in case of litigation the  burden of the proof lies on the QTPS).  Note:  Importance of evidences and proofs in case of disputes  In case of a dispute over an electronic signature message, one needs to look at all available evidences in  order to validate the signature and resolve the dispute.  The issues of the dispute may for example be that the signer denies having performed the signature at all,  or that the signer acknowledges having performed the signature, but for a different message, etc. Most of  the technical evidence can be found in the signed message and in documents that it refers to, such as the  certificate, the certification practices statement published by the CA (CPS) and the possibly used signature  policy, as described below. However, it should be noted that the signature may also require evidence of  the context in which the signature was created. For example, regardless of all technical evidence, the  signatory may still have been deceived or forced by violence to sign, or the signatory may not have  understood the document (e.g. it needs to be established that the document was written in a language  understandable to the signer).  Evidence present in the signature  Digital signatures generally bear with them a series of pieces of evidence, provided they are correctly  formatted (the reader may read CEN 419 040 for more detailed info). E.g. an unambiguous reference to  the signer’s certificate (the certificate itself or a reference to it), a time stamp and a certificate status  information that proves that the certificate was valid at the claimed time of signature-creation, etc. The  signature may also contain:   A commitment type, indicating the purpose of the signature.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  30   A location indicator, specifying the claimed location of the signatory,   A role under which the signature is applied,   A reference to the Signature Policy under which the signature is to be validated (see below)  The qualified certificate contains the following additional pieces of evidence:   a reference to the Certificate Policy and/or Certificate Practice Statement followed by the CA when  issuing the certificate (amongst other describing the security procedures for the CA, for example  relating to the protection of the signing key of the CA, the registration of the signatory, etc.);   different information to enquire about the validity status of the certificate (links toward Online  Certification Status Protocol (OCSP), blacklist of certificates (CRLs)), the period of validity of the  certificate, a link toward the CA certificate, a claim that the private key is located in a qualified  electronic signature creation device).  Optionally, the certificate may also contain:   limitations on the scope of use of the certificate, if applicable;   limits on the value of transactions for which the certificate can be used, if applicable.  Evidence through a Signature Policy  A signature policy is a set of rules for the creation and validation of an electronic signature, under which  the signature can be determined to be valid (see [3] and bibliography (b)), (as these considerations are not  in the scope of the eIDAS Regulation). A given legal/contractual context may recognise a particular  signature policy as meeting its requirements. An example of signature policy is the “evidence agreement”  through which Parties agree to accept the validity of signature type X to sign transactions. This is typically  included in terms and conditions of online banking application.  A signature policy may be issued, for example, by a party relying on the electronic signatures and selected  by the signer for use with that relying party. Alternatively, a signature policy may be established through  an electronic trading association for use amongst its members. Both the signer and verifier use the same  signature policy.  A signature policy may be implicit or explicit. The signature policy may be provided as part of the signed  document, out of band, or by other means. The signature policy may be explicitly identified or may be  implied by the semantics of the data being signed and/or other external data, like a contract being  referenced which itself refers to a signature policy, as well as by the signing context. An explicit signature  policy for open usage has a globally unique reference, which is bound to an electronic signature by the  signer as part of the signature calculation.  The signature policy may include the following:   rules for certification path construction/verification (including indication of trusted root  certificates to be used)   rules for use of revocation status information (e.g. CRLs or OCSP responses);   rules for use of timing information, time-marking and/or time stamping;   signature validation data to be provided by the signer;   signature validation data to be collected by the verifier.   the period during which signatures can be performed under that policy,  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  31   a list of recognised commitment types;   rules for the use of signer roles;   any constraints on signature algorithms and key lengths;   other signature policy rules required to meet the objectives of the signature.   rules for multiple signatures:  o for documents signed by multiple signers, it may be necessary to establish the order of  signing, and if all signers were present at the same place for signing.  o the signature policy should provide guidance on the actions to take (both at creation and  verification sides), if one or more of the signature(s) are not valid, etc.  Additional evidence that may be required:   Place of signing. In some contractual situations this is of importance, and may have to be proven.   Legal system to be applicable for the signed document.

Qualified electronic signatures – example of tools & practical usage  aspects  7.1 Implementing qualified electronic signatures (user perspective)  Signature creation tools  As mentioned previously, for creating a QES, the signatory needs (access to):   a qualified signature certificate,   a qualified signature creation device (QSCD) protecting the private key and enabling the signature  creation process (e.g. cryptographic computation),   a signature creation application managing the signature creation process (e.g. preparing the data  to be signed, allowing the signatory to use the QSCD, to enter the PIN, to select the certificate and  other signature creation parameters when applicable).  The signatory does not need to have all these elements in hand. A (Q)TSP may manage (some of) them on  his/her behalf. The strict minimum is that the signatory must be able to control the activation of the  private key.  Qualified certificate  Very probably, the first stakeholder that the signatory will meet in the framework of electronic signature  will be the CSP. There is even not necessarily a need to search for a CSP since in many European countries,  citizens are provided with electronic identity cards that bear digital certificate(s), and very often the  signature certificate is a qualified certificate.  When the signatory is required to acquire the certificate by himself, (s)he may be presented with several  options with regard to the information to be certified: the certificate may contain in addition to the “civil  identity” of the signatory, the name and identifier of an organisation with whom the citizen is associated  (e.g. his/her employer) and/or the indication of a role or mandate within an organisation.  Arguments for choice: a certificate with attributes help to evidence a role, function or belonging to an  organisation but needs to be re-issued if any one of these attributes changes.  Qualified signature creation device  With regard to the QSCD, the signatory may opt for a device in his/her hand, within his/her own  environment, or remotely managed by a TSP. When the QSCD is managed by a TSP, the device and the TSP  must be qualified. The way to verify that the provider is duly qualified is to check its presence in the trusted  list of the member state where it is established. The way to verify that the device is duly qualified is to check  its presence in the EC list of certified devices.  Arguments for choice: in the first case, the control by the signatory is higher, in the second case, the  mobility is enhanced.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  33  Signature creation application  There is no regulatory requirement on signature creation application. There are a variety of ways to  implement the signature creation.  On the one hand, the signature can be entirely performed within the signatory’s environment; the  signatory holds his/her signature creation device and signs with an application residing on his/her  computer. Quite a commonly used creation device is the smart card.  Example: a typical use case is the citizen that signs a pdf attestation thanks to his/her national electronic identity card.  The signatory may sign using his/her qualified signature creation device (e.g. eID) to create a QES on a data  (e.g. a PDF, a form) prepared by a server.  Example: a typical use case is the signature of the tax declaration, prepared by the government on its servers, possibly  completed online by the citizen, and whose fingerprint is locally signed by the citizen, with his/her eID card.  On the other hand, the signatory may rely on remote signature creation devices and facilities. As illustrated  below, it is possible to delegate a more or less important part of the signature creation process to a TSP. The  strict minimum is that the signatory must be able to control the activation of the private key. For this  purpose, the signatory must have the sole control on the authentication to her/his key. All the rest, even  including the management of the private key (generation, storage), may be delegated to a TSP and  implemented through a private key container. This may be really interesting from a user friendliness  perspective; the mobility is increased since the authentication towards the TSP may be limited to few  components (e.g. a mobile phone).  However, the signatory needs to trust the TSP for the sound protection of the private key when this one is  managed by the TSP. Thanks to the eIDAS Regulation, with regards to QES, the signature creation device  must be qualified (QSCD) and the TSP managing the private key(s) must be qualified (QTSP) and will be  supervised as part of the QSCD certification.  Example: a typical use case is the signature of bank transfers. This scenario can be concretised by a banking apps on a smart  phone through which the user connects to his/her bank. Via the apps the user enters the figures required for the bank transfer.  When the info is ready to be signed, a SMS containing a challenge is sent to the phone and the user needs to copy the challenge  via the apps to be authenticated; this allows the central server to activate and use the user’s private key to sign the transfer.  The authentication is considered as a strong authentication since the mobile phone communications are secure and the mobile  phone is supposed to be under the sole control of its owner. A variant of this example is the use of the mobile phone for the  authentication only, while the data to be signed preparation and the reception of the challenge occur via a web interface on the  user laptop; this a bit more secure since two distinct channels are used to convey the information (the laptop and the internet,  on the one hand, the mobile phone and the GPRS connection on the other hand).  Arguments for choice: When holding private keys, “in hands” the control by the signatory is higher. When  using remote signature creation facilities and devices, the mobility is enhanced.  Augmentation and preservation tools  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  34  As stated previously, for any type of AdES, where the signature is not verified immediately by the relying  party, the signatory (or relying party) may have some interest in completing the signature with a trusted  time stamp in order to provide a trusted evidence of the signing time. By this way it will be difficult for the  relying party to reject the signature in case of a subsequent problem with regard to the signature (e.g.  expiration of the signing certificate). Time stamping is not mandatory; it depends on the needs of the  relying party to be protected against potential repudiation of the signature by the signatory. Other events  may also affect the possibility to (re)validate the signature; e.g. the revocation of another certificate linked  to the signatory certificate (e.g. the CA certificate), the end of availability of information on the certificate  status by the CSP, etc. Hence, the signature should also be further enhanced with adequate proofs and  evidence by the relying party to overcome such events.  Concretely, the signatory (or relying party) may need to use an application that is able to:   Request time stamps from a time stamp service provider and to integrate the time stamp within the  signature. Generally, time stamping is a paying service that the signatory needs to buy on-the-fly or  needs to pay in advance.   Collect the required validation evidences and correctly format the signature according to the terms of  preservation.  The signatory (or relying party) may use the services of a TSP to do so. When the signature creation  application is provided in a remote way by a TSP, the service generally covers the augmentation and  preservation aspects. The TSP may further enhance the offering with storage (archiving) services.  Validation tools  The validation application needs to execute the validation process of a qualified electronic signature as  provisioned in Article 32 of the eIDAS Regulation. On top of the strictly cryptographic validation that the  digital signature is technically valid, the application must enable the relying party to validate the fact that  the signature is a QES: among others that the signatory’s certificate was issued by a QTSP, that the  certificate was both qualified and valid at the time of signing, the signature creation device is a QSCD, the  signatory’s data are correctly presented to the relying party, etc. Validations tools should consequently be  able to consume the EU MS national trusted lists to verify the qualified status of a QTSP/QTS.  For this purpose, the verifier may use an off-the shelf application, or can make use of the services from a  TSP that will perform the validation for him. In that latter case, the use of QTSP providing qualified  validation services of QES will bring more confidence and assurance to the verifier that the validation  process is correctly executed as the QTSP and the qualified services it provides will be under supervision  for meeting the eIDAS Regulation requirements.  7.2 Relevant standards regarding qualified electronic signatures (expert perspective)  Signature formats  When an organisation (e.g. administration, SME) decides to develop its own signature creation application  (whether to deploy it on its users environment or to offer it as a central service), the first recommendation  is to use standard and recognised signature formats, namely those referred to by CID (EU) 2015/1506  pursuant to Article 27 of the eIDAS Regulation).  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  35  Such standards are defined in ETSI TS 103 171 v.2.1.1. (XAdES Baseline Profile), ETSI TS 103 173 v.2.2.1.  (CAdES Baseline Profile), ETSI TS 103 172 v.2.2.2. (PAdES Baseline Profile) and ETSI TS 103 174 v2.2.1  (Associated Signature Container Baseline Profile). These standards support different formats and forms of  signatures, suitable for different terms of preservation (until very long term). Implementers are  recommended, whenever possible, to use the most advanced forms allowing for best guarantees not only  for long term, but also in case of many types of security breaches that might occur in the mid-term as well.  Newer versions of those standards are also available respectively as EN 319 122/132/142/162 series (see  ETSI TR 119 00012 for further guidance).  Specific implementations  When specific implementations are in place, e.g. for mass signing, they shall ensure:   that no data can be introduced in the flow of data to be signed (network and application protection  required);   that the user is aware that more than one document is to be signed that the data to be signed are  correctly “displayed”.  EC funded DSS Open source libraries  With regards to off-the-shelf toolkits allowing more integrated solutions, the EC funded the development  of the DSS toolkits, as part of the CEF eSignature building block, available from Join-up where a cookbook  is also made available for use and integration of such toolkits for the creation and validation of QES.13  Policies and security requirements for applications for signature creation and signature validation  ETSI TS 119 101 provides general security and policy requirements for applications for signature creation,  validation and augmentation. The document covers legal driven policy requirements, information security  (management system) requirements, signature creation, signature validation and signature augmentation  processes requirements, development and coding policy requirements and additional general  requirements. Protection Profiles (PP) for signature creation applications and signature validation  applications are out of scope and are defined in the CEN EN 419 111 standard \"Protection Profiles for  Signature Creation & Validation Applications\".  An important tool for relying Parties is probably ETSI TS 119 172 [3] series on signature policies. This series  of standards allows the definition and specifications of the rules to be applied during creation,  augmentation and/or validation of signatures, and how to fix the parameters for declaring a signature  conformant to the specified rules.  12 ETSI TR 119 000 V1.2.1 (2016-04): “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); The framework for  standardization of signatures: overview”.  13 EC funded eSignature's DSS has been published on both JoinUp and the CEF Digital Portal, issues are handled via  the DSS JIRA. All future releases and issue management will be available through the CEF Digital portal.  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119000_119099/119000/01.02.01_60/tr_119000v010201p.pdf https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/asset_release/all https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=23003381 https://esig-dss.atlassian.net/projects/DSS/issues  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  36  Annex A - Glossary  eIDAS – What is it?  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification (eID) and  trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation is about trust,  seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  Electronic seal  An electronic seal is a piece of data in electronic form, created by a legal person, which is attached to or  logically associated with an electronic document (or data) to ensure its origin and integrity.  It is similar in the paper world to the dry seal of a company on a piece of paper to indicate that the  document originates from the company and make it authentic and official.  Hash value (of a file)  A hash value is a standardised and unique summary of a message, which is obtained by applying a specific  cryptographic tool called a cryptographic hash function.  A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed  size, with slight differences in input data producing very big differences in output data.  A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which has specific security properties:   It is considered practically impossible to recreate the input message from its hash value;   It is considered practically impossible to compute from a specific message a second message that  has the same hash value (i.e. different messages lead to different hash values);   It is considered practically impossible to find two different messages that would lead to the same  hash value (no collisions)  With such properties, when applied to the same message repetitively the hash value is always the same,  while if the message is slightly modified (even by one single bit) the hash value will always be different.  That allows to verify the integrity of a message compared to the message on which the hash was  previously computed; when the hash values are identical, then the messages are identical.  As cryptographic hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, they are  often used with digital signatures. Signing a hash value is more efficient than signing the larger value.  Intellectual property  Intellectual property is the collective term for rights to intellectual creations such as books, music,  trademarks, designs, inventions, software, texts and photographs. A single creation may be protected by  multiple rights at the same time. The best-known intellectual property rights are trademark rights,  copyrights and patent rights.  Trusted list  A trusted list is a list including information related to the qualified trust service providers which are  established in and supervised by an EU Member State, together with information related to the qualified  trust services provided by them, in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in Regulation (EU)  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  37  No 910/2014. Those lists have constitutive value and are primary source of information to validate that a  qualified status is or has been granted to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides.  Trusted lists are essential elements in building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users  to determine the qualified status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on non-qualified trust service providers,  together with information related to the non-qualified trust services provided by them. It shall be clearly  indicated that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  Member States may include in the trusted lists information on nationally defined trust services of other  types than those defined under Article 3(16) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014. It shall be clearly indicated  that they are not qualified according to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.  QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  The eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 foresees a set of requirements and obligations for qualified trust  service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide in order to ensure high-level  security of the qualified trust services. Those obligations include in a nutshell:  - Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  - Trust service provider (TSP) is liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or  legal person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation, while the intention  or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTS. When TSP informed  customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services, and when such limitations are  recognisable to third parties, TSP is not liable when limitations have been exceeded.  - Where feasible, services must be accessible for person with disabilities.  - Implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments,  those measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. Measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the  adverse effects of any such incidents.  - Very strict rules regarding the obligation of notifying security & personal data breaches.  - Additional requirements on QTSP operations and practices:  - Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease;  - Up-to-date termination plan, agreed with the competent supervisory body (SB), to ensure  continuity of service;  - Requirements on employed staff and subcontractors, when used;  - Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  - Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. on limitations on use;  - Use of trustworthy systems and products ensuring the technical security and reliability of the  supported processes;  - Use of trustworthy systems to store (personal) data in a verifiable form;  - Take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data; and  - Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received, even after cessation of  activities.  - Specific requirements from the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to the  provision of a specific type of qualified trust service.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  38  All those requirements must be met by the QTSP/QTS before issuing the very first qualified trust service  output, i.e. before issuing the very first qualified time stamp in the case of QTSP providing qualified time  stamping services.  Once granted a qualified status, the eIDAS Regulation also foresees an active supervision scheme of  qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national  competent supervisory body (SB) to monitor fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations  throughout their lifetime.  CEF eSignature building blocks  The Connecting Europe Facility14 (CEF) supports trans- European networks and infrastructures in the  sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy. It provides public administrations and businesses of  reusable building blocks. Building blocks supported so far include: eIdentification; eSignature; eInvoicing;  eDelivery; and Automated Translation.  The eSignature building block helps public administrations and businesses to accelerate the creation and  verification of electronic signatures. The deployment of this building block in a Member State facilitates  the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, so that the legal value of  electronic documents can be recognized in other countries than the country of origin of the signer. This  means that public administrations and businesses can trust and use eSignatures that are valid and  structured in EU interoperable formats15,16.  The CEF eSignature solution17 consists of open source advisory services (Libraries, including source code,  artefacts, bundle for demonstration and cookbook) managed by the European Commission allowing the  creation and verification of electronic signatures, including the use of time stamps.  For more information about these services, please refer to the Digital Signature Service available from  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home.  Trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally provided for  remuneration which consists of:  (a) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related to those services, or  (b) the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  (c) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  14 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility.  15 CID (EU) 2011/130 establishing minimum requirements for the cross-border processing of documents signed  electronically by competent authorities under Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.  16 CID (EU) 2015/1506 laying down specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced  seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on  eID and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  17 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature.  https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/sd-dss/home https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/connecting-europe-facility https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/cef/og_page/catalogue-building-blocks#eSignature  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  39  Qualified trust services defined by the eIDAS Regulation  Only those trust services listed in Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for which there are applicable  requirements in the Regulation can benefit from the qualified status. eIDAS regulates the following nine  qualified trust services:  1. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures  Certificates for electronic signature are electronic attestations which link electronic signature  validation data to a natural person and confirm at least the name or the pseudonym of that  person. Since 1 July 2016, an electronic signature can only be used by a natural person to sign, i.e.  mainly to express consent on the signed data/document. This represents a significant difference  from the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC regime where an electronic signature, which could be  used by legal persons, was defined as a means of authentication. Under the eIDAS Regulation, the  entity who creates an electronic signature (the so called signatory) will be a natural person.  Therefore, certificates for electronic signature cannot be issued to legal persons anymore. Instead  legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals (see below).  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic signatures is an essential element for a signatory to  create qualified electronic signatures that shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten  signature all over the EU.  2. The provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals  As explained above, since 1 July 2016, legal persons cannot create legally valid (qualified)  electronic signatures anymore and cannot be issued (qualified) certificates for electronic  signatures. Instead legal persons can use certificates for electronic seals, which are electronic  attestations that link electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirm the name of that  person. The aim of an electronic seal is not to sign but to serve as an evidence that an electronic  data/document was issued by a legal person, ensuring certainty of the data/document’s origin and  integrity.  A qualified electronic certificate for electronic seals is an essential element for a legal person to  create qualified electronic seals that shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of integrity of  the data and of correctness of the origin of that data to which the qualified electronic seal is  linked.  3. The provision of qualified certificates for website authentication  Certificates for website authentication are issued to ensure the users (in particular citizens and  SMEs) that behind the website there is a legal or natural person identifiable by trustworthy  information.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for qualified website authentication certificates to be  considered trustworthy together with obligations for qualified trust service providers of such  qualified certificates with regard to the security of their operations, their liability and their  supervision regime. As a consequence, the Regulation ensures transparency regarding the quality  of the service offered to users, accountability of providers with regard to security of their services,  trustworthiness of the data associated to qualified authenticated websites and technological  neutrality of services and solutions.  4. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic signatures over extended  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  40  periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological  changes.  5. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals  Such a qualified trust service aims to ensure the long-term preservation of information, in order to  ensure the legal validity and trustworthiness of qualified electronic seals over extended periods of  time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future technological changes.  6. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  Validation of electronic signature is an ancillary service to electronic signatures whose process  aims to confirm the validity of an electronic signature.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures entail the verification by a qualified  trust service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified  electronic signature in order to confirm its validity.  7. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals  Validation of electronic seal is an ancillary service to electronic seals whose process aims to  confirm the validity of an electronic seal.  Qualified validation services for qualified electronic seals entail the verification by a qualified trust  service provider that the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation are met by a qualified electronic  seal in order to confirm its validity.  8. Qualified electronic time stamps services  Electronic time stamps are issued to ensure the correctness of the time linked to data/documents.  Qualified electronic time stamp shall enjoy, all over the EU, the presumption of the accuracy of the  date and the time it indicates and the integrity of the data to which the date and time are bound.  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery services  By relying on a qualified electronic registered delivery service, one will benefit, all over the EU,  from the presumption of the integrity of the registered data, the sending of that data by the  identified sender, its receipt by the identified addressee and the accuracy of the date and time of  sending and receipt indicated by that qualified trust service.  The Regulation sets clear requirements for all such qualified trust services to be considered trustworthy  together with obligations for their qualified trust service providers with regard to the security of their  operations, their liability and their supervision regime.

However, and depending  on the concrete environment the use case is applied in, the “strength/rigorousness” with which the  recommendations should be applied might be less or more severe.  Dimensions that could have an impact  on the “strength/rigorousness” of applying the recommendations, are the criticality of the processes  and/or data being involved in the business process which is being supported by the respective qualified  trust service. So, without intending to be complete as a risk assessment depends of the concrete  environment/context in which the organization is operating, some dimensions which might be considered  to determine the risk-profile of the process and/or data being protected (and therefor the minimum  “strength/rigorousness” to apply) are:   Business critical data & processes:  organizations store or process information that can have a less  or more significant impact on their own organization and/or their partners and/or their clients.  Examples of potential risks are e.g. loss of integrity of a database, compromise of business- confidential data, incorrect contracting-data, etc.   Data & processes with potential financial impact:  organization (especially but not only financial  industry related organizations) have several processes which might have direct financial impact for  themselves, for their partners and/or their clients ranging from amounts e.g. below a thousand  euros to amounts going into millions of euros. Examples of potential risks are e.g.: faulty validation  of signatures on mandates or payment instructions, rogue / criminal impersonation of third party  providers, hacking of personnel or corporate accounts, false invoices, etc.   Personal data (processing):  Personal data is clearly a very complex and high risk matter. The  scope of personal data is very broad, ranging from less delicate personal data, to directly  identifiable information to sensitive personal data. The more sensitive the data the stronger and  more rigorous one should apply the recommendations. Examples of potential risks are:  fines of up  to 4% of the global annual revenues of a company, embarrassment due to faulty access personal  information, unauthorized access/manipulation to e.g. biometric data, responding to a request- for-info based on an incorrect signed request, health data getting exposed / delivered incorrectly,  authenticity/integrity of critical health records being non-verifiable, etc.  Note:  We stress that the above are just examples of possible areas to consider to assess the risk-profile of  the process and/or data being protected. Depending on the reader’s environment other dimensions might  apply depending on regulation, corporate policies, contractual obligations, etc.  B.2 Determining applicable criticality-levels and derive resulting minimum applicable  recommendations  Following the above, it is proposed that organizations do their own analyses and following map their  processes / data-to-be-processed onto the following “criticality-levels”:   “Standard” would entail any usage of a trust service under normal circumstance like but not  limited to use cases e.g. involving financial exchange of a rather limited amount, personal records  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  45  with limited potential impact, or access to data/services of a limited classification level (e.g.  internal/restraint).   “Advanced” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where more precautions /  prudence is to be advised like cases which involve financial exchange of a rather important  magnitude, personal records with rather important impact if going wrong, or access to  data/services of a higher classification level like company-confidential.   “Sensitive” would entail any usage of a trust service in a context where sensitive data is being  involved, e.g. involving financial exchanges of a significant amount, personal record access of  personal sensitive information, or access to data/services of a high classification level  like company-/commercial-secret.  Based on the above “criticality-levels”, one can easily see how the levels (Basic, Recommended, Enhanced)  can match to these levels:   Basic would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “standard” level of criticality.   Recommended would entail the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is  involved in a (trans)action that involves data/services of an “advanced” level of criticality.   Enhanced would be the recommendations to-be-considered at the moment one is involved in a  (trans)action that involves data/services of a “sensitive” level of criticality.

OJ L 109, 26.4.2016, p. 40–42  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  47  Annex D - Frequently asked questions  What about the (international) recognition of electronic signatures (within  Europe)?  A qualified electronic signature (QES) shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature and  shall be recognised as a qualified electronic signature in all Member States; since QES bear with them the  proofs (or the links enabling the automatic validation through trusted sources) that they are qualified, they  shall never be refused by anybody in any European Member States. In case of litigation it is up to the  requesting party to proof that the signature is not qualified. There is quasi no risk of rejection with QES.  AdES also benefit from a legal recognition, but the burden of proving that the AdES is an AdES as per the  EU Regulation N° 910/2014 is on the signatory. In case of litigation the confirmation or information will  come from experts hired by the tribunal. There is a risk of rejection with AdES (depending on the quality of  the AdES; i.e. level of quality and of assurance on the CA and level of quality and assurance on the SCDev).  In all cases, the EU Regulation N° 910/2014 further supports the recognition of AdES through its Article 46  on electronic documents; “an electronic document shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as  evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in electronic form”. It means that no one can  refuse an AdES because the signed document is not in a paper form.  What about the (international) recognition of electronic signatures (outside  Europe)?  From a legal perspective, the automatic mutual recognition of QES will come from international  agreements between the Union and the foreign countries. Per Article 14 of the EU Regulation N°  910/2014, such agreements shall ensure that;  (a) the requirements applicable to qualified trust service providers established in the Union and the qualified  trust services they provide are met by the trust service providers in the third country or international  organisations with which the agreement is concluded, and by the trust services they provide;  (b) the qualified trust services provided by qualified trust service providers established in the Union are  recognised as legally equivalent to trust services provided by trust service providers in the third country  or international organisation with which the agreement is concluded.  Even in the absence of such agreement, and this is anyway true for the AdES (non-QES), thanks to the  international standards, the international recognition is possible. Many countries use schemes for  assessing the security of their trust service provider; both the assessment process and the criteria used  to assess the TSPs follow standards that, when not exactly the same as the ones used within Europe,  are comparable to our standards. Yet probably not easy for the citizen, it is not that complex for an IT  professional to assess whether an AdES received from a third country is comparable to an AdES issued  in Europe. For international relationships, the citizen is encouraged to take advice from his/her CA, e.g.  in order to verify interoperability of his/her signature.  Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures  |  Version 2.0  |  Final  |  DECEMBER 2016  48  eIDAS Regulation – Questions and answers on rules applicable to trust services as  of 1 July 2016  The European Commission complied a Q&A document to help fully understanding the new legal  framework in order to implement it or reap the benefits of electronic transactions.  The complied a Q&A document is available from https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas.

The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European  Commission DG CONNECT and Partners  followed a strong partnership for the implementation of  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) in 2014.  Action!  During October at the local level  In October, the community has pinpointed the following weekly Network and Information Security  topics on the agenda:   1st  week: Training employees, targeting  public and private organisations   2nd week: PC and mobile security protection and updates, targeting all digital users;   3rd  week: Coding,  targeting students   4th  week: Cyber security exercises, targeting technical expertise;   5th  week: ePrivacy, targeting all digital users  With a good reach proved by online analytics, with a good participation rate evidenced by the  number of countries, with a significant motivation for future edition verified by coordinators  replies, we can conclude that the European Cyber Security Month 2014 edition was very  successful.  However much more must be done in order for EU citizens to benefit the most and we  suggest recommendations in the last chapter.  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/en/content/dg-connect http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/partners https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 Introduction 1  2 Implementation 4  2.1 Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level 4  2.2 Enhance Content of ECSM 8  2.3 Improve International Cooperation 10  3 Evaluation 11  4 Conclusions 14  References 15  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  1  1 Introduction  ECSM is an EU advocacy campaign that promotes cyber security among citizens and advocates for  change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting data and information security, education,  sharing of good practices and competitions.  The objective of this report is to:  1. Present this preparatory work;  2. Carry out an objective evaluation by setting up an external survey open to the ECSM  coordinators;  3. Draw conclusions that can be used in future editions of the ECSM.  European Cyber Security Month 2014 has been designed to be an advocacy campaign focused on  Member States of the EU also involving partners. The project life cycle included coordinators calls,  webinars, face-to-face meetings, monthly news updates, high-level launch event, website resources,  and weekly publication of materials. A short summary of the campaign includes:  -  A coordinated EU campaign in the area of NIS that takes place every year in October;  -  This campaign brings together Member States’ (MS) activities under a common agenda.  Through this mechanism ENISA seeks to promote the transfer of good practices, know-how  across MSs and network between teams;  -  ENISA plays the role of a facilitator or of a broker. However, the MS are responsible for their  own activities as well as the macro management of the ECSM. The decision on the direction  of the ECSM 2014 was taken in consultation with representatives of the Italian and  Luxemburg teams as part of the macro management team motivated by their EU  Presidencies (IT during October 2014, LU during October 2015);  -  For this purpose an enlarged team comprised of representatives by all MS (involved in  national campaigns) is formed, supported by ENISA;  - Although the ECSM only lasts for one month (as the name suggests) it requires intensive  preparation in advance. There is scope in saving time after the October, to carry out the  evaluation of the activities accomplished throughout October.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  2  Some quotes  Commissioner VP Kroes’ statement for the ECSM: \"The Internet and its many  services bring many benefits to our society: not least significant growth of our  economy and millions of jobs. But we need to build and restore trust if we really  want to achieve those benefits. When it comes to cyber security, it is in our  common interest to be much more responsive and resilient to cyber threats.  ENISA can both play an operational and a strategic role to ensure that Europe is  ready for the challenge, together with public and private parties.  Each one of us  must play our part in the cyber-security challenge: every citizen, every business,  and every government. So I hope that the European Cyber Security Month raises  more awareness – let's get people talking!\"  ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “The internet of things, where every  electronic device will be uniquely accessible and identifiable over the internet, is approaching quickly.  This has a profound impact on all aspects of citizens’ everyday life, as e-services are all now totally  dependent on an open, safe and secure cyberspace. These are the technologies that are being built  today and that will deliver the services of the future.  It is therefore essential for citizens to participate actively in  improving information security, for ENISA to facilitate  improvement processes and for Member States to ensure that  security policy supports the internet based economy envisaged for  Europe 2020. Year by year we have been consolidating this trust  partnership for Cyber Security Month and I am honoured to see  the high level of engagement from partners. On behalf of my  team, thank you all! ”.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  3  Target audience  ECSM is an annual advocacy campaign that includes both the general public , acting as  ‘EU digital  citizens’ and specific groups focused on Member States stakeholders from public and private  organisations e.g. IT experts, NIS authoroties, etc .  The engagement model that ENISA uses is depicted  in the graphic below. It represents the stakeholders that are involved in the ECSM and the way the  Agency implements the brokerage role. The ECSM campaign is supported by ENISA and DG CONNECT,  the main contact in member states are through the National Laison Officers-  NLO1 network, partners  from public and private organisations, and networks of multipliers e.g. Europe Direct. Furthermore  the composition of the NLO network includes Member States representatives - one from each EU and  EEA country. A representative from the European Commission and a representative from the Council  of the European Union are also part of the network. Although not formally based on the ENISA  Regulation, this network is of great value to ENISA, as the NLOs serve as ENISA’s important point of  reference into the Member States on specific issues. ENISA also gains access to a network of national  contacts through individual NLOs, reinforcing the activity of the Agency in the Member States.  Graph engagement model  Structure of this document  This document will present to the reader the organisational aspects of the ECSM 2014 putting things  into perspective. We will refer to the motivation and concept behind the month, participation, and  evaluation including analytics. The evaluation report from 2013 with its recommendations was taken  into account and we refer to each of the recommendations giving details about the follow-up  implemented  in 2014.  1 ENISA has set up this network of National Liaison Officers (NLOs).  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  4  2 Implementation  The European Cyber Security Month 2014 benefited from planning that took into consideration  recommendations from the roadmap released in the previous year. In 2013, the main  recommendations2  regarding future editions of the advocacy campaign were grouped into three  pillars:  Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level   Plan in advance all steps and communicate them   Improve content and participation   Improve interactivity  Enhance Content of ECSM   Continue the development of repository of materials   Keep encouraging private-public common activities   Introduce a best practice section on the website  Improve International Cooperation   Exploring common webinars and e-learning solutions   Develop an International training kit for NIS activities   Advance planning  In the following sections we will briefly present how the lessons learned from 2013 were imlemented.  2.1 Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level  In the beginning of the year, the ECSM team 3  organized consultation meetings with the main  stakeholders, e.g. NLOs, DG CONNECT, CODE Week team, US NCSM, at European level and  international level and completed a detailed plan well in advance of the event.  Moreover all steps  were explained on many occasions and communicated to all stakeholders. The strategy was then  mapped to a timeline and used in order to build coalitions and reach other actors.  More milestones were identified and more synergy actions were built with other networks. For  example this timeline shows the coordination calls but it doesn’t include about all the other planning  steps4 that were agreed with multipliers like Europe Direct, Code Week, Safer Internet, and US NCSM.  2 Roadmap for ECSM, 2013 report http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage- 1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2013  3 ECSM  core team consisted of: ENISA, DG CONNECT, IT and LU representatives  4 E.g. common publication of material, international Twitter chat, etc.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2013  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  5  Timeline with 2014 planning  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  6  Additionally in order to improve content and participation, both in terms of quality and quantity, the  website www.cybersecuritymonth.eu represented the single main stop for citizens to look for  information and the place for ECSM coordinators to update details about activities taking place at the  local level. The site management was done by ENISA, but MSs Coordinators retained full control and  responsibility for their content. Changes and updates were supported by the team.  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  7  In order to improve interactivity, the team released a Network and information Security Quiz5 for  users. The audience for this quiz was the broader public and the quiz was intended to combine an  entertaining activity with a serious goal: offer an opportunity for participants to familiarise themselves  with some of the key themes of NIS education and some of the ENISA recommendations, including  material developed in recent years by ENISA through its work. Some questions are also directly  connected to the concepts introduced in the first part of this report.  The quiz contains 10 NIS questions and in total, together with input forms, it should take  approximately 10 minutes to complete. Each question starts with a short narrative and then a dilemma  or a direct question. For each answer (either correct or not) there is then a short  explanation/discussion with some further suggestions. A profile will be generated based on the overall  result of the quiz. The profile can be one of the following:  1. Beginner: with limited number of correct answers. This profile signals limited level of skills or  knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  2. Intermediate: good number of correct answers. This profile has a reasonable level of skills and  knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  3. Advanced: high number of correct answers. This profile has an excellent level of skills and  knowledge of NIS (according to quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  For each generated profile further indications are offered in terms of documentation and material to  consult with particular attention to ENISA reports. At the low and medium levels there is also the  suggestion for attempting the next confidence level quiz.  The application is available on the website6 from October 2014 as a pilot with a possibility of renewal  after the first evaluation.

As a result of this ECSM achieved great impact  with more activities in all countries, a sample on how the calendar looked like below.  In addition, the Agency introduced a best practice section on the website. The team promoted the  stories and work of champions7 of cyber security from member states.  AT: Marion Marschalek  I personally found fascination in dissecting software. The more I dissect, the better I understand, the  more I love to learn more. I think every human is naturally driven to learn, to build and to improve; but  when I started this, I admit, all the binaries did not look all that appealing to me.  I had to take a second look, then a third one, understanding a bit more every time, and finally having  fun dragging all my new knowledge together. And now... I do this every day, with passion.  RO: Andrei Avădănei  Challenge yourself and learn by participating to DefCamp.  UK: Chris D Doman  Without the UK's Cyber Security Challenge I probably wouldn't have found myself in such an exciting  position, and campaigns such as ECSM are key to getting more people to realize how much their  passions for technology are needed, both right now, and for the foreseeable future.  7 Direct link http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/cyber-security-ambassadors  http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/cyber-security-ambassadors  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  10  2.3 Improve International Cooperation  The ECSM team entered very early into consultation and advance planning with the counterparts from  the NCSM- National Cyber Security Month US. This supported establishing good contacts and common  actions between teams. Furthermore the following was achieved in collaboration:  1. Panel with representatives of NCSAM and  ECSM for promoting Cyber Security Month  during IGF- Internet Governance Forum 2014  Istanbul;  2. Publication of a report: “Public Private  Partnerships in Network and Information  Security Education”8;  3. International Twitter chat on tips to follow for NIS security;  4. Publication of “Mobile Tips” for users,  important to mention that this common actions  is already at the 2nd consecutive edition9;  5. NCSM representative in the Launch  event of ECSM in Brussels.  We believe that the international cooperation has a real potential to grow,  however a multi annual planning with clear milestones is currently missing and it  should be agreed in advance.  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in- network-and-information-security-education  9 http://stopthinkconnect.org/campaigns/details/?id=442  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  11  3 Evaluation  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work are the EU citizens, targeted by different categories,  as well as end user organisations from public and private sectors (in particular in the area of EU NIS  education). These stakeholders were expected to reap the following benefits:  • Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice sharing  community;  • Improve and enhance contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles.  • Increase citizens’ awareness and governance on privacy when using online tools.  Coordinators in the Member States played a central role in achieving these benefits.  This is why in  order to evaluate this edition of the campaign we set up a survey and asked a number of questions to  get their feedback.  The survey was closed and  focused on the coordinators involved in the campaign.  The charts below present their replies, 29 participants in total. In comparison to previous editions we  improved the phase of the evaluation taken into account larger consultation in order to avoid biases  and integrate more opinions in the future planning of ECSM.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  12  Furthermore the replies from the charts of the evaluation of European Cyber Security Month 2014  clearly show that:  - Several communication channels have to be used and Twitter cannot be used exclusively, we  may further use coordination calls, meetings, newsletters;  - The coordination team responded to the needs of the coordinators;  - ECSM brings added value and there is a clear statement of continuation;  - ENISA reports and material are used by the community;  - More effort has to be put in communicating all the material produced by ENISA and MSs.  These early conclusions will be complemented at a later stage by qualitative information (e.g.  assessment of the NIS Quiz through focus group) and used for the planning and deployment for next  editions.  It is presented below some other graphs regarding the use of the website, twitter reach and map with  geographical spread of the activities.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  13   Website sessions during the period end September to end October   Twitter performance   Media reach   Comparison 2013 vs 2014 in numbers:   Countries involved 2013: 27, 2014:30;   Twitter followers 2013: 964; 2014: 2223;   Kick off participation 2013: approx. 100 in total; 2014: approx. 200;   Materials published 2013: 2; 2014: 5 general and 2 tools e.g. NIS universities map and  NIS quiz;   Activities taken place: 2013: 115 vs 2014: more than 184 [some countries like NO and  SE encoded one general entry for tens of local activities; e.g. in annex CZ example in  infographics].  The annual editions of ECSM improve each year the beneficiaries reach, e.g. 2014 vs 2013. However  more could be done if more partners would join and participate according to the engagement model  e.g. public- private partnerships.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  14  4 Conclusions  The Agency will continue to support the European Cyber Security Month, but will aim to continually  increase, according to the work programme 2015-2016, the  involvement of Member States in the  coordination and deployment.  We call on Member States to promote and inform their NIS stakeholders on time!  We call on the European Commission to further provision on translations and support the  coordinators!  In recent years, the European Cyber Security Month has expanded its outreach with numerous  activities in the Member States, reaching a large number of European citizens. In 2015 and 2016 the  work programme10 mentions the ECSM will be further developed following its basic principles,  namely:  • Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  • Encourage common public-private activities.  • Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  Moreover Member States are encouraged to develop ownership of the campaign and support:  Building together a joint EU advocacy campaign on NIS topics!  10 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  15  References  ENISA  [1] www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  [2] www.enisa.europa.eu  [3] \"An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace\" EU Cyber Security Strategy  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  [4] ENISA Work Programme 2015 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes- reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  16  Annex A:  An infographic from MSs: CZ ECSM in numbers  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  17  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN TP-04-14-679-EN-N  978-92-9204-092-5  10.2824/3270  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

The objective of this report is to:  1. Present this preparatory work;  2. Carry out an objective evaluation by setting up an external survey open to the ECSM  coordinators;  3. Draw conclusions that can be used in future editions of the ECSM.  European Cyber Security Month 2014 has been designed to be an advocacy campaign focused on  Member States of the EU also involving partners. The project life cycle included coordinators calls,  webinars, face-to-face meetings, monthly news updates, high-level launch event, website resources,  and weekly publication of materials. A short summary of the campaign includes:  -  A coordinated EU campaign in the area of NIS that takes place every year in October;  -  This campaign brings together Member States’ (MS) activities under a common agenda.  Through this mechanism ENISA seeks to promote the transfer of good practices, know-how  across MSs and network between teams;  -  ENISA plays the role of a facilitator or of a broker. However, the MS are responsible for their  own activities as well as the macro management of the ECSM. The decision on the direction  of the ECSM 2014 was taken in consultation with representatives of the Italian and  Luxemburg teams as part of the macro management team motivated by their EU  Presidencies (IT during October 2014, LU during October 2015);  -  For this purpose an enlarged team comprised of representatives by all MS (involved in  national campaigns) is formed, supported by ENISA;  - Although the ECSM only lasts for one month (as the name suggests) it requires intensive  preparation in advance. There is scope in saving time after the October, to carry out the  evaluation of the activities accomplished throughout October.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  2  Some quotes  Commissioner VP Kroes’ statement for the ECSM: \"The Internet and its many  services bring many benefits to our society: not least significant growth of our  economy and millions of jobs. But we need to build and restore trust if we really  want to achieve those benefits. When it comes to cyber security, it is in our  common interest to be much more responsive and resilient to cyber threats.  ENISA can both play an operational and a strategic role to ensure that Europe is  ready for the challenge, together with public and private parties.  Each one of us  must play our part in the cyber-security challenge: every citizen, every business,  and every government. So I hope that the European Cyber Security Month raises  more awareness – let's get people talking!\"  ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “The internet of things, where every  electronic device will be uniquely accessible and identifiable over the internet, is approaching quickly.  This has a profound impact on all aspects of citizens’ everyday life, as e-services are all now totally  dependent on an open, safe and secure cyberspace. These are the technologies that are being built  today and that will deliver the services of the future.  It is therefore essential for citizens to participate actively in  improving information security, for ENISA to facilitate  improvement processes and for Member States to ensure that  security policy supports the internet based economy envisaged for  Europe 2020. Year by year we have been consolidating this trust  partnership for Cyber Security Month and I am honoured to see  the high level of engagement from partners. On behalf of my  team, thank you all! ”.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  3  Target audience  ECSM is an annual advocacy campaign that includes both the general public , acting as  ‘EU digital  citizens’ and specific groups focused on Member States stakeholders from public and private  organisations e.g. IT experts, NIS authoroties, etc .  The engagement model that ENISA uses is depicted  in the graphic below. It represents the stakeholders that are involved in the ECSM and the way the  Agency implements the brokerage role. The ECSM campaign is supported by ENISA and DG CONNECT,  the main contact in member states are through the National Laison Officers-  NLO1 network, partners  from public and private organisations, and networks of multipliers e.g. Europe Direct. Furthermore  the composition of the NLO network includes Member States representatives - one from each EU and  EEA country. A representative from the European Commission and a representative from the Council  of the European Union are also part of the network. Although not formally based on the ENISA  Regulation, this network is of great value to ENISA, as the NLOs serve as ENISA’s important point of  reference into the Member States on specific issues. ENISA also gains access to a network of national  contacts through individual NLOs, reinforcing the activity of the Agency in the Member States.  Graph engagement model  Structure of this document  This document will present to the reader the organisational aspects of the ECSM 2014 putting things  into perspective. We will refer to the motivation and concept behind the month, participation, and  evaluation including analytics. The evaluation report from 2013 with its recommendations was taken  into account and we refer to each of the recommendations giving details about the follow-up  implemented  in 2014.  1 ENISA has set up this network of National Liaison Officers (NLOs).  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  4  2 Implementation  The European Cyber Security Month 2014 benefited from planning that took into consideration  recommendations from the roadmap released in the previous year. In 2013, the main  recommendations2  regarding future editions of the advocacy campaign were grouped into three  pillars:  Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level   Plan in advance all steps and communicate them   Improve content and participation   Improve interactivity  Enhance Content of ECSM   Continue the development of repository of materials   Keep encouraging private-public common activities   Introduce a best practice section on the website  Improve International Cooperation   Exploring common webinars and e-learning solutions   Develop an International training kit for NIS activities   Advance planning  In the following sections we will briefly present how the lessons learned from 2013 were imlemented.  2.1 Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level  In the beginning of the year, the ECSM team 3  organized consultation meetings with the main  stakeholders, e.g. NLOs, DG CONNECT, CODE Week team, US NCSM, at European level and  international level and completed a detailed plan well in advance of the event.  Moreover all steps  were explained on many occasions and communicated to all stakeholders. The strategy was then  mapped to a timeline and used in order to build coalitions and reach other actors.  More milestones were identified and more synergy actions were built with other networks. For  example this timeline shows the coordination calls but it doesn’t include about all the other planning  steps4 that were agreed with multipliers like Europe Direct, Code Week, Safer Internet, and US NCSM.  2 Roadmap for ECSM, 2013 report http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage- 1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2013  3 ECSM  core team consisted of: ENISA, DG CONNECT, IT and LU representatives  4 E.g. common publication of material, international Twitter chat, etc.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2013  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  5  Timeline with 2014 planning  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  6  Additionally in order to improve content and participation, both in terms of quality and quantity, the  website www.cybersecuritymonth.eu represented the single main stop for citizens to look for  information and the place for ECSM coordinators to update details about activities taking place at the  local level. The site management was done by ENISA, but MSs Coordinators retained full control and  responsibility for their content. Changes and updates were supported by the team.  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  7  In order to improve interactivity, the team released a Network and information Security Quiz5 for  users. The audience for this quiz was the broader public and the quiz was intended to combine an  entertaining activity with a serious goal: offer an opportunity for participants to familiarise themselves  with some of the key themes of NIS education and some of the ENISA recommendations, including  material developed in recent years by ENISA through its work. Some questions are also directly  connected to the concepts introduced in the first part of this report.  The quiz contains 10 NIS questions and in total, together with input forms, it should take  approximately 10 minutes to complete. Each question starts with a short narrative and then a dilemma  or a direct question. For each answer (either correct or not) there is then a short  explanation/discussion with some further suggestions. A profile will be generated based on the overall  result of the quiz. The profile can be one of the following:  1. Beginner: with limited number of correct answers. This profile signals limited level of skills or  knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  2. Intermediate: good number of correct answers. This profile has a reasonable level of skills and  knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  3. Advanced: high number of correct answers. This profile has an excellent level of skills and  knowledge of NIS (according to quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  For each generated profile further indications are offered in terms of documentation and material to  consult with particular attention to ENISA reports. At the low and medium levels there is also the  suggestion for attempting the next confidence level quiz.  The application is available on the website6 from October 2014 as a pilot with a possibility of renewal  after the first evaluation.

As a result of this ECSM achieved great impact  with more activities in all countries, a sample on how the calendar looked like below.  In addition, the Agency introduced a best practice section on the website. The team promoted the  stories and work of champions7 of cyber security from member states.  AT: Marion Marschalek  I personally found fascination in dissecting software. The more I dissect, the better I understand, the  more I love to learn more. I think every human is naturally driven to learn, to build and to improve; but  when I started this, I admit, all the binaries did not look all that appealing to me.  I had to take a second look, then a third one, understanding a bit more every time, and finally having  fun dragging all my new knowledge together. And now... I do this every day, with passion.  RO: Andrei Avădănei  Challenge yourself and learn by participating to DefCamp.  UK: Chris D Doman  Without the UK's Cyber Security Challenge I probably wouldn't have found myself in such an exciting  position, and campaigns such as ECSM are key to getting more people to realize how much their  passions for technology are needed, both right now, and for the foreseeable future.  7 Direct link http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/cyber-security-ambassadors  http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/cyber-security-ambassadors  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  10  2.3 Improve International Cooperation  The ECSM team entered very early into consultation and advance planning with the counterparts from  the NCSM- National Cyber Security Month US. This supported establishing good contacts and common  actions between teams. Furthermore the following was achieved in collaboration:  1. Panel with representatives of NCSAM and  ECSM for promoting Cyber Security Month  during IGF- Internet Governance Forum 2014  Istanbul;  2. Publication of a report: “Public Private  Partnerships in Network and Information  Security Education”8;  3. International Twitter chat on tips to follow for NIS security;  4. Publication of “Mobile Tips” for users,  important to mention that this common actions  is already at the 2nd consecutive edition9;  5. NCSM representative in the Launch  event of ECSM in Brussels.  We believe that the international cooperation has a real potential to grow,  however a multi annual planning with clear milestones is currently missing and it  should be agreed in advance.  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in- network-and-information-security-education  9 http://stopthinkconnect.org/campaigns/details/?id=442  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  11  3 Evaluation  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work are the EU citizens, targeted by different categories,  as well as end user organisations from public and private sectors (in particular in the area of EU NIS  education). These stakeholders were expected to reap the following benefits:  • Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice sharing  community;  • Improve and enhance contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles.  • Increase citizens’ awareness and governance on privacy when using online tools.  Coordinators in the Member States played a central role in achieving these benefits.  This is why in  order to evaluate this edition of the campaign we set up a survey and asked a number of questions to  get their feedback.  The survey was closed and  focused on the coordinators involved in the campaign.  The charts below present their replies, 29 participants in total. In comparison to previous editions we  improved the phase of the evaluation taken into account larger consultation in order to avoid biases  and integrate more opinions in the future planning of ECSM.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  12  Furthermore the replies from the charts of the evaluation of European Cyber Security Month 2014  clearly show that:  - Several communication channels have to be used and Twitter cannot be used exclusively, we  may further use coordination calls, meetings, newsletters;  - The coordination team responded to the needs of the coordinators;  - ECSM brings added value and there is a clear statement of continuation;  - ENISA reports and material are used by the community;  - More effort has to be put in communicating all the material produced by ENISA and MSs.  These early conclusions will be complemented at a later stage by qualitative information (e.g.  assessment of the NIS Quiz through focus group) and used for the planning and deployment for next  editions.  It is presented below some other graphs regarding the use of the website, twitter reach and map with  geographical spread of the activities.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  13   Website sessions during the period end September to end October   Twitter performance   Media reach   Comparison 2013 vs 2014 in numbers:   Countries involved 2013: 27, 2014:30;   Twitter followers 2013: 964; 2014: 2223;   Kick off participation 2013: approx. 100 in total; 2014: approx. 200;   Materials published 2013: 2; 2014: 5 general and 2 tools e.g. NIS universities map and  NIS quiz;   Activities taken place: 2013: 115 vs 2014: more than 184 [some countries like NO and  SE encoded one general entry for tens of local activities; e.g. in annex CZ example in  infographics].  The annual editions of ECSM improve each year the beneficiaries reach, e.g. 2014 vs 2013. However  more could be done if more partners would join and participate according to the engagement model  e.g. public- private partnerships.  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  14  4 Conclusions  The Agency will continue to support the European Cyber Security Month, but will aim to continually  increase, according to the work programme 2015-2016, the  involvement of Member States in the  coordination and deployment.  We call on Member States to promote and inform their NIS stakeholders on time!  We call on the European Commission to further provision on translations and support the  coordinators!  In recent years, the European Cyber Security Month has expanded its outreach with numerous  activities in the Member States, reaching a large number of European citizens. In 2015 and 2016 the  work programme10 mentions the ECSM will be further developed following its basic principles,  namely:  • Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach.  • Encourage common public-private activities.  • Assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  Moreover Member States are encouraged to develop ownership of the campaign and support:  Building together a joint EU advocacy campaign on NIS topics!  10 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  15  References  ENISA  [1] www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  [2] www.enisa.europa.eu  [3] \"An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace\" EU Cyber Security Strategy  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  [4] ENISA Work Programme 2015 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes- reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programmes-general-reports  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  16  Annex A:  An infographic from MSs: CZ ECSM in numbers  European Cyber Security Month  deployment report  2014  Page  17  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN TP-04-14-679-EN-N  978-92-9204-092-5  10.2824/3270  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

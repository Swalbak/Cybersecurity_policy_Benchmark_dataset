It is addressed to all colleagues involved in the preparation of action documents and project documents  and offers a handy tool to develop solid logical framework matrices. It identifies clear and measurable  results statements that are in line with DEVCO policy priorities, as well as with the UN Sustainable De- velopment Goals (SDGs), along with a range of good indicators to monitor progress. It will be updated  regularly to reflect evolving priorities.  Its main objective is to enhance the quality of DEVCO interventions – both in terms of design as well  as of monitoring and reporting in the course of implementation.  The need for this type of guidance was identified in the framework of the results-reporting process  led by DEVCO 04, as well as through its systematic review of all action documents presented to Quality  Review Group meetings.  The present guidance covers DEVCO strategies in various sectors, and presents for each sector:  1. EU policy priorities: a short narrative explaining EU policy priorities and  commitments as articulated in key policy and strategic documents.  2. Results Chain: a diagram showing the main results (impact, outcomes,  outputs) that EU development interventions are expected to achieve in the  sector, reflecting EU policy priorities and commitments.  3. List of Sector Indicators: examples of measurable indicators associated  to each result statement are provided, that may be used in Logframe Matri- ces at project/ programme level.

However, risks and challenges associated with improved access to ICTs and the growing of internet pen- etration are often underestimated. Therefore, cyber capacity building is crucial to promote cyber security  across the globe.  Since the adoption of its Cybersecurity Strategy1 in 2013, the EU has been leading on international cy- ber capacity building and systematically linking these efforts with its development cooperation funds.  Moreover, in 2017 there was a clear recognition at the EU level that cybersecurity should be considered  a transversal issue in development cooperation that can contribute to the realisation of the 2030 Agenda  for Sustainable Development2, as stipulated in the EU’s Digital4Development3 policy framework. In the  cybersecurity sector, the desired impact/overall objective is to provide the citizens of developing coun- tries an open, free, secure, resilient and peaceful cyberspace. Reference to this can be found as a target  under SDG 9 “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster  innovation”, as well as under SDG 4 “Quality education”, SDG 8 “Decent work and economic growth”, SDG  16 “Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions”.  1. https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  2. https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld  3. https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/sites/devco/files/swd-digital4development_part1_v3.pdf  1. EU Policy Priorities  6  The significance of efforts to build national resilience in third countries as a means of increasing the level  of cybersecurity globally, with positive consequences for the EU, was also recognised in the 2017 Joint  Communication on “Resilience, deterrence and defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU”4.  EU interventions in this field strengthen the legislative, institutional and civil society capacities for pro- moting cyber security, cyber hygiene and awareness. They also help to develop new mechanisms for  effective information sharing, consultation and coordination on cyber incidents.  The outcomes of these interventions include the adoption and implementation of a coherent, holistic  and actionable national approach to cyber resilience; the operationalisation of cyber crisis management  structures; increased trust of users, organisations, and companies in the use of cyberspace; as well as the  alignment of legislation on cybercrime and electronic evidence with international standards.  The desired long-term impact is that citizens of developing countries enjoy an open, free, secure, resilient  and peaceful cyberspace.  EU strategic priorities  In order to leverage the threats and challenges related to cybersecurity, EU action is structured around  the following strategic priorities, as defined in the Joint Communication:  Promoting legislative reforms and strengthening the capacity of decision-makers to design and  implement cyber laws and policies in line with the Budapest Convention5 and human rights con- ventions;  Supporting an overarching strategic framework and strengthening institutional capacity to address  cyber risks in a holistic way, including in public service delivery;  Developing education, professional training and expertise in this field and improving cyber hygiene  and awareness of individual users;  Enhancing mechanisms for effective information sharing, consultation and coordination on cyber  incidents between stakeholders (private sector, civil society and government bodies).  4. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN%0D  5. https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185  7 RESU  LTS CH AIN  Citizens of  developing countries  enjoy an open, free,  secure, resilient and  peaceful cyberspace  Cybersecurity  Related SD G  s and Targets  M ain im  pact  4.

The eIDAS  regulation will facilitate seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses across countries  within the European Union and will establish a climate of trust when it comes to online and digital  transactions in the EU.  In the context of the eIDAS Regulation, ENISA conducted a study to present an overview of the  implementation and uptake of Trust Services defined in the eIDAS Regulation one year after adoption to the  new regime, and analyse the new opportunities and incentives introduced in the European Trust Services  market.  One year after the switch over to the eIDAS regulation, the number of the Trust Services has significantly  grown and there is a significant trend of TSP (64%) towards the process of being qualified. This goes some  way to support the wide recognition of the added value of the qualified status in the Trust Services market.  Considering the eIDAS Regulation as a framework, there is a lot of space for individual interpretation but  also for development at the level of Member States or even organisations. The survey results indicate, that  for more than 90% of the respondents recognize eIDAS as an opportunity to grow their business. At the  same time, the methods for provisioning Trust Services needs to be renewed with an innovative approach  and “out-of-box” thinking.  Concerning the penetration level of (Qualified)Trust Services in the market, “Classical” Trust Services,  related to the issuance of certificates receive a high recognition rate in the market, while the newly  defined services by eIDAS, as well as remote qualified trust services for the generation of QESign/QESeal  still do not receive widespread recognition. Future plans of (Q)TSP reveal a greater trend towards the  provision of qualified trust services in comparison to non-qualified ones.  Moreover, it is recognized that the market is still trying to fully understand the consequences of this  regulation. Currently, technical standards (e.g. signature in the cloud) are still under development and for  certain services there are only a few providers in specific Member States. In addition, respondents pointed  out gaps in the legislation and standardisation, with regards to the electronic delivery, electronic validation,  preservation and conformity assessment, as well as Conformity Assessment Body accreditation. This may  lead to disharmony of the Trust Services market in the European Union and put in question the “quality  level” of Trust Services.  The following conclusions provide further insight concerning the barriers, weaknesses, strengths and  drivers for the uptake of (qualified) trust services and derive from the survey as well as the in-depth open  questions with selected stakeholders.  A) Barriers and Weaknesses   Low level of knowledge of what is trust and its importance among the potential users (citizens,  enterprises) and lack of understanding of Trust Services.   Current market distortions such as seeming oligopolies in certain market sectors (i.e. browsers market)   Immaturity of the trust services market, not much knowledge about concrete implementation models  and integration with current business processes.  December 2017  06   Gaps in Standardization, limitations posed by soft law approaches and technical specifications mainly in  regard to new defined services (electronic delivery, electronic validation, preservation), the conformity  assessment process and the accreditation of CAB.   National level trust services non-conformant with eIDAS regulation create uncertainty and confusion,  hindering the uptake of the Trust Services Market.   Limited number of Applications to support trust services and closed market of web browsers.   Very few providers to offer qualified trust services and high reluctance towards developing new  solutions.  B) Strengths of the Trust Services market   eIDAS brings legal certainty which is a key enabler, since organisations are facilitated to organize and  deliver their digital strategies with confidence.   eIDAS is a key to ease the application of sectoral regulations (e.g. PSD2, MIFID2) and to guide towards  the compliance with the new GDPR.   It provides a powerful and solid base in developing new solutions and services, being recognised across  Europe.   Business requirements of industries with big digital transformation processes, like finance and  healthcare, can create market opportunities. A need for certainty, integrity and speed in industries  processes can be the driving force for the growth and uptake of Trust Service market.  C) Key Drivers for Trust Services Uptake   Usability and integration with business services   Enhance user experience and user-friendly approach   Development of applications, standards to support “new” trust services  December 2017  07  1. Introduction  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic  signatures, seals, time stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication2 and  it repeals Directive 1999/93/EC3. Under the eIDAS Regulation it is possible to use the trust services as well  as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their cross- border use.  As of the 1st July 2016, all provisions related to trust services of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable  in the 28 EU Member States, which do not need to transpose it into national law. The eIDAS regulation will  facilitate seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses across Member States within the  European Union and will establish a climate of trust when it comes to online and digital transactions in the  EU.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust services and qualified trust service provider. It aims to identify  requirements and obligations that ensure a high-level of security for whatever qualified trust service or  product is used or provided.  In order to ensure a high-level of security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an  active supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS)  they provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent Supervisory Body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations. Therefore,  when a TSP, without qualified status, intends to start providing qualified trust services, it shall submit to  the SB a notification of their intention together with a Conformity Assessment Report (CAR) issued by an  “eIDAS” accredited Conformity Assessment Body (CAB). National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) contribute to  the quality assurance of the whole process by being responsible to accredit a CAB, who will perform the  conformity assessment audits to TSP.  In the context of the eIDAS Regulation, ENISA decided to carry out this study to capture the adoption and  implementation of Trust Services in the EU market one year after the roll out of the eIDAS Regulation. The  European Commission conducted a study on a market plan to stimulate the take-up of eID and trust  services for the Digital Single Market back in July 20164.  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC,  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 See Glossary or Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for the definition of trust services.  3 Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community  framework for electronic signatures, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31999L0093  4 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/workshop-marketing-plan-stimulate-take-eid-and-trust- services-digital-single  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  December 2017  08  Since 2013 ENISA has contributed to supporting the EC on the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation by  providing security recommendations for the correct implementation of trust services, mapping technical  and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe5, raising  awareness for relying parties and end users on securing their electronic transactions by using trust  services.  1.1 Objectives of the report  Based on the above description, the goal of this report is to present an overview of the implementation  and uptake of Trust Services defined in the eIDAS Regulation one year after the switch over to the new  regime, and analyse the new opportunities and incentives introduced in the European Trust Services  market.  More specifically, this report aims to:  1. Collect input to identify the current status regarding the adoption and implementation of the  (Qualified)Trust Services in the European Trust Services market  2. Identify implementation and operational issues of Qualified Trust Services based on the experience  gathered by different types of stakeholders.  3. Analyse the new market opportunities and new incentives offered to the (Q)TSP in order to provide  new services.  4. Identify the key factors and barriers that influence the development of the (qualified) trust services  and define the main strengths and drivers for their further penetration in the EU Market.  The target audience of the report consists of Trust Service Providers (including individuals, businesses and  public administrations), those Member States Supervisory Bodies (SB) designated to carry out supervisory  activities under the eIDAS Regulation, Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB) as well as relying parties (users  of Trust Services).  1.2 Methodology  Two main tools were employed in this report to identify the eIDAS market uptake: an online survey and an  accompanying set of ‘deep analysis’ questions with some of the respondents who participated in the  survey, which served to better understand the current eIDAS market and future directions.  1.2.1 Online Survey  The online survey was carried out through the EU Survey Tool, and was submitted to the EU Trust Service  market stakeholders through a multitude of communication channels. The survey was mainly shared  through the European Commission distribution channel being the DIGIT-CIRCABC mailing list, the Article 19  ENISA Expert Group mailing list and ENISA contacts through the TSP Forum. The survey took place in May  and early June 2017. The respondents’ group included representatives of all types of eIDAS stakeholders:   Trust Service Providers (TSP)   Supervisory Bodies (SB)   Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB)   Relying parties (Users of the Trust Services)  5 TSP Forum, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/tspforum/tspforum  December 2017  09  The survey included 37 mixed questions that were short, closed questions (multiple or single choice) as  well as open questions, which were designed to give respondents the possibility to provide further details  and clarifications. The core of the survey was based on the experience collected by earlier ENISA  documents6, e.g. guidelines on security requirements applicable to TSPs, auditing framework for TSPs,  initiation/supervision of trust service provision, guidelines for TSPs based on standards. The answers to the  survey were analysed using quantitative data analysis techniques – with consideration of the differences  among individual respondents.  In total, 85 organisations responded to this online survey. The sample consisted of representatives among  stakeholders involved in the eIDAS regulation: Trust Service Providers (44), Conformity Assessment Bodies  (7), Supervisory Bodies (10) and relying parties (24). In terms of business sector represented, most of the  organisations originated from the private sector. Public administration respondents represent about a  quarter of the respondents, while only 9% of organisations are of mixed status/nature, as no further  characteristics can reasonably be provided.  Figure 1 Business sector of organisations that repsonded to the survey  In terms of geographic spread, respondents to this survey originated from 22 EU Member States. The  number of responses received from each country has been largely influenced by the number of Trust  Service Providers and the Trust Services available in such country as well as the degree of maturity of  online and Trust services overall. Therefore, a higher response rate has been reached in countries with a  larger number of TSPs (like Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain) available.  The responses to the survey provide for quantitative diversity originating from key stakeholders: TSP, SB and  CAB. Responses were collected from a number of participants representing different Member States and  groups (in terms of stakeholder type and business sector), and therefore, the conclusions of the survey  provide interesting insights, seeking to reflect the situation of the European Trust Service market as a whole.  Moreover, it is worth noting that Relying Parties refer mainly to organisations using Trust Services for their  6 ENISA Trust Services, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services  65%  26%  9%  B U S I N E S S  S E C TO R  O F  T H E  O R G A N I Z AT I O N  Private sector  Public administration  Mixed  December 2017  10  own purposes as well as organisations offering related consulting services, thus excluding natural persons  acting as Replying Parties in a PKI or in a set comprising of Trust services.  Figure 2 Respondents country of origin  1.2.2 Deep analysis questions  Whereas the survey generated a fair overview of the eIDAS market, it was complemented by four additional  in-depth, open questions with selected stakeholders. The survey aimed at seeking to understand the view  of market representatives on the uptake of trust services; additionally, it aimed at gaining a deeper insight  into possible directions of market development and evolution in the future. A total of 19 responses from 12  Member States have bene submitted and received. Chapter 3 presents the responses collected and  highlights the conclusions drawn.  The answers to the open questions have been analysed using qualitative content analysis.  1.3 Structure of the report  Chapter 2 provides in its charts and commentaries a more detailed overview of the trust services uptake  status from (Q)TSP, SB, CAB and relying parties, and constitutes the core of this report.  Chapter 3 draws conclusions on the findings and suggests areas for improvements and further steps to be  taken, driven by the analysis of open in-depth questions. Similarly, some key drivers for further  development have been included.  December 2017  11  2. Trust Services Uptake one-year after the eIDAS roll-out  2.1 TSP Trend towards being Qualified  The online survey was carried out in early June 2017, one year after the new rules for trust services under  the eIDAS Regulation entered into effect, being 1 July 2016. In June and early July 2017 many (Q)TSP have  added their services to the Trust List, as it is described in chapter 3. This is because of the transitional  measure laid down in Art.51.3 and Art.51.4 of the eIDAS Regulation, which allowed certification-service- providers issuing qualified certificates under Directive 1999/93/EC and considered as qualified on entry  into force of the Regulation for trust services, to have an extended period in which to submit a conformity  assessment report to the SB up in the period ending on 1 July 2017.  This survey aimed initially to identify (a) whether TSPs recognise the need to provide qualified trust  services as defined under the eIDAS regulation and (b) whether they are prepared to undergo the initiation  and supervision process (see ENISA reports)7 as foreseen in eIDAS. A TSP, without qualified status, that  intends to start providing qualified trust services should undergo an initiation phase in terms of:   Preparation: The TSP designs, sets up, implements, tests and deploys in pre-production the QTS it  intends to provide, in line with the eIDAS requirements.   Notification: The TSP notifies the SB its intention to become qualified together with the conformity  assessment report (CAR) issued by the “eIDAS” accredited CAB.   Initial verification of compliance: The SB verifies whether or not the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation in order to be granted a qualified status.   Publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list: Upon notification by the SB that the  notifying TSP/TS has been granted a qualified status, the body in charge of the Member State trusted  list, updates the list accordingly.  This survey focused on seeking a general approach of the TSP towards compliance with the qualification  requirements. The following stages were identified as far as the status of a (Q)TSP is concerned:   Information gathering   In the initiation phase   Qualified  A large portion of responding TSPs describe their situation as being “in the initiation phase” (64%) while  only 4% of the respondents declare that they are still at the stage of “information gathering”. This means  that there is a significant tendency (64%) on the part of TSPs to change their status to qualified, which  means that the added value of the qualified status is broadly recognised in the TSP market. About 32% of  the Trust Service Providers8 that took part in the survey have been granted qualified status according to  the eIDAS security requirements.  7 ENISA Report on “Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services”, “Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust  Service Providers”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/.  8 In July 2017, there were 159 (Q)TSP based on the information from TSL Lists Browser,  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/  December 2017  12  Figure 3 Status of preparation of the TSP towards being granted the qualified status  Concerning the TSPs that are currently in the initiation phase, 43% of them are in the preparation phase  (for instance, in the phase of developing products, preparing documentation), 43% of them are undergoing  the audit process and waiting for the CAR from the corresponding CAB while the remaining 14% are  waiting for the SB to verify compliance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The above- mentioned figures are representative of the trend9 in the period when the survey took place, when many  TSPs were still submitting their CAR to the SB, since they were entitled to benefit from the transitional  period ending 1st of July 2017, as defined in Art.51.3 and Art.51.4 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Most of the survey respondents perceive eIDAS as a business opportunity, which is backed up by their  arguments and comments as given below:   “eIDAS creates a common framework in the European Union and provides new opportunities to  expand and offer services across borders”.   “eIDAS provides legal certainty and standardisation that will in turn allow all market players to better  prepare their products and lower the risk of being non-compliant”.   “It is expected that the eIDAS will create greater demand for new products and enhance the added  value of existing services”.   “eIDAS is also seen as an opportunity for CABs due to new certification areas in Trust Service  Providers”.   “The new regulation will become a foundation for digital government and enterprises”.   “eIDAS is also an opportunity mostly corresponding to new services, standardisation and a unified  European market”.   “Accreditation as a way of gaining trust from the end users is an additional opportunity”.  9 Moreover, this trend is verified by the number of QTSP in November 2017 which counts up to 203 compared to 159  TSP in July 2017.  32%  64%  4%  T S P  S TAT E  TO WA R D S  B E I N G  Q UA L I F I E D  Qualified  In initiation phase  Information gathering  Conclusion 1: There is a significant tendency among TSPs to seek qualified status which verifies the  wide recognition of the added value of the qualified status in the Trust Services market.  December 2017  13   “It creates new market opportunities for eService providers”.  However, when commenting on costs related to become compliant with the eIDAS regulation, TSPs  attribute them mainly to the cost for introducing new technologies and necessary changes in  organizational processes that are already in place and to the accreditation and audit procedure to be  followed. Supervisory Bodies particularly expressed the need for hiring new personnel and for carrying out  specialised trainings in order to prepare new technological challenges.  The survey concludes that the eIDAS regulation is widely recognised as an opportunity for the market. An  overwhelming majority (91%) of the TSPs stated that they recognise the eIDAS regulation to some extent  as a business opportunity. Just about 50% of the TSPs declare that it is an opportunity for them to grow  their business, while 41% recognise it as an opportunity with an additional cost. However, it seems that  most of the respondents who chose “both” (business opportunity and additional cost) as an answer,  consider the additional cost of eIDAS implementation and/or accreditation as an investment that will result  in more business opportunities. The remaining 9% state that the implementation of the regulation will be  an additional cost for their organisation.  Figure 4 (Q)TSP Recognition of eIDAS regulation as a business opportunity, additional cost or both  Taking into account the responses from the whole range of stakeholders, the corresponding rates are  comparable, where 92% of the respondents see a business opportunity at least to some extent.  Table 1 gives a breakdown of the answers depending on the organisation type. From the overall data  analysis, it is concluded that only SBs are somewhat sceptical as to whether the eIDAS regulation is an  opportunity. This can be explained by their role in the Trust Services market. CABs are the most  enthusiastic category of parties affected by eIDAS; CABs are auditors of QTSPs and they benefit from the  new impetus in implementing the provisions of the Regulation.  41%  50%  9%  ( Q ) T S P  TO WA R D S  R E C O G N I T I O N  O F  E I DA S  R E G U L AT I O N  Both  Business Opportunity  Additional Cost  December 2017  14  Table 1: Recognition of eIDAS as a business opportunity or an additional cost  TYPE OF ORGANISATION ADDITIONAL COST BUSINESS OPORTUNITY BOTH  Conformity Assessment Body  (CAB)  0% 86% 14%  Supervisory Body (SB) 20% 30% 50%  Trust Service Provider (TSP) 9% 50% 41%  User of Trust Services  (natural or legal persons)  4% 54% 42%  AVERAGE 8% 52% 40%  2.2 Market penetration of Qualified and non-Qualified Trust Services  One of the main goals of the survey has been to capture the penetration and adoption level of the eIDAS  trust services one year after entry into force of the eIDAS regulation. The penetration level of the eIDAS  Trust Services has been defined from 1 (least used) to 5 (most used). Based on the results shown in Figure  5, it is worth mentioning that the highest penetration level is related to the two typical services being,  (Qualified) Electronic Signatures and (Qualified)Time Stamps. The penetration level of the new trust  services - defined by the eIDAS Regulation – has been lagging. The highest growth areas are among the  newly-introduced services and they are observed for (qualified) electronic seals and (qualified) validation  services.  A small portion of the (Q)TSPs contributing to the survey disclosed the number of certificates issued  annually in the two-year period leading up to the eIDAS regulation coming into force (01.07.2014 –  30.06.2016), as well as one year after the entry into force (01.07.2016 – 30.06.2017). From that limited  sample, it can be inferred that the number of certificates issued has been growing each year and that the  current penetration of non-qualified trust services is greater than the penetration of the qualified ones,  which actually coincides with the results of Figure 5.  With reference to Relying Parties (users) when it comes to the use of (Qualified)Trust Services, the majority  (75%) of them replied that their companies have implemented such services in their operations, while only  25% have not done so yet; even these Relying Parties, however, have future plan to implement them.  Public Administration or private sector organisations using Trust Services for their own purposes as well as  companies offering related consulting services are mainly among the respondents being already prepared  to use Trust Services.  December 2017  15  Figure 5 Trust services penetration in the market one year after the eIDAS roll-out  2.2.1 Remote Qualified Trust Services  Another topic addressed in the survey concerns the implementation of any application that make use of  remote qualified trust services by relying parties. Trust Services such as cloud-based services for the  generation of qualified electronic signature or qualified electronic seal do not require end users to possess  a dedicated hardware device for key pair generation and storage (e.g. a smart card). Instead, the signing  key can be securely stored in a remote (cloud-based) system of the QTSP and signatures can be created  after strong authentication has been used to authenticate the identity of the signatory. The survey focused  on finding out the spread and recognition of remote qualified trust services among businesses in Europe.  While 54% of respondents declared that they have not implemented such applications, 42% of  respondents confirmed that they use applications that leverage on remote qualified trust services (while  the remaining 4% were not sure of the existence of such services in their markets). The respondents  represented 9 (Luxembourg, Estonia, Spain, Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Finland) out of 22  Member States participating in the survey. One of the main reasons that has been quoted as hindering the  implementation of remote signature/seal is that key standards have not yet been published10.  10 CEN/CENELEC EN 419 241 Protection Profile for QSCD for Server Signing, being developed by CEN TC 224 / WG17  30%  39%  12%  9%  13%  20%  10%  5%  3%  10%  7%  3%  3%  32%  22%  16%  23%  18%  20%  11%  13%  4%  17%  14%  10%  10%  12%  17%  20%  18%  23%  24%  15%  28%  24%  26%  20%  19%  18%  17%  9%  21%  5%  26%  11%  17%  21%  16%  22%  19%  19%  9%  9%  13%  32%  45%  20%  25%  47%  33%  53%  25%  40%  49%  60%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  Electronic signature  Qualified electronic signature  Electronic seal  Qualified electronic seal  Electronic time stamp  Qualified electronic time stamp  Qualified website authentication certificate  Electronic registered delivery service  Qualified electronic registered delivery services  Validation service  Qualified validation service  Preservation service  Qualified preservation service  PENETRATION OF TRUST SERVICES AFTER THE EIDAS ROLL OUT  5 (most used) 4 3 2 1 (least used)  December 2017  16  2.2.2 Non-regulated (nationally defined) trust services  According to the survey, 28% of the respondents, representing 9 Member States, point out that there are  specific types of trust services made available at Member State level, which have not been defined in the  eIDAS Regulation (58% of respondents declare that that do not know such services, while the remaining  14% declare that they are not aware of the existence of such services). Such trust services offered in a  Member State, are regulated by a Member State and they only have recognition within such Member State  but can still act as an obstacle to the uptake of the eIDAS Trust Services.  The respondents provided further clarifications by giving examples of services at national level which are  not part of the eIDAS Trust Services:   “Electronic signature confirmed by “Trusted Profile” (Poland)   “Electronic archiving and digitisation” (Belgium)   “Information/documents long term preservation, LEXNET Platform for exchanging information  between the Judicial Bodies and a wide range of legal operators” (Spain)  The survey shows that there are national trust services in some EU MS. Some of them are broadly used at  MS level, without however, having any cross border recognition as it is possible to do for trust services  under the eIDAS Regulation.  2.2.3 Future Directions of Trust Services Provision  The survey seeks to explore future plans of (Q)TSP concerning the provision of Trust Services in the market.  Particularly, it addresses a) future plans for the qualified trust services in relation to the non-qualified  ones, and b) future plans for the newly introduced trust services in relation to services offered already.  From Figure 6 it is apparent that there is a relative high provision of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures (20%) and electronic timestamps (16%). The future plans of (Q)TSP concerning the provision of  qualified trust services appear to be of high rate for all qualified Trust Services. Of particular interest are  future plans for qualified website authentication certificates (66%), qualified electronic seal (66%),  qualified validation service (68%) and qualified electronic registered delivery (52%).  Moreover, it is worth  noting that qualified electronic registered delivery services and qualified preservation service are not  within the scope of direct plans for 45% and 48% of (Q)TSP respectively.  Concerning non-qualified trust services, the current uptake as well as plans of TSP are given in Figure 7. It is  apparent that there is high level of penetration for typical services being electronic signatures (45%) and  electronic time stamps (32%).  Comparing the two diagrams, it is obvious there is a higher trend (grey part of the chart) towards the  provision of qualified trust services in comparison to the non-qualified ones. For example, comparing the  provision plans for qualified electronic signature towards non-qualified one, the percentages are 69%  towards 39%.  Conclusion 3: Typical Trust Services, related to the issuance of certificates, have deep penetration in  the market, while the newly-introduced services by eIDAS, as well as remote qualified trust services  for the generation of QESign/QESeal are still not widespread.

The number of SSL/TLS certificates has grown sharply in the last few years driven by  business needs rather than any regulatory framework, and the market has evolved to be highly  concentrated around a small number of players, mostly from outside Europe.  Based on these features, qualified certificates for website authentication (QWAC) present a particular case  among the newly introduced trust services in the eIDAS Regulation, since they will need to enter in an  already mature, global and unregulated market. To be successfully introduced it will be necessary to  stimulate demand for QWACs by properly communicating to consumers their benefits, while at the same  time supporting providers to ensure sufficient supply11.  The successful introduction of QWACs needs clear communication of the benefits the hold for  stakeholders. According to the survey the majority of relying parties (80%) understand the differences  between QWAC and SSL certificates, but the respondents to the survey cannot be classified as “common  users”.  Concerning the implementation of QWAC by the QTSPs, 7% of the respondents have already such a  service, 27% have not implemented it yet, and 66% have plans to run such a service in the future (see  Figure 8). It is really worth noticing the trend towards the uptake of the QWACS12.  Figure 8 TSPs plans for providing QWACs  11 Refer to “Qualified Website Authentication Certificates” report published by ENISA in May 2016,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qualified-website-authentication-certificates  12 In July 2017, there were 6 QTSP offering QWAC originating from 6 countries, while the total number of (Q)TSP is  calculated to 159.The trend can be validated by the number of QTSP, which in November 2017 counts up to 16 QTSP  providing QWAC, coming from 13 countries.

The biggest potential for utilising QWAC can be seen in Banking services (37%), HealthCare  (33%) and e-Government services (31%).  Figure 9 Potential of utilizing QWACs in different sectors of the economy  2.3 Key factors and barriers influencing development of the Trust Service market  Respondents provided mixed responses concerning the key factors that will influence further development  of the trust services market. The most important factors included “Evolution of Business Models” (20%),  “Maturity of e-Government Services” (19%), “Change in mind-set” (19%) and “Public-Private Partnership”  (11%). All the above seem to suggest that the main concerns revolve around the market’s ability to adapt  to customer needs and its ability to build suitable business models including partnerships between public  and private entities.  Most respondents believe that the evolution of business models and change in mind-set, as well as the  maturity of the e-government services influence the development of the Trust Service market.  Standardisation is considered to be an important factor (13%), while a so called “soft law” approach (for  example, guidelines delivered by EU Bodies such as ENISA) is perceived as a less significant factor in an  effort to influence the market (Figure 10).  The importance of the legal framework at the national level in the process of development of the eIDAS  market is clearly stated. For instance, in one of the respondent’s countries it is permitted to submit a letter  to Courts of Justice in electronic form signed with a qualified signature, but there is no formal method to  deliver it. There are also examples in which local governments create obstacles against the eIDAS uptake –  for instance by declaring some e-government systems as “closed” to avoid coming under the eIDAS  framework requirements.

It is worth noting that for Estonia further standardisation is a key factor,  while respondents from Italy regard more highly the maturity of e-Government services.  In most Member  States, evolution of business models has a major impact on the Trust Services market.  In each Member State, different aspects play a key role – for example Germany and Estonia deem further  standardisation of trust services as the most important factor.

December 2017  21  Figure 11  Key factors that will influence further development of trust services (selected countries)  The main barrier for further development of trust services market according to the survey concerns  limitations in understanding of Trust Services (28%). This results in low demand that has been accounted  to 13% of all responses. These factors seem to have a big impact on further development, while they  constitute a common problem in all innovative markets and appear whenever new technologies, products  or services are introduced. They represent a concern towards new and unknown situations- especially  where new services are not clear and cannot be easily explained. This is also backed up by the fact that  16% of the respondents identify users’ familiarity as a barrier.  Around 9% of the responses point to “Other” barriers for the further development of the eIDAS market.  The most common one is that “improper” government activities create barriers or distortions in the Trust  Service market. Examples include for instance the “lack or low quality of public services”, the “lack of  innovation in the public administration” and/or the “use of proprietary or unsecured legacy systems and  applications”, as well as unfair competition from public institutions that create ad hoc monopolies of state- owned companies (for instance national postal services) in the Trust Service market. Other commonly  mentioned factors are the lack of the secondary legislation for the eIDAS Regulation and the lack of a clear  road map for the development of eIDAS and trust services, which keeps on replicating harmonization gaps.  Moreover, some Member States also indicate that governments are not supportive of the development of  the eIDAS market. Others points are:   “Reluctance of private sector to implement into services”   “Lack of adoption by key service providers e.g. banks”   “No formal e-delivery standard”   “Lack of blockchain usage vision”  Change in mindset  Evolution of Business Models  Further Standardization  Maturity of e- Government Services  Public-Private Partnership  Soft law  Other  What are the key factors that will influence further  development of trust services on your market?

Concerning Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment bodies, they  respectively 80% and 86% confirmed that gaps in standardisation is one of the barriers for the further  development of the trust services.

The open question related to this issue, concerning to specify further standardisation or regulatory gaps  during auditing the QTSP, brought deeper insight into this aspect from the CAB and SB perspective.  Basically, overall 82% of the respondents from this group confirm such an issue and clearly pointed out  that standards and specifications are still missing at the regulatory level.  Figure 13 Standardisation gaps from the SB and CAB perspective   CABs Approach  CABs point out the lack of standards for eIDAS services as well as their different understanding on  standards. More specifically, they mention standards missing in the areas of qualified electronic delivery,  qualified validation, qualified preservation, and alternative identification methods (e.g. through video  means). The legal uncertainty concerning eIDAS-compliant cryptographic algorithms has also been  mentioned.   SBs Approach  At the same time, respondents representing Supervisory Bodies (SBs) complain about the lack of  standardization for the Conformity Assessment process. They strongly express the view that the  differences in CAB accreditation schemes in the Member States and the absence of a standardised  Conformity Assessment Report constitute a challenge. For instance, audit reports from one Member State  contain around 100 pages, while from another the number of pages can reach up to 500. This means CABs  have different interpretations of the actual scope of audits and/or the content of the audit report. As a  result, this situation may lead to a non-harmonised Trust Service market and questions regarding “quality”  of Trust Services in the European Union may raise. Therefore, in the opinion of the respondents from SBs,  it is imperative to draw definitions for:   Accreditation procedure for the Conformity Assessment Bodies   Auditing rules and scope (“what to audit against”) taking into account: eIDAS provisions, implementing  acts, standards and specifications   Conformity Assessment Report Content   Implementing acts and clear definitions of trust services, i.e. ERDS, preservation and validation  80 86  20 14  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  SBs CABs  H AV E  YO U  N O T I C E D  R E G U L ATO RY  O R  S TA N DA R D I Z AT I O N  G A P S  D U R I N G  AU D I T I N G ?  Yes No  December 2017  24   Technical standards describing the certification scheme of the different trust services  2.4.2 Problems encountered during an eIDAS audit  The survey has indicated that 70% of CAB and SB have encountered problems while performing eIDAS  audits to QTSP. It is worth mentioning that the time that the survey was carried out, it was the period  before the deadline of 1st July when certification-service-providers issuing qualified certificates under the  Directive 1999/93/EC had to submit a conformity assessment report to the SB. This means that many  audits were still ongoing and that SBs had been adapting to the audit process.  The most commonly quoted auditing problems to both CABs and SBs were related to different  interpretations of eIDAS requirements and/or definitions of trust services in the Member States and the  lack of harmonization by implementation. Furthermore, the problem of linking ETSI EN 319 xxx standard  series to eIDAS Regulation clauses and the number of reports to provide, meaning both EN 319 and eIDAS  report, was raised.  Figure 14  Problems with audits for SB and CAB   SB Approach  A number of respondents indicate that TSP are quite supportive and no problems were encountered when  performing audits. However, SBs raise the need to have the full version of the Conformity Assessment  Report, whereby all detected vulnerabilities be analysed, along with audit findings to be presented in a  meeting between the CAB, the QTSP and the SB.  SBs mainly report the problem of TSP preparation for the audits, and specifically: problems in having access  to systems, lack of supporting documents/ policies / procedures related to audits, divergence in  interpretations of the Regulation related to remote signing services and video identification.  Moreover, difficulties in getting insights in case of the activities of a TSP are spread out among many  subcontractors. SB also mention that the requirements in the eIDAS Regulation are quite general so that it  is possible to interpret them differently, which triggers differences in opinion among CAB, SB and TSP.   CAB Approach  The respondents originating from CABs point out the limited audit support documents and the differences  in interpretation of eIDAS requirements by the stakeholders (CAB, TSP and SB), particularly by SB. Besides  the standardisation issue (as described in 2.4.1), they express the opinion that many of their problems are  70  71  20  29  10  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  SBs  CABs  D O  YO U  E N C O U N T E R  P R O B L E M S  W H E N  P E R F O R M I N G  A N E I DA S  AU D I T ?  yes no no experience  December 2017  25  laid down at supervision level, being the result of insufficient preparation of the SB, lack of experience and  expertise of SB personnel and lack or delay in publishing national documents supporting the auditing  process. Moreover, the limited experience of the NAB and the absence of national experts/auditors have  been raised.  The management of non-conformities identified during the audit relates to the absence of shared /  common rules concerning the management of non-conformities after the audits as well as the  requirements that should apply to the conformity of non-qualified TSP.  It was also mentioned that in general audits on qualified certificate issuance, did not raise any issues, since  QTSP are well prepared thanks to their experience with proving conformance with the requirements of  Directive 1999/93/EC. However, some TSPs present an insufficient level of preparation for the eIDAS  audits, but this is not the general case. Other ancillary issues include assessing video identification  methods (article 24.1(d)) and the lack of regulation on eIDAS-compliant cryptographic algorithms as  mentioned above.  Moreover, SB and CAB, based on their auditing experience, commented also on the difficulty level of  auditing the trust services. The results show that Electronic Registered Delivery and Remote Electronic  Signatures/Seal are the most challenging Trust Services to audit, pointed out respectively by 24% and 23%  of the respondents.

Conclusion 6: A guidance on conformity assessment report content, audit process and post-audit  activities is needed to assure the same “quality” implementation level of Trust services and avoid  interpretations among the involved stakeholders (SB, CAB and TSP).  December 2017  26  2.5 Business models for Trust Services and involvement of public administration  A broad understanding of the whole Trust Service market can indicate three general business models:  Centralised (closed – leading role of the public sector), Federal (open – leading role of the commercial  sector) and Mixed (both public and commercial sector) (Figure 16). According to the respondents (in this  case TSP, CAB and SB) the leading model for trust services provision in their countries is the mixed one,  where both public and commercial organisations provide services on the market. This answer is given by  69% of the responses, representing 17 countries. A purely centralised or federal model is present in very  few countries.  Among respondents who have indicated the “Mixed” model, most of them agree that this is the right choice,  as it ensures higher adoption and brings an opportunity to maximise the strongest qualities of both parties:  public entities can build a big customer base, while private entities can be more innovative and provide  services that the public sector wouldn’t be interested in.  Arguments for shifting towards a “Federal” model is that it would be more dynamic, innovative and  competitive (respondents point out the issue with free provision of public Trust Services).  Moreover, it is  supported that this model is optimal as it is open, innovative and provides the best services for end-users.  However, 4 out of 9 respondents believe that their market should move towards a mixed model which can  guarantee a stronger market providing more possibilities, can be more flexible and can provide the best  services in both commercial and public sectors.  The respondents from countries with a “Centralised” Trust Service model are in the minority, accounting  for only 13% of the respondents. The main arguments for keeping such a model are that the public sector  can guarantee strong control over security and that in small countries such a model is more cost-effective.  Figure 16 Business model used for trust services in respondents’ country  One third of the respondents (38%) originating from 12 out of 22 countries, confirm that in their countries  there is a partnership between private and public sectors regarding Trust Services. Although Trust Services  may appear to have a direct effect only on the public sector, there is a real business potential in the private  sector too. Incorporation of Private-Public Partnership would benefit both the business and customers.  Such partnership would result in better efficiency and cost optimisation and can lead to innovation growth.  The customers would benefit from better and broader access to services, provided by both public and  private sectors, better user experience and perhaps even more flexible pricing schemes.  69%  18%  13%  W H AT  I S  T H E  B U S I N E S S  M O D E L  U S E D  F O R  T R U S T  S E R V I C E S  I N  YO U R  C O U N T RY ?  Mixed  Federal  Centralized  December 2017  27  Figure 17  Private-Public Partnership (PPP) concerning the use of trust services in respondent's country  2.5.1 Involvement of public administration  In the opinion of more than half of the respondents (55%), public administration should pursue a mixed  approach of building own solutions and implementing commercial solutions. Purchase of 3rd party  solutions only comes as the second most popular response to the question constituting 34% of the  responses.   Build own solution  Only 11% of respondents point out that public administration should build its own solutions which results  from the need for independence from any third-parties and from avoiding vendor locking, in particular if this  kind of services is perceived as a \"critical infrastructure\". Deeper analysis of the answers shows that most of  the respondents (67%) who recommend that public administration should build its own Trust Services are  from the private sector. Even more interesting is the fact that most of the respondents from the public  administration sector recommend a combination of solutions (59%) or buying 3rd party ones (36%).  However, it is highlighted that the public administration shall be fully responsible for the operation of its  publicly available services. In case of immaturity of the TS market and lack of commercial solutions, public  administration can build its own solutions to boost adoption of eIDAS Trust Services. This is in principle in  line with the conclusion drawn in chapter 2.3 that the involvement of public administration is needed.   Buying third party solutions  The rationale in favour of buying third party solutions is mainly related to the cost-effectiveness issue.  Commercial, of-the-shelf solutions, are considered as being more cost-effective than custom ones developed  by public administration. Moreover, considering the size of public administration in the proportion to the  cost and complexity of creating a whole new mechanism it does not seem to be applicable.   Combine the above solutions  In reference to the mixed approach, the justification is that the existing commercial solutions shall be used  whenever possible in case of \"standard use” whereas for some specific needs (e.g. due to national security  related aspects) administration may build its own solutions. In a long term the option “Build own solution”  may result in legacy solutions and lack of improvements, while combination of the solutions will help  towards interoperability of public and private services, depending though on each country status (e.g.  existing infrastructure, staff).  38%  28%  34%  I S  T H E R E  A  P P P  I N  YO U R  C O U N T RY ?  Yes  No  Don't know  December 2017  28  Figure 18 Should the public administration build its own trust services or implement commercial solutions?  Concluding, the decision concerning the “best approach” to take should be based on the analysis of cost,  timing, nature of the needed service and the user's perspective, defining \"what would be the best way to  serve citizens\". A mixed approach is considered by many respondents as the only one offering \"the best  possible price and performance ratio\", as it enables the use of the \"most effective and economic solutions\".  The respondents were also asked about the potential of building a central Trust Services gateway (in  accordance with the idea described in recital 7 of the eIDAS Regulation) providing a single user interface to  different Trust Services, especially for electronic signatures. 43% of the respondents identified that there is  a market need for such an idea. Almost 32% of all respondents said they did not know if there was such  demand on the market, which points out the uncertainty of an under development market (Figure 19).

Yes  No  I'm not sure  Conclusion 7: A combination of public and private solutions is considered as the best way to implement  trust services and therefore there should be always space for synergy between the two sectors.  December 2017  29  3. TSP market dynamics analysis  In addition to the survey, information about the eIDAS implementation is gained by analysing the TSL list  changes over time14. There have been many changes to TSL since the switch over to the eIDAS Regulation  (01.06.2016). More than half (54%) are stable services, which have not been changed, 19% are new  services and 27% are services stopped after eIDAS roll-out. These results were inferred in July 2017 and do  not include changes before July 1st 2016.  Figure 20  Trust services after eIDAS  Figure 21 shows the change over time of the total active qualified trust services offered, as well as the  monthly number of granted and withdrawn qualified trust services for one year after the switch over to  eIDAS. Significant growth in the number of qualified trust services added can be highlighted in June 2017.  This is due to the transitional measure laid down in Art.51.3 and Art.51.4 of the eIDAS Regulation, which  provided to CSP issuing qualified certificates under the Directive 1999/93/EC an extended period to submit  a conformity assessment report up to 1st July 2017.  The majority of Trust Services is related to the “typical CA services”, meaning the issuance of (Qualified)  Electronic Certificates. Services supporting electronic Time Stamp are widely provided. New services  defined in Article 3 of eIDAS Regulation (Preservation, Registered Delivery, Validation) are lagging  significantly (Figure 22).  14 EU Trust Service Status List (TSL) Analysis Tool, http://tlbrowser.tsl.website/tools/  54%  19%  27%  T R U S T  S E R V I C E S  A F T E R  T H E  S W I T C H  OV E R  TO  E I DA S  Service continuation  New services  Service stopped after eIDAS  Conclusion 9: The number of Qualified Trust Services has grown after the switch over to  eIDAS regulation.

Key Points and Conclusions  One year after the eIDAS Regulation entered into effect, the number of the available Trust Services has  increased considerably and a significant trend of Trust Service Providers (TSPs) (64%) towards acquiring the  qualified status is noted. This increase, confirms the wide recognition and the added value of the qualified  status in the Trust Services market.  Considering the eIDAS Regulation as a framework, there is a lot of space left for individual interpretation  but also for development at the level of Member States and even organisations. The survey results  indicate, that for more than 90% of the respondents eIDAS is an opportunity to grow their business. At the  same time, the way of provisioning Trust Services needs to be changed and it needs an innovative  approach going forward.  It is well known that for TSPs the eIDAS implementation requires an additional cost for undergoing an audit  but after that the potential of using cross border services is likely to increase. The most important and  difficult challenge is to find out how to implement such services into existing processes to optimize costs  while pursuing new business opportunities. The eIDAS Regulation can be used as a foundation for digital  transformation of organisations. It can provide new eServices allowing for the creation of new business  models, products and services whilst also driving operating costs lower.  Concerning the penetration level of (Qualified)Trust Services in the market, typical Trust Services, related  to the issuance of certificates receive a high recognition rate in the market, while the newly introduced  services by eIDAS, as well as remote qualified trust services for the generation of QESign/QESeal are still  not widespread. However, the future plans of (Q)TSP reveal the higher trend towards the provision of  qualified trust services in comparison to the non-qualified ones.  It can also be concluded from the survey results that appropriate understanding, involvement and active  participation of the national administration and organizations in the creation of the eIDAS ecosystem in  each MS is extremely important. Governments can play a leading role in the dissemination of eIDAS and  create a “starting point” for further adoption and mass use of Trust Services developing new e- Government services.  There is huge potential to increase customer usage of trust services by projecting  user-friendly applications that support Trust Services.  Moreover, the market recognizes that it is still trying to fully understand the consequences of this regulation.  Currently, technical standards (i.e. signature in the cloud) are still under development and for certain  services there are few providers in specific Member States. In addition, respondents pointed out gaps in the  legislation and standardisation, in regard to the electronic delivery, electronic validation, preservation and  conformity assessment, as well as the CABs accreditation process. This may lead to a non-harmonised Trust  Service market in the European Union and may place in question the “quality level” of Trust Services.  The following conclusions provide further insight concerning the barriers, weaknesses, strengths and  drivers for the uptake of (qualified) trust services and derive from the survey as well as the in-depth open  questions with selected stakeholders.  December 2017  33  A) Barriers and Weaknesses   Low level of knowledge of what is trust and its importance among the potential users (citizens,  enterprises) and lack of understanding of Trust Services.   Current market distortions such as seeming oligopolies in certain market sectors (i.e. browsers market)   Immaturity of the trust services market, not much knowledge about concrete implementation models and  integration with current business processes.   Gaps in Standardization, limitations posed by soft law approaches and technical specifications mainly in  regard to new defined services (electronic delivery, electronic validation, preservation), the conformity  assessment process and the accreditation of CAB.   National level trust services non-conformant with eIDAS regulation create uncertainty and confusion,  hindering the uptake of the Trust Services Market.   Limited number of Applications to support trust services and closed market of web browsers.   Very few providers to offer qualified trust services and high reluctance towards developing new solutions.  B) Strengths of the Trust Services market   eIDAS brings legal certainty which is a key enabler, since organisations are facilitated to organize and  deliver their digital strategies with confidence.   eIDAS is a key to ease the application of sectoral regulations (e.g. PSD2, MIFID2) and to guide towards the  compliance with the new GDPR.   It provides a powerful and solid base in developing new solutions and services, being recognised across  Europe.   Business requirements of industries with big digital transformation processes, like finance and healthcare,  can create market opportunities. A need for certainty, integrity and speed in industries processes can be  the driving force for the growth and uptake of Trust Service market.  C) Key Drivers for Trust Services Uptake   Usability and integration with business services  o Promote the benefits and added value the Trust Services can bring in the daily life of the people and  provide stronger integration of trust services into business processes.  o Integration of qualified certificates for website authentication with browser distributions  o Involve all related parties, not only legislators, but also third parties like browsers and developers.  o Stronger integration of electronic signatures, seals and timestamps with standard software.  o Increase the level of the interconnection between countries and the use of Trust Services by  developing new, easy to use e-Government services.   Enhance user experience and user-friendly approach  o Deployment of trust services needs to become more streamlined. Interoperability, security and  usability are probably the most important elements that will inspire confidence for stakeholders.  o Training and awareness about the capability of Trusted Services at every level of the market, including  decision makers in business and governments, SMEs and mass market.  o Reach all the target customers by making user-friendly applications based on Trust Services market.  o Remote identification for certificate issuance is a challenge that should have similar approaches in all  countries.  December 2017  34   Development of applications, standards to support “new” trust services  o Growth of the number of e-services available both in the commercial and public sectors that integrate  Trusted Services in order to impulse for the development of low-digitalised areas of economy and  administration.  o Implement and “test in practice” new tools based on eIDAS trust services like eSeals.  o Development of new standards for Internet browsers and electronic signature “in the cloud”.  o The topics of collateral technologies such as biometric advanced electronic signatures, identity of  objects for IoT solutions and block-chain-based self-sovereign eID systems can have a great impact on  the growth of the Trust Services market.  o The growing market of e-invoicing and the implementation of PSD2 could leverage the e-Seals market.  o A strong need for the preservation of electronic documents in long-term and digital preservation  systems compliant with the OAIS framework.

The eIDAS  regulation will facilitate seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses across countries  within the European Union and will establish a climate of trust when it comes to online and digital  transactions in the EU.  In the context of the eIDAS Regulation, ENISA conducted a study to present an overview of the  implementation and uptake of Trust Services defined in the eIDAS Regulation one year after adoption to the  new regime, and analyse the new opportunities and incentives introduced in the European Trust Services  market.  One year after the switch over to the eIDAS regulation, the number of the Trust Services has significantly  grown and there is a significant trend of TSP (64%) towards the process of being qualified. This goes some  way to support the wide recognition of the added value of the qualified status in the Trust Services market.  Considering the eIDAS Regulation as a framework, there is a lot of space for individual interpretation but  also for development at the level of Member States or even organisations. The survey results indicate, that  for more than 90% of the respondents recognize eIDAS as an opportunity to grow their business. At the  same time, the methods for provisioning Trust Services needs to be renewed with an innovative approach  and “out-of-box” thinking.  Concerning the penetration level of (Qualified)Trust Services in the market, “Classical” Trust Services,  related to the issuance of certificates receive a high recognition rate in the market, while the newly  defined services by eIDAS, as well as remote qualified trust services for the generation of QESign/QESeal  still do not receive widespread recognition. Future plans of (Q)TSP reveal a greater trend towards the  provision of qualified trust services in comparison to non-qualified ones.  Moreover, it is recognized that the market is still trying to fully understand the consequences of this  regulation.

Introduction  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic  signatures, seals, time stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication2 and  it repeals Directive 1999/93/EC3. Under the eIDAS Regulation it is possible to use the trust services as well  as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their cross- border use.  As of the 1st July 2016, all provisions related to trust services of the eIDAS Regulation are directly applicable  in the 28 EU Member States, which do not need to transpose it into national law. The eIDAS regulation will  facilitate seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses across Member States within the  European Union and will establish a climate of trust when it comes to online and digital transactions in the  EU.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust services and qualified trust service provider. It aims to identify  requirements and obligations that ensure a high-level of security for whatever qualified trust service or  product is used or provided.  In order to ensure a high-level of security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation foresees an  active supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS)  they provide (hereafter referred to as a QTSP/QTS) by the national competent Supervisory Body (SB) that  supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and obligations. Therefore,  when a TSP, without qualified status, intends to start providing qualified trust services, it shall submit to  the SB a notification of their intention together with a Conformity Assessment Report (CAR) issued by an  “eIDAS” accredited Conformity Assessment Body (CAB). National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) contribute to  the quality assurance of the whole process by being responsible to accredit a CAB, who will perform the  conformity assessment audits to TSP.  In the context of the eIDAS Regulation, ENISA decided to carry out this study to capture the adoption and  implementation of Trust Services in the EU market one year after the roll out of the eIDAS Regulation. The  European Commission conducted a study on a market plan to stimulate the take-up of eID and trust  services for the Digital Single Market back in July 20164.  1 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC,  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 See Glossary or Art.3.16 of the eIDAS Regulation for the definition of trust services.  3 Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community  framework for electronic signatures, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31999L0093  4 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/workshop-marketing-plan-stimulate-take-eid-and-trust- services-digital-single  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  December 2017  08  Since 2013 ENISA has contributed to supporting the EC on the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation by  providing security recommendations for the correct implementation of trust services, mapping technical  and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe5, raising  awareness for relying parties and end users on securing their electronic transactions by using trust  services.  1.1 Objectives of the report  Based on the above description, the goal of this report is to present an overview of the implementation  and uptake of Trust Services defined in the eIDAS Regulation one year after the switch over to the new  regime, and analyse the new opportunities and incentives introduced in the European Trust Services  market.  More specifically, this report aims to:  1. Collect input to identify the current status regarding the adoption and implementation of the  (Qualified)Trust Services in the European Trust Services market  2. Identify implementation and operational issues of Qualified Trust Services based on the experience  gathered by different types of stakeholders.  3. Analyse the new market opportunities and new incentives offered to the (Q)TSP in order to provide  new services.  4. Identify the key factors and barriers that influence the development of the (qualified) trust services  and define the main strengths and drivers for their further penetration in the EU Market.  The target audience of the report consists of Trust Service Providers (including individuals, businesses and  public administrations), those Member States Supervisory Bodies (SB) designated to carry out supervisory  activities under the eIDAS Regulation, Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB) as well as relying parties (users  of Trust Services).  1.2 Methodology  Two main tools were employed in this report to identify the eIDAS market uptake: an online survey and an  accompanying set of ‘deep analysis’ questions with some of the respondents who participated in the  survey, which served to better understand the current eIDAS market and future directions.  1.2.1 Online Survey  The online survey was carried out through the EU Survey Tool, and was submitted to the EU Trust Service  market stakeholders through a multitude of communication channels. The survey was mainly shared  through the European Commission distribution channel being the DIGIT-CIRCABC mailing list, the Article 19  ENISA Expert Group mailing list and ENISA contacts through the TSP Forum. The survey took place in May  and early June 2017. The respondents’ group included representatives of all types of eIDAS stakeholders:   Trust Service Providers (TSP)   Supervisory Bodies (SB)   Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB)   Relying parties (Users of the Trust Services)  5 TSP Forum, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/tspforum/tspforum  December 2017  09  The survey included 37 mixed questions that were short, closed questions (multiple or single choice) as  well as open questions, which were designed to give respondents the possibility to provide further details  and clarifications. The core of the survey was based on the experience collected by earlier ENISA  documents6, e.g. guidelines on security requirements applicable to TSPs, auditing framework for TSPs,  initiation/supervision of trust service provision, guidelines for TSPs based on standards. The answers to the  survey were analysed using quantitative data analysis techniques – with consideration of the differences  among individual respondents.  In total, 85 organisations responded to this online survey. The sample consisted of representatives among  stakeholders involved in the eIDAS regulation: Trust Service Providers (44), Conformity Assessment Bodies  (7), Supervisory Bodies (10) and relying parties (24). In terms of business sector represented, most of the  organisations originated from the private sector. Public administration respondents represent about a  quarter of the respondents, while only 9% of organisations are of mixed status/nature, as no further  characteristics can reasonably be provided.  Figure 1 Business sector of organisations that repsonded to the survey  In terms of geographic spread, respondents to this survey originated from 22 EU Member States. The  number of responses received from each country has been largely influenced by the number of Trust  Service Providers and the Trust Services available in such country as well as the degree of maturity of  online and Trust services overall. Therefore, a higher response rate has been reached in countries with a  larger number of TSPs (like Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain) available.  The responses to the survey provide for quantitative diversity originating from key stakeholders: TSP, SB and  CAB. Responses were collected from a number of participants representing different Member States and  groups (in terms of stakeholder type and business sector), and therefore, the conclusions of the survey  provide interesting insights, seeking to reflect the situation of the European Trust Service market as a whole.  Moreover, it is worth noting that Relying Parties refer mainly to organisations using Trust Services for their  6 ENISA Trust Services, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services  65%  26%  9%  B U S I N E S S  S E C TO R  O F  T H E  O R G A N I Z AT I O N  Private sector  Public administration  Mixed  December 2017  10  own purposes as well as organisations offering related consulting services, thus excluding natural persons  acting as Replying Parties in a PKI or in a set comprising of Trust services.  Figure 2 Respondents country of origin  1.2.2 Deep analysis questions  Whereas the survey generated a fair overview of the eIDAS market, it was complemented by four additional  in-depth, open questions with selected stakeholders. The survey aimed at seeking to understand the view  of market representatives on the uptake of trust services; additionally, it aimed at gaining a deeper insight  into possible directions of market development and evolution in the future. A total of 19 responses from 12  Member States have bene submitted and received. Chapter 3 presents the responses collected and  highlights the conclusions drawn.  The answers to the open questions have been analysed using qualitative content analysis.  1.3 Structure of the report  Chapter 2 provides in its charts and commentaries a more detailed overview of the trust services uptake  status from (Q)TSP, SB, CAB and relying parties, and constitutes the core of this report.  Chapter 3 draws conclusions on the findings and suggests areas for improvements and further steps to be  taken, driven by the analysis of open in-depth questions. Similarly, some key drivers for further  development have been included.  December 2017  11  2. Trust Services Uptake one-year after the eIDAS roll-out  2.1 TSP Trend towards being Qualified  The online survey was carried out in early June 2017, one year after the new rules for trust services under  the eIDAS Regulation entered into effect, being 1 July 2016. In June and early July 2017 many (Q)TSP have  added their services to the Trust List, as it is described in chapter 3. This is because of the transitional  measure laid down in Art.51.3 and Art.51.4 of the eIDAS Regulation, which allowed certification-service- providers issuing qualified certificates under Directive 1999/93/EC and considered as qualified on entry  into force of the Regulation for trust services, to have an extended period in which to submit a conformity  assessment report to the SB up in the period ending on 1 July 2017.  This survey aimed initially to identify (a) whether TSPs recognise the need to provide qualified trust  services as defined under the eIDAS regulation and (b) whether they are prepared to undergo the initiation  and supervision process (see ENISA reports)7 as foreseen in eIDAS. A TSP, without qualified status, that  intends to start providing qualified trust services should undergo an initiation phase in terms of:   Preparation: The TSP designs, sets up, implements, tests and deploys in pre-production the QTS it  intends to provide, in line with the eIDAS requirements.   Notification: The TSP notifies the SB its intention to become qualified together with the conformity  assessment report (CAR) issued by the “eIDAS” accredited CAB.   Initial verification of compliance: The SB verifies whether or not the TSP and the QTS it intends to  provide meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation in order to be granted a qualified status.   Publication of the qualified status in the national trusted list: Upon notification by the SB that the  notifying TSP/TS has been granted a qualified status, the body in charge of the Member State trusted  list, updates the list accordingly.  This survey focused on seeking a general approach of the TSP towards compliance with the qualification  requirements. The following stages were identified as far as the status of a (Q)TSP is concerned:   Information gathering   In the initiation phase   Qualified  A large portion of responding TSPs describe their situation as being “in the initiation phase” (64%) while  only 4% of the respondents declare that they are still at the stage of “information gathering”. This means  that there is a significant tendency (64%) on the part of TSPs to change their status to qualified, which  means that the added value of the qualified status is broadly recognised in the TSP market. About 32% of  the Trust Service Providers8 that took part in the survey have been granted qualified status according to  the eIDAS security requirements.  7 ENISA Report on “Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services”, “Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust  Service Providers”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines/.  8 In July 2017, there were 159 (Q)TSP based on the information from TSL Lists Browser,  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/  December 2017  12  Figure 3 Status of preparation of the TSP towards being granted the qualified status  Concerning the TSPs that are currently in the initiation phase, 43% of them are in the preparation phase  (for instance, in the phase of developing products, preparing documentation), 43% of them are undergoing  the audit process and waiting for the CAR from the corresponding CAB while the remaining 14% are  waiting for the SB to verify compliance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The above- mentioned figures are representative of the trend9 in the period when the survey took place, when many  TSPs were still submitting their CAR to the SB, since they were entitled to benefit from the transitional  period ending 1st of July 2017, as defined in Art.51.3 and Art.51.4 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Most of the survey respondents perceive eIDAS as a business opportunity, which is backed up by their  arguments and comments as given below:   “eIDAS creates a common framework in the European Union and provides new opportunities to  expand and offer services across borders”.   “eIDAS provides legal certainty and standardisation that will in turn allow all market players to better  prepare their products and lower the risk of being non-compliant”.   “It is expected that the eIDAS will create greater demand for new products and enhance the added  value of existing services”.   “eIDAS is also seen as an opportunity for CABs due to new certification areas in Trust Service  Providers”.   “The new regulation will become a foundation for digital government and enterprises”.   “eIDAS is also an opportunity mostly corresponding to new services, standardisation and a unified  European market”.   “Accreditation as a way of gaining trust from the end users is an additional opportunity”.  9 Moreover, this trend is verified by the number of QTSP in November 2017 which counts up to 203 compared to 159  TSP in July 2017.  32%  64%  4%  T S P  S TAT E  TO WA R D S  B E I N G  Q UA L I F I E D  Qualified  In initiation phase  Information gathering  Conclusion 1: There is a significant tendency among TSPs to seek qualified status which verifies the  wide recognition of the added value of the qualified status in the Trust Services market.  December 2017  13   “It creates new market opportunities for eService providers”.  However, when commenting on costs related to become compliant with the eIDAS regulation, TSPs  attribute them mainly to the cost for introducing new technologies and necessary changes in  organizational processes that are already in place and to the accreditation and audit procedure to be  followed. Supervisory Bodies particularly expressed the need for hiring new personnel and for carrying out  specialised trainings in order to prepare new technological challenges.  The survey concludes that the eIDAS regulation is widely recognised as an opportunity for the market. An  overwhelming majority (91%) of the TSPs stated that they recognise the eIDAS regulation to some extent  as a business opportunity. Just about 50% of the TSPs declare that it is an opportunity for them to grow  their business, while 41% recognise it as an opportunity with an additional cost. However, it seems that  most of the respondents who chose “both” (business opportunity and additional cost) as an answer,  consider the additional cost of eIDAS implementation and/or accreditation as an investment that will result  in more business opportunities. The remaining 9% state that the implementation of the regulation will be  an additional cost for their organisation.  Figure 4 (Q)TSP Recognition of eIDAS regulation as a business opportunity, additional cost or both  Taking into account the responses from the whole range of stakeholders, the corresponding rates are  comparable, where 92% of the respondents see a business opportunity at least to some extent.  Table 1 gives a breakdown of the answers depending on the organisation type. From the overall data  analysis, it is concluded that only SBs are somewhat sceptical as to whether the eIDAS regulation is an  opportunity. This can be explained by their role in the Trust Services market. CABs are the most  enthusiastic category of parties affected by eIDAS; CABs are auditors of QTSPs and they benefit from the  new impetus in implementing the provisions of the Regulation.  41%  50%  9%  ( Q ) T S P  TO WA R D S  R E C O G N I T I O N  O F  E I DA S  R E G U L AT I O N  Both  Business Opportunity  Additional Cost  December 2017  14  Table 1: Recognition of eIDAS as a business opportunity or an additional cost  TYPE OF ORGANISATION ADDITIONAL COST BUSINESS OPORTUNITY BOTH  Conformity Assessment Body  (CAB)  0% 86% 14%  Supervisory Body (SB) 20% 30% 50%  Trust Service Provider (TSP) 9% 50% 41%  User of Trust Services  (natural or legal persons)  4% 54% 42%  AVERAGE 8% 52% 40%  2.2 Market penetration of Qualified and non-Qualified Trust Services  One of the main goals of the survey has been to capture the penetration and adoption level of the eIDAS  trust services one year after entry into force of the eIDAS regulation. The penetration level of the eIDAS  Trust Services has been defined from 1 (least used) to 5 (most used). Based on the results shown in Figure  5, it is worth mentioning that the highest penetration level is related to the two typical services being,  (Qualified) Electronic Signatures and (Qualified)Time Stamps. The penetration level of the new trust  services - defined by the eIDAS Regulation – has been lagging. The highest growth areas are among the  newly-introduced services and they are observed for (qualified) electronic seals and (qualified) validation  services.  A small portion of the (Q)TSPs contributing to the survey disclosed the number of certificates issued  annually in the two-year period leading up to the eIDAS regulation coming into force (01.07.2014 –  30.06.2016), as well as one year after the entry into force (01.07.2016 – 30.06.2017). From that limited  sample, it can be inferred that the number of certificates issued has been growing each year and that the  current penetration of non-qualified trust services is greater than the penetration of the qualified ones,  which actually coincides with the results of Figure 5.  With reference to Relying Parties (users) when it comes to the use of (Qualified)Trust Services, the majority  (75%) of them replied that their companies have implemented such services in their operations, while only  25% have not done so yet; even these Relying Parties, however, have future plan to implement them.  Public Administration or private sector organisations using Trust Services for their own purposes as well as  companies offering related consulting services are mainly among the respondents being already prepared  to use Trust Services.  December 2017  15  Figure 5 Trust services penetration in the market one year after the eIDAS roll-out  2.2.1 Remote Qualified Trust Services  Another topic addressed in the survey concerns the implementation of any application that make use of  remote qualified trust services by relying parties. Trust Services such as cloud-based services for the  generation of qualified electronic signature or qualified electronic seal do not require end users to possess  a dedicated hardware device for key pair generation and storage (e.g. a smart card). Instead, the signing  key can be securely stored in a remote (cloud-based) system of the QTSP and signatures can be created  after strong authentication has been used to authenticate the identity of the signatory. The survey focused  on finding out the spread and recognition of remote qualified trust services among businesses in Europe.  While 54% of respondents declared that they have not implemented such applications, 42% of  respondents confirmed that they use applications that leverage on remote qualified trust services (while  the remaining 4% were not sure of the existence of such services in their markets). The respondents  represented 9 (Luxembourg, Estonia, Spain, Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Finland) out of 22  Member States participating in the survey. One of the main reasons that has been quoted as hindering the  implementation of remote signature/seal is that key standards have not yet been published10.  10 CEN/CENELEC EN 419 241 Protection Profile for QSCD for Server Signing, being developed by CEN TC 224 / WG17  30%  39%  12%  9%  13%  20%  10%  5%  3%  10%  7%  3%  3%  32%  22%  16%  23%  18%  20%  11%  13%  4%  17%  14%  10%  10%  12%  17%  20%  18%  23%  24%  15%  28%  24%  26%  20%  19%  18%  17%  9%  21%  5%  26%  11%  17%  21%  16%  22%  19%  19%  9%  9%  13%  32%  45%  20%  25%  47%  33%  53%  25%  40%  49%  60%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  Electronic signature  Qualified electronic signature  Electronic seal  Qualified electronic seal  Electronic time stamp  Qualified electronic time stamp  Qualified website authentication certificate  Electronic registered delivery service  Qualified electronic registered delivery services  Validation service  Qualified validation service  Preservation service  Qualified preservation service  PENETRATION OF TRUST SERVICES AFTER THE EIDAS ROLL OUT  5 (most used) 4 3 2 1 (least used)  December 2017  16  2.2.2 Non-regulated (nationally defined) trust services  According to the survey, 28% of the respondents, representing 9 Member States, point out that there are  specific types of trust services made available at Member State level, which have not been defined in the  eIDAS Regulation (58% of respondents declare that that do not know such services, while the remaining  14% declare that they are not aware of the existence of such services). Such trust services offered in a  Member State, are regulated by a Member State and they only have recognition within such Member State  but can still act as an obstacle to the uptake of the eIDAS Trust Services.  The respondents provided further clarifications by giving examples of services at national level which are  not part of the eIDAS Trust Services:   “Electronic signature confirmed by “Trusted Profile” (Poland)   “Electronic archiving and digitisation” (Belgium)   “Information/documents long term preservation, LEXNET Platform for exchanging information  between the Judicial Bodies and a wide range of legal operators” (Spain)  The survey shows that there are national trust services in some EU MS. Some of them are broadly used at  MS level, without however, having any cross border recognition as it is possible to do for trust services  under the eIDAS Regulation.  2.2.3 Future Directions of Trust Services Provision  The survey seeks to explore future plans of (Q)TSP concerning the provision of Trust Services in the market.  Particularly, it addresses a) future plans for the qualified trust services in relation to the non-qualified  ones, and b) future plans for the newly introduced trust services in relation to services offered already.  From Figure 6 it is apparent that there is a relative high provision of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures (20%) and electronic timestamps (16%). The future plans of (Q)TSP concerning the provision of  qualified trust services appear to be of high rate for all qualified Trust Services. Of particular interest are  future plans for qualified website authentication certificates (66%), qualified electronic seal (66%),  qualified validation service (68%) and qualified electronic registered delivery (52%).  Moreover, it is worth  noting that qualified electronic registered delivery services and qualified preservation service are not  within the scope of direct plans for 45% and 48% of (Q)TSP respectively.  Concerning non-qualified trust services, the current uptake as well as plans of TSP are given in Figure 7. It is  apparent that there is high level of penetration for typical services being electronic signatures (45%) and  electronic time stamps (32%).  Comparing the two diagrams, it is obvious there is a higher trend (grey part of the chart) towards the  provision of qualified trust services in comparison to the non-qualified ones. For example, comparing the  provision plans for qualified electronic signature towards non-qualified one, the percentages are 69%  towards 39%.  Conclusion 3: Typical Trust Services, related to the issuance of certificates, have deep penetration in  the market, while the newly-introduced services by eIDAS, as well as remote qualified trust services  for the generation of QESign/QESeal are still not widespread.

The number of SSL/TLS certificates has grown sharply in the last few years driven by  business needs rather than any regulatory framework, and the market has evolved to be highly  concentrated around a small number of players, mostly from outside Europe.  Based on these features, qualified certificates for website authentication (QWAC) present a particular case  among the newly introduced trust services in the eIDAS Regulation, since they will need to enter in an  already mature, global and unregulated market. To be successfully introduced it will be necessary to  stimulate demand for QWACs by properly communicating to consumers their benefits, while at the same  time supporting providers to ensure sufficient supply11.  The successful introduction of QWACs needs clear communication of the benefits the hold for  stakeholders. According to the survey the majority of relying parties (80%) understand the differences  between QWAC and SSL certificates, but the respondents to the survey cannot be classified as “common  users”.  Concerning the implementation of QWAC by the QTSPs, 7% of the respondents have already such a  service, 27% have not implemented it yet, and 66% have plans to run such a service in the future (see  Figure 8). It is really worth noticing the trend towards the uptake of the QWACS12.  Figure 8 TSPs plans for providing QWACs  11 Refer to “Qualified Website Authentication Certificates” report published by ENISA in May 2016,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qualified-website-authentication-certificates  12 In July 2017, there were 6 QTSP offering QWAC originating from 6 countries, while the total number of (Q)TSP is  calculated to 159.The trend can be validated by the number of QTSP, which in November 2017 counts up to 16 QTSP  providing QWAC, coming from 13 countries.

The biggest potential for utilising QWAC can be seen in Banking services (37%), HealthCare  (33%) and e-Government services (31%).  Figure 9 Potential of utilizing QWACs in different sectors of the economy  2.3 Key factors and barriers influencing development of the Trust Service market  Respondents provided mixed responses concerning the key factors that will influence further development  of the trust services market. The most important factors included “Evolution of Business Models” (20%),  “Maturity of e-Government Services” (19%), “Change in mind-set” (19%) and “Public-Private Partnership”  (11%). All the above seem to suggest that the main concerns revolve around the market’s ability to adapt  to customer needs and its ability to build suitable business models including partnerships between public  and private entities.  Most respondents believe that the evolution of business models and change in mind-set, as well as the  maturity of the e-government services influence the development of the Trust Service market.  Standardisation is considered to be an important factor (13%), while a so called “soft law” approach (for  example, guidelines delivered by EU Bodies such as ENISA) is perceived as a less significant factor in an  effort to influence the market (Figure 10).  The importance of the legal framework at the national level in the process of development of the eIDAS  market is clearly stated. For instance, in one of the respondent’s countries it is permitted to submit a letter  to Courts of Justice in electronic form signed with a qualified signature, but there is no formal method to  deliver it. There are also examples in which local governments create obstacles against the eIDAS uptake –  for instance by declaring some e-government systems as “closed” to avoid coming under the eIDAS  framework requirements.

It is worth noting that for Estonia further standardisation is a key factor,  while respondents from Italy regard more highly the maturity of e-Government services.  In most Member  States, evolution of business models has a major impact on the Trust Services market.  In each Member State, different aspects play a key role – for example Germany and Estonia deem further  standardisation of trust services as the most important factor.

December 2017  21  Figure 11  Key factors that will influence further development of trust services (selected countries)  The main barrier for further development of trust services market according to the survey concerns  limitations in understanding of Trust Services (28%). This results in low demand that has been accounted  to 13% of all responses. These factors seem to have a big impact on further development, while they  constitute a common problem in all innovative markets and appear whenever new technologies, products  or services are introduced. They represent a concern towards new and unknown situations- especially  where new services are not clear and cannot be easily explained. This is also backed up by the fact that  16% of the respondents identify users’ familiarity as a barrier.  Around 9% of the responses point to “Other” barriers for the further development of the eIDAS market.  The most common one is that “improper” government activities create barriers or distortions in the Trust  Service market. Examples include for instance the “lack or low quality of public services”, the “lack of  innovation in the public administration” and/or the “use of proprietary or unsecured legacy systems and  applications”, as well as unfair competition from public institutions that create ad hoc monopolies of state- owned companies (for instance national postal services) in the Trust Service market. Other commonly  mentioned factors are the lack of the secondary legislation for the eIDAS Regulation and the lack of a clear  road map for the development of eIDAS and trust services, which keeps on replicating harmonization gaps.  Moreover, some Member States also indicate that governments are not supportive of the development of  the eIDAS market. Others points are:   “Reluctance of private sector to implement into services”   “Lack of adoption by key service providers e.g. banks”   “No formal e-delivery standard”   “Lack of blockchain usage vision”  Change in mindset  Evolution of Business Models  Further Standardization  Maturity of e- Government Services  Public-Private Partnership  Soft law  Other  What are the key factors that will influence further  development of trust services on your market?

Concerning Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment bodies, they  respectively 80% and 86% confirmed that gaps in standardisation is one of the barriers for the further  development of the trust services.

The open question related to this issue, concerning to specify further standardisation or regulatory gaps  during auditing the QTSP, brought deeper insight into this aspect from the CAB and SB perspective.  Basically, overall 82% of the respondents from this group confirm such an issue and clearly pointed out  that standards and specifications are still missing at the regulatory level.  Figure 13 Standardisation gaps from the SB and CAB perspective   CABs Approach  CABs point out the lack of standards for eIDAS services as well as their different understanding on  standards. More specifically, they mention standards missing in the areas of qualified electronic delivery,  qualified validation, qualified preservation, and alternative identification methods (e.g. through video  means). The legal uncertainty concerning eIDAS-compliant cryptographic algorithms has also been  mentioned.   SBs Approach  At the same time, respondents representing Supervisory Bodies (SBs) complain about the lack of  standardization for the Conformity Assessment process. They strongly express the view that the  differences in CAB accreditation schemes in the Member States and the absence of a standardised  Conformity Assessment Report constitute a challenge. For instance, audit reports from one Member State  contain around 100 pages, while from another the number of pages can reach up to 500. This means CABs  have different interpretations of the actual scope of audits and/or the content of the audit report. As a  result, this situation may lead to a non-harmonised Trust Service market and questions regarding “quality”  of Trust Services in the European Union may raise. Therefore, in the opinion of the respondents from SBs,  it is imperative to draw definitions for:   Accreditation procedure for the Conformity Assessment Bodies   Auditing rules and scope (“what to audit against”) taking into account: eIDAS provisions, implementing  acts, standards and specifications   Conformity Assessment Report Content   Implementing acts and clear definitions of trust services, i.e. ERDS, preservation and validation  80 86  20 14  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  SBs CABs  H AV E  YO U  N O T I C E D  R E G U L ATO RY  O R  S TA N DA R D I Z AT I O N  G A P S  D U R I N G  AU D I T I N G ?  Yes No  December 2017  24   Technical standards describing the certification scheme of the different trust services  2.4.2 Problems encountered during an eIDAS audit  The survey has indicated that 70% of CAB and SB have encountered problems while performing eIDAS  audits to QTSP. It is worth mentioning that the time that the survey was carried out, it was the period  before the deadline of 1st July when certification-service-providers issuing qualified certificates under the  Directive 1999/93/EC had to submit a conformity assessment report to the SB. This means that many  audits were still ongoing and that SBs had been adapting to the audit process.  The most commonly quoted auditing problems to both CABs and SBs were related to different  interpretations of eIDAS requirements and/or definitions of trust services in the Member States and the  lack of harmonization by implementation. Furthermore, the problem of linking ETSI EN 319 xxx standard  series to eIDAS Regulation clauses and the number of reports to provide, meaning both EN 319 and eIDAS  report, was raised.  Figure 14  Problems with audits for SB and CAB   SB Approach  A number of respondents indicate that TSP are quite supportive and no problems were encountered when  performing audits. However, SBs raise the need to have the full version of the Conformity Assessment  Report, whereby all detected vulnerabilities be analysed, along with audit findings to be presented in a  meeting between the CAB, the QTSP and the SB.  SBs mainly report the problem of TSP preparation for the audits, and specifically: problems in having access  to systems, lack of supporting documents/ policies / procedures related to audits, divergence in  interpretations of the Regulation related to remote signing services and video identification.  Moreover, difficulties in getting insights in case of the activities of a TSP are spread out among many  subcontractors. SB also mention that the requirements in the eIDAS Regulation are quite general so that it  is possible to interpret them differently, which triggers differences in opinion among CAB, SB and TSP.   CAB Approach  The respondents originating from CABs point out the limited audit support documents and the differences  in interpretation of eIDAS requirements by the stakeholders (CAB, TSP and SB), particularly by SB. Besides  the standardisation issue (as described in 2.4.1), they express the opinion that many of their problems are  70  71  20  29  10  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  SBs  CABs  D O  YO U  E N C O U N T E R  P R O B L E M S  W H E N  P E R F O R M I N G  A N E I DA S  AU D I T ?  yes no no experience  December 2017  25  laid down at supervision level, being the result of insufficient preparation of the SB, lack of experience and  expertise of SB personnel and lack or delay in publishing national documents supporting the auditing  process. Moreover, the limited experience of the NAB and the absence of national experts/auditors have  been raised.  The management of non-conformities identified during the audit relates to the absence of shared /  common rules concerning the management of non-conformities after the audits as well as the  requirements that should apply to the conformity of non-qualified TSP.  It was also mentioned that in general audits on qualified certificate issuance, did not raise any issues, since  QTSP are well prepared thanks to their experience with proving conformance with the requirements of  Directive 1999/93/EC. However, some TSPs present an insufficient level of preparation for the eIDAS  audits, but this is not the general case. Other ancillary issues include assessing video identification  methods (article 24.1(d)) and the lack of regulation on eIDAS-compliant cryptographic algorithms as  mentioned above.  Moreover, SB and CAB, based on their auditing experience, commented also on the difficulty level of  auditing the trust services. The results show that Electronic Registered Delivery and Remote Electronic  Signatures/Seal are the most challenging Trust Services to audit, pointed out respectively by 24% and 23%  of the respondents.

Conclusion 6: A guidance on conformity assessment report content, audit process and post-audit  activities is needed to assure the same “quality” implementation level of Trust services and avoid  interpretations among the involved stakeholders (SB, CAB and TSP).  December 2017  26  2.5 Business models for Trust Services and involvement of public administration  A broad understanding of the whole Trust Service market can indicate three general business models:  Centralised (closed – leading role of the public sector), Federal (open – leading role of the commercial  sector) and Mixed (both public and commercial sector) (Figure 16). According to the respondents (in this  case TSP, CAB and SB) the leading model for trust services provision in their countries is the mixed one,  where both public and commercial organisations provide services on the market. This answer is given by  69% of the responses, representing 17 countries. A purely centralised or federal model is present in very  few countries.  Among respondents who have indicated the “Mixed” model, most of them agree that this is the right choice,  as it ensures higher adoption and brings an opportunity to maximise the strongest qualities of both parties:  public entities can build a big customer base, while private entities can be more innovative and provide  services that the public sector wouldn’t be interested in.  Arguments for shifting towards a “Federal” model is that it would be more dynamic, innovative and  competitive (respondents point out the issue with free provision of public Trust Services).  Moreover, it is  supported that this model is optimal as it is open, innovative and provides the best services for end-users.  However, 4 out of 9 respondents believe that their market should move towards a mixed model which can  guarantee a stronger market providing more possibilities, can be more flexible and can provide the best  services in both commercial and public sectors.  The respondents from countries with a “Centralised” Trust Service model are in the minority, accounting  for only 13% of the respondents. The main arguments for keeping such a model are that the public sector  can guarantee strong control over security and that in small countries such a model is more cost-effective.  Figure 16 Business model used for trust services in respondents’ country  One third of the respondents (38%) originating from 12 out of 22 countries, confirm that in their countries  there is a partnership between private and public sectors regarding Trust Services. Although Trust Services  may appear to have a direct effect only on the public sector, there is a real business potential in the private  sector too. Incorporation of Private-Public Partnership would benefit both the business and customers.  Such partnership would result in better efficiency and cost optimisation and can lead to innovation growth.  The customers would benefit from better and broader access to services, provided by both public and  private sectors, better user experience and perhaps even more flexible pricing schemes.  69%  18%  13%  W H AT  I S  T H E  B U S I N E S S  M O D E L  U S E D  F O R  T R U S T  S E R V I C E S  I N  YO U R  C O U N T RY ?  Mixed  Federal  Centralized  December 2017  27  Figure 17  Private-Public Partnership (PPP) concerning the use of trust services in respondent's country  2.5.1 Involvement of public administration  In the opinion of more than half of the respondents (55%), public administration should pursue a mixed  approach of building own solutions and implementing commercial solutions. Purchase of 3rd party  solutions only comes as the second most popular response to the question constituting 34% of the  responses.   Build own solution  Only 11% of respondents point out that public administration should build its own solutions which results  from the need for independence from any third-parties and from avoiding vendor locking, in particular if this  kind of services is perceived as a \"critical infrastructure\". Deeper analysis of the answers shows that most of  the respondents (67%) who recommend that public administration should build its own Trust Services are  from the private sector. Even more interesting is the fact that most of the respondents from the public  administration sector recommend a combination of solutions (59%) or buying 3rd party ones (36%).  However, it is highlighted that the public administration shall be fully responsible for the operation of its  publicly available services. In case of immaturity of the TS market and lack of commercial solutions, public  administration can build its own solutions to boost adoption of eIDAS Trust Services. This is in principle in  line with the conclusion drawn in chapter 2.3 that the involvement of public administration is needed.   Buying third party solutions  The rationale in favour of buying third party solutions is mainly related to the cost-effectiveness issue.  Commercial, of-the-shelf solutions, are considered as being more cost-effective than custom ones developed  by public administration. Moreover, considering the size of public administration in the proportion to the  cost and complexity of creating a whole new mechanism it does not seem to be applicable.   Combine the above solutions  In reference to the mixed approach, the justification is that the existing commercial solutions shall be used  whenever possible in case of \"standard use” whereas for some specific needs (e.g. due to national security  related aspects) administration may build its own solutions. In a long term the option “Build own solution”  may result in legacy solutions and lack of improvements, while combination of the solutions will help  towards interoperability of public and private services, depending though on each country status (e.g.  existing infrastructure, staff).  38%  28%  34%  I S  T H E R E  A  P P P  I N  YO U R  C O U N T RY ?

Concluding, the decision concerning the “best approach” to take should be based on the analysis of cost,  timing, nature of the needed service and the user's perspective, defining \"what would be the best way to  serve citizens\". A mixed approach is considered by many respondents as the only one offering \"the best  possible price and performance ratio\", as it enables the use of the \"most effective and economic solutions\".  The respondents were also asked about the potential of building a central Trust Services gateway (in  accordance with the idea described in recital 7 of the eIDAS Regulation) providing a single user interface to  different Trust Services, especially for electronic signatures. 43% of the respondents identified that there is  a market need for such an idea. Almost 32% of all respondents said they did not know if there was such  demand on the market, which points out the uncertainty of an under development market (Figure 19).

December 2017  29  3. TSP market dynamics analysis  In addition to the survey, information about the eIDAS implementation is gained by analysing the TSL list  changes over time14. There have been many changes to TSL since the switch over to the eIDAS Regulation  (01.06.2016). More than half (54%) are stable services, which have not been changed, 19% are new  services and 27% are services stopped after eIDAS roll-out. These results were inferred in July 2017 and do  not include changes before July 1st 2016.  Figure 20  Trust services after eIDAS  Figure 21 shows the change over time of the total active qualified trust services offered, as well as the  monthly number of granted and withdrawn qualified trust services for one year after the switch over to  eIDAS. Significant growth in the number of qualified trust services added can be highlighted in June 2017.  This is due to the transitional measure laid down in Art.51.3 and Art.51.4 of the eIDAS Regulation, which  provided to CSP issuing qualified certificates under the Directive 1999/93/EC an extended period to submit  a conformity assessment report up to 1st July 2017.  The majority of Trust Services is related to the “typical CA services”, meaning the issuance of (Qualified)  Electronic Certificates. Services supporting electronic Time Stamp are widely provided. New services  defined in Article 3 of eIDAS Regulation (Preservation, Registered Delivery, Validation) are lagging  significantly (Figure 22).  14 EU Trust Service Status List (TSL) Analysis Tool, http://tlbrowser.tsl.website/tools/  54%  19%  27%  T R U S T  S E R V I C E S  A F T E R  T H E  S W I T C H  OV E R  TO  E I DA S  Service continuation  New services  Service stopped after eIDAS  Conclusion 9: The number of Qualified Trust Services has grown after the switch over to  eIDAS regulation. However, introduction of services newly introduced by the eIDAS  Regulation (QWAC, QeSeal, Preservation, QERD, QVal) is significantly lagging.

In July  2017, there were 150 CAs issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures, 21 issuing qualified  certificates for electronic seals and 6 issuing qualified certificates for website authentication.

Key Points and Conclusions  One year after the eIDAS Regulation entered into effect, the number of the available Trust Services has  increased considerably and a significant trend of Trust Service Providers (TSPs) (64%) towards acquiring the  qualified status is noted. This increase, confirms the wide recognition and the added value of the qualified  status in the Trust Services market.  Considering the eIDAS Regulation as a framework, there is a lot of space left for individual interpretation  but also for development at the level of Member States and even organisations. The survey results  indicate, that for more than 90% of the respondents eIDAS is an opportunity to grow their business. At the  same time, the way of provisioning Trust Services needs to be changed and it needs an innovative  approach going forward.  It is well known that for TSPs the eIDAS implementation requires an additional cost for undergoing an audit  but after that the potential of using cross border services is likely to increase. The most important and  difficult challenge is to find out how to implement such services into existing processes to optimize costs  while pursuing new business opportunities. The eIDAS Regulation can be used as a foundation for digital  transformation of organisations. It can provide new eServices allowing for the creation of new business  models, products and services whilst also driving operating costs lower.  Concerning the penetration level of (Qualified)Trust Services in the market, typical Trust Services, related  to the issuance of certificates receive a high recognition rate in the market, while the newly introduced  services by eIDAS, as well as remote qualified trust services for the generation of QESign/QESeal are still  not widespread. However, the future plans of (Q)TSP reveal the higher trend towards the provision of  qualified trust services in comparison to the non-qualified ones.  It can also be concluded from the survey results that appropriate understanding, involvement and active  participation of the national administration and organizations in the creation of the eIDAS ecosystem in  each MS is extremely important. Governments can play a leading role in the dissemination of eIDAS and  create a “starting point” for further adoption and mass use of Trust Services developing new e- Government services.  There is huge potential to increase customer usage of trust services by projecting  user-friendly applications that support Trust Services.  Moreover, the market recognizes that it is still trying to fully understand the consequences of this regulation.  Currently, technical standards (i.e. signature in the cloud) are still under development and for certain  services there are few providers in specific Member States. In addition, respondents pointed out gaps in the  legislation and standardisation, in regard to the electronic delivery, electronic validation, preservation and  conformity assessment, as well as the CABs accreditation process. This may lead to a non-harmonised Trust  Service market in the European Union and may place in question the “quality level” of Trust Services.  The following conclusions provide further insight concerning the barriers, weaknesses, strengths and  drivers for the uptake of (qualified) trust services and derive from the survey as well as the in-depth open  questions with selected stakeholders.  December 2017  33  A) Barriers and Weaknesses   Low level of knowledge of what is trust and its importance among the potential users (citizens,  enterprises) and lack of understanding of Trust Services.   Current market distortions such as seeming oligopolies in certain market sectors (i.e. browsers market)   Immaturity of the trust services market, not much knowledge about concrete implementation models and  integration with current business processes.   Gaps in Standardization, limitations posed by soft law approaches and technical specifications mainly in  regard to new defined services (electronic delivery, electronic validation, preservation), the conformity  assessment process and the accreditation of CAB.   National level trust services non-conformant with eIDAS regulation create uncertainty and confusion,  hindering the uptake of the Trust Services Market.   Limited number of Applications to support trust services and closed market of web browsers.   Very few providers to offer qualified trust services and high reluctance towards developing new solutions.  B) Strengths of the Trust Services market   eIDAS brings legal certainty which is a key enabler, since organisations are facilitated to organize and  deliver their digital strategies with confidence.   eIDAS is a key to ease the application of sectoral regulations (e.g. PSD2, MIFID2) and to guide towards the  compliance with the new GDPR.   It provides a powerful and solid base in developing new solutions and services, being recognised across  Europe.   Business requirements of industries with big digital transformation processes, like finance and healthcare,  can create market opportunities. A need for certainty, integrity and speed in industries processes can be  the driving force for the growth and uptake of Trust Service market.  C) Key Drivers for Trust Services Uptake   Usability and integration with business services  o Promote the benefits and added value the Trust Services can bring in the daily life of the people and  provide stronger integration of trust services into business processes.  o Integration of qualified certificates for website authentication with browser distributions  o Involve all related parties, not only legislators, but also third parties like browsers and developers.  o Stronger integration of electronic signatures, seals and timestamps with standard software.  o Increase the level of the interconnection between countries and the use of Trust Services by  developing new, easy to use e-Government services.   Enhance user experience and user-friendly approach  o Deployment of trust services needs to become more streamlined. Interoperability, security and  usability are probably the most important elements that will inspire confidence for stakeholders.  o Training and awareness about the capability of Trusted Services at every level of the market, including  decision makers in business and governments, SMEs and mass market.  o Reach all the target customers by making user-friendly applications based on Trust Services market.  o Remote identification for certificate issuance is a challenge that should have similar approaches in all  countries.  December 2017  34   Development of applications, standards to support “new” trust services  o Growth of the number of e-services available both in the commercial and public sectors that integrate  Trusted Services in order to impulse for the development of low-digitalised areas of economy and  administration.  o Implement and “test in practice” new tools based on eIDAS trust services like eSeals.  o Development of new standards for Internet browsers and electronic signature “in the cloud”.  o The topics of collateral technologies such as biometric advanced electronic signatures, identity of  objects for IoT solutions and block-chain-based self-sovereign eID systems can have a great impact on  the growth of the Trust Services market.  o The growing market of e-invoicing and the implementation of PSD2 could leverage the e-Seals market.  o A strong need for the preservation of electronic documents in long-term and digital preservation  systems compliant with the OAIS framework.

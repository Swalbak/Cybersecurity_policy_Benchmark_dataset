It is our  aim to ensure that the knowledge and research collected and produced by the Capacity Centre can  assist nations improve their cybersecurity capacity in a systematic and substantive way. By helping  understand national cybersecurity capacity, the Capacity Centre hopes to help promote an innovative  cyberspace in support of well-being, human rights and prosperity for all.  In order to achieve this aim, the Capacity Centre developed its prototype National Cybersecurity  Capacity Maturity Model in 2014, and deployed it in 2015 during 11 national cybersecurity capacity  reviews, as well as a regional assessment of the Latin American and Caribbean Region (led by the  Organization of American States in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank). The  reviews were conducted alongside several international organisations and leading ministries, and  convened stakeholders from across all sectors of society in order to gain a comprehensive  understanding of the maturity of cybersecurity capacity of the nation. During the reviews, the Capacity  Centre was able to gauge whether the content of CMM is consistent with the cybersecurity capacity  landscape, as well as determine ways to enhance the overall content, structure and deployment of  the CMM through lessons learnt.  Therefore, the Capacity Centre has developed a revised edition of the CMM, based on the lessons  learnt through the deployment of the model. The Capacity Centre proposed a series of modifications  based on the lessons learnt to a panel of cybersecurity experts from various disciplines. These expert  consultations confirmed several proposed amendments, and produced additional inputs for  consideration in the revision of the CMM. Once the amended content was curated by senior  academics leading the development of the respective cybersecurity capacity dimensions, the revised  edition of the CMM was produced.  Most of the alterations that have been made in the revised edition of the CMM are structural rather  than substantial. Certain factors and aspects have been combined or reconfigured to improve the  clarity and precision of the model as a whole, while ensuring the continuity of the content. For  example, in Dimension 3, several review participants expressed confusion regarding the differences  between factors, which resulted in a reconfiguration of this dimension in order to more clearly  communicate the intention of each factor. Other revisions, such as adding factors to certain  dimensions, were made to ensure the essence of the cybersecurity capacity dimensions is more  accurately reflected. In Dimension 5, in particular, several new factors were added so that the focus  of the dimension is drawn toward technical standards, controls and products rather than the existing  ambiguous scope. Finally, some factors were added as a direct result of feedback from the various  country reviews, such as the addition of a factor on the role of media in Dimension 2 and a factor on  international cooperation in Dimension 4.  This effort to enhance the content of the CMM is not intended to be a static exercise. As the Capacity  Centre continues to deploy the model across the world, new lessons will be learnt that can be used to  further enhance the CMM. Our aim is to ensure the CMM remains applicable to all national contexts  and reflects the global state of cybersecurity capacity maturity.

Introduction  The goal of the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (Capacity Centre) is to increase the scale and  effectiveness of cybersecurity capacity-building, both within the UK and internationally through the  deployment of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CMM). The Capacity Centre will make this  knowledge available to governments, communities and organisations to help increase their  cybersecurity capacity. By helping increasing national cybersecurity capacity the Capacity Centre  hopes to help promote an innovative cyberspace in support of well-being, human rights and prosperity  for all.  We currently consider cybersecurity capacity to comprise five dimensions:  1. Devising cybersecurity policy and strategy;  2. Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society;  3. Developing cybersecurity knowledge;  4. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks; and  5. Controlling risks through standards, organisations and technologies.  These five dimensions cover the broad expanse of areas that should be considered when seeking to  enhance cybersecurity capacity. We recognise that these dimensions may overlap with one another  on certain issues, and indeed the Capacity Centre hopes to understand the interdependences between  cybersecurity capacities as it conducts more national capacity reviews. Within each dimension, there  are several factors, aspects, stages of maturity, and indicators of cybersecurity capacity, each of which  is defined as follows:   Dimension: The 5 dimensions represent the clusters of cybersecurity capacity through which  the Capacity Centre analyses the nuances of capacity. They represent the different research  ‘lenses’ through which cybersecurity capacity is studied. Accordingly, the most fundamental  structure of the CMM is divided into dimensions, which consist of a number of factors.   Factor: Within the 5 dimensions, factors describe what it means to possess cybersecurity  capacity. They are elements that contribute to the enhancement of cybersecurity capacity  maturity, and the complete list of factors seeks to holistically incorporate all elements of the  cybersecurity capacity landscape, though we recognise that this list may need to be adapted  based on lessons learnt in reviews. Most factors are composed of a number of aspects that  structure the factor’s content (indicators) into more concise parts, while some factors that are  more limited in scope do not have specific aspects.  Cybersecurity  Policy and  Strategy  Cyber Culture  and Society  Cybersecurity  Education,  Training and  Skills  Legal and  Regulatory  Frameworks  Standards,  Organisations,  and  Technologies  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  6   Aspect: Each factor is then presented as a number of aspects, which represent different  components of the factor. Aspects represent an organisational method to divide indicators  into smaller clusters that are easier to comprehend. The number of aspects depends on the  themes that emerge in the content of the factor and the overall complexity of the factor. Each  aspect is composed of a series of indicators within 5 stages of maturity.   Stage: Stages define to which degree a country has progressed in relation to a certain  factor/aspect of cybersecurity capacity. The CMM consists of 5 distinct stages of maturity  (defined on page 6), that serve as a snapshot of existing cybersecurity capacity, from which a  country can improve or decline depending on the actions taken (or inaction). Within each  stage there are a number of indicators which a country has to fulfil to move towards higher  cybersecurity capacity maturity.   Indicator: Indicators represent the most elemental part of CMM’s structure. Each indicator  describes the steps, actions, or building blocks that are indicative of a specific stage of maturity  within a distinct aspect, factor and dimension. In order to elevate a country’s cybersecurity  capacity maturity, all of the indicators within a particular stage will need to have been fulfilled.  Most of these indicators are binary in nature, i.e. the country can either evidence they have  fulfilled the indicator criteria, or they cannot provide such evidence. In order for a country to  enhance its maturity within a given aspect of factor, the fulfilment of every indicator needs to  evidenced, otherwise they country cannot progress to the following stage.  The preceding terms are layered as follows:  Below is a template for how the factors, aspects, and indicators are visualised in each dimension of  the CMM:  D X.X: Factor Title  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Aspect A  Indicator 1  Indicator 2  Indicator 3  Indicator 4  Indicator 5  Indicator 6  Indicator 7  Indicator 8  Indicator 9  Indicator 10  Indicator 11  Indicator 12  Indicator 13  Aspect B  Indicator 1  Indicator 2  Indicator 3  Indicator 4  Indicator 5  Indicator 6  Indicator 7  Indicator 8  Indicator 9  Indicator 10  Indicator 11  Indicator 12  Dimension  Factor  Aspect  Start-up stage  Indicators  Formative stage  Indicators  Established stage  Indicators  Strategic stage  Indicators  Dynamic stage  Indicators  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  7  In order to determine to what stage of maturity particular indicators belong, each stage has been  characterised as follows:   Start-up: At this stage either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in nature.  There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity building, but no concrete  actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence at this stage.   Formative: Some features of the aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be  ad-hoc, disorganized, poorly defined – or simply “new”. However, evidence of this activity can  be clearly demonstrated.   Established: The elements of the aspect are in place, and working. There is not, however, well- thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little trade-off decision- making has been made concerning the “relative” investment in the various elements of the  aspect. But the aspect is functional and defined.   Strategic: Choices have been made about which parts of the aspect are important, and which  are less important for the particular organisation or nation. The strategic stage reflects the  fact that these choices have been made, conditional upon the nation or organization's  particular circumstances.   Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy depending on  the prevailing circumstances such as the technology of the threat environment, global conflict  or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g. cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic  organisations have developed methods for changing strategies in stride. Rapid decision- making, reallocation of resources, and constant attention to the changing environment are  feature of this stage.  The CMM allows the review of current national cybersecurity capacity maturity. In each case,  understanding the requirements to achieve higher levels of capacity should directly indicate areas  requiring further investment, and the data required to evidence such capacity levels. This means that  the CMM could also be used to build business cases for investment and expected performance  enhancements.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  8  II. Development of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model  a. Selection of Cybersecurity Capacity-Building Factors  In developing the first iteration of the model in 2014, the Capacity Centre began the process of  selecting factors contributing to building capacity in cybersecurity through exhaustive exploration into  various disciplines. This search sought to gather as much publically available material on cybersecurity  capacity-building as possible, in order not to miss relevant material and reduce the risk of duplicating  efforts conducted by other institutions. Therefore, the Capacity Centre researched, assessed, and  analysed cybersecurity capacity-building factors from several organisations from around the world.  This process sought to ensure that the CMM developed by the Capacity Centre is as scientifically  rigorous as possible. Such factors include, but are not limited to, content produced by: the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA), Hathaway Global Strategies LLC., the National Institute of Standards and Technologies  (NIST), the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and  Development (OECD), the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), and the World Economic Forum  (WEF). These organisations (among others) have all conducted significant research into various factors  contributing to cybersecurity capacity-building. The Capacity Centre acknowledges the importance of  these initiatives in the development of the CMM. In addition, in order to collect as diverse and credible  input as possible, the Capacity Centre consulted with various stakeholders with diverse geographic,  organisational and disciplinary perspectives. These stakeholders are all regarded as experts in their  respective fields, which encompass the five dimensions of cybersecurity capacity identified by the  Capacity Centre. Stakeholders routinely contributed to the collection of cybersecurity capacity- building material.  Once the initial broad collection of factors had been completed, the Capacity Centre proceeded to  prioritise these factors based on a defined methodology. Prioritisation was deemed necessary in order  to prevent an over-abundance of information during the deployment phase. In order to conduct this  prioritisation, the Capacity Centre developed a survey which proposed the following questions:   CATEGORISATION: To what extent do you believe that this should be a primary factor within  one of the five dimensions (as opposed to a consideration that serves as an aspect of a factor)?   EVIDENCE: To what extent do you believe it is impossible/easy to gather evidence to  demonstrate that a nation state or other organisation possesses this capability (i.e. is it  measurable or demonstrable in an observable way)?   VALIDATION: How scientifically robust do you believe measures of this factor could be?   POTENTIAL: Do you agree that this factor should be included in the Cybersecurity Capacity  Maturity Model, assuming supporting data could be acquired?   RELEVANCE: How important is this factor to the future development of cybersecurity capacity?  This survey was completed by several of the stakeholders previously mentioned. The Capacity Centre  collected the responses for all of the participants in the survey in order to create an average score for  all results in each dimension of capacity, and then took the average of each factor across all five  questions, which produced a single score for every factor. These average scores per factor served as  our base for prioritisation. The Capacity Centre decided to use the third quartile as its benchmark for  highest priority factors, as this produced both an operational number of factors and is an objective  standard for selection. By comparing each score against the baseline, and accounting for overlap  between different dimensions, the factors for inclusion were selected.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  9  However, before the CMM could be converted into a tool for national cybersecurity reviews, the CMM  was revised to reflect the operational environment. This revision process was crucial to ensuring that  the CMM maintains a functional purpose, rather than a theoretical perspective. The Organisation of  American States (OAS) provided invaluable insight into several operational environments in which the  CMM might be deployed. Finally, the CMM was adapted into a deployment tool, which optimised  accessibility to the various stakeholders participating in the cybersecurity review. The adaptation  process sought to capture the academic rigour and content behind the development of the CMM, but  condense, re-structure, and rephrase the material in such a way as to maximise the impact of the  capacity-building exercise.  b. Pilot Phase and Deployment  During the pilot phase of CMM in the first quarter of 2015, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre  worked alongside the Organisation of American States (OAS) and Inter-American Development Bank  (IDB)1  and the World Bank2  to conduct national cybersecurity capacity maturity reviews. Further  country reviews were conducted over the following year in conjunction with the Commonwealth  Telecommunications Organisation (CTO),3 the government of The Netherlands under the auspices of  the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE)4 and individual countries.5 Throughout the process of  deployment, the Capacity Centre has not only gained a unique understanding of the cybersecurity  capacities of several countries, but has also learned lessons about cybersecurity capacity-building that  can benefit the cybersecurity discipline as an evolving field of work.  As the Capacity Centre does not and cannot have thorough and in-depth understanding of each  domestic context in which the model is deployed, it is important to work alongside international  organisations or host ministries or organisations within the respective country. Moreover,  cooperation with international organisations has sought to enable those organisations to achieve its  own cybersecurity capacity-building objectives through a holistic understanding of a country’s existing  cybersecurity capacity. After engaging with the model deployment a number of times, these  organisations will continue to conduct reviews in their own right, with remote Capacity Centre  support. In this way, we can increase economies of scale while empowering international  organisations to use a single model that is applicable to a variety of objectives and addresses  cybersecurity capacity comprehensively.  1 Colombia, Jamaica, and regional review  2 Armenia, Bhutan, Kosovo and Montenegro.  3 Uganda and Fiji.  4 Senegal.  5 Indonesia and United Kingdom.

Evolution of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model  This document presents the second iteration of the Capacity Centre’s Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity  Model. All revisions that have been made are based on lessons learnt in the pilot phase and  subsequent post-pilot deployment of the CMM and through expert consultations. However, to  validate the results of this revision process and ensure widest stakeholder consultations, this revised  edition of the CMM has been disseminated to international cybersecurity experts for review and  advice before finalisation.  a. Revision Process  In order to gather feedback and suggestions for the CMM evolution, a series of conference calls with  members of the Capacity Centre’s Expert Panel was arranged in late 2015. Each conference call  focused on one of the five dimensions of the CMM and discussed various enhancements to the existing  factors. These calls also introduced potential new factors, as gathered from the lessons learnt of the  deployment of the model, a roundtable Expert Panel discussion, and additional preliminary  consultations with the respective dimension Chairs. The outcome of the discussion during each of the  calls was analysed and fed into the revision of the five CMM dimensions. The revised content was in  turn curated by senior academics leading the development of the respective dimensions. Key  modifications are described below.  b. Modifications and New Factors of CMM Revised Edition  Dimension One: Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy  An additional aspect was added to the Incident Response factor (‘Mode of Operation’) to better reflect  the operational part of incident response capacity, including processes, tools and training. This was  originally a factor in Dimension 5, but the review participants felt this factor was out-of-place without  the context of the other aspects of incident response included in Dimension 1.  Furthermore, several aspects within various factors were merged to create a more focused view on  each factor. For example, crisis management was condensed from two aspects to one because during  the reviews, it became evident that participant responses for the ‘Evaluation’ aspect of crisis  management was dependent on their response to the ‘Planning’ aspect. By combining these two  aspects, the dependent relationship between aspects is removed.  Finally, to avoid further redundancies in this dimension, the word “national” was removed from  various factors, aspects and indicators (apart from ‘National Cybersecurity Strategy’, which was  identified as a noun), as the CMM is in itself a national model.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  11  Dimension Two: Cyber Culture and Society  One of the major changes within the second dimension was the clarification of the relationship  between cybersecurity awareness raising and cybersecurity mind-set. To ensure coherence within and  across dimensions, the factor on initiatives seeking to raise awareness was moved to Dimension Three  (Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills), while the prevailing cybersecurity mind-set and social  perception was retained in Dimension Two.  Three new factors were introduced within this dimension, namely: User Understanding of Personal  Information Protection Online, Reporting Mechanisms, and Media and Social Media. All of these new  factors had been identified as missing or not distinct enough during the deployment of the CMM.  The factor on User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online refers to the  understanding and sensitisation of users to protecting their personal data. This factor was identified  as important in the first iteration of the CMM, but was not included due to difficultly of evidence  collection. We decided that, since perceptual evidence should be included in the reviews, we are able  to include this factor.  The factor on Reporting Mechanisms was identified as an important aspect to be included in the  revised edition of the CMM by the various experts we consulted during the revision phase. This factor  explores the existence of reporting mechanisms functioning as channels for users to report cybercrime  and the possible development of coordinated programmes to promote the use of these mechanisms.  The evidence gathered will offer valuable insight in a country’s preparedness to control cybersecurity  risks and the public ability to recognise and report these.  The role of media was identified as important during the CMM reviews and is now a distinct factor in  the revised edition. The factor on Media and Social Media explores whether cybersecurity is a  common subject across mainstream media, or an issue for broad discussion on social media, as well  as the role of media in conveying information about cybersecurity to the public, thus shaping their  cybersecurity values, attitudes and online behaviour.  Dimension Three: Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills  Awareness raising was moved to this dimension from the cultural and social dimension, as raising  awareness of cybersecurity is crucial to building knowledge. Additionally, the participants in the  reviews often claimed that executive awareness of cybersecurity depended on the sector. By re- contextualising this factor into raising executive awareness, this aspect can be more readily applied at  the national level.  Additionally, while the content of the third dimension did not change substantially, the deployment  of the CMM suggested a broad restructuring of the factors and their aspects, as the previous structure  proved to be confusing to country review participants and showed overlaps. For example, there was  a conflation of education and training in the first iteration of the model that many participants found  confusing. In the new structure, education and training are clearly separated and are defined by the  provisional aspect, as well as development/uptake aspect, rather than addressing both education and  training in the same factors. Emphasis was further shifted from focusing primarily on businesses and  the private sector towards addressing all sectors of society.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  12  Dimension Four: Legal and Regulatory Frameworks  Among the different components of the factor legal and regulatory frameworks, only ICT security  legislation was considered unclear during the reviews, as the interpretation varied between ICT  security legislation as the legal tool for mandatory standards adoption, or as a unique cybercrime law.  As a result, this aspect of the first factor was clarified and the content was made more explicit by  referring to the protection of critical information infrastructure, e-transactions, liability of Internet  Service Providers and cyber incident reporting obligations.  Additionally, while a distinction was made in the CMM between training prosecutors and judges,  review participants commented that it is not only crucial to maintain this distinction in further versions  of the model, but also that the need for specialised trainings should be highlighted. This finding was  corroborated by experts consulted on this dimension. In fact, one expert even suggested that, if the  same training programmes are used for all parts of the criminal justice system, it would signify a lower  level of cybersecurity capacity maturity.  The third factor on responsible disclosure was less self-explanatory to participants, as it did not directly  relate to the other elements of this dimension and there was disagreement whether responsible  disclosure requires a legal response or is rather an issue for policy or standards and good practice.  Experts consulted on the various dimensions concluded that the responsible disclosure factor should  be moved to the Standards, Organisations, and Technologies Dimension, as its content relates to  technical vulnerabilities and the standards that are in place to disclose and address these.  Through expert consultations, several recommendations were gathered to further enhance the  structure of Dimension Four. It was discussed that additional aspects on legislation addressing  intellectual property, data protection, child protection online and consumer protection should be  added to provide a more holistic overview of the legal framework relating to cybersecurity and  emphasise these specific subjects that are widely debated at the international arena.  Another recommendation raised during expert consultations was the need to distinguish domestic  and international cooperation as its own factor rather than an aspect of the criminal justice system  factor. In accordance with expert input, the newly established third factor within this dimension  includes both formal legal cooperation mechanisms (such as mutual legal assistance and extradition)  and informal mechanisms (such as cooperation between law enforcement and Internet Service  Providers), on domestic and international levels.  Dimension Five: Standards, Organisations, and Technologies  The various reviews conducted by the Capacity Centre indicated that the focus of Dimension Five was  not as clear or succinct as the other four. Therefore, four new factors were based on recommendations  from cybersecurity experts, in order to tailor the focus of this dimension on a clear set of issues.  Two new factors that were added observe the level of deployment and implementation of technical  security and cryptographic control measures. These factors will gather evidence on the deployment  of up-to-date technical security controls such as anti-malware systems, intrusion detection systems,  network firewalls, event-logging and auditing functionality, as well as the deployment of cryptographic  controls in all sectors, and whether these controls meet international standards and guidelines.  In addition, software quality was added as a new factor. Experts in cybersecurity have identified that  the aspect of quality during deployment of software and the functional requirements as well as the  existence and improvement of policies and processes on software updates were missing from the  CMM.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  13  The only other substantial change was the combination of the two aspects of National Infrastructure  Resilience into one on Internet Infrastructure Resilience which, based on input from the reviews, more  accurately reflects the content in the indicators.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  14  IV. National Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model  Dimension 1: Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy  This dimension explores the country’s capacity to develop and deliver cybersecurity strategy and  enhance its cybersecurity resilience through improving its incident response, crisis management,  redundancy, and critical infrastructure protection capacities. Delivering cybersecurity must include  capability in early warning, deterrence, resistance and recovery. This dimension considers effective  security policy in delivering national defence and resilience capability, while maintaining the benefits  of a cyberspace vital for government, international business and society in general.  D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy  Cybersecurity strategy is essential to mainstreaming a cybersecurity agenda across government  because it helps prioritise cybersecurity as an important policy area, determines responsibilities and  mandates of key cybersecurity government and non-governmental actors, and directs allocation of  resources to the emerging and existing cybersecurity issues and priorities.   Development: This aspect addresses the development of a national strategy, allocation of  implementation authorities across sectors and civil society and an understanding of national  cybersecurity risks and threats which drives capacity building at a national level.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of an overarching programme for  cybersecurity coordination, including a departmental owner or coordinating body with a  consolidated budget.   Content: This aspect addresses the content of the national cybersecurity strategy and whether  it is linked explicitly to national risks, priorities and objectives such as public awareness raising,  mitigation of cybercrime, incident response capability and critical national infrastructure  protection.  D 1.2: Incident Response  This factor addresses the capacity of the government to identify and determine characteristics of  national level incidents in a systematic way. It also reviews the government’s capacity to organise,  coordinate, and operationalise incident response.   Identification of Incidents: This aspect identifies whether there is a central registry of national  level cyber incidents.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of a mandated central body designated to  collect incident information, and its relationship with the public and private sector for national  level incident response.   Coordination: This aspect explores the existence of coordinated national incident response  with clear roles and responsibilities as well as lines of communication for crisis situations.   Mode of Operation: This aspect addresses the operational and technical capacity of the  incident response organisation, such as services, processes, resources and tools.  D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  This factor studies the government’s capacity to identify CI assets and the risks associated with them,  engage in response planning and critical assets protection, facilitate quality interaction with CI asset  owners, and enable comprehensive general risk management practice including response planning.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  15   Identification: This aspect addresses the existence of a general list of CI assets, identified risk-  based priorities, and an audit of CI assets on a regular basis.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of a formal collaboration mechanism  between government ministries and owners of critical assets.   Risk Management and Response: This aspect explores whether cybersecurity is embedded  into general risk management practices, and whether security measures are developed to  ensure business continuity of CI in the context of the prevailing risk environment. Additionally,  this aspect refers to information protection procedures and processes for response planning  to an attack on critical assets, supported by adequate technical security solutions.  D 1.4: Crisis Management  This factor addresses crisis management planning addresses conducting specialised needs  assessments, training exercises, and simulations that produce scalable results for policy development  and strategic decision-making. Through qualitative and quantitative techniques, cybersecurity  evaluation processes aim to produce structured and measurable results that would solicit  recommendations for policymakers and other stakeholders and inform national strategy  implementation as well as inform budgetary allocations.   Crisis Management: (as above)  D 1.5: Cyber Defence Consideration  This factor explores whether the government has the capacity to design and implement a cyber  Defence strategy and lead its implementation including through a designated cyber Defence  organisation. It also reviews the level of coordination between various public and private sector actors  in response to malicious attacks on strategic information systems and critical national infrastructure.   Strategy: This aspect addresses the existence of a national cyber Defence strategy.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of a designated organisation within the  government responsible for Defence for conflict using cyber means.   Coordination: This aspect addresses coordination in response to malicious attacks on strategic  information systems and critical national infrastructure.  D 1.6: Communications Redundancy  This factor reviews a government’s capacity to identify and map digital redundancy and redundant  communications among stakeholders. Digital redundancy foresees a cybersecurity system in which  duplication and failure of any component is safeguarded by proper backup. Most of these backups will  take the form of isolated (from mainline systems) but readily available digital networks, but some may  be non-digital (e.g. backing up a digital communications network with a radio communications  network).   Communications Redundancy: (as above)  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  16  D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Strategy Development  No national cybersecurity  strategy exists, although  planning processes for  strategy development may  have begun.  Advice may have been  sought from international  partners.  An outline/draft national  cybersecurity strategy has  been articulated.  Processes for strategy  development have been  initiated.  Consultation processes have  been agreed for key  stakeholder groups,  including international  partners.  A national cybersecurity  strategy has been published.  Multi-stakeholder  consultation processes have  been followed and  observations fed back to the  identified strategy 'owners'.  National cybersecurity  strategy is promoted and  implemented by multiple  stakeholders across  government and other  sectors.  Strategy review and renewal  processes are confirmed.  Regular scenario and real- time cyber exercises that  provide a concurrent picture  of national cyber resilience  are considered a strategic  priority.  Relevant metrics,  measurement, and  monitoring processes, data,  and historic trends are  evaluated and inform  decision-making.  Cybersecurity strategic  plans, aligned with national  strategic priorities, drive  capacity building and  investments in security.  Continual revision and  refinement of cybersecurity  strategy is conducted  proactively to adapt to  changing socio-political,  threat and technology  environments.  The country is a leader  within the international  community and the debate  shaping the development of  global cybersecurity  strategy.  Organisation  No overarching national  cybersecurity programme  has been developed.  A coordinated cybersecurity  programme is being  developed through a multi- stakeholder consultative  process.  However, budgets reside in  disparate public  departments without a  discrete cybersecurity  budget line.  The single agreed  cybersecurity programme  has a designated  coordinating body with a  mandate to consult across  public and private sectors,  and civil society.  The programme is defined  according to goals and  objectives, using metrics to  measure progress.  Discrete budget for  cybersecurity exists, but is  Evidence exists of iterative  application of metrics and  resulting refinements to  operations and strategy  across government,  including resource allocation  considerations.  A consolidated cybersecurity  budget has been  administered in order to  allocate resources.  A singular national  cybersecurity posture exists  with the ability to reassign  tasks and budgets  dynamically according to  changing risk assessments.  A designated national body  disseminates and receives  feedback on the strategy  from wider society to  continuously enhance the  national cybersecurity  posture.

Content  Various national policies  may exist with a reference  to cybersecurity, but if so,  the content is generic, not  necessarily aligned with  national goals, and does not  provide actionable  directives.  Content includes links  established between  cybersecurity, national risk  priorities and business  development, but these are  generally ad-hoc and lack  detail.  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy is  linked explicitly and directly  to national risks, priorities  and objectives, as well as  business development.  Content at a minimum  should seek to raise public  awareness, mitigate  cybercrime, establish  incident response capability  and protect critical  infrastructure from external  and internal threats.  Metrics and measurements  are utilised to update  national cybersecurity  strategy content to help  leaders evaluate the success  of the various cybersecurity  objectives and guide  resource investment.  Content now also seeks to  protect critical  infrastructure internal  threats.  New content is periodically  incorporated in the strategy  in response to evolving  threat landscapes.  Content of the national  cybersecurity strategy leads,  promotes and encourages  national and international  cooperation to ensure a  secure, resilient and trusted  cyberspace.  D 1.2: Incident Response  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification of  Incidents  No catalogue of national  level incidents exists, or is in  development.  Certain cybersecurity  incidents have been  categorised and recorded as  national-level threats.  A central registry of  national-level cybersecurity  incidents is operational.  Regular, systematic updates  to the national-level  incident registry are made.  Resources are allocated for  analysing incidents in order  to prioritise which incidents  are most urgent.  Focus on incident  identification and analysis is  adapted in response to  environmental changes.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  18  D 1.2: Incident Response  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Organisation  No organisation for national  cyber incident response  exists.  Private sector organisations  key to national cybersecurity  have been identified, but no  formal coordination and  information sharing  mechanisms exist between  public and private sectors.  Dispersed public and private  sector bodies detect and  respond to incidents as they  occur but a specific mandate  for a national cyber incident  response organisation is yet  to be agreed.  A funded national body for  incident response has been  established (such as CSIRTs  or CERTs), with specified  roles and responsibilities.  Distinct and formal security  roles and responsibilities are  allocated across  government, critical  infrastructure, enterprise,  and individual systems.  Human and financial  resources allocated to  incident response are  adequate to the  cybersecurity threat  environment and enhance  effectiveness of the  organisation.  National incident response  capability is fully financially  sustainable, from a single or  multiple sources.  An early warning capacity is  incorporated into the  mission of the incident  response organisation,  which seeks to shape and  manage the threat  landscape before  responding to specific  incidents.  Coordination  Coordination of incident  response is informally  managed within or between  public and private sectors.  Leads for incident response  have been designated at the  operational level, but  national-level coordination  has not yet been  established.  Routine and coordinated  national incident response is  established and published  between public and private  sectors, with lines of  communication prepared  for times of crisis.  International cooperation  for incident response  between organisations  exists to resolve incidents as  they occur.  The national incident  response organisation  coordinates and  collaborates with sub- national/sectorial incident- response organisations.  Technical capabilities now  go beyond coordinating  response and include  strategically focusing  resources in coordinating  international incident and  threat intelligence  analysis/support.  A platform for the reporting  and sharing of incidents  across sectors is promoted.  Multi-level and inclusive  national and international  coordination between all  levels and sectors is  internalised as vital for  continuous and effective  incident response.  Regional coordination exists  to resolve incidents as they  occur.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  19  D 1.2: Incident Response  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Mode of Operation  Key incident response  processes (detection,  resolution, prevention, etc.)  and (digital) tools to support  them have not been well  defined or documented.  There is limited or no  sufficient training or  understanding of the key  concepts of cybersecurity  incident response.  Key incident response  processes have been  identified, but not officially  documented or  operationalised.  Members of CSIRTs receive  training in an ad-hoc  manner.  Incident response is reactive  and ad-hoc.  Key incident response  processes and tools are  defined, documented and  functional.  Members of CSIRTs receive  training regularly in order to  understand key concepts of  cybersecurity incident  response.  National-level incident  response is limited in scope  and still reactive.  Incident response teams  have established a training  policy for their members;  members are being trained  in specialised subjects and  accredited by internationally  recognised bodies on a  regular basis.  Team members are able to  carry out a sophisticated  incident analysis  investigation quickly and  efficiently.  Key processes (detection,  resolution, prevention, etc.)  are being monitored and  reviewed in regular basis,  and tested with different  case scenarios.  Forensics services are  offered.  National incident response  teams coordinate with  international counterparts.  The results of testing key  processes through case  scenarios are being analysed  and are incorporated into  the updating of processes.  The benefits of training and  accreditation are being  evaluated and inform the  future training planning.  Tools for early detection,  identification, prevention,  response and mitigation of  zero-day vulnerabilities are  embedded in incident  response organisation(s).  Mechanisms for regional  cooperation in incident  response have been  established.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  20  D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  Some understanding of  what comprises CI assets is  acknowledged, but no  formal categorisation of  assets has been produced.  A list of general CI assets has  been created.  A detailed audit of CI assets  as it relates to  cybersecurity is performed  on a regular basis.  CI asset audit lists are  disseminated to relevant  stakeholders.  CI risks and assets have  been prioritised according  to vulnerability and impact,  which guides strategic  investment.  Vulnerability/asset  management processes are  in place so that incremental  security improvements can  be made.  Priority listing of CI assets is  regularly re-appraised to  capture changes in the  threat environment.  Organisation  There is little or no  interaction between  government ministries and  owners of CI assets. No  mechanism for collaboration  exists.  There is informal and ad-hoc  threat and vulnerability  disclosure among CI owners  as well as between CI and  the government, but the  scope of reporting  requirements has not been  specified.  A mechanism is established  for regular vulnerability  disclosure with defined  scope for reporting  incidents (either  mandatory or voluntary)  between CI asset owners  and the government.  Formal internal and  external CI communication  strategies have been  defined and are consistent  across sectors, with clear  points of contact.  Strategic engagement  between government and  CI is agreed and promoted.  There is a clear  understanding of which  threats to CI are managed  centrally, and which are  managed locally.  A public awareness  campaign to facilitate the CI  communication strategy is  established with a point of  contact for this information.  Cybersecurity requirements  and vulnerabilities in CI  supply chains are clearly  identified, mapped and  managed.  Owners of critical  infrastructure and assets  are able to rapidly respond  to the changing threat  landscape.  Trust has been established  between the government  and CIs with respect to  cybersecurity and exchange  of threat information, which  is fed into the strategic  decision-making process.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  21  Risk Management and  Response  Risk management skills and  understanding may be  incorporated into business  practices, but cybersecurity,  if recognised, is subsumed  into IT and data protection  risk and is not recognised as  a priority.  Response planning and  threat awareness may have  been broadly discussed, but  no formal plan exists.  Physical and virtual access  control is implemented.  CI has basic capacity to  detect, identify, respond to  and recover from cyber  threats, but such capabilities  are uncoordinated and vary  in quality.  Protection of CI assets  includes basic level  cybersecurity awareness and  data security policies, but no  protection processes have  been agreed.  Best practices in security  measures, guidelines, and  standards for CI  cybersecurity have been  established and adopted.  Cybersecurity risk  management processes  have been established,  supported by adequate  technical security solutions,  communication links, and  harm mitigation measures.  CI risk management  procedures are used to  create a national response  plan including the  participation of all vital  entities.  Cybersecurity is firmly  embedded into general risk  management practice.  Assessment of the breadth  and severity of harm  incurred by CI assets is  regularly conducted and  response planning is  tailored to that assessment  to ensure business  continuity.  Resources are allocated in  proportion to the assessed  impact of an incident to  ensure rapid and effective  incident response.  Insider threat detection is  accounted for.  Audit practices to assess  network and system  dependencies and  vulnerabilities (i.e.  unmitigated dependencies)  are implemented on a  regular basis and inform  continuous reassessment of  CI risk portfolio,  technologies, policies and  processes.  The impact of cybersecurity  risk on the business  operations of CI, including  direct and opportunity  costs, impact on revenue,  and hindrance to  innovation, are understood  and incorporated into  future planning and  executive decision making.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  22  D 1.4: Crisis Management  Categories Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Crisis Management  It is understood that general  crisis management is  necessary for national  security, but cybersecurity is  not yet considered as a  component.  Crisis management exercise  design and planning  authority may have been  allocated in principle (either  directly or via consultants),  but cybersecurity crisis  management planning has  not been thoroughly  outlined.  A preliminary cybersecurity  needs assessment of  measures and techniques  that require testing has  been undertaken, but no  exercise has been  conducted at this point.  An exercise planning  authority has been  designated, and has  outlined the steps to be  taken in order to conduct  the cybersecurity exercise.  Key stakeholders and other  subject matter experts, such  as think tanks, academics,  civil leaders and consultants  are included in the planning  process.  Exercise monitors, if  designated, are internal and  may lack training.  A cybersecurity exercise,  with limited size and  geographic scope has been  conducted involving all  relevant stakeholders in all  sectors.  Appropriate resources have  been allocated to the  exercises.  Planning process includes  the engagement of  participants, an outline of  their role in the exercise,  and the articulation of  benefits and incentives for  participation.  Trained internal or external  monitors facilitate the  exercise.  The exercise is evaluated  and commentary is provided  by participants and  stakeholders.  A realistic high-level  scenario informs a plan to  test information flows,  decision-making and  resource investment at the  national level.  Trust is developed well in  advance via the recruitment  and pre-exercise briefing  process and through  guaranteed confidentiality  control.  Specific, Measurable,  Attainable, Relevant, and  Time-Bound (SMART)  objectives and performance  key indicators (PKI) inform  decisions in crisis  management, and  evaluation results inform  future investment in  national cybersecurity  capacity.  Findings are evaluated  against international crisis  management good practice.  Tailored, sector-specific  reports are prepared for  each stakeholder, while  ensuring sensitive  information is secured.  The exercise involves  neutral peer stakeholders to  observe, and, where  appropriate, contribute, and  addresses international  challenges to produce  scalable results for  international policy- and  decision-making.  An evaluation of the crisis  management exercise is  provided for the  international community, so  that lessons learnt can  contribute toward a global  understanding of crisis  management.  Crisis management is  embedded in risk analysis,  review and management.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  23  D 1.5: Cyber Defence  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Strategy  National security policy and  Defence strategy may be  published and may contain a  cybersecurity component.  Specific threats to national  security in cyberspace have  been identified, such as  external threat actors (both  state and non-state), insider  threats, supply chain  vulnerabilities, and threats  to military operational  capacity, but a coherent  strategy does not yet exist.  National cyber Defence  policy or strategy exists and  outlines the country’s  position in its response to  different types and levels of  cyber-attacks (for example,  cyber-enabled conflict  producing a kinetic effect  and offensive cyber-attacks  aimed to disrupt  infrastructure).  Resources dedicated toward  Cyber Defence are allocated  based on national strategic  objectives.  The evolving threat  landscape in cybersecurity is  captured through repeated  review in order to ensure  that cyber Defence ways  and means continue to meet  national security objectives.  The policy or strategy drives  the international discussion  on rules of engagement in  cyberspace.  Rules of engagement are  clearly defined and the  military doctrine that  applies to cyberspace is fully  developed and takes note of  significant shifts in the  cybersecurity environment.  Organisation  Informal management of  cyber Defence may be  distributed among the  armed forces and/or  government organisations,  with occasional reference to  signals intelligence.  Cyber operations units are  incorporated into the  different branches of the  armed forces, but no central  command and control  structure exists.  There is a defined  organisation within the  Defence apparatus  responsible for conflict using  cyber means.  Highly specialised expertise  with advanced capabilities  and full situational  awareness are integrated  into the national defence  posture.  The Defence apparatus  contributes to the debate in  developing a common  international understanding  of the point at which a  cyber-attack might trigger a  cross-domain response.  Coordination  No, or limited, capacity for  coordinated cyber Defence  exists between domestic  stakeholders (e.g. law  enforcement, public, and  enterprise, private) or  interstate stakeholders (e.g.  allied or neutral states).  Cyber Defence capability  requirements are agreed  between the public and  private sector in order to  minimise the threat to  national and international  security.  The entity in charge of cyber  Defence coordinates  integration regarding cyber  events between  government, military and  critical infrastructure and  identifies clear roles and  responsibilities.  Defence organisations and  critical infrastructure  providers have established a  mechanism to report threat  intelligence.  Analytical capacity exists to  support the coordination of  resource allocation for  national cyber Defence;  possibly including a cyber- defence research centre.  The understanding of  strengths and weaknesses  within the coordination  mechanism then feeds into  the re-evaluation of the  national security posture of  the nation.  The country is leading the  international debate on  cyber Defence and  systematically shares  intelligence with allies.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  24  D 1.6: Communications Redundancy  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Communications  Redundancy  Digital redundancy  measures may be  considered, but not in a  systematic, comprehensive  fashion.  Current emergency  response assets may have  been identified, but lack any  level of integration.  Stakeholders convene to  identify gaps and overlaps in  emergency response asset  communications and  authority links.  Emergency response assets,  priorities and standard  operating procedures are  mapped and identified in  the event of a  communications disruption  along any node in the  emergency response  network.  Emergency response assets  are hardwired into a  national emergency  communication network.  Communication is  distributed across  emergency response  functions, geographic areas  of responsibility, public and  private responders, and  command authorities.  Appropriate resources are  allocated to hardware  integration, technology  stress testing, personnel  training and crisis  simulations drills.  Outreach and education of  redundant communications  protocols is undertaken for  key stakeholders and is  tailored to their unique roles  and responsibilities.  Emergency response assets  practice interoperability and  function effectively under  compromised  communications scenarios.  The results of these  scenarios then inform  strategic investment in  future emergency response  assets.  Stakeholders contribute to  international efforts on  redundancy communication  planning.  Optimised efficiency is in  place to mediate extended  outages of systems.  National-level assets can act  to assist neighbours in the  event of an international- level crisis or incident.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  25  Dimension 2: Cyber Culture and Society  This dimension reviews important elements of a responsible cybersecurity culture such as the  understanding of cyber-related risks in society, the level of trust in Internet services, e-government and  e-commerce services, and users’ understanding of personal information protection online. Moreover,  this factor explores the existence of reporting mechanisms functioning as channels for users to report  cybercrime. In addition, this factor reviews the role of media and social media in shaping cybersecurity  values, attitudes and behaviour.  D 2.1: Cybersecurity Mind-set  This factor evaluates the degree to which cybersecurity is prioritised and embedded in the values,  attitudes, and practices of government, the private sector, and users across society-at-large. A  cybersecurity mind-set consists of values, attitudes and practices, including habits, of individual users,  experts, and other actors in the cybersecurity ecosystem that increase the resilience of users to threats  to their security online.   Government: This aspect examines whether all agencies across all levels of government have  embedded a proactive cybersecurity mind-set.   Private sector: This aspect examines whether all agencies have embedded a proactive  cybersecurity mind-set across business and industry.   Users: This aspect examines whether a cybersecurity mind-set is adopted throughout society.  D 2.2: Trust and Confidence on the Internet  This factor reviews the level of user’s trust and confidence in the use of online services, in general, and  e-government and e-commerce services, in particular.   User Trust and Confidence on the Internet: This aspect examines whether users trust in online  services, and whether there is a coordinated programme by operators of Internet  infrastructure to promote trust.   User Trust in E-government Services: This aspect examines whether there are government e-  services offered, if trust exists in the secure provision of such services, and if efforts are in  place to promote such trust in the application of security measures.   User Trust in E-commerce Services: This aspect examines whether e-commerce services are  offered and established in a secure environment, trusted by users.  D 2.3: User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online  This aspect looks at whether Internet users and stakeholders within the public and private sectors  recognise and understand the importance of protection of personal information online, and whether  they are sensitised to their privacy rights.   User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online: (as above)  D 2.4: Reporting Mechanisms  This aspect explores the existence of reporting mechanisms functioning as channels for users to report  internet related crime such as online fraud, cyber-bullying, child abuse online, identity theft, privacy  and security breaches, and other incidents.   Reporting Mechanisms: (as above)  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  26  D 2.5: Media and Social Media  This aspect explores whether cybersecurity is a common subject across mainstream media, and an  issue for broad discussion on social media. Moreover, this aspects speaks about the role of media in  conveying information about cybersecurity to the public, thus shaping their cybersecurity values,  attitudes and online behaviour.   Media and Social Media: (as above)  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  27  D 2.1: Cybersecurity Mind-set  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Government  Government has no or  minimal recognition of the  need to prioritise a  cybersecurity mind-set.  Leading agencies within  government may have  begun to consider  cybersecurity.  Leading agencies have  begun to place priority on  cybersecurity, by identifying  risks and threats.  Most government officials at  all levels are aware of  cybersecurity good  practices.  Agencies across all levels of  government have routinized  a cybersecurity mind-set,  employing good (proactive)  practices as a matter of  habit.  Cybersecurity mind-set  informs strategic planning.  The cybersecurity mind-set  serves as a foundation for  government official’s  operational practices and is  evidenced as global good  practice.  Cybersecurity mind-set of  government officials is  related to a reduction of the  overall threat landscape of  the government.  Private Sector  The private sector has no or  minimal recognition of the  need to prioritise a  cybersecurity mind-set.  Leading firms have begun to  place priority on a  cybersecurity mind-set by  identifying high-risk  practices.  Programmes and materials  have been made available to  train and improve  cybersecurity practices.  Most private sector actors  at all levels are aware of  cybersecurity good  practices.  Most private sector actors,  including SMEs, have  routinized a cybersecurity  mind-set, employing good  (proactive) practices as a  matter of habit.  Cybersecurity mind-set,  informs strategic planning.  The cybersecurity mind-set  serves as a foundation for  private sector operational  practices, informs all IT  related initiatives and is  evidenced as global good  practice.  Cybersecurity mind-set of  the private sector is related  to a reduction of the overall  threat landscape of the  sector.  Users  Users have no or minimal  recognition of the need to  prioritise a cybersecurity  mind-set and take no  proactive steps to improve  their cybersecurity.  A limited proportion of  Internet users have begun  to place priority on  cybersecurity, by identifying  risks and threats.  A growing number of users  feel it is a priority for them  to employ good  cybersecurity practices and  make conscious efforts to  securely use online systems.  Most users have routinized  a cybersecurity mind-set,  employing secure practices  as a matter of habit.  Cybersecurity mind-set of  users is related to a  reduction of the overall  threat landscape of the  country.

Operators of Internet  infrastructure may consider  measures promoting trust in  online services.  A very limited proportion of  Internet users critically  assess what they see or  receive online and believe  that they have the ability to  use the Internet and protect  themselves online.  A limited proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of the Internet based on  indicators of website  legitimacy.  Operators of Internet  infrastructure develop  measures to promote trust  in online services but have  not established them.  A growing proportion of  Internet users critically  assess what they see or  receive online, based on  identifying possible risks.  A growing proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of the Internet based on  indicators of website  legitimacy.  Internet infrastructure  operators have established  programmes to promote  trust in online services.  User-consent policies are in  place designed to notify  practices on the collection,  use or disclosure of sensitive  personal information.  Most Internet users critically  assess what they see or  receive online, based on  identifying possible risks.  Most Internet users feel  confident while using the  Internet, have the ability to  recognise non-legitimate  websites (including mimicry  attempts), and have a sense  of control over providing  personal data online.  Programmes to promote  trust in the use of online  services are assessed based  on measures of  effectiveness which informs  resource allocation.  Individuals assess the risk in  using online services,  including changes in the  technical and cybersecurity  environment and  continuously adjust their  behaviour based on this  assessment.  Internet infrastructure  operators assess trust  promotion services and  integrate findings into  programme and policy  revision.  User Trust in E- government Services  Government offers no or  limited e-services, but has  not publicly promoted the  necessary secure  environment.  If e-government services are  provided, users are  unfamiliar with or lack trust  in them.  Government continues to  increase e-service provision,  but also recognises the need  for the application of  security measures to  establish trust in these  services.  The need for security in e- government services is  recognised by stakeholders  and users.  A limited proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of e-government services.  E-government services have  been fully developed.  High-level risks affecting e- government services are  prioritised in order to  reduce occurrences.  The public sector promotes  use of e-government  services and trust in these  services through a  coordinated programme,  including the compliance to  web standards that protect  the anonymity of users.  Public authorities are  routinely publishing certain  information about their  activities.  Privacy-by-default is  promoted as a tool for  transparency in e- government services.  The majority of users trust  in the secure use of e- government services and  make use of them.  E-government services and  promotion thereof are  continuously improved and  expanded to enhance  transparent/open and  secure systems and user  trust.  Impact assessments on data  protection in e-government  services are consistently  taking place and feed back  into strategic planning.

A growing proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of e-government services.  Possible breaches in e-  government services are  being identified,  acknowledged, and  disclosed in an ad-hoc  manner.  Processes are employed for  gathering user feedback in  order to ensure efficient  management of online  content.  User Trust in E- commerce Services  E-commerce services are  not offered or are offered in  an unsecure environment.  If e-commerce services are  provided, users are  unfamiliar with or lack trust  in them.  E-commerce services are  being provided to a limited  extent.  The private sector  recognises the need for the  application of security  measures to establish trust  in e-commerce services.  A limited proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of e-commerce services.  Some e-commerce services  are informing users of the  utility of deployed security  solutions.  E-commerce services are  fully established by multiple  stakeholders in a secure  environment.  Security solutions are  updated and reliable  payment systems have been  made available.  A growing proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of e-commerce services.  The private sector promotes  use of e-commerce services  and trust in these services.  Terms and conditions of use  of e-commerce services are  easily accessible.  E-commerce service  providers recognise the  need for building trust in  order to ensure business  continuity, and resources  are allocated accordingly.  The majority of users trust  in the secure use of e- commerce services and  make use of them.  Stakeholders invest in  establishing enhanced  service functionality of e- commerce services,  protection of personal  information and the  provision of feedback  mechanisms for users.  E-commerce services are  continuously improved in  order to promote  transparent, trustworthy  and secure systems.  Terms and conditions  provided by e-commerce  services are clear and easily  comprehensible to all users.  User feedback mechanisms  are integrated into e- commerce services in order  to enhance trust between  users and providers.

There is no or limited  discussion regarding the  protection of personal  information online.  Discussions may have begun  and involve multiple  stakeholders, but no privacy  standards are in place.  Users and stakeholders  within the public and private  sectors may have general  knowledge about how  personal information is  handled online; and may  employ good (proactive)  cybersecurity practices to  protect their personal  information online.  Discussions have begun  regarding the protection of  personal information and  about the balance between  security and privacy, but this  has not resulted in concrete  actions or policies.  A growing proportion of  users have the skills to  manage their privacy online,  and protect themselves  from intrusion, interference,  or unwanted access of  information by others.  There is constant public  debate regarding the  protection of personal  information and about the  balance between security  and privacy, which informs  privacy policies within public  and private sectors.  All stakeholders have the  information, confidence and  the ability to take measures  to protect their personal  information online and to  maintain control of the  distribution of this  information.  Users and stakeholders  within the public and private  sectors widely recognise the  importance of protection of  personal information online,  and are sensitised to their  privacy rights.  Mechanisms are in place in  private and public sectors to  ensure that privacy and  security are not competing.  Privacy by default as a tool  for transparency is  promoted.  Users have the knowledge  and skills necessary to  protect their personal  information online, adapting  their abilities to the  changing risk environment.  There is a wide recognition  of the need to ensure  security and protection of  personal information.  Policies are in place in  private and public sectors to  ensure that privacy and  security are not competing  in a changing environment  and are informed by user  feedback and public debate.  Assessments of personal  information protection in e- services are regularly  conducted and feed back  into policy revision.

The public and/or private  sectors are providing some  channels for reporting  online fraud, cyber-bullying,  child abuse online, identity  theft, privacy and security  breaches, and other  incidents, but these  channels are not  coordinated and are used in  an ad-hoc manner.  Promotion of the existing  reporting channels has not  yet begun or is ad-hoc.  Reporting mechanisms have  been established and are  regularly used.  Programmes to promote the  use of these mechanisms  have been established by  public and private sectors.  Coordinated reporting  mechanisms are widely  used.  Programmes to promote the  use of these mechanisms  are prioritised by public and  private sectors and are  considered as an investment  in loss prevention and risk  control.  Effectiveness metrics of  reporting mechanisms are  applied and findings inform  the revision and promotion  of the mechanisms.  All relevant stakeholders  actively collaborate and  share good practice to  enhance existing reporting  mechanisms and there is a  clear distribution of roles  and responsibilities,  including regarding the  response to reported  incidents.  Mechanisms have been  developed to coordinate  response to reported  incidents between law  enforcement and the  national incident response  capability.  D 2.5: Media and Social Media  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Media and Social  Media  Media and social media  rarely, if ever, cover  information about  cybersecurity or report on  issues such as security  breaches or cybercrime.  There is ad-hoc media  coverage of cybersecurity,  with limited information  provided and reporting on  specific issues that  individuals face online, such  as online child protection or  cyber-bullying.  There is limited discussion  on social media about  cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity is a common  subject across mainstream  media, and information and  reports on a wide range of  issues, including security  breaches and cybercrime  are widely disseminated.  There is broad discussion on  social media about  cybersecurity.  Media coverage extends  beyond threat reporting and  can inform the public of  proactive and actionable  cybersecurity measures, as  well economic and social  impacts.  There is frequent discussion  on social media about  cybersecurity and  individuals regularly  exchange experiences online  using social media.  The broad discussion of  personal experiences and  personal attitudes of  individuals across  mainstream and social  media inform policy making  and facilitate societal  change.

Moreover, it evaluates the availability, quality, and uptake of educational and  training offerings for various groups of government stakeholders, private sector, and the population  as a whole.  D 3.1: Awareness Raising  This factor focuses on the prevalence and design of programmes to raise awareness of cybersecurity  risks and threats as well as how to address them.   Awareness Raising Programmes: This aspect examines the existence of a national  coordinated programme for cybersecurity awareness raising, covering a wide range of  demographics and issues, developed based on consultations with stakeholders from various  sectors.   Executive Awareness Raising: This aspect examines efforts raising executives’ awareness of  cybersecurity issues in the public, private, academic and civil society sectors, as well as how  cybersecurity risks might be addressed.  D 3.2: Framework for Education  This factor addresses the importance of high quality cybersecurity education offerings and the  existence of qualified educators. Moreover, this factor examines the need for enhancing cybersecurity  education at the national and institutional level and the collaboration between government, and  industry to ensure that the educational investments meet the needs of the cybersecurity environment  across all sectors.   Provision: This aspect explores whether there are cybersecurity educational offerings and  educator qualification programmes available based on an understanding of current risks and  skills requirements.   Administration: This aspect explores the coordination and resources for developing and  enhancing cybersecurity education frameworks, with allocated budget and spending based on  the national demand.  D 3.3: Framework for Professional Training  This factor addresses the availability and provision of cybersecurity training programmes building a  cadre of cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, this factor reviews the uptake of cybersecurity training  and horizontal and vertical cybersecurity knowledge transfer within organisations and how it  translates into continuous skills development.   Provision: This aspects examines the development, availability and provision of cybersecurity  training programmes for enhancing skills and capabilities.   Uptake: This aspect examines the existence of certified employees trained in cybersecurity  issues, processes, planning and analytics through the uptake of cybersecurity training  programmes and knowledge transfer within organisations.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  33  D 3.1: Awareness Raising  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Awareness Raising  Programmes  The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities across all  sectors is not recognised, or  is only at initial stages of  discussion.  Awareness raising  programmes, courses,  seminars and online  resources are available for  target demographics from  public, private, academic,  and/or civil society sources,  but no coordination or  scaling efforts have been  conducted.  Awareness raising  programmes may be  informed by international  initiatives but are not linked  to national strategy.  A national programme for  cybersecurity awareness  raising, led by a designated  organisation (from any  sector) is established, which  addresses a wide range of  demographics and issues,  but no metrics for  effectiveness have been  applied.  Consultation with  stakeholders from various  sectors informs the creation  and utilisation of  programmes and materials.  A single online portal linking  to appropriate cybersecurity  information exists and is  disseminated via that  programme.  The national awareness  raising programme is  coordinated and integrated  with sector-specific, tailored  awareness raising  programmes, such as those  focusing on government,  industry, academia, civil  society, and/or children.  Metrics for effectiveness are  established and evidence of  application and lessons  learnt are fed into future  programmes.  The evolution of the  programme is supported by  the adaptation of existing  materials and resources,  involving clear methods for  obtaining a measure of  suitability and quality.  Programmes contribute  toward expanding and  enhancing international  awareness raising good  practice and capacity- building efforts.  Awareness raising  programmes are adapted in  response to performance  evidenced by monitoring  which results in the  redistribution of resources  and future investments.  Metrics contribute toward  national cybersecurity  strategy revision processes.  Awareness programme  planning gives explicit  consideration to national  demand from the  stakeholder communication  (in the widest sense), so that  campaigns continue to  impact the entire society.  The national awareness  raising programme has a  measurable impact on  reduction of the overall  threat landscape.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  34  D 3.1: Awareness Raising  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Executive Awareness  Raising  Awareness raising on  cybersecurity issues for  executives is limited or non- existent.  Executives are not yet aware  of their responsibilities to  shareholders, clients,  customers, and employees  in relation to cybersecurity.  Executives are made aware  of general cybersecurity  issues, but not how these  issues and threats might  affect their organisation.  Executives of particular  sectors, such as finance and  telecommunications, have  been made aware of  cybersecurity risk in general  and how the organisation  deals with cybersecurity  issues, but not of strategic  implications.  Awareness raising of  executives in the public,  private, academic and civil  society sectors address  cybersecurity risks in  general, some of the  primary methods of attack,  and how the organisation  deals with cyber issues  (usually abdicated to the  CIO).  Select executive members  are made aware of how  cybersecurity risks affect the  strategic decision making of  the organisation,  particularly those in the  financial and  telecommunications sectors.  Awareness raising efforts of  cybersecurity crisis  management at the  executive level is still  reactive in focus.  Executive awareness raising  efforts in nearly all sectors  include the identification of  strategic assets, specific  measures in place to protect  them, and the mechanism  by which they are protected.  Executives are able to alter  strategic decision making,  and allocate specific funding  and people to the various  elements of cyber risk,  contingent on their  company’s prevailing  situation.  Executives are made aware  of what contingency plans  are in place to address  various cyber-based attacks  and their aftermath.  Executive awareness  courses in cybersecurity are  mandatory for nearly all  sectors.  Cybersecurity risks are  considered as an agenda  item at every executive  meeting, and funding and  attention is reallocated to  address those risks.  Executives are regarded  regionally and  internationally as a source  of good practice in  responsible and accountable  corporate cybersecurity  governance.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  35  D 3.2: Framework for Education  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no cybersecurity  educators are available, and  there are no qualification  programmes for educators.  Computer science courses  are offered that may have a  security component, but no  cybersecurity-related  courses are offered.  No accreditation in  cybersecurity education  exists.  Qualification programmes  for cybersecurity educators  are being explored, with a  small cadre of existing  professional educators.  Some educational courses  exist in cybersecurity-  related fields, such as  information security,  network security and  cryptography, but  cybersecurity-specific  courses are not yet offered.  A demand for cybersecurity  education is evidenced  through course enrolment  and feedback.  Qualifications for and supply  of educators are readily  available in cybersecurity.  Specialised courses in  cybersecurity are offered  and accredited at the  university level.  Degrees in cybersecurity-  related fields are offered by  universities.  Universities and other  bodies hold  seminars/lectures on  cybersecurity issues aimed  at non-specialists.  Research and development  is a leading consideration in  cybersecurity education.  Cybersecurity educators are  not only drawn from the  academic environment, but  incentives are in place so  that industry and/or  government experts take  these positions as well.  Accredited cybersecurity  courses are embedded in all  computer science degrees.  Degrees are offered in  cybersecurity specifically,  which encompasses courses  and models in various other  cybersecurity-related fields,  including technical and non-  technical elements such as  policy implications, and  multi-disciplinary education.  Cybersecurity educational  offerings are weighted and  focused based on an  understanding of current  risks and skills requirements.  Cybersecurity education is  not limited to universities,  but ranges from primary to  post-graduate levels,  including vocational  education.  National courses, degrees,  and research are at the  forefront of cybersecurity  education internationally.  Cybersecurity education  programmes maintain a  balance between preserving  core components of the  curriculum and promoting  adaptive processes that  respond to rapid changes in  the cybersecurity  environment.  Prevailing cybersecurity  requirements are  considered in the re-  development of all general  curricula.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  36  D 3.2: Framework for Education  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Administration  The need for enhancing  national cybersecurity  education is not yet  considered.  A network of national  contact points for  governmental, regulatory  bodies, critical industries  and education institutions is  not yet established.  Discussion of how  coordinated management of  cybersecurity education and  research enhances national  knowledge development has  not, or only just begun.  The need for enhancing  cybersecurity education in  schools and universities has  been identified by leading  government, industry, and  academic stakeholders.  Schools, government, and  industry collaborate in an  ad-hoc manner to supply  the resources necessary for  providing cybersecurity  education.  A national budget focused  on cybersecurity education  is not yet established.  Broad consultation across  government, private sector,  academia and civil society  stakeholders informs  cybersecurity education  priorities and is reflected in  national cybersecurity  strategy.  National budget is dedicated  to national cybersecurity  research and laboratories at  universities.  Competitions and initiatives  for students are promoted  by government and/or  industry in order to increase  the attractiveness of  cybersecurity careers.  Metrics are developed to  ensure that educational  investments meet the needs  of the cybersecurity  environment across all  sectors.  Government budget and  spending on cybersecurity  education is managed based  on the national demand.  Leading national  cybersecurity academic  institutions share their  lessons learnt with other  national and international  counterparts.  Government has established  academic centres of  excellence in cybersecurity.  International cybersecurity  centres of excellence are  established through  twinning programmes led by  world class institutions.  Routinized cooperation  between all stakeholders in  cybersecurity education can  be evidenced.  Content in cybersecurity  education programmes is  aligned with practical  cybersecurity problems and  business challenges, and  provides a mechanism for  enhancing curriculum based  on the evolving landscape.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  37  D 3.3: Framework for Professional Training  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no training  programmes in  cybersecurity exist.  The need for training  professionals in  cybersecurity has been  documented at the national  level.  Training for general IT staff  is provided on cybersecurity  issues so that they can react  to incidents as they occur,  but no training for dedicated  security professionals exists.  ICT professional certification  is offered, with some  security modules or  components.  Ad-hoc training courses,  seminars and online  resources are available for  cybersecurity professionals  through public or private  sources, with limited  evidence of take-up.  Structured cybersecurity  training programmes exist  to develop skills towards  building a cadre of  cybersecurity-specific  professionals.  Security professional  certification is offered  across sectors within the  country.  The needs of society are  well understood and a list of  training requirements is  documented.  Training programmes for  non-cybersecurity  professionals are recognised  and initially offered.  A range of cybersecurity  training courses is tailored  toward meeting national  strategic demand and aligns  with international good  practice.  The training programme  outlines the priorities in the  national cybersecurity  strategy.  Training programmes are  offered to cybersecurity  professionals that focus on  the skills necessary to  communicate technically  complex challenges to non- technical audiences, such as  management and general  employees.  Metrics of effectiveness  assess the modes and  procedures of training.  The public and private  sector collaborate to offer  training, constantly adapting  and seeking to build skillsets  drawn from both sectors.  Training offerings  coordinate with education  programmes so that the  foundation established in  schools can enable training  programmes to build a  highly skilled workforce.  Programmes and incentive  structures are in place to  ensure the retention of  trained workforce within the  country.  Uptake  Training uptake by IT  personnel designated to  respond to cybersecurity  incidents is limited or non-  existent.  Metrics evaluating take-up  of ad-hoc training courses,  seminars, online resources,  and certification offerings  exist, but are limited in  scope.  There is no knowledge  transfer from employees  trained in cybersecurity to  untrained employees.  There is an established  cadre of certified employees  trained in cybersecurity  issues, processes, planning  and analytics.  Knowledge transfer from  employees trained in  cybersecurity to untrained  employees is ad hoc.  The uptake of cybersecurity  training is used to inform  future training programmes.  Coordination of training  across all sectors ensures  the national demand for  professionals is met.  Cybersecurity professionals  not only fulfil national  requirements, but domestic  professionals are consulted  internationally to share  lessons learnt and good  practice.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  38  D 3.3: Framework for Professional Training  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Job creation initiatives for  cybersecurity within  organisations are  established and encourage  employers to train staff to  become cybersecurity  professionals.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  39  Dimension 4: Legal and Regulatory Frameworks  This dimension examines the government’s capacity to design and enact national legislation directly  and indirectly relating to cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis placed on the topics of ICT security,  privacy and data protection issues, and other cybercrime-related issues. The capacity to enforce such  laws is examined through law enforcement, prosecution, and court capacities. Moreover, this  dimension observes issues such as formal and informal cooperation frameworks to combat cybercrime.  D 4.1: Legal Frameworks  This factor addresses various legislation and regulation frameworks related to cybersecurity, including:  ICT security legislative frameworks, privacy, freedom of speech, and other human rights online, data  protection, child protection, consumer protection, intellectually property, substantive and procedural  cybercrime legislation.   Legislative Frameworks for ICT Security: This aspect addresses the existence and  implementation of comprehensive ICT security legislative and regulatory frameworks.   Privacy, Freedom of Speech & Other Human Rights Online: This aspect examines to what  extent domestic legislation ensures that human rights are protected online, including privacy,  freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly and association.   Data Protection Legislation: This aspect examines the existence and implementation of  comprehensive data protection legislation.   Child Protection Online: This aspect focuses on the legislative protection of children online,  including the protection of their rights online and the criminalisation of child abuse online.   Consumer Protection Legislation: This aspect addresses the existence and implementation of  legislation protecting consumers online from fraud and other forms of business malpractice.   Intellectual Property Legislation: This aspect is concerned with the existence and  implementation of online intellectual property legislation.   Substantive Cybercrime Legislation: This aspect explores if existing legislation criminalises a  variety of cybercrimes in specific legislation or general criminal law.   Procedural Cybercrime Legislation: This aspect examines whether comprehensive criminal  procedural law with procedural powers for the investigation of cybercrime and evidentiary  requirements to deter, respond to and prosecute cybercrime and crimes involving electronic  evidence is implemented.  D 4.2: Criminal Justice System  This factor studies the capacity of law enforcement to investigate cybercrime, and the prosecution’s  capacity to present cybercrime and electronic evidence cases. Finally, this factor addresses the court  capacity to preside over cybercrime cases and those involving electronic evidence.   Law Enforcement: This aspect examines whether law enforcement have received training on  investigating and managing cybercrime cases and cases involving electronic evidence, and  have sufficient human, procedural and technological resources.   Prosecution: This aspect examines whether prosecutors have received training on handling  cybercrime cases and cases involving electronic evidence, and whether there are sufficient  human, procedural and technological resources.   Courts: This aspect examines whether courts have sufficient resources and training to ensure  effective and efficient prosecution of cybercrime cases and cases involving electronic evidence.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  40  D 4.3: Formal and Informal Cooperation Frameworks to Combat Cybercrime  This factor addresses the existence and functioning of formal and informal mechanisms that enable  cooperation between domestic actors and across borders to deter and combat cybercrime.   Formal Cooperation: This aspect examines the existence and effectivity of formal cooperation  mechanisms to combat cybercrime, both between state actors and across borders, including  mutual legal assistance and extradition procedures.   Informal Cooperation: This aspect examines the existence and effectivity of informal  cooperation mechanisms to combat cybercrime, both domestically and across borders, as well  as within the public sector and between public and private sectors.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  41  D 4.1: Legal Frameworks  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Legislative Framework  for ICT Security  Legislation relating to ICT  security does not yet exist.  Efforts to draw attention to  the need to create a legal  framework on cybersecurity  have been made and may  have resulted in a gap  analysis.  Experienced stakeholders  from all sectors may have  been consulted to support  the establishment of a legal  and regulatory framework.  Key priorities for creating  cybersecurity legal  frameworks have been  identified through multi- stakeholder consultation,  potentially resulting in draft  legislation, but legislation  has not yet been adopted.  Comprehensive ICT  legislative and regulatory  frameworks addressing  cybersecurity have been  adopted.  Laws address the protection  of critical information  infrastructure, e- transactions, liability of  Internet Service Providers  and, potentially, cyber  incident reporting  obligations.  The country reviews existing  legal and regulatory  mechanisms for ICT security,  identifies where gaps and  overlaps exist, and amends  laws accordingly or enacts  new laws.  Monitoring of enforcement  of legislative frameworks  informs resource allocation  and legal reform.  Mechanisms are in place for  continuously harmonising  ICT legal frameworks with  national cybersecurity- related ICT policies,  international law, standards  and good practices.  Participation in the  development of regional or  international cybersecurity  cooperation agreements  and treaties is a priority.  Efforts are in place to  exceed minimal baselines  specified in these treaties  where appropriate.  Privacy, Freedom of  Speech & Other  Human Rights Online  Domestic law does not  recognise fundamental  human rights in relation to  cybercrime.  Discussions of privacy issues  online may have begun and  include multiple  stakeholders, but no privacy  legislation or standards are  in place.  Domestic legislation  partially recognises privacy,  freedom of information,  freedom of assembly and  association, and freedom of  expression online.  Stakeholders from all key  sectors have been consulted  for the development of  legislation addressing  human rights online.  Domestic law recognises  fundamental human rights  on the Internet, including  privacy online, freedom of  speech, freedom of  information, and freedom of  assembly and association.  Domestic law specifies  safeguards to protect the  individual’s right to privacy  during the collection, use  and disclosure of personal  information in investigations  involving electronic  evidence.

In order to meet dynamic  changes in the application of  technology to consumer  protection, procedures are  in place to amend and  update legal frameworks as  needed.  Intellectual Property  Legislation  Intellectual property of  online products and services  might be discussed among  multiple stakeholders, but  no specific legal provisions  are in place.  If general law on intellectual  property exists, it is not  applicable to online  products and services yet.  Legislation on intellectual  property online is under  development, through  consultation with key  stakeholders.  Comprehensive legislation  addressing intellectual  property of online products  and services has been  adopted and is enforced.  Legislation on intellectual  property online is regularly  reviewed and amended  accordingly to reflect  changes in national  priorities and the  international ICT landscape.  Legislative amendments are  informed by multi- stakeholder consultations  and public discourse.  Decisions to update  legislation are based on the  balance between  intellectual property and  open access policies,  through multi-stakeholder  discussion.  Substantive  Cybercrime Legislation  Specific substantive criminal  law on cybercrime does not  exist or general criminal law  exists, but its application to  cybercrime is unclear  Specific substantive criminal  provisions on cybercrime  might be discussed among  lawmakers, but the  development of the  provisions has not yet  commenced.  Partial legislation exists that  addresses some aspects of  cybercrime or cybercrime  legal provisions are under  development.  Substantive cybercrime legal  provisions are contained in  specific legislation or a  general criminal law.  The country has ratified  regional or international  instruments on cybercrime  and consistently seeks to  implement these measures  into domestic law.  Measures are in place to  exceed minimal baselines  specified in international  treaties where appropriate,  which includes procedures  to amend substantive legal  frameworks as needed.  The country is an active  contributor in the global  discourse on developing and  improving international  cybercrime treaties.

Traditional investigative  measures are applied to  cybercrime investigations,  with limited digital forensics  capacity.  If law enforcement officers  receive training on  cybercrime and digital  evidence, it is ad-hoc and  not specialised.  A comprehensive  institutional capacity with  sufficient human,  procedural and  technological resources to  investigate cybercrime cases  has been established.  Digital chain of custody and  evidence integrity is  established including formal  processes, roles and  responsibilities.  Standards for the training of  law enforcement officers on  cybercrime exist and are  implemented.  Resources dedicated to fully  operational cybercrime units  have been allocated based  on strategic decision  making.  Advanced investigative  capabilities allow the  investigation of complex  cybercrime cases, supported  by regular testing and  training of investigators.  Law enforcement agencies  have the resources to  maintain the integrity of  data to meet international  evidential standards in  cross-border investigation.  Statistics and trends on  cybercrime investigations  are collected and analysed.  All law enforcement officers  receive specialised and  continuous training based  on relative responsibilities  and new, evolving threat  landscapes.  Law enforcement can utilise  sophisticated digital forensic  tools, and these  technologies are  consistently updated.  The institutional capacity of  law enforcement is  frequently reviewed and  revised based on an  assessment of effectiveness.  Prosecution  Prosecutors do not receive  adequate training and  resources to review  electronic evidence or  prosecute cybercrime.  There are no specialised  cybercrime prosecutors, but  consultation may have  begun to consider this  capacity within the criminal  justice community.  A limited number of  specialised cybercrime  prosecutors have the  capacity to build a case  based on electronic  evidence, but this capacity is  largely ad-hoc and un- institutionalised.

There is no formal  mechanism that promotes  the exchange of information  between domestic public  and private sectors on  cybercrime and cooperation  is limited.  Formal mechanisms of  international cooperation  have been established, but  the application to  cybercrime is ad-hoc or only  possible in some cases.  Exchange of information on  cybercrime between  domestic public and private  sectors is ad-hoc and  unregulated.  Formal mechanisms of  international cooperation  have been established in  order to prevent and  combat cybercrime by  facilitating their detection,  investigation, and  prosecution.  Mutual legal assistance and  extradition agreements and  mechanisms have been  established and are applied  to cybercrime cases.  Legislative requirements for  the exchange of information  between domestic public  and private sectors have  been determined.  Formal international  cooperation mechanisms  are fully functional, with  established communication  channels.  Strategic decisions are made  to expand and enhance  formal cooperation  mechanisms on cybercrime  as needed.  Resources are allocated to  support the exchange of  information between public  and private sectors  domestically and enhance  legislative requirements and  communication  mechanisms.  Formal international  cooperation mechanisms  are regularly reviewed to  determine effectiveness,  and are revised accordingly  to reflect the changing  cybercrime landscape.  Formal and informal  international cooperation  mechanisms complement  each other and are  interoperable.  Formal mechanisms that  enable the exchange of  information between  domestic public and private  sectors are adapted in  accordance with identified  needs and changing threat  environment.  Informal Cooperation  There is minimal interaction  between government and  criminal justice actors.  Cooperation between  Internet Service Providers  and law enforcement has  not been established.

The dimension specifically examines the  implementation of cybersecurity standards and good practices, the deployment of processes and  controls, and the development of technologies and products in order to reduce cybersecurity risks.  D 5.1: Adherence to Standards  This factor reviews government’s capacity to design, adapt and implement cybersecurity standards  and good practice, especially those related to procurement procedures and software development.   ICT Security Standards: This aspect examines whether cybersecurity related standards and  good practices are being adhered to and adopted widely across the public sector and Critical  Infrastructure (CI) organisations.   Standards in Procurement: This aspect addresses the implementation of standards in  procurement practices.   Standards in Software Development: This aspect addresses the implementation of standards  in software development.  D 5.2: Internet Infrastructure Resilience  This factor addresses the existence of reliable Internet services and infrastructure in the country as well  as rigorous security processes across private and public sectors. Also, this aspect reviews the control  that the government might have on its Internet infrastructure and the extent to which networks and  systems are outsourced.   Internet Infrastructure Resilience: (as above)  D 5.3: Software Quality  This factor examines the quality of software deployment and the functional requirements in public and  private sectors. In addition, this factor reviews the existence and improvement of policies on and  processes for software updates and maintenance based on risk assessments and the criticality of  services.   Software Quality: (as above)  D 5.4: Technical Security Controls  This factor reviews evidence regarding the deployment of technical security controls by users, public  and private sectors and whether the technical cybersecurity control set is based on established  cybersecurity frameworks.   Technical Security Controls: (as above)  D 5.5: Cryptographic Controls  This factor reviews the deployment of cryptographic techniques in all sectors and users for protection  of data at rest or in transit, and the extent to which these cryptographic controls meet international  standards and guidelines and are kept up-to-date.   Cryptographic Controls: (as above)  D 5.6: Cybersecurity Marketplace  This factor addresses the availability and development of competitive cybersecurity technologies and  insurance products.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  50   Cybersecurity Technologies: This aspect examines whether a national market for  cybersecurity technologies is in place and supported, and informed by national need.   Cyber Insurance: This aspect explores the existence of a market for cyber insurance, its  coverage and products suitable for various organisations.  D 5.7: Responsible Disclosure  This factor explores the establishment of a responsible disclosure framework for the receipt and  dissemination of vulnerability information across sectors and if there is sufficient capacity to  continuously review and update this framework.   Responsible Disclosure: (as above)  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  51  D 5.1: Adherence to Standards  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  ICT Security Standards  No standards or good  practices have been  identified for use in securing  data, technology or  infrastructure, by the public  and private sectors.  Or, initial identification of  some appropriate standards  and good practices has been  made by the public and  private sectors, possibly  some ad hoc  implementation, but no  concerted endeavour to  implement or change  existing practice in a  measurable way.  Information risk  management standards  have been identified for use  and there have been some  initial signs of promotion  and take-up within public  and private sectors.  There is some evidence of  measurable implementation  and adoption of  international standards and  good practices.  Nationally agreed baseline  of cybersecurity related  standards and good  practices has been  identified, and adopted  widely across public and  private sectors.  Some body within  government exists to assess  level of adoption across  public and private sectors.  Government schemes exist  to promote continued  enhancements, and metrics  are being applied to monitor  compliance.  Consideration is being given  to how standards and good  practices can be used to  address risk within supply  chains within the CI, by both  government and CI.  Government and  organisations promote  adoption of standards and  good practises according to  assessment of national risks  and budgetary choices.  There is evidence of debate  between government and  other stakeholders as to  how national and  organisational resource  decisions should align and  drive standard adoption.  Evidence of contribution to  international standards’  bodies exists and  contributes to thought  leadership and sharing of  experience by organisations.  The choice of adopted  standards and good  practices and their  implementation is  continuously improved.  Adoption of standards and  non-compliance decisions  are made in response to  changing threat  environments and resource  drivers across sectors and CI  through collaborative risk  management.  Evidence exists of debate  within all sectors on  compliance to standards  and good practices, based  on continuous needs  assessments.  Standards in  Procurement  No standards or good  practices have been  identified for use in guiding  procurement processes by  the public and private  sector. If they are  recognised, implementation  is ad hoc and  uncoordinated.  Cybersecurity standards and  good practices guiding  procurement processes  have been identified for use.  Evidence of promotion and  adoption of cybersecurity  standards and good  practices in defining  procurement practices  exists within public sectors  and private sectors.  Procurement practices meet  international IT guidelines,  standards and good  practices.  Adoption and compliance of  standards in procurement  practices within the public  and private sectors, is  evidenced through  measurement and  assessments of process  effectiveness.  Cybersecurity standards and  good practices in guiding  procurement processes are  being adhered to widely  within public and private  sectors.  Critical aspects of  procurement and supply,  such as prices and costs,  quality, timescales and  other value adding activities  are continuously improved,  and procurement process  Organisations have the  ability to monitor use of  standards and good  practices in procurement  processes and support  deviations and non- compliance decisions in  real-time through risk-based  decision making and quality  assurance.

Organisations are able to  benchmark the skills of their  procurement professionals  against the competencies  outlined in procurement  standards and identify any  skills and capability gaps.  Internal stakeholders have  been trained in the secure  use of E-sourcing or E- tendering systems and  purchase-to-pay systems  (P2P) in order to implement  these tools in performing  key tasks in procurement  and supply.  Standards in Software  Development  No standards or good  practices for software  development have been  identified for use relating to  integrity and resilience in  public and private sectors.  Or, there is some  identification, but only  limited evidence of take-up.  Core activities and  methodologies for software  development processes  focused on integrity and  resilience are being  discussed within  professional communities.  Government promotes  relevant standards in  software development, but  there is no widespread use  of these standards yet.  Some organisations supply  or seek to adopt standards  in code development.  Government has an  established programme for  promoting and monitoring  standard adoption in  software development –  both for public and  commercial systems.

D 5.2: Internet Infrastructure Resilience  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Internet Infrastructure  Resilience  Affordable and reliable  Internet services and  infrastructure in the country  may have not yet been  established; if they have  been, adoption rates of  those services are a  concern.  There is little or no national  control of network  infrastructure; networks  and systems are  outsourced, with potential  adoption from unreliable  third-party markets.  Limited Internet services  and infrastructure are  available, but may not be  reliable.  Resilience of Internet  infrastructure in public and  private sectors has been  discussed by multiple  stakeholders, but has not  been fully addressed.  There may be regional  support to secure Internet  infrastructure in the  country.  Reliable Internet services  and infrastructure have  been established.  Internet is used for e- commerce and electronic  business transactions;  authentication processes  are established.  Technology and processes  deployed for Internet  infrastructure meet  international IT guidelines,  standards, and good  practices.  National infrastructure is  formally managed, with  documented processes,  roles and responsibilities,  and limited redundancy.  Regular assessment of  processes according to  international standards and  guidelines are conducted  together with assessment of  national information  infrastructure security and  critical services that drive  investment in new  technologies.  Acquisition of infrastructure  technologies is effectively  controlled, with flexibility  incorporated according to  changing market dynamics.  Costs for infrastructure  technologies are continually  assessed and optimised.  There is effectively  controlled acquisition of  critical technologies with  managed strategic planning  and service continuity  processes in place.  Scientific, technical,  industrial and human  capabilities are being  systematically maintained,  enhanced and perpetuated  in order to maintain the  country’s independent  resilience.

A catalogue of secure  software platforms and  applications within the  public and private sectors  does not exist.  Policies and processes  regarding updates of  software applications have  not yet been formulated.  Software quality and  functional requirements in  public and private sectors  are recognised and  identified, but not  necessarily in a strategic  manner.  A catalogue for secure  software platforms and  applications within the  public and private sectors is  under development.  Policies and processes on  software updates and  maintenance are now under  development.  Evidence of software quality  deficiencies is being  gathered and assessed  regarding its impact on  usability and performance.  Software quality and  functional requirements in  public and private sectors  are recognised and  established.  Reliable software  applications that adhere to  international standards and  good practices are being  used widely in the public  and private sectors.  Policies on and processes  for software updates are  established.  Software applications are  characterised as to their  reliability, usability and  performance in adherence  to international standards  and good practices.  Quality of software used in  public and private sectors is  monitored and assessed.  Policies and processes on  software updates and  maintenance are being  improved based on risk  assessments and the  criticality of services.  Benefits to businesses from  additional investment in  ensuring software quality  and maintenance are  measured and assessed.  Software defects are  manageable in a timely  manner and service  continuity is ensured.  Software applications of  high level performance,  reliability and usability are  available, with service  continuity processes fully  automated.  Requirements of software  quality are being  systematically reviewed,  updated, and adapted to  the changing cybersecurity  environment.

Internet Service Providers  (ISPs) may not offer any  upstream controls to their  customers.  Technical security controls  are deployed by users,  public and private sectors,  but inconsistently.  The deployment of up-to- date technical security  controls is promoted in an  ad-hoc manner and all  sectors are being  incentivised to their use.  ISPs may be offering anti- malware software as part of  their services but possibly in  an ad-hoc manner. ISPs  recognise the need to  establish policies for  technical security control  deployment as part of their  services.  Network Introduction  Detection Systems (NIDS)  and Host Intrusion  Detection Systems (HIDS)  are deployed but not  necessarily in a consistent  manner.  Up-to-date technical  security controls, including  patching and backups, are  deployed in all sectors.  Users have an  understanding of the  importance of anti-malware  software and network  firewalls across devices.  Physical security controls  are employed to prevent  unauthorized personnel  from entering computing  facilities.  ISPs establish policies for  technical security control  deployment as part of their  services.  The technical cybersecurity  control set is based on  established cybersecurity  frameworks, such as the  SANS top 20 cybersecurity  controls, the CESG 10 steps  to cybersecurity, or PAS 55.  Penetration of technical  security controls leads to  effective upstream  protection of users and  public/private sectors.  Within the public and  private sectors, technical  security controls are being  kept up-to-date, monitored  for effectiveness and  reviewed on a regular basis.  The public and private  sector have the capacity to  critically assess and upgrade  cybersecurity controls  according to their  appropriateness and  suitability for use.  All sectors have the capacity  to continuously assess the  security controls deployed  for their effectiveness and  suitability according to their  changing needs.  The understanding of the  technical security controls  being deployed extends to  its impact on organisational  operations and budget  allocation.  ISPs supplement technical  security controls with multi  factor authentication, digital  certificates and whitelisting  to ensure prevention of  access of non-trusted sites  or web addresses and  maintain a safe Internet  environment.

Cryptographic controls for  protecting data at rest and  in transit are recognised and  deployed ad-hoc by multiple  stakeholders and within  various sectors.  State of the art tools, such  as SSL or TLS, are deployed  ad-hoc by web service  providers to secure all  communications between  servers and web browsers.  Cryptographic techniques  are available for all sectors  and users for protection of  data at rest or in transit.  There is a broad  understanding of secure  communication services,  such as encrypted/signed  email.  The cryptographic controls  deployed meet international  standards and guidelines  accordingly for each sector  and are kept up-to-date.  State of the art tools, such  as SSL or TLS, are deployed  routinely by web service  providers to secure all  communications between  servers and web browsers.  The public and private  sectors critically assess the  deployment of  cryptographic controls,  according to their objectives  and priorities.  The public and private  sectors have developed  encryption and  cryptographic control  policies based on the  previous assessment, and  regularly review the policies  for effectiveness.  The relevance of  cryptographic controls  deployed for securing data  at rest and data in transit is  continuously assessed  through risk assessments.  The public and private  sector adapt encryption and  cryptographic control  policies based on the  evolution of technological  advancement and changing  threat environment.

The domestic market may  provide non-specialised  cybersecurity products, but  these are not market- driven.  Cybersecurity is considered  in software and  infrastructure development.  Cybersecurity products are  now being produced by  domestic providers in  accordance with market  needs.  National dependence on  foreign cybersecurity  technologies is increasingly  mitigated through enhanced  domestic capacity.  Cybersecurity technology  development abides by  secure coding guidelines,  good practices and adhere  to internationally accepted  standards.  Risk assessments and  market incentives inform  the prioritisation of product  development to mitigate  identified risks.  Security functions in  software and computer  system configurations are  automated in the  development and  deployment of technologies.  Domestic cybersecurity  products are exported to  other nations and are  considered superior  products.  Cyber Insurance  The need for a cyber  insurance market may have  been identified, but no  products and services are  available.  The need for a market in  cyber insurance has been  identified through the  assessment of financial risks  for public and private  sectors, and development of  products is now being  discussed.  A market for cyber  insurance is established and  encourages information  sharing among participants  of the market.  First-party insurance  typically covers damage to  digital assets, business  interruptions and,  potentially, reputational  harm.  Third-party insurance covers  liability and the costs of  forensic investigations,  customer notification, credit  monitoring, public relations,  legal defence,  compensation and  regulatory fines.  Cyber insurance specifies a  variety of coverages to  mitigate consequential  losses. These coverages are  selected based on strategic  planning needs and  identified risk.  Products suitable for SMEs  are also on offer.  The cyber insurance market  is innovative and adapts to  emerging risks, standards  and practices, while  addressing the full scope of  cyber harm.  Insurance premiums are  offered for consistent cyber- secure behaviour.

Technical details of  vulnerabilities are shared  informally with other  stakeholders who can  distribute the information  more broadly.  Software and service  providers are able to  address bug and  vulnerability reports.  A vulnerability disclosure  framework is in place, which  includes a disclosure  deadline, scheduled  resolution, and an  acknowledgement report.  Organisations have  established processes to  receive and disseminate  vulnerability information.  Software and service  providers commit to refrain  from legal action against a  party disclosing information  responsibly.  Responsible disclosure  processes for all involved  stakeholders (product  vendors, customers, security  vendors and public) are set.  An analysis of the technical  details of vulnerabilities is  published and advisory  information is disseminated  according to individual roles  and responsibilities.  The large majority of  products and services are  updated within  predetermined deadlines.  Responsible disclosure  policies are continuously  reviewed and updated  based on the needs of all  affected stakeholders.  Responsible disclosure  frameworks are shared  internationally, so that best  practice in this area can be  created.  All affected products and  services are routinely  updated within deadline.  Processes are in place to  review and reduce  deadlines.

    "original document": "1  Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre  University of Oxford  3/31/2016  Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity  Model for Nations (CMM)  Revised Edition  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  2  Executive Summary  The goal of the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (Capacity Centre) is to increase the scale and  effectiveness of cybersecurity capacity-building, both within the UK and internationally by gaining a  more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the cybersecurity capacity landscape. It is our  aim to ensure that the knowledge and research collected and produced by the Capacity Centre can  assist nations improve their cybersecurity capacity in a systematic and substantive way. By helping  understand national cybersecurity capacity, the Capacity Centre hopes to help promote an innovative  cyberspace in support of well-being, human rights and prosperity for all.  In order to achieve this aim, the Capacity Centre developed its prototype National Cybersecurity  Capacity Maturity Model in 2014, and deployed it in 2015 during 11 national cybersecurity capacity  reviews, as well as a regional assessment of the Latin American and Caribbean Region (led by the  Organization of American States in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank). The  reviews were conducted alongside several international organisations and leading ministries, and  convened stakeholders from across all sectors of society in order to gain a comprehensive  understanding of the maturity of cybersecurity capacity of the nation. During the reviews, the Capacity  Centre was able to gauge whether the content of CMM is consistent with the cybersecurity capacity  landscape, as well as determine ways to enhance the overall content, structure and deployment of  the CMM through lessons learnt.  Therefore, the Capacity Centre has developed a revised edition of the CMM, based on the lessons  learnt through the deployment of the model. The Capacity Centre proposed a series of modifications  based on the lessons learnt to a panel of cybersecurity experts from various disciplines. These expert  consultations confirmed several proposed amendments, and produced additional inputs for  consideration in the revision of the CMM. Once the amended content was curated by senior  academics leading the development of the respective cybersecurity capacity dimensions, the revised  edition of the CMM was produced.  Most of the alterations that have been made in the revised edition of the CMM are structural rather  than substantial. Certain factors and aspects have been combined or reconfigured to improve the  clarity and precision of the model as a whole, while ensuring the continuity of the content. For  example, in Dimension 3, several review participants expressed confusion regarding the differences  between factors, which resulted in a reconfiguration of this dimension in order to more clearly  communicate the intention of each factor. Other revisions, such as adding factors to certain  dimensions, were made to ensure the essence of the cybersecurity capacity dimensions is more  accurately reflected. In Dimension 5, in particular, several new factors were added so that the focus  of the dimension is drawn toward technical standards, controls and products rather than the existing  ambiguous scope. Finally, some factors were added as a direct result of feedback from the various  country reviews, such as the addition of a factor on the role of media in Dimension 2 and a factor on  international cooperation in Dimension 4.  This effort to enhance the content of the CMM is not intended to be a static exercise. As the Capacity  Centre continues to deploy the model across the world, new lessons will be learnt that can be used to  further enhance the CMM. Our aim is to ensure the CMM remains applicable to all national contexts  and reflects the global state of cybersecurity capacity maturity.

Introduction  The goal of the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (Capacity Centre) is to increase the scale and  effectiveness of cybersecurity capacity-building, both within the UK and internationally through the  deployment of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model (CMM). The Capacity Centre will make this  knowledge available to governments, communities and organisations to help increase their  cybersecurity capacity. By helping increasing national cybersecurity capacity the Capacity Centre  hopes to help promote an innovative cyberspace in support of well-being, human rights and prosperity  for all.  We currently consider cybersecurity capacity to comprise five dimensions:  1. Devising cybersecurity policy and strategy;  2. Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society;  3. Developing cybersecurity knowledge;  4. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks; and  5. Controlling risks through standards, organisations and technologies.  These five dimensions cover the broad expanse of areas that should be considered when seeking to  enhance cybersecurity capacity. We recognise that these dimensions may overlap with one another  on certain issues, and indeed the Capacity Centre hopes to understand the interdependences between  cybersecurity capacities as it conducts more national capacity reviews. Within each dimension, there  are several factors, aspects, stages of maturity, and indicators of cybersecurity capacity, each of which  is defined as follows:   Dimension: The 5 dimensions represent the clusters of cybersecurity capacity through which  the Capacity Centre analyses the nuances of capacity. They represent the different research  ‘lenses’ through which cybersecurity capacity is studied. Accordingly, the most fundamental  structure of the CMM is divided into dimensions, which consist of a number of factors.   Factor: Within the 5 dimensions, factors describe what it means to possess cybersecurity  capacity. They are elements that contribute to the enhancement of cybersecurity capacity  maturity, and the complete list of factors seeks to holistically incorporate all elements of the  cybersecurity capacity landscape, though we recognise that this list may need to be adapted  based on lessons learnt in reviews. Most factors are composed of a number of aspects that  structure the factor’s content (indicators) into more concise parts, while some factors that are  more limited in scope do not have specific aspects.

Aspects represent an organisational method to divide indicators  into smaller clusters that are easier to comprehend. The number of aspects depends on the  themes that emerge in the content of the factor and the overall complexity of the factor. Each  aspect is composed of a series of indicators within 5 stages of maturity.   Stage: Stages define to which degree a country has progressed in relation to a certain  factor/aspect of cybersecurity capacity. The CMM consists of 5 distinct stages of maturity  (defined on page 6), that serve as a snapshot of existing cybersecurity capacity, from which a  country can improve or decline depending on the actions taken (or inaction). Within each  stage there are a number of indicators which a country has to fulfil to move towards higher  cybersecurity capacity maturity.   Indicator: Indicators represent the most elemental part of CMM’s structure. Each indicator  describes the steps, actions, or building blocks that are indicative of a specific stage of maturity  within a distinct aspect, factor and dimension. In order to elevate a country’s cybersecurity  capacity maturity, all of the indicators within a particular stage will need to have been fulfilled.  Most of these indicators are binary in nature, i.e. the country can either evidence they have  fulfilled the indicator criteria, or they cannot provide such evidence. In order for a country to  enhance its maturity within a given aspect of factor, the fulfilment of every indicator needs to  evidenced, otherwise they country cannot progress to the following stage.  The preceding terms are layered as follows:  Below is a template for how the factors, aspects, and indicators are visualised in each dimension of  the CMM:  D X.X: Factor Title  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Aspect A  Indicator 1  Indicator 2  Indicator 3  Indicator 4  Indicator 5  Indicator 6  Indicator 7  Indicator 8  Indicator 9  Indicator 10  Indicator 11  Indicator 12  Indicator 13  Aspect B  Indicator 1  Indicator 2  Indicator 3  Indicator 4  Indicator 5  Indicator 6  Indicator 7  Indicator 8  Indicator 9  Indicator 10  Indicator 11  Indicator 12  Dimension  Factor  Aspect  Start-up stage  Indicators  Formative stage  Indicators  Established stage  Indicators  Strategic stage  Indicators  Dynamic stage  Indicators  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  7  In order to determine to what stage of maturity particular indicators belong, each stage has been  characterised as follows:   Start-up: At this stage either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in nature.  There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity building, but no concrete  actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence at this stage.   Formative: Some features of the aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be  ad-hoc, disorganized, poorly defined – or simply “new”. However, evidence of this activity can  be clearly demonstrated.   Established: The elements of the aspect are in place, and working. There is not, however, well- thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little trade-off decision- making has been made concerning the “relative” investment in the various elements of the  aspect. But the aspect is functional and defined.   Strategic: Choices have been made about which parts of the aspect are important, and which  are less important for the particular organisation or nation. The strategic stage reflects the  fact that these choices have been made, conditional upon the nation or organization's  particular circumstances.   Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy depending on  the prevailing circumstances such as the technology of the threat environment, global conflict  or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g. cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic  organisations have developed methods for changing strategies in stride. Rapid decision- making, reallocation of resources, and constant attention to the changing environment are  feature of this stage.  The CMM allows the review of current national cybersecurity capacity maturity. In each case,  understanding the requirements to achieve higher levels of capacity should directly indicate areas  requiring further investment, and the data required to evidence such capacity levels. This means that  the CMM could also be used to build business cases for investment and expected performance  enhancements.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  8  II. Development of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model  a. Selection of Cybersecurity Capacity-Building Factors  In developing the first iteration of the model in 2014, the Capacity Centre began the process of  selecting factors contributing to building capacity in cybersecurity through exhaustive exploration into  various disciplines. This search sought to gather as much publically available material on cybersecurity  capacity-building as possible, in order not to miss relevant material and reduce the risk of duplicating  efforts conducted by other institutions. Therefore, the Capacity Centre researched, assessed, and  analysed cybersecurity capacity-building factors from several organisations from around the world.  This process sought to ensure that the CMM developed by the Capacity Centre is as scientifically  rigorous as possible. Such factors include, but are not limited to, content produced by: the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA), Hathaway Global Strategies LLC., the National Institute of Standards and Technologies  (NIST), the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and  Development (OECD), the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), and the World Economic Forum  (WEF). These organisations (among others) have all conducted significant research into various factors  contributing to cybersecurity capacity-building. The Capacity Centre acknowledges the importance of  these initiatives in the development of the CMM. In addition, in order to collect as diverse and credible  input as possible, the Capacity Centre consulted with various stakeholders with diverse geographic,  organisational and disciplinary perspectives. These stakeholders are all regarded as experts in their  respective fields, which encompass the five dimensions of cybersecurity capacity identified by the  Capacity Centre. Stakeholders routinely contributed to the collection of cybersecurity capacity- building material.  Once the initial broad collection of factors had been completed, the Capacity Centre proceeded to  prioritise these factors based on a defined methodology. Prioritisation was deemed necessary in order  to prevent an over-abundance of information during the deployment phase. In order to conduct this  prioritisation, the Capacity Centre developed a survey which proposed the following questions:   CATEGORISATION: To what extent do you believe that this should be a primary factor within  one of the five dimensions (as opposed to a consideration that serves as an aspect of a factor)?   EVIDENCE: To what extent do you believe it is impossible/easy to gather evidence to  demonstrate that a nation state or other organisation possesses this capability (i.e. is it  measurable or demonstrable in an observable way)?   VALIDATION: How scientifically robust do you believe measures of this factor could be?   POTENTIAL: Do you agree that this factor should be included in the Cybersecurity Capacity  Maturity Model, assuming supporting data could be acquired?   RELEVANCE: How important is this factor to the future development of cybersecurity capacity?  This survey was completed by several of the stakeholders previously mentioned. The Capacity Centre  collected the responses for all of the participants in the survey in order to create an average score for  all results in each dimension of capacity, and then took the average of each factor across all five  questions, which produced a single score for every factor. These average scores per factor served as  our base for prioritisation. The Capacity Centre decided to use the third quartile as its benchmark for  highest priority factors, as this produced both an operational number of factors and is an objective  standard for selection. By comparing each score against the baseline, and accounting for overlap  between different dimensions, the factors for inclusion were selected.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  9  However, before the CMM could be converted into a tool for national cybersecurity reviews, the CMM  was revised to reflect the operational environment. This revision process was crucial to ensuring that  the CMM maintains a functional purpose, rather than a theoretical perspective. The Organisation of  American States (OAS) provided invaluable insight into several operational environments in which the  CMM might be deployed. Finally, the CMM was adapted into a deployment tool, which optimised  accessibility to the various stakeholders participating in the cybersecurity review. The adaptation  process sought to capture the academic rigour and content behind the development of the CMM, but  condense, re-structure, and rephrase the material in such a way as to maximise the impact of the  capacity-building exercise.  b. Pilot Phase and Deployment  During the pilot phase of CMM in the first quarter of 2015, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre  worked alongside the Organisation of American States (OAS) and Inter-American Development Bank  (IDB)1  and the World Bank2  to conduct national cybersecurity capacity maturity reviews. Further  country reviews were conducted over the following year in conjunction with the Commonwealth  Telecommunications Organisation (CTO),3 the government of The Netherlands under the auspices of  the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE)4 and individual countries.5 Throughout the process of  deployment, the Capacity Centre has not only gained a unique understanding of the cybersecurity  capacities of several countries, but has also learned lessons about cybersecurity capacity-building that  can benefit the cybersecurity discipline as an evolving field of work.  As the Capacity Centre does not and cannot have thorough and in-depth understanding of each  domestic context in which the model is deployed, it is important to work alongside international  organisations or host ministries or organisations within the respective country. Moreover,  cooperation with international organisations has sought to enable those organisations to achieve its  own cybersecurity capacity-building objectives through a holistic understanding of a country’s existing  cybersecurity capacity. After engaging with the model deployment a number of times, these  organisations will continue to conduct reviews in their own right, with remote Capacity Centre  support. In this way, we can increase economies of scale while empowering international  organisations to use a single model that is applicable to a variety of objectives and addresses  cybersecurity capacity comprehensively.  1 Colombia, Jamaica, and regional review  2 Armenia, Bhutan, Kosovo and Montenegro.  3 Uganda and Fiji.  4 Senegal.  5 Indonesia and United Kingdom.

Evolution of the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model  This document presents the second iteration of the Capacity Centre’s Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity  Model. All revisions that have been made are based on lessons learnt in the pilot phase and  subsequent post-pilot deployment of the CMM and through expert consultations. However, to  validate the results of this revision process and ensure widest stakeholder consultations, this revised  edition of the CMM has been disseminated to international cybersecurity experts for review and  advice before finalisation.  a. Revision Process  In order to gather feedback and suggestions for the CMM evolution, a series of conference calls with  members of the Capacity Centre’s Expert Panel was arranged in late 2015. Each conference call  focused on one of the five dimensions of the CMM and discussed various enhancements to the existing  factors. These calls also introduced potential new factors, as gathered from the lessons learnt of the  deployment of the model, a roundtable Expert Panel discussion, and additional preliminary  consultations with the respective dimension Chairs. The outcome of the discussion during each of the  calls was analysed and fed into the revision of the five CMM dimensions. The revised content was in  turn curated by senior academics leading the development of the respective dimensions. Key  modifications are described below.  b. Modifications and New Factors of CMM Revised Edition  Dimension One: Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy  An additional aspect was added to the Incident Response factor (‘Mode of Operation’) to better reflect  the operational part of incident response capacity, including processes, tools and training. This was  originally a factor in Dimension 5, but the review participants felt this factor was out-of-place without  the context of the other aspects of incident response included in Dimension 1.  Furthermore, several aspects within various factors were merged to create a more focused view on  each factor. For example, crisis management was condensed from two aspects to one because during  the reviews, it became evident that participant responses for the ‘Evaluation’ aspect of crisis  management was dependent on their response to the ‘Planning’ aspect. By combining these two  aspects, the dependent relationship between aspects is removed.  Finally, to avoid further redundancies in this dimension, the word “national” was removed from  various factors, aspects and indicators (apart from ‘National Cybersecurity Strategy’, which was  identified as a noun), as the CMM is in itself a national model.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  11  Dimension Two: Cyber Culture and Society  One of the major changes within the second dimension was the clarification of the relationship  between cybersecurity awareness raising and cybersecurity mind-set. To ensure coherence within and  across dimensions, the factor on initiatives seeking to raise awareness was moved to Dimension Three  (Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills), while the prevailing cybersecurity mind-set and social  perception was retained in Dimension Two.  Three new factors were introduced within this dimension, namely: User Understanding of Personal  Information Protection Online, Reporting Mechanisms, and Media and Social Media. All of these new  factors had been identified as missing or not distinct enough during the deployment of the CMM.  The factor on User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online refers to the  understanding and sensitisation of users to protecting their personal data. This factor was identified  as important in the first iteration of the CMM, but was not included due to difficultly of evidence  collection. We decided that, since perceptual evidence should be included in the reviews, we are able  to include this factor.  The factor on Reporting Mechanisms was identified as an important aspect to be included in the  revised edition of the CMM by the various experts we consulted during the revision phase. This factor  explores the existence of reporting mechanisms functioning as channels for users to report cybercrime  and the possible development of coordinated programmes to promote the use of these mechanisms.  The evidence gathered will offer valuable insight in a country’s preparedness to control cybersecurity  risks and the public ability to recognise and report these.  The role of media was identified as important during the CMM reviews and is now a distinct factor in  the revised edition. The factor on Media and Social Media explores whether cybersecurity is a  common subject across mainstream media, or an issue for broad discussion on social media, as well  as the role of media in conveying information about cybersecurity to the public, thus shaping their  cybersecurity values, attitudes and online behaviour.  Dimension Three: Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills  Awareness raising was moved to this dimension from the cultural and social dimension, as raising  awareness of cybersecurity is crucial to building knowledge. Additionally, the participants in the  reviews often claimed that executive awareness of cybersecurity depended on the sector. By re- contextualising this factor into raising executive awareness, this aspect can be more readily applied at  the national level.  Additionally, while the content of the third dimension did not change substantially, the deployment  of the CMM suggested a broad restructuring of the factors and their aspects, as the previous structure  proved to be confusing to country review participants and showed overlaps. For example, there was  a conflation of education and training in the first iteration of the model that many participants found  confusing. In the new structure, education and training are clearly separated and are defined by the  provisional aspect, as well as development/uptake aspect, rather than addressing both education and  training in the same factors. Emphasis was further shifted from focusing primarily on businesses and  the private sector towards addressing all sectors of society.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  12  Dimension Four: Legal and Regulatory Frameworks  Among the different components of the factor legal and regulatory frameworks, only ICT security  legislation was considered unclear during the reviews, as the interpretation varied between ICT  security legislation as the legal tool for mandatory standards adoption, or as a unique cybercrime law.  As a result, this aspect of the first factor was clarified and the content was made more explicit by  referring to the protection of critical information infrastructure, e-transactions, liability of Internet  Service Providers and cyber incident reporting obligations.  Additionally, while a distinction was made in the CMM between training prosecutors and judges,  review participants commented that it is not only crucial to maintain this distinction in further versions  of the model, but also that the need for specialised trainings should be highlighted. This finding was  corroborated by experts consulted on this dimension. In fact, one expert even suggested that, if the  same training programmes are used for all parts of the criminal justice system, it would signify a lower  level of cybersecurity capacity maturity.  The third factor on responsible disclosure was less self-explanatory to participants, as it did not directly  relate to the other elements of this dimension and there was disagreement whether responsible  disclosure requires a legal response or is rather an issue for policy or standards and good practice.  Experts consulted on the various dimensions concluded that the responsible disclosure factor should  be moved to the Standards, Organisations, and Technologies Dimension, as its content relates to  technical vulnerabilities and the standards that are in place to disclose and address these.  Through expert consultations, several recommendations were gathered to further enhance the  structure of Dimension Four. It was discussed that additional aspects on legislation addressing  intellectual property, data protection, child protection online and consumer protection should be  added to provide a more holistic overview of the legal framework relating to cybersecurity and  emphasise these specific subjects that are widely debated at the international arena.  Another recommendation raised during expert consultations was the need to distinguish domestic  and international cooperation as its own factor rather than an aspect of the criminal justice system  factor. In accordance with expert input, the newly established third factor within this dimension  includes both formal legal cooperation mechanisms (such as mutual legal assistance and extradition)  and informal mechanisms (such as cooperation between law enforcement and Internet Service  Providers), on domestic and international levels.  Dimension Five: Standards, Organisations, and Technologies  The various reviews conducted by the Capacity Centre indicated that the focus of Dimension Five was  not as clear or succinct as the other four. Therefore, four new factors were based on recommendations  from cybersecurity experts, in order to tailor the focus of this dimension on a clear set of issues.  Two new factors that were added observe the level of deployment and implementation of technical  security and cryptographic control measures. These factors will gather evidence on the deployment  of up-to-date technical security controls such as anti-malware systems, intrusion detection systems,  network firewalls, event-logging and auditing functionality, as well as the deployment of cryptographic  controls in all sectors, and whether these controls meet international standards and guidelines.  In addition, software quality was added as a new factor. Experts in cybersecurity have identified that  the aspect of quality during deployment of software and the functional requirements as well as the  existence and improvement of policies and processes on software updates were missing from the  CMM.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  13  The only other substantial change was the combination of the two aspects of National Infrastructure  Resilience into one on Internet Infrastructure Resilience which, based on input from the reviews, more  accurately reflects the content in the indicators.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  14  IV. National Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model  Dimension 1: Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy  This dimension explores the country’s capacity to develop and deliver cybersecurity strategy and  enhance its cybersecurity resilience through improving its incident response, crisis management,  redundancy, and critical infrastructure protection capacities. Delivering cybersecurity must include  capability in early warning, deterrence, resistance and recovery. This dimension considers effective  security policy in delivering national defence and resilience capability, while maintaining the benefits  of a cyberspace vital for government, international business and society in general.  D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy  Cybersecurity strategy is essential to mainstreaming a cybersecurity agenda across government  because it helps prioritise cybersecurity as an important policy area, determines responsibilities and  mandates of key cybersecurity government and non-governmental actors, and directs allocation of  resources to the emerging and existing cybersecurity issues and priorities.   Development: This aspect addresses the development of a national strategy, allocation of  implementation authorities across sectors and civil society and an understanding of national  cybersecurity risks and threats which drives capacity building at a national level.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of an overarching programme for  cybersecurity coordination, including a departmental owner or coordinating body with a  consolidated budget.   Content: This aspect addresses the content of the national cybersecurity strategy and whether  it is linked explicitly to national risks, priorities and objectives such as public awareness raising,  mitigation of cybercrime, incident response capability and critical national infrastructure  protection.  D 1.2: Incident Response  This factor addresses the capacity of the government to identify and determine characteristics of  national level incidents in a systematic way. It also reviews the government’s capacity to organise,  coordinate, and operationalise incident response.   Identification of Incidents: This aspect identifies whether there is a central registry of national  level cyber incidents.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of a mandated central body designated to  collect incident information, and its relationship with the public and private sector for national  level incident response.   Coordination: This aspect explores the existence of coordinated national incident response  with clear roles and responsibilities as well as lines of communication for crisis situations.   Mode of Operation: This aspect addresses the operational and technical capacity of the  incident response organisation, such as services, processes, resources and tools.  D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  This factor studies the government’s capacity to identify CI assets and the risks associated with them,  engage in response planning and critical assets protection, facilitate quality interaction with CI asset  owners, and enable comprehensive general risk management practice including response planning.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  15   Identification: This aspect addresses the existence of a general list of CI assets, identified risk-  based priorities, and an audit of CI assets on a regular basis.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of a formal collaboration mechanism  between government ministries and owners of critical assets.   Risk Management and Response: This aspect explores whether cybersecurity is embedded  into general risk management practices, and whether security measures are developed to  ensure business continuity of CI in the context of the prevailing risk environment. Additionally,  this aspect refers to information protection procedures and processes for response planning  to an attack on critical assets, supported by adequate technical security solutions.  D 1.4: Crisis Management  This factor addresses crisis management planning addresses conducting specialised needs  assessments, training exercises, and simulations that produce scalable results for policy development  and strategic decision-making. Through qualitative and quantitative techniques, cybersecurity  evaluation processes aim to produce structured and measurable results that would solicit  recommendations for policymakers and other stakeholders and inform national strategy  implementation as well as inform budgetary allocations.   Crisis Management: (as above)  D 1.5: Cyber Defence Consideration  This factor explores whether the government has the capacity to design and implement a cyber  Defence strategy and lead its implementation including through a designated cyber Defence  organisation. It also reviews the level of coordination between various public and private sector actors  in response to malicious attacks on strategic information systems and critical national infrastructure.   Strategy: This aspect addresses the existence of a national cyber Defence strategy.   Organisation: This aspect addresses the existence of a designated organisation within the  government responsible for Defence for conflict using cyber means.   Coordination: This aspect addresses coordination in response to malicious attacks on strategic  information systems and critical national infrastructure.  D 1.6: Communications Redundancy  This factor reviews a government’s capacity to identify and map digital redundancy and redundant  communications among stakeholders. Digital redundancy foresees a cybersecurity system in which  duplication and failure of any component is safeguarded by proper backup. Most of these backups will  take the form of isolated (from mainline systems) but readily available digital networks, but some may  be non-digital (e.g. backing up a digital communications network with a radio communications  network).   Communications Redundancy: (as above)  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  16  D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Strategy Development  No national cybersecurity  strategy exists, although  planning processes for  strategy development may  have begun.  Advice may have been  sought from international  partners.  An outline/draft national  cybersecurity strategy has  been articulated.  Processes for strategy  development have been  initiated.  Consultation processes have  been agreed for key  stakeholder groups,  including international  partners.  A national cybersecurity  strategy has been published.  Multi-stakeholder  consultation processes have  been followed and  observations fed back to the  identified strategy 'owners'.  National cybersecurity  strategy is promoted and  implemented by multiple  stakeholders across  government and other  sectors.  Strategy review and renewal  processes are confirmed.  Regular scenario and real- time cyber exercises that  provide a concurrent picture  of national cyber resilience  are considered a strategic  priority.  Relevant metrics,  measurement, and  monitoring processes, data,  and historic trends are  evaluated and inform  decision-making.  Cybersecurity strategic  plans, aligned with national  strategic priorities, drive  capacity building and  investments in security.  Continual revision and  refinement of cybersecurity  strategy is conducted  proactively to adapt to  changing socio-political,  threat and technology  environments.  The country is a leader  within the international  community and the debate  shaping the development of  global cybersecurity  strategy.  Organisation  No overarching national  cybersecurity programme  has been developed.  A coordinated cybersecurity  programme is being  developed through a multi- stakeholder consultative  process.  However, budgets reside in  disparate public  departments without a  discrete cybersecurity  budget line.  The single agreed  cybersecurity programme  has a designated  coordinating body with a  mandate to consult across  public and private sectors,  and civil society.  The programme is defined  according to goals and  objectives, using metrics to  measure progress.  Discrete budget for  cybersecurity exists, but is  Evidence exists of iterative  application of metrics and  resulting refinements to  operations and strategy  across government,  including resource allocation  considerations.  A consolidated cybersecurity  budget has been  administered in order to  allocate resources.  A singular national  cybersecurity posture exists  with the ability to reassign  tasks and budgets  dynamically according to  changing risk assessments.  A designated national body  disseminates and receives  feedback on the strategy  from wider society to  continuously enhance the  national cybersecurity  posture.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  17  D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  not yet a part of a  consolidated budget.  Content  Various national policies  may exist with a reference  to cybersecurity, but if so,  the content is generic, not  necessarily aligned with  national goals, and does not  provide actionable  directives.  Content includes links  established between  cybersecurity, national risk  priorities and business  development, but these are  generally ad-hoc and lack  detail.  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy is  linked explicitly and directly  to national risks, priorities  and objectives, as well as  business development.  Content at a minimum  should seek to raise public  awareness, mitigate  cybercrime, establish  incident response capability  and protect critical  infrastructure from external  and internal threats.  Metrics and measurements  are utilised to update  national cybersecurity  strategy content to help  leaders evaluate the success  of the various cybersecurity  objectives and guide  resource investment.  Content now also seeks to  protect critical  infrastructure internal  threats.  New content is periodically  incorporated in the strategy  in response to evolving  threat landscapes.  Content of the national  cybersecurity strategy leads,  promotes and encourages  national and international  cooperation to ensure a  secure, resilient and trusted  cyberspace.  D 1.2: Incident Response  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification of  Incidents  No catalogue of national  level incidents exists, or is in  development.  Certain cybersecurity  incidents have been  categorised and recorded as  national-level threats.  A central registry of  national-level cybersecurity  incidents is operational.  Regular, systematic updates  to the national-level  incident registry are made.  Resources are allocated for  analysing incidents in order  to prioritise which incidents  are most urgent.  Focus on incident  identification and analysis is  adapted in response to  environmental changes.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  18  D 1.2: Incident Response  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Organisation  No organisation for national  cyber incident response  exists.  Private sector organisations  key to national cybersecurity  have been identified, but no  formal coordination and  information sharing  mechanisms exist between  public and private sectors.  Dispersed public and private  sector bodies detect and  respond to incidents as they  occur but a specific mandate  for a national cyber incident  response organisation is yet  to be agreed.  A funded national body for  incident response has been  established (such as CSIRTs  or CERTs), with specified  roles and responsibilities.  Distinct and formal security  roles and responsibilities are  allocated across  government, critical  infrastructure, enterprise,  and individual systems.  Human and financial  resources allocated to  incident response are  adequate to the  cybersecurity threat  environment and enhance  effectiveness of the  organisation.  National incident response  capability is fully financially  sustainable, from a single or  multiple sources.  An early warning capacity is  incorporated into the  mission of the incident  response organisation,  which seeks to shape and  manage the threat  landscape before  responding to specific  incidents.  Coordination  Coordination of incident  response is informally  managed within or between  public and private sectors.  Leads for incident response  have been designated at the  operational level, but  national-level coordination  has not yet been  established.  Routine and coordinated  national incident response is  established and published  between public and private  sectors, with lines of  communication prepared  for times of crisis.  International cooperation  for incident response  between organisations  exists to resolve incidents as  they occur.  The national incident  response organisation  coordinates and  collaborates with sub- national/sectorial incident- response organisations.  Technical capabilities now  go beyond coordinating  response and include  strategically focusing  resources in coordinating  international incident and  threat intelligence  analysis/support.  A platform for the reporting  and sharing of incidents  across sectors is promoted.  Multi-level and inclusive  national and international  coordination between all  levels and sectors is  internalised as vital for  continuous and effective  incident response.  Regional coordination exists  to resolve incidents as they  occur.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  19  D 1.2: Incident Response  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Mode of Operation  Key incident response  processes (detection,  resolution, prevention, etc.)  and (digital) tools to support  them have not been well  defined or documented.  There is limited or no  sufficient training or  understanding of the key  concepts of cybersecurity  incident response.  Key incident response  processes have been  identified, but not officially  documented or  operationalised.  Members of CSIRTs receive  training in an ad-hoc  manner.  Incident response is reactive  and ad-hoc.  Key incident response  processes and tools are  defined, documented and  functional.  Members of CSIRTs receive  training regularly in order to  understand key concepts of  cybersecurity incident  response.  National-level incident  response is limited in scope  and still reactive.  Incident response teams  have established a training  policy for their members;  members are being trained  in specialised subjects and  accredited by internationally  recognised bodies on a  regular basis.  Team members are able to  carry out a sophisticated  incident analysis  investigation quickly and  efficiently.  Key processes (detection,  resolution, prevention, etc.)  are being monitored and  reviewed in regular basis,  and tested with different  case scenarios.  Forensics services are  offered.  National incident response  teams coordinate with  international counterparts.  The results of testing key  processes through case  scenarios are being analysed  and are incorporated into  the updating of processes.  The benefits of training and  accreditation are being  evaluated and inform the  future training planning.  Tools for early detection,  identification, prevention,  response and mitigation of  zero-day vulnerabilities are  embedded in incident  response organisation(s).  Mechanisms for regional  cooperation in incident  response have been  established.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  20  D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  Some understanding of  what comprises CI assets is  acknowledged, but no  formal categorisation of  assets has been produced.  A list of general CI assets has  been created.  A detailed audit of CI assets  as it relates to  cybersecurity is performed  on a regular basis.  CI asset audit lists are  disseminated to relevant  stakeholders.  CI risks and assets have  been prioritised according  to vulnerability and impact,  which guides strategic  investment.  Vulnerability/asset  management processes are  in place so that incremental  security improvements can  be made.  Priority listing of CI assets is  regularly re-appraised to  capture changes in the  threat environment.  Organisation  There is little or no  interaction between  government ministries and  owners of CI assets. No  mechanism for collaboration  exists.  There is informal and ad-hoc  threat and vulnerability  disclosure among CI owners  as well as between CI and  the government, but the  scope of reporting  requirements has not been  specified.  A mechanism is established  for regular vulnerability  disclosure with defined  scope for reporting  incidents (either  mandatory or voluntary)  between CI asset owners  and the government.  Formal internal and  external CI communication  strategies have been  defined and are consistent  across sectors, with clear  points of contact.  Strategic engagement  between government and  CI is agreed and promoted.  There is a clear  understanding of which  threats to CI are managed  centrally, and which are  managed locally.  A public awareness  campaign to facilitate the CI  communication strategy is  established with a point of  contact for this information.  Cybersecurity requirements  and vulnerabilities in CI  supply chains are clearly  identified, mapped and  managed.  Owners of critical  infrastructure and assets  are able to rapidly respond  to the changing threat  landscape.  Trust has been established  between the government  and CIs with respect to  cybersecurity and exchange  of threat information, which  is fed into the strategic  decision-making process.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  21  Risk Management and  Response  Risk management skills and  understanding may be  incorporated into business  practices, but cybersecurity,  if recognised, is subsumed  into IT and data protection  risk and is not recognised as  a priority.  Response planning and  threat awareness may have  been broadly discussed, but  no formal plan exists.  Physical and virtual access  control is implemented.  CI has basic capacity to  detect, identify, respond to  and recover from cyber  threats, but such capabilities  are uncoordinated and vary  in quality.  Protection of CI assets  includes basic level  cybersecurity awareness and  data security policies, but no  protection processes have  been agreed.  Best practices in security  measures, guidelines, and  standards for CI  cybersecurity have been  established and adopted.  Cybersecurity risk  management processes  have been established,  supported by adequate  technical security solutions,  communication links, and  harm mitigation measures.  CI risk management  procedures are used to  create a national response  plan including the  participation of all vital  entities.  Cybersecurity is firmly  embedded into general risk  management practice.  Assessment of the breadth  and severity of harm  incurred by CI assets is  regularly conducted and  response planning is  tailored to that assessment  to ensure business  continuity.  Resources are allocated in  proportion to the assessed  impact of an incident to  ensure rapid and effective  incident response.  Insider threat detection is  accounted for.  Audit practices to assess  network and system  dependencies and  vulnerabilities (i.e.  unmitigated dependencies)  are implemented on a  regular basis and inform  continuous reassessment of  CI risk portfolio,  technologies, policies and  processes.  The impact of cybersecurity  risk on the business  operations of CI, including  direct and opportunity  costs, impact on revenue,  and hindrance to  innovation, are understood  and incorporated into  future planning and  executive decision making.

Crisis management exercise  design and planning  authority may have been  allocated in principle (either  directly or via consultants),  but cybersecurity crisis  management planning has  not been thoroughly  outlined.  A preliminary cybersecurity  needs assessment of  measures and techniques  that require testing has  been undertaken, but no  exercise has been  conducted at this point.  An exercise planning  authority has been  designated, and has  outlined the steps to be  taken in order to conduct  the cybersecurity exercise.  Key stakeholders and other  subject matter experts, such  as think tanks, academics,  civil leaders and consultants  are included in the planning  process.  Exercise monitors, if  designated, are internal and  may lack training.  A cybersecurity exercise,  with limited size and  geographic scope has been  conducted involving all  relevant stakeholders in all  sectors.  Appropriate resources have  been allocated to the  exercises.  Planning process includes  the engagement of  participants, an outline of  their role in the exercise,  and the articulation of  benefits and incentives for  participation.  Trained internal or external  monitors facilitate the  exercise.  The exercise is evaluated  and commentary is provided  by participants and  stakeholders.  A realistic high-level  scenario informs a plan to  test information flows,  decision-making and  resource investment at the  national level.  Trust is developed well in  advance via the recruitment  and pre-exercise briefing  process and through  guaranteed confidentiality  control.  Specific, Measurable,  Attainable, Relevant, and  Time-Bound (SMART)  objectives and performance  key indicators (PKI) inform  decisions in crisis  management, and  evaluation results inform  future investment in  national cybersecurity  capacity.  Findings are evaluated  against international crisis  management good practice.  Tailored, sector-specific  reports are prepared for  each stakeholder, while  ensuring sensitive  information is secured.  The exercise involves  neutral peer stakeholders to  observe, and, where  appropriate, contribute, and  addresses international  challenges to produce  scalable results for  international policy- and  decision-making.  An evaluation of the crisis  management exercise is  provided for the  international community, so  that lessons learnt can  contribute toward a global  understanding of crisis  management.  Crisis management is  embedded in risk analysis,  review and management.

Specific threats to national  security in cyberspace have  been identified, such as  external threat actors (both  state and non-state), insider  threats, supply chain  vulnerabilities, and threats  to military operational  capacity, but a coherent  strategy does not yet exist.  National cyber Defence  policy or strategy exists and  outlines the country’s  position in its response to  different types and levels of  cyber-attacks (for example,  cyber-enabled conflict  producing a kinetic effect  and offensive cyber-attacks  aimed to disrupt  infrastructure).  Resources dedicated toward  Cyber Defence are allocated  based on national strategic  objectives.  The evolving threat  landscape in cybersecurity is  captured through repeated  review in order to ensure  that cyber Defence ways  and means continue to meet  national security objectives.  The policy or strategy drives  the international discussion  on rules of engagement in  cyberspace.  Rules of engagement are  clearly defined and the  military doctrine that  applies to cyberspace is fully  developed and takes note of  significant shifts in the  cybersecurity environment.  Organisation  Informal management of  cyber Defence may be  distributed among the  armed forces and/or  government organisations,  with occasional reference to  signals intelligence.  Cyber operations units are  incorporated into the  different branches of the  armed forces, but no central  command and control  structure exists.  There is a defined  organisation within the  Defence apparatus  responsible for conflict using  cyber means.  Highly specialised expertise  with advanced capabilities  and full situational  awareness are integrated  into the national defence  posture.  The Defence apparatus  contributes to the debate in  developing a common  international understanding  of the point at which a  cyber-attack might trigger a  cross-domain response.  Coordination  No, or limited, capacity for  coordinated cyber Defence  exists between domestic  stakeholders (e.g. law  enforcement, public, and  enterprise, private) or  interstate stakeholders (e.g.  allied or neutral states).  Cyber Defence capability  requirements are agreed  between the public and  private sector in order to  minimise the threat to  national and international  security.  The entity in charge of cyber  Defence coordinates  integration regarding cyber  events between  government, military and  critical infrastructure and  identifies clear roles and  responsibilities.  Defence organisations and  critical infrastructure  providers have established a  mechanism to report threat  intelligence.  Analytical capacity exists to  support the coordination of  resource allocation for  national cyber Defence;  possibly including a cyber- defence research centre.  The understanding of  strengths and weaknesses  within the coordination  mechanism then feeds into  the re-evaluation of the  national security posture of  the nation.  The country is leading the  international debate on  cyber Defence and  systematically shares  intelligence with allies.

Current emergency  response assets may have  been identified, but lack any  level of integration.  Stakeholders convene to  identify gaps and overlaps in  emergency response asset  communications and  authority links.  Emergency response assets,  priorities and standard  operating procedures are  mapped and identified in  the event of a  communications disruption  along any node in the  emergency response  network.  Emergency response assets  are hardwired into a  national emergency  communication network.  Communication is  distributed across  emergency response  functions, geographic areas  of responsibility, public and  private responders, and  command authorities.  Appropriate resources are  allocated to hardware  integration, technology  stress testing, personnel  training and crisis  simulations drills.  Outreach and education of  redundant communications  protocols is undertaken for  key stakeholders and is  tailored to their unique roles  and responsibilities.  Emergency response assets  practice interoperability and  function effectively under  compromised  communications scenarios.  The results of these  scenarios then inform  strategic investment in  future emergency response  assets.  Stakeholders contribute to  international efforts on  redundancy communication  planning.  Optimised efficiency is in  place to mediate extended  outages of systems.  National-level assets can act  to assist neighbours in the  event of an international- level crisis or incident.

Leading agencies within  government may have  begun to consider  cybersecurity.  Leading agencies have  begun to place priority on  cybersecurity, by identifying  risks and threats.  Most government officials at  all levels are aware of  cybersecurity good  practices.  Agencies across all levels of  government have routinized  a cybersecurity mind-set,  employing good (proactive)  practices as a matter of  habit.  Cybersecurity mind-set  informs strategic planning.  The cybersecurity mind-set  serves as a foundation for  government official’s  operational practices and is  evidenced as global good  practice.  Cybersecurity mind-set of  government officials is  related to a reduction of the  overall threat landscape of  the government.  Private Sector  The private sector has no or  minimal recognition of the  need to prioritise a  cybersecurity mind-set.  Leading firms have begun to  place priority on a  cybersecurity mind-set by  identifying high-risk  practices.  Programmes and materials  have been made available to  train and improve  cybersecurity practices.  Most private sector actors  at all levels are aware of  cybersecurity good  practices.  Most private sector actors,  including SMEs, have  routinized a cybersecurity  mind-set, employing good  (proactive) practices as a  matter of habit.  Cybersecurity mind-set,  informs strategic planning.  The cybersecurity mind-set  serves as a foundation for  private sector operational  practices, informs all IT  related initiatives and is  evidenced as global good  practice.  Cybersecurity mind-set of  the private sector is related  to a reduction of the overall  threat landscape of the  sector.  Users  Users have no or minimal  recognition of the need to  prioritise a cybersecurity  mind-set and take no  proactive steps to improve  their cybersecurity.  A limited proportion of  Internet users have begun  to place priority on  cybersecurity, by identifying  risks and threats.

Operators of Internet  infrastructure may consider  measures promoting trust in  online services.  A very limited proportion of  Internet users critically  assess what they see or  receive online and believe  that they have the ability to  use the Internet and protect  themselves online.  A limited proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of the Internet based on  indicators of website  legitimacy.  Operators of Internet  infrastructure develop  measures to promote trust  in online services but have  not established them.  A growing proportion of  Internet users critically  assess what they see or  receive online, based on  identifying possible risks.  A growing proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of the Internet based on  indicators of website  legitimacy.  Internet infrastructure  operators have established  programmes to promote  trust in online services.  User-consent policies are in  place designed to notify  practices on the collection,  use or disclosure of sensitive  personal information.  Most Internet users critically  assess what they see or  receive online, based on  identifying possible risks.  Most Internet users feel  confident while using the  Internet, have the ability to  recognise non-legitimate  websites (including mimicry  attempts), and have a sense  of control over providing  personal data online.  Programmes to promote  trust in the use of online  services are assessed based  on measures of  effectiveness which informs  resource allocation.  Individuals assess the risk in  using online services,  including changes in the  technical and cybersecurity  environment and  continuously adjust their  behaviour based on this  assessment.  Internet infrastructure  operators assess trust  promotion services and  integrate findings into  programme and policy  revision.  User Trust in E- government Services  Government offers no or  limited e-services, but has  not publicly promoted the  necessary secure  environment.  If e-government services are  provided, users are  unfamiliar with or lack trust  in them.  Government continues to  increase e-service provision,  but also recognises the need  for the application of  security measures to  establish trust in these  services.  The need for security in e- government services is  recognised by stakeholders  and users.  A limited proportion of  users trust in the secure use  of e-government services.  E-government services have  been fully developed.  High-level risks affecting e- government services are  prioritised in order to  reduce occurrences.  The public sector promotes  use of e-government  services and trust in these  services through a  coordinated programme,  including the compliance to  web standards that protect  the anonymity of users.  Public authorities are  routinely publishing certain  information about their  activities.  Privacy-by-default is  promoted as a tool for  transparency in e- government services.  The majority of users trust  in the secure use of e- government services and  make use of them.  E-government services and  promotion thereof are  continuously improved and  expanded to enhance  transparent/open and  secure systems and user  trust.  Impact assessments on data  protection in e-government  services are consistently  taking place and feed back  into strategic planning.

There is no or limited  discussion regarding the  protection of personal  information online.  Discussions may have begun  and involve multiple  stakeholders, but no privacy  standards are in place.  Users and stakeholders  within the public and private  sectors may have general  knowledge about how  personal information is  handled online; and may  employ good (proactive)  cybersecurity practices to  protect their personal  information online.  Discussions have begun  regarding the protection of  personal information and  about the balance between  security and privacy, but this  has not resulted in concrete  actions or policies.  A growing proportion of  users have the skills to  manage their privacy online,  and protect themselves  from intrusion, interference,  or unwanted access of  information by others.  There is constant public  debate regarding the  protection of personal  information and about the  balance between security  and privacy, which informs  privacy policies within public  and private sectors.  All stakeholders have the  information, confidence and  the ability to take measures  to protect their personal  information online and to  maintain control of the  distribution of this  information.  Users and stakeholders  within the public and private  sectors widely recognise the  importance of protection of  personal information online,  and are sensitised to their  privacy rights.  Mechanisms are in place in  private and public sectors to  ensure that privacy and  security are not competing.  Privacy by default as a tool  for transparency is  promoted.  Users have the knowledge  and skills necessary to  protect their personal  information online, adapting  their abilities to the  changing risk environment.  There is a wide recognition  of the need to ensure  security and protection of  personal information.  Policies are in place in  private and public sectors to  ensure that privacy and  security are not competing  in a changing environment  and are informed by user  feedback and public debate.  Assessments of personal  information protection in e- services are regularly  conducted and feed back  into policy revision.

The public and/or private  sectors are providing some  channels for reporting  online fraud, cyber-bullying,  child abuse online, identity  theft, privacy and security  breaches, and other  incidents, but these  channels are not  coordinated and are used in  an ad-hoc manner.  Promotion of the existing  reporting channels has not  yet begun or is ad-hoc.  Reporting mechanisms have  been established and are  regularly used.  Programmes to promote the  use of these mechanisms  have been established by  public and private sectors.  Coordinated reporting  mechanisms are widely  used.  Programmes to promote the  use of these mechanisms  are prioritised by public and  private sectors and are  considered as an investment  in loss prevention and risk  control.  Effectiveness metrics of  reporting mechanisms are  applied and findings inform  the revision and promotion  of the mechanisms.  All relevant stakeholders  actively collaborate and  share good practice to  enhance existing reporting  mechanisms and there is a  clear distribution of roles  and responsibilities,  including regarding the  response to reported  incidents.  Mechanisms have been  developed to coordinate  response to reported  incidents between law  enforcement and the  national incident response  capability.  D 2.5: Media and Social Media  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Media and Social  Media  Media and social media  rarely, if ever, cover  information about  cybersecurity or report on  issues such as security  breaches or cybercrime.  There is ad-hoc media  coverage of cybersecurity,  with limited information  provided and reporting on  specific issues that  individuals face online, such  as online child protection or  cyber-bullying.  There is limited discussion  on social media about  cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity is a common  subject across mainstream  media, and information and  reports on a wide range of  issues, including security  breaches and cybercrime  are widely disseminated.  There is broad discussion on  social media about  cybersecurity.  Media coverage extends  beyond threat reporting and  can inform the public of  proactive and actionable  cybersecurity measures, as  well economic and social  impacts.  There is frequent discussion  on social media about  cybersecurity and  individuals regularly  exchange experiences online  using social media.  The broad discussion of  personal experiences and  personal attitudes of  individuals across  mainstream and social  media inform policy making  and facilitate societal  change.

Moreover, it evaluates the availability, quality, and uptake of educational and  training offerings for various groups of government stakeholders, private sector, and the population  as a whole.  D 3.1: Awareness Raising  This factor focuses on the prevalence and design of programmes to raise awareness of cybersecurity  risks and threats as well as how to address them.   Awareness Raising Programmes: This aspect examines the existence of a national  coordinated programme for cybersecurity awareness raising, covering a wide range of  demographics and issues, developed based on consultations with stakeholders from various  sectors.   Executive Awareness Raising: This aspect examines efforts raising executives’ awareness of  cybersecurity issues in the public, private, academic and civil society sectors, as well as how  cybersecurity risks might be addressed.  D 3.2: Framework for Education  This factor addresses the importance of high quality cybersecurity education offerings and the  existence of qualified educators. Moreover, this factor examines the need for enhancing cybersecurity  education at the national and institutional level and the collaboration between government, and  industry to ensure that the educational investments meet the needs of the cybersecurity environment  across all sectors.   Provision: This aspect explores whether there are cybersecurity educational offerings and  educator qualification programmes available based on an understanding of current risks and  skills requirements.   Administration: This aspect explores the coordination and resources for developing and  enhancing cybersecurity education frameworks, with allocated budget and spending based on  the national demand.  D 3.3: Framework for Professional Training  This factor addresses the availability and provision of cybersecurity training programmes building a  cadre of cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, this factor reviews the uptake of cybersecurity training  and horizontal and vertical cybersecurity knowledge transfer within organisations and how it  translates into continuous skills development.   Provision: This aspects examines the development, availability and provision of cybersecurity  training programmes for enhancing skills and capabilities.   Uptake: This aspect examines the existence of certified employees trained in cybersecurity  issues, processes, planning and analytics through the uptake of cybersecurity training  programmes and knowledge transfer within organisations.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  33  D 3.1: Awareness Raising  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Awareness Raising  Programmes  The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities across all  sectors is not recognised, or  is only at initial stages of  discussion.  Awareness raising  programmes, courses,  seminars and online  resources are available for  target demographics from  public, private, academic,  and/or civil society sources,  but no coordination or  scaling efforts have been  conducted.  Awareness raising  programmes may be  informed by international  initiatives but are not linked  to national strategy.  A national programme for  cybersecurity awareness  raising, led by a designated  organisation (from any  sector) is established, which  addresses a wide range of  demographics and issues,  but no metrics for  effectiveness have been  applied.  Consultation with  stakeholders from various  sectors informs the creation  and utilisation of  programmes and materials.  A single online portal linking  to appropriate cybersecurity  information exists and is  disseminated via that  programme.  The national awareness  raising programme is  coordinated and integrated  with sector-specific, tailored  awareness raising  programmes, such as those  focusing on government,  industry, academia, civil  society, and/or children.  Metrics for effectiveness are  established and evidence of  application and lessons  learnt are fed into future  programmes.  The evolution of the  programme is supported by  the adaptation of existing  materials and resources,  involving clear methods for  obtaining a measure of  suitability and quality.  Programmes contribute  toward expanding and  enhancing international  awareness raising good  practice and capacity- building efforts.  Awareness raising  programmes are adapted in  response to performance  evidenced by monitoring  which results in the  redistribution of resources  and future investments.  Metrics contribute toward  national cybersecurity  strategy revision processes.  Awareness programme  planning gives explicit  consideration to national  demand from the  stakeholder communication  (in the widest sense), so that  campaigns continue to  impact the entire society.  The national awareness  raising programme has a  measurable impact on  reduction of the overall  threat landscape.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  34  D 3.1: Awareness Raising  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Executive Awareness  Raising  Awareness raising on  cybersecurity issues for  executives is limited or non- existent.  Executives are not yet aware  of their responsibilities to  shareholders, clients,  customers, and employees  in relation to cybersecurity.  Executives are made aware  of general cybersecurity  issues, but not how these  issues and threats might  affect their organisation.  Executives of particular  sectors, such as finance and  telecommunications, have  been made aware of  cybersecurity risk in general  and how the organisation  deals with cybersecurity  issues, but not of strategic  implications.  Awareness raising of  executives in the public,  private, academic and civil  society sectors address  cybersecurity risks in  general, some of the  primary methods of attack,  and how the organisation  deals with cyber issues  (usually abdicated to the  CIO).  Select executive members  are made aware of how  cybersecurity risks affect the  strategic decision making of  the organisation,  particularly those in the  financial and  telecommunications sectors.  Awareness raising efforts of  cybersecurity crisis  management at the  executive level is still  reactive in focus.  Executive awareness raising  efforts in nearly all sectors  include the identification of  strategic assets, specific  measures in place to protect  them, and the mechanism  by which they are protected.  Executives are able to alter  strategic decision making,  and allocate specific funding  and people to the various  elements of cyber risk,  contingent on their  company’s prevailing  situation.  Executives are made aware  of what contingency plans  are in place to address  various cyber-based attacks  and their aftermath.  Executive awareness  courses in cybersecurity are  mandatory for nearly all  sectors.  Cybersecurity risks are  considered as an agenda  item at every executive  meeting, and funding and  attention is reallocated to  address those risks.  Executives are regarded  regionally and  internationally as a source  of good practice in  responsible and accountable  corporate cybersecurity  governance.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  35  D 3.2: Framework for Education  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no cybersecurity  educators are available, and  there are no qualification  programmes for educators.  Computer science courses  are offered that may have a  security component, but no  cybersecurity-related  courses are offered.  No accreditation in  cybersecurity education  exists.  Qualification programmes  for cybersecurity educators  are being explored, with a  small cadre of existing  professional educators.  Some educational courses  exist in cybersecurity-  related fields, such as  information security,  network security and  cryptography, but  cybersecurity-specific  courses are not yet offered.  A demand for cybersecurity  education is evidenced  through course enrolment  and feedback.  Qualifications for and supply  of educators are readily  available in cybersecurity.  Specialised courses in  cybersecurity are offered  and accredited at the  university level.  Degrees in cybersecurity-  related fields are offered by  universities.  Universities and other  bodies hold  seminars/lectures on  cybersecurity issues aimed  at non-specialists.  Research and development  is a leading consideration in  cybersecurity education.  Cybersecurity educators are  not only drawn from the  academic environment, but  incentives are in place so  that industry and/or  government experts take  these positions as well.  Accredited cybersecurity  courses are embedded in all  computer science degrees.  Degrees are offered in  cybersecurity specifically,  which encompasses courses  and models in various other  cybersecurity-related fields,  including technical and non-  technical elements such as  policy implications, and  multi-disciplinary education.  Cybersecurity educational  offerings are weighted and  focused based on an  understanding of current  risks and skills requirements.  Cybersecurity education is  not limited to universities,  but ranges from primary to  post-graduate levels,  including vocational  education.  National courses, degrees,  and research are at the  forefront of cybersecurity  education internationally.  Cybersecurity education  programmes maintain a  balance between preserving  core components of the  curriculum and promoting  adaptive processes that  respond to rapid changes in  the cybersecurity  environment.  Prevailing cybersecurity  requirements are  considered in the re-  development of all general  curricula.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  36  D 3.2: Framework for Education  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Administration  The need for enhancing  national cybersecurity  education is not yet  considered.  A network of national  contact points for  governmental, regulatory  bodies, critical industries  and education institutions is  not yet established.  Discussion of how  coordinated management of  cybersecurity education and  research enhances national  knowledge development has  not, or only just begun.  The need for enhancing  cybersecurity education in  schools and universities has  been identified by leading  government, industry, and  academic stakeholders.  Schools, government, and  industry collaborate in an  ad-hoc manner to supply  the resources necessary for  providing cybersecurity  education.  A national budget focused  on cybersecurity education  is not yet established.  Broad consultation across  government, private sector,  academia and civil society  stakeholders informs  cybersecurity education  priorities and is reflected in  national cybersecurity  strategy.  National budget is dedicated  to national cybersecurity  research and laboratories at  universities.  Competitions and initiatives  for students are promoted  by government and/or  industry in order to increase  the attractiveness of  cybersecurity careers.  Metrics are developed to  ensure that educational  investments meet the needs  of the cybersecurity  environment across all  sectors.  Government budget and  spending on cybersecurity  education is managed based  on the national demand.  Leading national  cybersecurity academic  institutions share their  lessons learnt with other  national and international  counterparts.  Government has established  academic centres of  excellence in cybersecurity.  International cybersecurity  centres of excellence are  established through  twinning programmes led by  world class institutions.  Routinized cooperation  between all stakeholders in  cybersecurity education can  be evidenced.  Content in cybersecurity  education programmes is  aligned with practical  cybersecurity problems and  business challenges, and  provides a mechanism for  enhancing curriculum based  on the evolving landscape.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  37  D 3.3: Framework for Professional Training  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no training  programmes in  cybersecurity exist.  The need for training  professionals in  cybersecurity has been  documented at the national  level.  Training for general IT staff  is provided on cybersecurity  issues so that they can react  to incidents as they occur,  but no training for dedicated  security professionals exists.  ICT professional certification  is offered, with some  security modules or  components.  Ad-hoc training courses,  seminars and online  resources are available for  cybersecurity professionals  through public or private  sources, with limited  evidence of take-up.  Structured cybersecurity  training programmes exist  to develop skills towards  building a cadre of  cybersecurity-specific  professionals.  Security professional  certification is offered  across sectors within the  country.  The needs of society are  well understood and a list of  training requirements is  documented.  Training programmes for  non-cybersecurity  professionals are recognised  and initially offered.  A range of cybersecurity  training courses is tailored  toward meeting national  strategic demand and aligns  with international good  practice.  The training programme  outlines the priorities in the  national cybersecurity  strategy.  Training programmes are  offered to cybersecurity  professionals that focus on  the skills necessary to  communicate technically  complex challenges to non- technical audiences, such as  management and general  employees.  Metrics of effectiveness  assess the modes and  procedures of training.  The public and private  sector collaborate to offer  training, constantly adapting  and seeking to build skillsets  drawn from both sectors.  Training offerings  coordinate with education  programmes so that the  foundation established in  schools can enable training  programmes to build a  highly skilled workforce.  Programmes and incentive  structures are in place to  ensure the retention of  trained workforce within the  country.  Uptake  Training uptake by IT  personnel designated to  respond to cybersecurity  incidents is limited or non-  existent.  Metrics evaluating take-up  of ad-hoc training courses,  seminars, online resources,  and certification offerings  exist, but are limited in  scope.  There is no knowledge  transfer from employees  trained in cybersecurity to  untrained employees.  There is an established  cadre of certified employees  trained in cybersecurity  issues, processes, planning  and analytics.  Knowledge transfer from  employees trained in  cybersecurity to untrained  employees is ad hoc.  The uptake of cybersecurity  training is used to inform  future training programmes.  Coordination of training  across all sectors ensures  the national demand for  professionals is met.  Cybersecurity professionals  not only fulfil national  requirements, but domestic  professionals are consulted  internationally to share  lessons learnt and good  practice.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  38  D 3.3: Framework for Professional Training  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Job creation initiatives for  cybersecurity within  organisations are  established and encourage  employers to train staff to  become cybersecurity  professionals.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  39  Dimension 4: Legal and Regulatory Frameworks  This dimension examines the government’s capacity to design and enact national legislation directly  and indirectly relating to cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis placed on the topics of ICT security,  privacy and data protection issues, and other cybercrime-related issues. The capacity to enforce such  laws is examined through law enforcement, prosecution, and court capacities. Moreover, this  dimension observes issues such as formal and informal cooperation frameworks to combat cybercrime.  D 4.1: Legal Frameworks  This factor addresses various legislation and regulation frameworks related to cybersecurity, including:  ICT security legislative frameworks, privacy, freedom of speech, and other human rights online, data  protection, child protection, consumer protection, intellectually property, substantive and procedural  cybercrime legislation.   Legislative Frameworks for ICT Security: This aspect addresses the existence and  implementation of comprehensive ICT security legislative and regulatory frameworks.   Privacy, Freedom of Speech & Other Human Rights Online: This aspect examines to what  extent domestic legislation ensures that human rights are protected online, including privacy,  freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly and association.   Data Protection Legislation: This aspect examines the existence and implementation of  comprehensive data protection legislation.   Child Protection Online: This aspect focuses on the legislative protection of children online,  including the protection of their rights online and the criminalisation of child abuse online.   Consumer Protection Legislation: This aspect addresses the existence and implementation of  legislation protecting consumers online from fraud and other forms of business malpractice.   Intellectual Property Legislation: This aspect is concerned with the existence and  implementation of online intellectual property legislation.   Substantive Cybercrime Legislation: This aspect explores if existing legislation criminalises a  variety of cybercrimes in specific legislation or general criminal law.   Procedural Cybercrime Legislation: This aspect examines whether comprehensive criminal  procedural law with procedural powers for the investigation of cybercrime and evidentiary  requirements to deter, respond to and prosecute cybercrime and crimes involving electronic  evidence is implemented.  D 4.2: Criminal Justice System  This factor studies the capacity of law enforcement to investigate cybercrime, and the prosecution’s  capacity to present cybercrime and electronic evidence cases. Finally, this factor addresses the court  capacity to preside over cybercrime cases and those involving electronic evidence.   Law Enforcement: This aspect examines whether law enforcement have received training on  investigating and managing cybercrime cases and cases involving electronic evidence, and  have sufficient human, procedural and technological resources.   Prosecution: This aspect examines whether prosecutors have received training on handling  cybercrime cases and cases involving electronic evidence, and whether there are sufficient  human, procedural and technological resources.   Courts: This aspect examines whether courts have sufficient resources and training to ensure  effective and efficient prosecution of cybercrime cases and cases involving electronic evidence.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  40  D 4.3: Formal and Informal Cooperation Frameworks to Combat Cybercrime  This factor addresses the existence and functioning of formal and informal mechanisms that enable  cooperation between domestic actors and across borders to deter and combat cybercrime.   Formal Cooperation: This aspect examines the existence and effectivity of formal cooperation  mechanisms to combat cybercrime, both between state actors and across borders, including  mutual legal assistance and extradition procedures.   Informal Cooperation: This aspect examines the existence and effectivity of informal  cooperation mechanisms to combat cybercrime, both domestically and across borders, as well  as within the public sector and between public and private sectors.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  41  D 4.1: Legal Frameworks  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Legislative Framework  for ICT Security  Legislation relating to ICT  security does not yet exist.  Efforts to draw attention to  the need to create a legal  framework on cybersecurity  have been made and may  have resulted in a gap  analysis.  Experienced stakeholders  from all sectors may have  been consulted to support  the establishment of a legal  and regulatory framework.  Key priorities for creating  cybersecurity legal  frameworks have been  identified through multi- stakeholder consultation,  potentially resulting in draft  legislation, but legislation  has not yet been adopted.  Comprehensive ICT  legislative and regulatory  frameworks addressing  cybersecurity have been  adopted.  Laws address the protection  of critical information  infrastructure, e- transactions, liability of  Internet Service Providers  and, potentially, cyber  incident reporting  obligations.  The country reviews existing  legal and regulatory  mechanisms for ICT security,  identifies where gaps and  overlaps exist, and amends  laws accordingly or enacts  new laws.  Monitoring of enforcement  of legislative frameworks  informs resource allocation  and legal reform.  Mechanisms are in place for  continuously harmonising  ICT legal frameworks with  national cybersecurity- related ICT policies,  international law, standards  and good practices.  Participation in the  development of regional or  international cybersecurity  cooperation agreements  and treaties is a priority.  Efforts are in place to  exceed minimal baselines  specified in these treaties  where appropriate.  Privacy, Freedom of  Speech & Other  Human Rights Online  Domestic law does not  recognise fundamental  human rights in relation to  cybercrime.  Discussions of privacy issues  online may have begun and  include multiple  stakeholders, but no privacy  legislation or standards are  in place.  Domestic legislation  partially recognises privacy,  freedom of information,  freedom of assembly and  association, and freedom of  expression online.  Stakeholders from all key  sectors have been consulted  for the development of  legislation addressing  human rights online.  Domestic law recognises  fundamental human rights  on the Internet, including  privacy online, freedom of  speech, freedom of  information, and freedom of  assembly and association.  Domestic law specifies  safeguards to protect the  individual’s right to privacy  during the collection, use  and disclosure of personal  information in investigations  involving electronic  evidence.

In order to meet dynamic  changes in the application of  technology to consumer  protection, procedures are  in place to amend and  update legal frameworks as  needed.  Intellectual Property  Legislation  Intellectual property of  online products and services  might be discussed among  multiple stakeholders, but  no specific legal provisions  are in place.  If general law on intellectual  property exists, it is not  applicable to online  products and services yet.  Legislation on intellectual  property online is under  development, through  consultation with key  stakeholders.  Comprehensive legislation  addressing intellectual  property of online products  and services has been  adopted and is enforced.  Legislation on intellectual  property online is regularly  reviewed and amended  accordingly to reflect  changes in national  priorities and the  international ICT landscape.  Legislative amendments are  informed by multi- stakeholder consultations  and public discourse.  Decisions to update  legislation are based on the  balance between  intellectual property and  open access policies,  through multi-stakeholder  discussion.  Substantive  Cybercrime Legislation  Specific substantive criminal  law on cybercrime does not  exist or general criminal law  exists, but its application to  cybercrime is unclear  Specific substantive criminal  provisions on cybercrime  might be discussed among  lawmakers, but the  development of the  provisions has not yet  commenced.  Partial legislation exists that  addresses some aspects of  cybercrime or cybercrime  legal provisions are under  development.  Substantive cybercrime legal  provisions are contained in  specific legislation or a  general criminal law.  The country has ratified  regional or international  instruments on cybercrime  and consistently seeks to  implement these measures  into domestic law.  Measures are in place to  exceed minimal baselines  specified in international  treaties where appropriate,  which includes procedures  to amend substantive legal  frameworks as needed.  The country is an active  contributor in the global  discourse on developing and  improving international  cybercrime treaties.  Laws, where needed, are  amended to reflect changes  in the international ICT  environment.

If law enforcement officers  receive training on  cybercrime and digital  evidence, it is ad-hoc and  not specialised.  A comprehensive  institutional capacity with  sufficient human,  procedural and  technological resources to  investigate cybercrime cases  has been established.  Digital chain of custody and  evidence integrity is  established including formal  processes, roles and  responsibilities.  Standards for the training of  law enforcement officers on  cybercrime exist and are  implemented.  Resources dedicated to fully  operational cybercrime units  have been allocated based  on strategic decision  making.  Advanced investigative  capabilities allow the  investigation of complex  cybercrime cases, supported  by regular testing and  training of investigators.  Law enforcement agencies  have the resources to  maintain the integrity of  data to meet international  evidential standards in  cross-border investigation.  Statistics and trends on  cybercrime investigations  are collected and analysed.  All law enforcement officers  receive specialised and  continuous training based  on relative responsibilities  and new, evolving threat  landscapes.  Law enforcement can utilise  sophisticated digital forensic  tools, and these  technologies are  consistently updated.  The institutional capacity of  law enforcement is  frequently reviewed and  revised based on an  assessment of effectiveness.  Prosecution  Prosecutors do not receive  adequate training and  resources to review  electronic evidence or  prosecute cybercrime.  There are no specialised  cybercrime prosecutors, but  consultation may have  begun to consider this  capacity within the criminal  justice community.  A limited number of  specialised cybercrime  prosecutors have the  capacity to build a case  based on electronic  evidence, but this capacity is  largely ad-hoc and un- institutionalised.

There is no formal  mechanism that promotes  the exchange of information  between domestic public  and private sectors on  cybercrime and cooperation  is limited.  Formal mechanisms of  international cooperation  have been established, but  the application to  cybercrime is ad-hoc or only  possible in some cases.  Exchange of information on  cybercrime between  domestic public and private  sectors is ad-hoc and  unregulated.  Formal mechanisms of  international cooperation  have been established in  order to prevent and  combat cybercrime by  facilitating their detection,  investigation, and  prosecution.  Mutual legal assistance and  extradition agreements and  mechanisms have been  established and are applied  to cybercrime cases.  Legislative requirements for  the exchange of information  between domestic public  and private sectors have  been determined.  Formal international  cooperation mechanisms  are fully functional, with  established communication  channels.  Strategic decisions are made  to expand and enhance  formal cooperation  mechanisms on cybercrime  as needed.  Resources are allocated to  support the exchange of  information between public  and private sectors  domestically and enhance  legislative requirements and  communication  mechanisms.  Formal international  cooperation mechanisms  are regularly reviewed to  determine effectiveness,  and are revised accordingly  to reflect the changing  cybercrime landscape.  Formal and informal  international cooperation  mechanisms complement  each other and are  interoperable.  Formal mechanisms that  enable the exchange of  information between  domestic public and private  sectors are adapted in  accordance with identified  needs and changing threat  environment.  Informal Cooperation  There is minimal interaction  between government and  criminal justice actors.  Cooperation between  Internet Service Providers  and law enforcement has  not been established.  Law enforcement  cooperation with foreign  counterparts is not  effective.  Exchange of information  between government and  criminal justice actors is  limited and ad-hoc.  Ad-hoc cooperation  between Internet Service  Providers and law  enforcement exists, but is  not always effective.

The dimension specifically examines the  implementation of cybersecurity standards and good practices, the deployment of processes and  controls, and the development of technologies and products in order to reduce cybersecurity risks.  D 5.1: Adherence to Standards  This factor reviews government’s capacity to design, adapt and implement cybersecurity standards  and good practice, especially those related to procurement procedures and software development.   ICT Security Standards: This aspect examines whether cybersecurity related standards and  good practices are being adhered to and adopted widely across the public sector and Critical  Infrastructure (CI) organisations.   Standards in Procurement: This aspect addresses the implementation of standards in  procurement practices.   Standards in Software Development: This aspect addresses the implementation of standards  in software development.  D 5.2: Internet Infrastructure Resilience  This factor addresses the existence of reliable Internet services and infrastructure in the country as well  as rigorous security processes across private and public sectors. Also, this aspect reviews the control  that the government might have on its Internet infrastructure and the extent to which networks and  systems are outsourced.   Internet Infrastructure Resilience: (as above)  D 5.3: Software Quality  This factor examines the quality of software deployment and the functional requirements in public and  private sectors. In addition, this factor reviews the existence and improvement of policies on and  processes for software updates and maintenance based on risk assessments and the criticality of  services.   Software Quality: (as above)  D 5.4: Technical Security Controls  This factor reviews evidence regarding the deployment of technical security controls by users, public  and private sectors and whether the technical cybersecurity control set is based on established  cybersecurity frameworks.   Technical Security Controls: (as above)  D 5.5: Cryptographic Controls  This factor reviews the deployment of cryptographic techniques in all sectors and users for protection  of data at rest or in transit, and the extent to which these cryptographic controls meet international  standards and guidelines and are kept up-to-date.   Cryptographic Controls: (as above)  D 5.6: Cybersecurity Marketplace  This factor addresses the availability and development of competitive cybersecurity technologies and  insurance products.  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  50   Cybersecurity Technologies: This aspect examines whether a national market for  cybersecurity technologies is in place and supported, and informed by national need.   Cyber Insurance: This aspect explores the existence of a market for cyber insurance, its  coverage and products suitable for various organisations.  D 5.7: Responsible Disclosure  This factor explores the establishment of a responsible disclosure framework for the receipt and  dissemination of vulnerability information across sectors and if there is sufficient capacity to  continuously review and update this framework.   Responsible Disclosure: (as above)  Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3657116  51  D 5.1: Adherence to Standards  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  ICT Security Standards  No standards or good  practices have been  identified for use in securing  data, technology or  infrastructure, by the public  and private sectors.  Or, initial identification of  some appropriate standards  and good practices has been  made by the public and  private sectors, possibly  some ad hoc  implementation, but no  concerted endeavour to  implement or change  existing practice in a  measurable way.  Information risk  management standards  have been identified for use  and there have been some  initial signs of promotion  and take-up within public  and private sectors.  There is some evidence of  measurable implementation  and adoption of  international standards and  good practices.  Nationally agreed baseline  of cybersecurity related  standards and good  practices has been  identified, and adopted  widely across public and  private sectors.  Some body within  government exists to assess  level of adoption across  public and private sectors.  Government schemes exist  to promote continued  enhancements, and metrics  are being applied to monitor  compliance.  Consideration is being given  to how standards and good  practices can be used to  address risk within supply  chains within the CI, by both  government and CI.  Government and  organisations promote  adoption of standards and  good practises according to  assessment of national risks  and budgetary choices.  There is evidence of debate  between government and  other stakeholders as to  how national and  organisational resource  decisions should align and  drive standard adoption.  Evidence of contribution to  international standards’  bodies exists and  contributes to thought  leadership and sharing of  experience by organisations.  The choice of adopted  standards and good  practices and their  implementation is  continuously improved.  Adoption of standards and  non-compliance decisions  are made in response to  changing threat  environments and resource  drivers across sectors and CI  through collaborative risk  management.  Evidence exists of debate  within all sectors on  compliance to standards  and good practices, based  on continuous needs  assessments.  Standards in  Procurement  No standards or good  practices have been  identified for use in guiding  procurement processes by  the public and private  sector. If they are  recognised, implementation  is ad hoc and  uncoordinated.  Cybersecurity standards and  good practices guiding  procurement processes  have been identified for use.  Evidence of promotion and  adoption of cybersecurity  standards and good  practices in defining  procurement practices  exists within public sectors  and private sectors.  Procurement practices meet  international IT guidelines,  standards and good  practices.  Adoption and compliance of  standards in procurement  practices within the public  and private sectors, is  evidenced through  measurement and  assessments of process  effectiveness.

Organisations are able to  benchmark the skills of their  procurement professionals  against the competencies  outlined in procurement  standards and identify any  skills and capability gaps.  Internal stakeholders have  been trained in the secure  use of E-sourcing or E- tendering systems and  purchase-to-pay systems  (P2P) in order to implement  these tools in performing  key tasks in procurement  and supply.  Standards in Software  Development  No standards or good  practices for software  development have been  identified for use relating to  integrity and resilience in  public and private sectors.  Or, there is some  identification, but only  limited evidence of take-up.  Core activities and  methodologies for software  development processes  focused on integrity and  resilience are being  discussed within  professional communities.  Government promotes  relevant standards in  software development, but  there is no widespread use  of these standards yet.  Some organisations supply  or seek to adopt standards  in code development.  Government has an  established programme for  promoting and monitoring  standard adoption in  software development –  both for public and  commercial systems.

D 5.2: Internet Infrastructure Resilience  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Internet Infrastructure  Resilience  Affordable and reliable  Internet services and  infrastructure in the country  may have not yet been  established; if they have  been, adoption rates of  those services are a  concern.  There is little or no national  control of network  infrastructure; networks  and systems are  outsourced, with potential  adoption from unreliable  third-party markets.  Limited Internet services  and infrastructure are  available, but may not be  reliable.  Resilience of Internet  infrastructure in public and  private sectors has been  discussed by multiple  stakeholders, but has not  been fully addressed.  There may be regional  support to secure Internet  infrastructure in the  country.  Reliable Internet services  and infrastructure have  been established.  Internet is used for e- commerce and electronic  business transactions;  authentication processes  are established.  Technology and processes  deployed for Internet  infrastructure meet  international IT guidelines,  standards, and good  practices.  National infrastructure is  formally managed, with  documented processes,  roles and responsibilities,  and limited redundancy.  Regular assessment of  processes according to  international standards and  guidelines are conducted  together with assessment of  national information  infrastructure security and  critical services that drive  investment in new  technologies.  Acquisition of infrastructure  technologies is effectively  controlled, with flexibility  incorporated according to  changing market dynamics.  Costs for infrastructure  technologies are continually  assessed and optimised.  There is effectively  controlled acquisition of  critical technologies with  managed strategic planning  and service continuity  processes in place.  Scientific, technical,  industrial and human  capabilities are being  systematically maintained,  enhanced and perpetuated  in order to maintain the  country’s independent  resilience.

A catalogue of secure  software platforms and  applications within the  public and private sectors  does not exist.  Policies and processes  regarding updates of  software applications have  not yet been formulated.  Software quality and  functional requirements in  public and private sectors  are recognised and  identified, but not  necessarily in a strategic  manner.  A catalogue for secure  software platforms and  applications within the  public and private sectors is  under development.  Policies and processes on  software updates and  maintenance are now under  development.  Evidence of software quality  deficiencies is being  gathered and assessed  regarding its impact on  usability and performance.  Software quality and  functional requirements in  public and private sectors  are recognised and  established.  Reliable software  applications that adhere to  international standards and  good practices are being  used widely in the public  and private sectors.  Policies on and processes  for software updates are  established.  Software applications are  characterised as to their  reliability, usability and  performance in adherence  to international standards  and good practices.  Quality of software used in  public and private sectors is  monitored and assessed.  Policies and processes on  software updates and  maintenance are being  improved based on risk  assessments and the  criticality of services.  Benefits to businesses from  additional investment in  ensuring software quality  and maintenance are  measured and assessed.  Software defects are  manageable in a timely  manner and service  continuity is ensured.  Software applications of  high level performance,  reliability and usability are  available, with service  continuity processes fully  automated.  Requirements of software  quality are being  systematically reviewed,  updated, and adapted to  the changing cybersecurity  environment.

Internet Service Providers  (ISPs) may not offer any  upstream controls to their  customers.  Technical security controls  are deployed by users,  public and private sectors,  but inconsistently.  The deployment of up-to- date technical security  controls is promoted in an  ad-hoc manner and all  sectors are being  incentivised to their use.  ISPs may be offering anti- malware software as part of  their services but possibly in  an ad-hoc manner. ISPs  recognise the need to  establish policies for  technical security control  deployment as part of their  services.  Network Introduction  Detection Systems (NIDS)  and Host Intrusion  Detection Systems (HIDS)  are deployed but not  necessarily in a consistent  manner.  Up-to-date technical  security controls, including  patching and backups, are  deployed in all sectors.  Users have an  understanding of the  importance of anti-malware  software and network  firewalls across devices.  Physical security controls  are employed to prevent  unauthorized personnel  from entering computing  facilities.  ISPs establish policies for  technical security control  deployment as part of their  services.  The technical cybersecurity  control set is based on  established cybersecurity  frameworks, such as the  SANS top 20 cybersecurity  controls, the CESG 10 steps  to cybersecurity, or PAS 55.  Penetration of technical  security controls leads to  effective upstream  protection of users and  public/private sectors.  Within the public and  private sectors, technical  security controls are being  kept up-to-date, monitored  for effectiveness and  reviewed on a regular basis.  The public and private  sector have the capacity to  critically assess and upgrade  cybersecurity controls  according to their  appropriateness and  suitability for use.  All sectors have the capacity  to continuously assess the  security controls deployed  for their effectiveness and  suitability according to their  changing needs.  The understanding of the  technical security controls  being deployed extends to  its impact on organisational  operations and budget  allocation.  ISPs supplement technical  security controls with multi  factor authentication, digital  certificates and whitelisting  to ensure prevention of  access of non-trusted sites  or web addresses and  maintain a safe Internet  environment.

Cryptographic controls for  protecting data at rest and  in transit are recognised and  deployed ad-hoc by multiple  stakeholders and within  various sectors.  State of the art tools, such  as SSL or TLS, are deployed  ad-hoc by web service  providers to secure all  communications between  servers and web browsers.  Cryptographic techniques  are available for all sectors  and users for protection of  data at rest or in transit.  There is a broad  understanding of secure  communication services,  such as encrypted/signed  email.  The cryptographic controls  deployed meet international  standards and guidelines  accordingly for each sector  and are kept up-to-date.  State of the art tools, such  as SSL or TLS, are deployed  routinely by web service  providers to secure all  communications between  servers and web browsers.  The public and private  sectors critically assess the  deployment of  cryptographic controls,  according to their objectives  and priorities.  The public and private  sectors have developed  encryption and  cryptographic control  policies based on the  previous assessment, and  regularly review the policies  for effectiveness.  The relevance of  cryptographic controls  deployed for securing data  at rest and data in transit is  continuously assessed  through risk assessments.  The public and private  sector adapt encryption and  cryptographic control  policies based on the  evolution of technological  advancement and changing  threat environment.

The domestic market may  provide non-specialised  cybersecurity products, but  these are not market- driven.  Cybersecurity is considered  in software and  infrastructure development.  Cybersecurity products are  now being produced by  domestic providers in  accordance with market  needs.  National dependence on  foreign cybersecurity  technologies is increasingly  mitigated through enhanced  domestic capacity.  Cybersecurity technology  development abides by  secure coding guidelines,  good practices and adhere  to internationally accepted  standards.  Risk assessments and  market incentives inform  the prioritisation of product  development to mitigate  identified risks.  Security functions in  software and computer  system configurations are  automated in the  development and  deployment of technologies.  Domestic cybersecurity  products are exported to  other nations and are  considered superior  products.  Cyber Insurance  The need for a cyber  insurance market may have  been identified, but no  products and services are  available.  The need for a market in  cyber insurance has been  identified through the  assessment of financial risks  for public and private  sectors, and development of  products is now being  discussed.  A market for cyber  insurance is established and  encourages information  sharing among participants  of the market.  First-party insurance  typically covers damage to  digital assets, business  interruptions and,  potentially, reputational  harm.  Third-party insurance covers  liability and the costs of  forensic investigations,  customer notification, credit  monitoring, public relations,  legal defence,  compensation and  regulatory fines.  Cyber insurance specifies a  variety of coverages to  mitigate consequential  losses. These coverages are  selected based on strategic  planning needs and  identified risk.  Products suitable for SMEs  are also on offer.  The cyber insurance market  is innovative and adapts to  emerging risks, standards  and practices, while  addressing the full scope of  cyber harm.  Insurance premiums are  offered for consistent cyber- secure behaviour.

Technical details of  vulnerabilities are shared  informally with other  stakeholders who can  distribute the information  more broadly.  Software and service  providers are able to  address bug and  vulnerability reports.  A vulnerability disclosure  framework is in place, which  includes a disclosure  deadline, scheduled  resolution, and an  acknowledgement report.  Organisations have  established processes to  receive and disseminate  vulnerability information.  Software and service  providers commit to refrain  from legal action against a  party disclosing information  responsibly.  Responsible disclosure  processes for all involved  stakeholders (product  vendors, customers, security  vendors and public) are set.  An analysis of the technical  details of vulnerabilities is  published and advisory  information is disseminated  according to individual roles  and responsibilities.  The large majority of  products and services are  updated within  predetermined deadlines.  Responsible disclosure  policies are continuously  reviewed and updated  based on the needs of all  affected stakeholders.  Responsible disclosure  frameworks are shared  internationally, so that best  practice in this area can be  created.  All affected products and  services are routinely  updated within deadline.  Processes are in place to  review and reduce  deadlines.

This report follows a number of previous reports published by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA), including Tools and methodologies to support cooperation between  CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017), Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law  enforcement: legal and organisational aspects, Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2017a), An Overview on Enhancing  Technical Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019a) and Roadmap of the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019b).  This report proposes a methodology to analyse the legal and organisational framework, the  roles and duties of CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary, and their required competences, as well as  synergies and potential interferences in their activities related to their responses to cyber  incidents and fight against cybercrime, respectively. In addition, this report aims to present a  detailed analysis focusing on some Member States (MSs) and European Free Trade  Association (EFTA) countries, namely Czechia (1), France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway,  Portugal, Romania and Sweden.  The data for this report were collected via desk research and interviews with subject-matter  experts. The data collected showed, among other things, that:   The communities make efforts to avoid interferences where possible and attempt to  create effective partnerships and take advantage of their synergies to support each  other in the fight against cybercrime; however, some interferences might occur during  incident handling and cybercrime investigations.   There are examples of joint training activities, mainly involving two communities (CSIRTs  and LEAs or LEAs and the judiciary, especially prosecutors) and, more rarely, involving  all three communities, in particular in the form of joint exercises. These joint training  activities help enhance overall the competences required to respond to cybercrime.   There has been no significant impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic on cooperation and interaction between the three communities and their  ability to function. In some instances, interaction among the communities has  increased, with even daily interactions, to ensure that each community is kept up to  date. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, the use of online tools to facilitate  meetings and events has become the norm.  This report, the 2020 handbook and the 2020 toolset on CSIRT and LE (law enforcement)  cooperation (ENISA, 2021) are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows:   The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences  across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and judiciary).   The handbook helps a trainer explain these concepts through scenarios.   The toolset contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  (1) Czechia has been the short-form name for the Czech Republic since 2016.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1.  BACKGROUND OF THE REPORT  This report follows up previous work in the area of Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) and law enforcement (LE) cooperation. With the view of enhancing the response to  cyberattacks and supporting the fight against cybercrime, this report aims to continue to  facilitate cooperation between the CSIRT and the LE communities and the extensions that this  collaboration may have to other communities, especially the judiciary. The ENISA Programming  Document 2020–2022 (ENISA, 2019) includes Objective 4.2 – Community building and  operational cooperation. Under this objective, Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA and other operational communities  anticipates as one of the deliverables a report on a topic emanating from the 2019 report on  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE.  The report presented here originates in particular from one of the recommendations of the 2019  report on cooperation between CSIRTs and LE entitled “An Overview on Enhancing Technical  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE” (ENISA, 2019a), namely:   ‘To promote the use of Segregation (or separation) of Duties (SoD) matrices to avoid  overlapping duties across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary in relation to the sharing  information’ (ENISA, 2019a, p. 35).  An overview and timeline of the previous work carried out by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in the area of CSIRT and LE cooperation is presented in the figure  below (2).  Figure 1: Overview and timeline of previous ENISA work on CSIRT–LE cooperation  (2) All reports and training materials are available on the ENISA website under publications  (www.enisa.europa.eu/publications) and training resources (www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity- specialists/online-training-material).  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  8  This report, the 2020 handbook and the 2020 toolset on CSIRT and LE (law enforcement)  cooperation (ENISA, 2021) are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows:   The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences  across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and judiciary).   The handbook helps a trainer explain these concepts through scenarios.   The toolset contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  1.2.  REPORT OBJECTIVES  The main objectives of this report are to:   propose a methodology to analyse:  - the legal and organisational framework defining the roles and duties (3) of  CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary;  - the required competences (4) of LEAs and CSIRTs, especially national and  governmental CSIRTs;  - synergies and potential interferences in their activities related to their  responses to incidents of a criminal nature and their fight against cybercrime.   present, focusing on some Member States/European Free Trade Association (EFTA)  countries, a detailed analysis of the roles and duties of CSIRTs and LEAs and  required competences, showing synergies and potential interferences in their  activities related to their responses to incidents of a criminal nature and their fight  against cybercrime.  This report is meant to provide a basis for a further, more comprehensive analysis covering  additional Member States and EFTA countries. The methodology proposed could be used, with  some adaptation, for further analysis of candidate countries, potential candidate countries (5)  and neighbouring countries of the EU (6), as well as other countries.  1.3.  REPORT SCOPE  The report focuses on the cooperation of national and governmental (n/g) CSIRTs (7) with LEAs,  although most of the analysis is largely applicable to CSIRTs in general (i.e. other than n/g  CSIRTs).  No specific sector is targeted in this report; the results are applicable to the different levels of  cooperation between the three communities in response to incidents of a criminal nature and in  the fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to energy and from transport to health).  (3) The term ‘duties’, as used here, as well as in the SoD matrix and in other parts of the reports, is synonymous to the  term ‘tasks’.  (4) ‘Competency’ refers to a ‘combination of skills, knowledge, attributes and behaviours that enables an individual to  perform a task’ (IAEA, n.d., p. 5) For more information on competences see also (UN, n.d., p. 6) and (OECD, 2014).  (5) For a list of candidate countries and potential candidate countries see https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-  enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en  (6) For a list of neighbourhood countries see https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-  policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring- countries-eu_en  (7) ‘National/government (n/g) CSIRTs’ refers to teams ‘that serve a country’s government by helping to protect its  critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant  stakeholders at national level. They also bear responsibility for cooperation with other countries’ national and  governmental teams (ENISA, n.d.d)]” (ENISA, 2019c, p. 9).  https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  9  Following the methodology presented in this report (see Chapter 3), an analysis of the roles and  duties, required competences, and synergies and potential interferences has been conducted  and is presented in Chapter 4.  The general geographical scoping of the report is limited to EU/EFTA countries. The analysis  presented in Chapter 4 focuses in particular on:   Czechia;   France;   Germany;   Luxembourg;   Norway;   Portugal;   Romania;   Sweden.  This selection of countries was based on the following criteria:   geographical balance;   balance of different legal systems;   balance in terms of size (area and population) of the countries;   balance in terms of maturity of the CSIRT–LE cooperation.  This report does not seek to provide an exhaustive analysis; rather, it focuses on a small  number of topics affecting cooperation – in particular roles and duties, synergies and possible  overlaps and interferences, required competences – as might be of interest in cross-border  investigations.  In the future, this report is likely to be followed up with an extended version covering additional  countries.  1.4.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience of this report is:   CSIRTs, in particular n/g CSIRTs;   LE (8);   the judiciary (in this report this refers both to prosecutors (9) and to judges (10));   individuals and organisations with an interest in cybersecurity.  Policymakers and lawmakers may also benefit from particular aspects of the analysis presented  in this report as they prepare policies and legislation to enhance cooperation between  operational communities in responding to cyberattacks and fighting cybercrime, including  CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary, in the Member States and in jurisdictions interested in  cooperating with the EU in their transition to and affirmation of the rule of law.  (8) Similarly to previous ENISA reports, law enforcement (LE), law enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police  agencies are used synonymously; see, for instance, (ENISA, 2018).  (9) On the status and role of prosecutors, see (UNODC, 2014).  (10) On judges and principles to ensure their competence, independence and impartiality, see the European Charter on  the Statute for Judges (Council of Europe, 1998).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  10  2. DATA COLLECTION METHODS  This chapter describes the methods used to collect data for this report, starting with the desk  research that was undertaken using publicly available sources such as legislative acts, policy  reports, training programmes and other country-specific material. This is followed by a  description of the interviews that were conducted, which were semi-structured and guided by a  questionnaire, while allowing interviewees to discuss issues and topics pertinent to them and  provide additional information. Finally, a description is provided of the SoD matrix that was used  to collect additional data during the interviews to further support the research.  Qualitative research (11) was conducted for this report. A combination of research methods was  used to collect data for analysing CSIRT, LE and judiciary cooperation, roles and duties,  required competences, synergies and potential interferences in the selected Member  State/EFTA countries, in particular:   desk research;   subject matter expert interviews;   SoD matrix.  Desk research was also conducted to develop the methodology presented in Chapter 3, which  was also used to collect data for the analysis of the eight EU Member States and EFTA  countries presented in Chapter 4 and proposed for expanding the analysis to other countries.  The cut-off date for data collection was 31 August 2020; however, some input received at the  beginning of October 2020 has also been integrated in this report.  2.1.  DESK RESEARCH  Initially, desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources such as  legislative acts, policy reports, training programmes and country-specific sources, including  ENISA publications.  The first findings from this desk research were particularly useful for:   developing the methodology (presented in Chapter 3); and   drafting the questionnaire to support the interviews.  Additional desk research was carried out focused on specific topics considered relevant by the  project team following the analysis of the data collected during the initial desk research and the  interviews. For instance, some additional desk research was conducted on the role of certain  national bodies or joint initiatives mentioned during the interviews.  Desk research was also conducted to collect information on the included countries; the main  sources consulted for each country are listed in Annex A.  Some legal material (EU and national legal acts, but also legislation-related legal assessments,  policies and legal literature) covering areas such as principles of criminal procedure,  (11) Qualitative research is focused on explaining the reasons for people’s behaviour and understanding their opinions  and options while quantitative research aims to quantify attitudes, opinions or other defined variables to generalise  results from a population (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Interviewing is the most common format used for data collection in  qualitative research while the questionnaire is the research instrument that is used most widely for both quantitative  and qualitative approaches.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  11  comparative criminal law and procedure, and European law was consulted. No specific  thorough case law research was conducted on the role of CSIRTs in supporting the fight against  cybercrime; however, from the limited research undertaken, it appears that such case law is  rare and/or not publicly available.  In addition, documents such as the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU and specific country  National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSSs) (12) were reviewed.  Regarding aspects of cooperation and coordination between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, in  addition to previous ENISA reports and projects, some reports by the European Commission,  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union  Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), the Council of Europe and Interpol were  also reviewed.  Academic publications were reviewed focusing on aspects such as the cybersecurity culture of  CSIRTs and their effectiveness, capacity building and international cooperation, as well as  national criminal justice practices.  Several course offerings and training programmes for CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, as well as  joint training initiatives, were reviewed, including, but not limited to, those provided by:   ENISA: ‘Trainings for Cybersecurity Specialists (ENISA, n.d.);   Task Force on Computer Security Incident Response Teams (TF-CSIRT):  ‘TRANSITS training: High-quality training for computer security teams’ (GÉANT,  n.d.);   Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST): ‘Trainings’ (FIRST,  n.d.);   European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL): ‘Education and  training’ (CEPOL, n.d.);   Europol European Cybercrime Centre (EC3): ‘Training and capacity building’  (Europol , n.d.);   European Judicial Training Network (EJTN, n.d.a);   Council of Europe: ‘Cybercrime Programme Office (C-PROC)’ (Council of Europe,  n.d.a);   Academy of European Law (ERA) (ERA, n.d.);   ENFORCE Project (13) (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  Examples of the course offerings and training programmes reviewed are presented in Annex B.  Several different sources were also consulted to collect country-specific information.  The main sources consulted for the drafting of this report are listed in Annex C, grouped  according to the following categories:   legal framework-related material;   policy reports;   ENISA reports in the area of CSIRT and LE cooperation;  (12) The ENISA NCSS Interactive Map lists all of the documents of the NCSSs in the EU, together with their strategic  objectives and good examples of implementation. The map is available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies- interactive-map  (13) ‘ENFORCE is an 18-month European project co-funded by the European Commission in the framework of the  Internal Security Fund – Police.’ The project was concluded in May 2020. ‘The ENFORCE project aims at designing,  setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This curriculum will be  validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g. law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs)  and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together using state-of-the-art training technology. ENFORCE project  is coordinated by CEIS and a partnership between CIRCL, French Ministry of Interior and CEIS’ (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  12   training-related material;   country-specific material;   academic papers;   other material.  The search for policy reports took place from April to June 2020 using the following keywords:  cybercrime, cybersecurity, national cybersecurity strategy, CSIRT, cybercrime legislation,  criminal code, Budapest Convention, law enforcement, prosecutors, judiciary, criminal court,  training, e-evidence.  2.2.  INTERVIEWS  A questionnaire was designed to collect data through semi-structured interviews with experts  from the selected countries.  The questionnaire was developed through several rounds of internal reviews to ensure that it  was appropriate and relevant. The questionnaire was piloted and following the pilot interviews a  few changes, mainly editorial, were made.  The questionnaire was divided into the following sections:   Section 1: General and organisational aspects;   Section 2: Possible synergies and potential interferences;   Section 3: Challenges;   Section 4: Competences and training;   Section 5: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;   Section 6: Certification of forensic tools.   Section 7: Any additional information and comments  The questionnaire consisted of 14 open questions; in one question the interviewees were asked  to fill in a SoD matrix (further details on the SoD matrix are provided in section 2.3). The  interviewees were given the possibility of providing additional input and comments as free text.  The questionnaire was sent to the interviewees before the interviews.  Twenty interviews were conducted. The interviewees were carefully selected to ensure that the  data collected would be as consistent as possible across the different communities (CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary) and countries. One representative each from a CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  from each country was identified, mostly in a top/middle management role and with a good  understanding or experience of cooperation between communities within their own country and  possibly across the EU.  The interviews took place between June and August 2020. Unless the interviewees asked for  an interview in person, the interviews were conducted by telephone. Interviews lasted for  approximately 1 hour. To ensure that the data collected were of the highest quality, two  members of the project team – in most cases at least one ENISA expert and one Call for  Expressions of Interest (CEI) subject matter expert (14) – participated in the interviews and took  detailed notes. After the interviews these detailed notes were sent to the interviewees for  validation.  2.3.  SOD MATRIX  In addition to the desk research and interview questions, a SoD matrix was used to collect data.  The interviewees were sent the matrix, together with the questionnaire, before the interviews.  (14) For more information on CEI Experts see Section 2.4.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  13  During the interview they were asked to identify which actor(s) in their country for each of the  given duties is Responsible, Supporting (if applicable), Informed (if applicable) and Consulted (if  applicable). Some interviewees preferred to fill in the matrix after the interview and send it back  by email.  SoD is a control that is used to ensure compliance with laws and regulations; it is already well  known in financial accounting systems. In particular, regulatory mandates such as the  Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 (US Congress, 2002) and the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act  (GLBA) (US Congress, 1999) introduced the concept of SoD and associated it with information  technology (IT) organisation.  The importance of roles and duties has also been highlighted more recently in the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union,  2016a). The SoD is also presented in the ISO 27001 standard (ISO, n.d.) as one of the potential  controls used for ensuring implementation and operation of information security within the  organisation (control A.6.1.2 from Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard). Conflicting duties and  areas of responsibilities should be segregated to reduce the risk of exposure to unauthorised or  unintentional modification or misuse.  Thus, applying a SoD is a crucial aspect of an effective risk management strategy. In the  context of CSIRT and LE cooperation, the risks that the communities may be exposed to are:   reciprocal interference in the performances of duties;   duplication of efforts because of overlapping duties;   delays during a cybercrime investigation because of improper allocation of duties;  which could lead to:   ineffective management of a cybersecurity incident and/or loss of information  important for the investigation or of electronic evidence to prove the crime.  The SoD approach mandates a separation between actors performing different duties. Detected  conflicts can be better managed as the actors, i.e. the CSIRTs, LE and judiciary, will be aware  of the other communities’ duties.  The SoD approach for the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities was proposed in the 2018  ENISA report Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE: interaction with the judiciary (ENISA,  2018). In 2019, this matrix was developed further and the updated version was published in the  2019 report An overview on enhancing technical cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA,  2019a) and the Roadmap on the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019b).  Indicative examples of completed SoD matrices are provided in the 2019 ENISA Training  material on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA, n.d.c). It should be noted that the content of this  framework was validated by the Member States during the 8th ENISA/EC3 Workshop that took  place in November 2019 (ENISA, n.d.n); the workshop participants provided feedback and their  views have been considered in the version of the SoD matrix presented in this report.  The SoD matrix used to collect data for this report and proposed as a methodology to collect  data on CSIRT and LE cooperation is presented in more detail in Section 3.3. This SoD matrix  is inspired by COBIT (15) methodology, in particular COBIT 5 (ISACA, n.d.), especially by the  (15) COBIT (‘Formerly known as Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT); with this iteration  used only as the acronym’) is ‘a broad and comprehensive I&T governance and management framework and  continues to establish itself as a generally accepted framework for I&T governance’ (ISACA, n.d.). This SoD matrix is  inspired by COBIT 5 (released in 2012); however, it should be noted that there is a newer version of COBIT, COBIT  2019. ‘Earlier versions of COBIT – [including COBIT 5] – focused on IT, whereas COBIT 2019 focuses on  information and technology aimed at the whole enterprise, recognizing that I&T has become crucial in the support,  sustainability and growth of enterprises’. For more information see (ISACA, n.d. a).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  14  ‘RACI’ charts (for more information on RACI charts, see, for instance, (Tomczack, 2014)). In  COBIT 5 methodology the RACI charts are introduced to ensure the correct allocation of tasks  within an organisation, with RACI denoting Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed.  The use of a responsibility assignment matrix such as the RACI charts, which describe  participation in different roles, allows more detailed input than the symbols that have been used  in previous ENISA studies on CSIRT and LE cooperation. Although responsibility assignment  matrices are offered by various frameworks, the role distinction presented in COBIT 5 seemed  to better fit the needs of this project. It should be noted that the COBIT 5 framework was not  implemented in this study; however, the methodology used for collecting data was inspired by  its RACI charts.  In the SoD matrix used to collect data for this report and proposed as a methodology to collect  data on CSIRT–LE cooperation, namely ‘RSCI’, the four possible roles for CSIRTs, LE,  prosecutors and judges concern the performance of duties related to (supporting) cybercrime-  fighting activities: Responsible (R), Supporting (S) (if applicable), Consulted (C) (if applicable),  and informed (I) (if applicable).  Figure 2 depicts the roles that can be assigned to the communities when they perform their  duties, comparing them with those presented in the COBIT 5 RACI charts. The roles that were  used to collect data for this project are highlighted in blue. The new role that replaced  ‘accountable’ in COBIT 5 is highlighted in light blue. It should be noted that when a community  is ‘responsible’ for a specific duty its representatives are also accountable when performing this  duty.  Figure 2: RSCI method used to collect data  The SoD matrix has been converted to a Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) Galaxy  ‘matrix’ format and made available on GitHub, together with some additional documentation (16).  For this project, a JSON file (17) was created that can be easily converted to the data format that  is supported not only by MISP but also by other sharing platforms that are accessible by both  CSIRTs and LE. As mentioned in the 2019 ENISA report on technical cooperation between  CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019a), MISP seems to be the most popular information sharing  platform used by both communities. ‘MISP Galaxy is a simple method used to express a large  object called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or attributes’ (GitHub, n.d.). MISP  Galaxies and Clusters can be added to MISP events and attributes for additional context and  clarification. For instance, they can be used in MISP instances where LEAs/CSIRTs carry out  joint threat research.

CONTRIBUTION BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS  ENISA selected nine external subject matter experts, of whom eight were selected from the List  of Network and Information Security (NIS) Experts compiled following the ENISA CEI (ref.  ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.m).  Of these nine experts, five contributed to this report by supporting data collection (interviews  and desk research) and report drafting; one contributed in particular to the desk research and  the development of the methodology; one acted as the editor and coordinator of the input; and  two reviewed the report over several rounds, including the first draft in April 2020, the  intermediate draft in June 2020 and the final draft in August 2020 (these reviews were in  addition to the reviews by ENISA reviewers and other external reviewers).  All nine contributed on an individual basis by their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime,  including but not limited to technical, legal, organisational and behavioural aspects of CSIRT  and LE cooperation.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  16  3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY  This chapter presents in detail the methodology suggested for the analysis of roles, synergies  and potential interferences between CSIRT, LE and judiciary cooperation in specific countries in  the desk research. This methodology has been piloted and used for the data collection for the  current report and can be used for analysing additional countries.  The description of the desk research is followed by a description of the questionnaire to collect  data via semi-structured interviews. Finally, the SoD matrix is proposed to support and/or  complement the semi-structured interviews.  3.1.  DESK RESEARCH  The desk research aims to collect information on:   roles and duties;   synergies and potential interferences;   required competences.  To collect this information, with a focus on specific countries, the following sources are  proposed to be consulted:   national laws and other legal acts, including but not necessarily limited to:  o constitutions;  o criminal codes;  o criminal procedural codes;  o other laws specific to cybercrime and e-evidence, including laws  implementing relevant EU law (18) and laws implementing the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2003);   NCSSs;   policy documents;   official websites of national and governmental CSIRTs, including their  RFC2350 (19);   official police websites, especially the pages dedicated to fighting cybercrime  activities;   official websites of prosecution offices, especially the pages dedicated to fighting  cybercrime activities;   official websites of criminal courts, especially the pages dedicated to fighting  cybercrime activities;   information dedicated to the different countries on the following portals/web  pages:  o ENISA National Cyber Security Strategies – Interactive Map  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-  map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map);  (18) For an overview of the relevant EU legal framework see (ENISA, 2017a).  (19) An RFC2350 (where ‘RFC’ stands for Request for Comments) provides basic information about a CSIRT, its  channels of communication and its roles and responsibilities. For more details on RFC2350 see (Brownlee &  Guttman, 1998).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  17  o ENISA CSIRTs by Country – Interactive Map  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-  country-interactive-map);  o FIRST members (https://www.first.org/members/map);  o Trusted Introducer (TI) European database of CSIRTs (20)  (https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/index.html);  o Europol website (https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-  agreements/member-states);  o Eurojust website  (http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/about/background/Pages/History.aspx);  o Council of Europe website (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/47-members-  states);  o e-Justice Portal (https://e-justice.europa.eu and https://beta.e-  justice.europa.eu – beta version);  o European Judicial Network (EJN) (https://www.ejn-  crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/Ejn_Home/EN) and in particular the following pages:  o ‘Info about national systems’ (https://www.ejn-  crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/ejn_infoaboutall.aspx);  o ‘e-Evidence’ (https://www.ejn-  crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_DynamicPage/EN/83);   courses and training for CSIRTs, LE, prosecutors and judges, focusing on preventing  and fighting cybercrime.  The desk research aims to collect data on the competences that are needed for CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary to perform their roles and duties related to fighting cybercrime. Special focus  should also be given to training initiatives to facilitate cooperation across the communities.  3.2.  QUESTIONNAIRE  The following questionnaire can be used to support semi-structured interviews to collect data on  roles and duties, required competences, synergies and potential interferences:  Section 1 – Questions on general legal/organisational aspects  1. What is the role of your organisation in fighting cybercrime activities?  2. Does your legal framework support the cooperation between CSIRT/LEA and the  interaction/information flow with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges) in  cybercrime  3. Regarding cybercrime cases, could you briefly describe how information is shared  between CSIRTs – national and governmental in particular – LEAs, prosecutors  and judges?  Segregation of duties (SoD) matrix  4. Referring to the SoD matrix that was sent to you before this interview […], could  you fill it out by identifying for each duty which actor (CSIRT, LE, Prosecutors,  Judges) in your country is:  o Responsible (R): responsible for performing this duty, is the decision-maker  o Supporting (S): providing support when performing this duty (if applicable)  o Consulted (C): consulted during the performance of this duty (if applicable)  o Informed (I): informed when performing this duty? (if applicable)  (20) The Trusted Introducer (TI) maintains the European database of CSIRTs (also known as CERTs) and security  teams.

In your opinion, which are the possible synergies across CSIRT/LE and judiciary  during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have you seen  in reality such synergies taking place? Could you give us an example?  6. In your opinion, which are the potential interferences across CSIRT/LE and  judiciary during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have  you seen in reality such interference taking place? Could you provide an example?  Section 3 – Questions on challenges  7. Are there any specific challenges that you would like to mention about cooperation  across the CSIRT/LE and judiciary communities? If yes, what kind of challenges  (e.g. legal, organisational, technical, cultural)?  8. Are there any challenges that you would like to mention in particular regarding  digital forensics and electronic evidence (e-evidence)?  Section 4 – Questions on competences and training  9. What are the competencies that your organisation/community has and could share  with the other communities (in particular CSIRT with LE/judiciary, LE with CSIRT,  and judiciary with CSIRT)?  10. Which competencies do you feel are lacking/could be improved in your  organisation/community and you might improve by learning from another  community (e.g. CSIRT from LE/judiciary, LE from CSIRT, and judiciary from  CSIRT)?  11. Does your organisation organise and/or participate in joint training across CSIRTs,  LEAs and judiciary (prosecutor and judges) communities? If yes, do you find them  useful?  Section 5 – Question on covid-19 pandemic crisis  12. Has the COVID-19 pandemic crisis changed the way CSIRT/LE/judiciary work  together? If yes, how so? Could you provide an example? (e.g. fewer meetings in  person, but on the other hand more communication via email and over the phone)  Section 6 – Question on cybersecurity certification of forensic tools  13. Do you think that a cybersecurity certification of forensic tools would help the  CSIRT/LE/judiciary cooperation? (e.g. if CSIRTs use certified tools, the LE and  Judiciary might trust more the data provided by CSIRT and use them more easily  as evidence in court)  Section 7 – Question on any additional information or comments  14. Would you like to share any additional information or provide us with any  comment?  The complete questionnaire is presented in Annex E.  3.3.  SOD MATRIX  To complement and support data collection using the desk research and the semi-structured  interviews, the SoD matrix in Table 1 is proposed to be used to collect data on the different  roles  of CSIRT, LE and judiciary, in the different phases of a cybercrime investigation. The  development of this SoD matrix is described in Section 2.3, while a detailed description of the  different roles and guidelines on how to fill in the matrix are provided below.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  19  Table 1: SoD matrix used to collect data by implementing the RSCI method  Version 1.6 of 5 June 2020   Responsible (R): Who is responsible for performing this duty?

Reviewing the response and  updating policies and  procedures  As it was the case for the data collection for this report, the matrix in Table 1 can be sent to  interviewees along with the questionnaire before the interviews.  Some explanations on the matrix are provided below:   At the top of the SoD matrix the four possible roles that each actor (CSIRTs, LE,  prosecutors and judges) may play are listed and explained: Responsible (R),  Supporting (S) (if applicable), Consulted (C) (if applicable), and informed (I) (if  applicable).   In the rows, the duties are listed and numbered for convenience (e.g. 10. Collecting  data that may be evidence/evidence collection). It should be noted that ‘duties’ refers  to the tasks performed by the communities during the cybercrime investigation phases.   Columns 2–5 refer to the key actors throughout the cybercrime investigation life cycle:  CSIRTs, LE, prosecutors and judges.   In this matrix, the interviewees were asked to indicate which role(s) each actor  (CSIRTs, LE, prosecutors, judges) plays in the performance of duties during a  cybercrime (supporting)-fighting activity. In particular, the interviewees were asked to  identify whether the CSIRT, LE, the prosecutor or the judge ‘Responsible’ for a  particular duty and, if applicable, which other actor is responsible for ‘Supporting’ the  performance of that duty, and who is ‘Consulted’ or ‘Informed’ during the performance  of that duty.   Column 6 (optional) is used to capture information on training topics that need to be  covered for the communities to be able to successfully perform their tasks. It should be  noted that the training needs are directly linked to the competences required for the  performance of the specific duties.   Column 7 is used for any additional information an interviewee might provide, with the  aim of recording possible synergies and potential interferences, especially for those  cases where a task is performed by more than one community.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  21  An example of how to fill in the SoD matrix using the RSCI method is presented in Table 2. A  LEA has been asked to indicate the roles that each community plays when ‘collecting data that  may be evidence’.   The LEA is Responsible (R) for evidence collection while the CSIRT is Supporting (S)  this cybercrime-fighting activity, as it also collects evidence that may be useful for LE.   The prosecutor may be Consulted (C) and Informed (I) during the evidence collection  phase to provide guidance on the types of data that need to be collected and to  confirm if these data are admissible in criminal proceedings. Judges do not participate  in this activity.  Table 2: Example of completed information related to one duty in the SoD matrix   Responsible (R): Who is responsible for performing this duty?

COUNTRY FOCUS  This chapter presents the analysis of the data collected using the methodology outlined in  Chapter 3 for the following MSs/EFTA countries:   Czechia;   France;   Germany;   Luxembourg;   Norway;   Portugal;   Romania;   Sweden.  For each country, first, an analysis of the roles and duties of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary is  provided. This is followed by a description of synergies and potential interferences. Finally,  some examples of existing training programmes are provided.  The country profile analysis was based on desk research and interviews with CSIRTs, LE and  some judiciary representatives. Contributions from the interviewees are acknowledged in the  report. However, the following points should be noted:   For consistency, the names of those interviewed are not provided, as some  interviewees requested not to be named in the report.   Interviewees provided their contributions based on their knowledge and expertise and  were not acting as representatives of their country.  In each country section, a subsection is dedicated to the ‘roles and duties’ of competent  authorities and departments that perform duties related to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  The tables of competent authorities and departments provided are not exhaustive but rather aim  to present the reader with a quick overview. Additional information on the authorities and  departments and their roles and duties can be found in the subsections that follow these tables.  It should be noted that each country has its own organisations in terms of CSIRTs, including  national and governmental CSIRTs (as well as other CSIRTs), and also LE and judiciary  authorities.  4.1.  CZECHIA  Czechia is a ‘parliamentary republic with a head of government, the prime minister – and a head  of state, the president. The country is divided into 14 regions, including the capital, Prague’  (European Union, n.d.a).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Czechia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Czech legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  In 2014 Czechia adopted its NCSS for 2015–2020 (NBÚ, 2015) (ENISA, n.d.e)). Cybersecurity  has been regulated by the Cyber Security Act since 2014 (NCKB, 2014). The Cyber Security  Act regulates the rights and obligations of persons, as well as the powers and competences of  public authorities, in the field of cybersecurity. It also implements relevant EU provisions  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  23  (transposing, for example, the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council, 2016)) and  regulates the security requirements for electronic communications networks and information  systems.  4.1.1.  Roles and duties  In Czechia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber and Information Security  Agency (NCISA)  Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační  bezpečnost  NÚKIB  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Národní centrum kybernetické bezpečnosti  NCKB  GovCert.CZ: Government CERT of the  Czech Republic  GovCERT.CZ: Vládní CERT České republiky GovCERT.CZ  National CSIRT of the Czech Republic Národní CSIRT České republiky CSIRT.CZ  Police of the Czech Republic – National  Centre Against Organized Crime – Unit of  Special Activities  Národní centrála proti organizovanému zločinu  – Útvar zvláštních činností  NCOZ – ÚZČ  Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Offices and  Judges  Nejvyšší státní zastupitelství České republiky  4.1.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) is responsible for the  implementation of the NCSS in Czechia. It is ‘the central administrative body for cyber security,  including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication  systems and cryptographic protection’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). It can also act as an ‘expert’ on  cybersecurity issues for LE and provide technical help in criminal investigations. NCISA  ‘operate[s] the government security team, the so-called Government CERT of the Czech  Republic (GovCERT.CZ)’ (NÚKIB, n.d. a). It also engages in dialogue with the other EU  Member States. NCISA cooperates with other national and foreign CSIRTs, supports education  and research and development in the field of cybersecurity, performs security audits and  exercises, and engages in international cooperation and policy work. It also offers legal and  policy support in the field of cybersecurity to other governmental bodies and their CSIRTs.  4.1.1.2. CSIRTs  In Czechia, there are officially two nationwide CSIRT teams recognized by the Cyber Security  Act: the governmental CERT (GovCERT.CZ) and a national CSIRT (CSIRT.CZ).  GovCERT.CZ is a public entity operated by the executive section of NCISA. GovCERT.CZ’s  ‘goal is to help [the critical information infrastructure and the state bodies] to effectively face  security challenges, react on the incidents, coordinate actions to solve them and effectively  prevent them’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). Its ‘constituency are public sector institutions and critical  information infrastructure of the Czech Republic’ (NCBK, 2015, p. 8). Operators of these  infrastructures are required by law to report cybersecurity incidents to NCISA. GovCERT.CZ is  therefore responsible for the evaluation of, and coordination of the response to, severe incidents  and the sharing of relevant information about incidents or threats with relevant authorities,  operators of relevant infrastructures and the public. GovCERT.CZ/NCISA may require regulated  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  24  entities to implement reactive or preventive measures in reaction to specific cybersecurity  incidents and threats.  CSIRT.CZ is a private entity operated by the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC on the basis of a  public contract arranged with NCISA. CSIRT.CZ fulfils the role of a national CSIRT, as defined  in the Cyber Security Act. It collects mandatory reports of cybersecurity incidents from operators  of important networks and digital services, coordinates the response to them and shares data  and information with GovCERT.CZ.  There are three main reasons why there are two nationwide CSIRTs in Czechia. The first  reason is because of the principle of the minimisation of state intervention – it is not necessary  for the state to strictly regulate all operators of information infrastructures; therefore,  GovCERT.CZ deals only with the most important infrastructures in terms of national security  and provides other infrastructures with the opportunity to cooperate through the national CSIRT.  The second reason is that private infrastructure operators are more willing to cooperate with  another private entity than with the state; therefore, a greater intensity and scope of cooperation  between the infrastructure operators and the private national CSIRT is expected. The third  reason is that a public institution can do only what the law expressly allows, whereas the private  national CSIRT can be much more creative in coordinating and organising the response to  cybersecurity incidents, as it can act praeter legem and can do anything that the law does not  explicitly prohibit it from doing (Government of the Czech Republic, 2020).  4.1.1.3. LE  The National Centre against Organized Crime (Národní centrála proti organizovanému  zločinu – NCOZ) was established in 2016 by merging the Organized Crime Detection Unit  (Útvar pro odhalování organizovaného zločinu – ÚOOZ) and the Corruption and Financial Crime  Detection Unit (Útvar pro odhalování korupce a finanční criminality – ÚOKFK). It currently plays  a key role in the fight against cybercrime in Czechia. As a central body, it specialises in the fight  against organised and large-scale cybercrime and cybercrime against critical and important  information infrastructures. NCOZ also plays a coordinating role and a role in the preparation of  standard and recommended procedures for cybercrime investigations.  The Unit of Special Activities (Útvar zvláštních činností – ÚZČ) of the Police of the Czech  Republic intercepts and records telecommunication traffic, conducts surveillance of persons and  objects, and collects digital evidence and carries out other specialised actions aimed at securing  such evidence.  At the regional level there are information crime units at each of the regional criminal police  directorates. These units include specialists and have technical equipment for investigating  cybercrime and securing electronic evidence. They conduct investigations and provide support  and technical equipment in cybercrime investigations to lower organisational units.  4.1.1.4. Judiciary  ‘The Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Czech Republic is the competent central  authority in the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings whereas the Ministry of Justice of Czechia  is the competent central authority for the trial stage of criminal proceedings and when the  execution of sentences is concerned’ (Council of Europe, n.d.b).  A network of prosecutors specialising in cybercrime has been formally established at the  national level (Council of the European Union, 2017).  At the level of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and courts, an informal expert group has been set  up at the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, which focuses on computer crime.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  25  Judges in Czechia are independent in the performance of their duties and there is no  specialisation of judges in criminal chambers. Cases are therefore assigned to judges according  to a random key and it is up to each judge to educate themselves on the issue at hand.  However, because of the increasing number of cybercrime cases, as well as cases in which  familiarisation with the issue of electronic evidence is necessary, there is an increased interest  in this area on the part of the judges. There is also a clear effort on the part of prosecutors and  the police to provide relevant information on the context of, and to explain the technical details  of, cases, including in cooperation with CSIRTs, academia and other members of the  professional public.  Czechia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.1.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As in most countries, useful synergies and also at the same time reciptocal potential  interferences in the activities of individual communities can be identified. In general,  representatives of these communities agreed that, if the activities of individual communities are  coordinated, they are significantly more effective. In such cases, individual communities can  support each other and share specific competences, powers, knowledge, information and  equipment.  Over the last few years, many steps have been taken to strengthen the effectiveness of  intercommunity cooperation. The Cyber Security Act has been adopted, regulating the  obligation to provide information and formulating the powers of NCISA and national and  governmental CSIRTs; a memorandum was concluded between NCISA and the police; the  position of liaison officer to enable police and CSIRT coordination was established; and  cooperation mechanisms have been set up and implemented. These steps have led to many  synergistic effects. In particular, they enable the immediate and effective bilateral transfer of  information on threats and incidents between LE and CSIRTs, the mutual use of professional  and technical capabilities of individual communities, mutual assistance in actions to fulfil  relevant obligations, and cooperation with other communities. One synergistic effect specifically  identified during the interviews is that CSIRTs share with LE information obtained from a  constituency or cooperating alliances that would otherwise be unavailable to LE. However,  although these synergies are particularly evident between CSIRTs and LE, they are relatively  new in the case of the judiciary.  There are also some interferences that may occur between the communities. According to the  interviewees the most important potential interference relates to the collection of digital  evidence and stems from the differences between the goals and approaches of the different  communities. Activities of CSIRTs focused on the mitigation of cyber incidents may seriously  hinder collection of the evidence necessary for a criminal investigation, or even destroy it or  render it inadmissible at court. In addition, one of the limitations of cooperation identified during  the interviews is the effort made by CSIRTs to maintain trust within their constituencies.  Although CSIRTs recommend that victims of cybercrime report incidents to and cooperate with  LEAs, they sometimes refuse to do so for different reasons. In such cases CSIRTs are  discouraged from sharing information about relevant incidents with LE because they fear a loss  of trust on the part of their constituency. Another limitation identified is the lack of  understanding, specifically between CSIRT and LE community technical experts and the  judiciary.  During the interviews, the following recommendations were formulated by the interviewees:   provide more coordination of activities – through training, more precise legal and  procedural regulation and cooperation mechanisms;   provide transparent information-sharing mechanisms;  INTERCOMMUNITY  COOPERATION  Cooperation  mechanisms have  been set up and  implemented  [enabling] immediate  and effective bilateral  transfer of information  on threats and  incidents between LE  and CSIRTs.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  26   strengthen cooperation with the judiciary (CSIRT–LE cooperation is mostly already  in place);   provide better descriptions of individual groups/units, so that everyone knows who  to contact and when;   implement sustainable and trustworthy cooperation routines for all the institutions  involved;   involve all of the communities in training; the training should be focused on the  ability to rapidly share information between all communities.  4.1.3. Examples of training  The Action Plan of the Cyber Security Strategy of Czechia (NCKB) considers promoting the  development of Czechia’s police capabilities with regard to cybercrime. It mainly aims to:   reinforce the personnel of individual police cybercrime departments;   modernise the technological equipment of specialised police departments;   develop cooperation with foreign counterparts;   provide professional education and training to police specialists, including  language training.  The Conception of the Development of Capabilities of the Police of Czechia to Investigate  Cybercrime was drafted by the Police Presidium of Czechia and adopted by the National  Security Council in October 2015 (Council of the European Union, 2017).  Actions aimed at the prevention and public awareness of cybercrime are carried out by several  authorities within Czechia, such as the National Cyber Security Centre, LEAs, the private sector,  academia and non-governmental organisations.  The National Cybersecurity Competence Centre (NC3) (National Cybersecurity Competence  Centre , n.d.) at Masaryk University, Brno (Masaryk University , n.d.), has developed a special  tool, KYPO (Kybernetický polygon), which is a cyber range platform (KYPO, n.d.), and built a  laboratory that is used to organise cybersecurity exercises. These consist of large-scale  exercises held two to four times a year, with smaller exercises taking place a couple of times a  month, and are offered to public authorities, businesses and education providers. NC3 offers  training to judicial and police academies, investigators and public prosecutors. NCISA, in  cooperation with NC3, also organises the annual Cyber Czech exercise using KYPO and its  laboratory (21).  Law enforcement and judicial authorities are provided with professional training on cybercrime.  The aim is to establish standard practices and knowledge for the detection and investigation of  cybercrime, with the main focus being to secure digital traces and evidence. Certain educational  activities on dealing with cybercrime also take place at Secondary Police Schools of the Ministry  of the Interior. Participation in national and international exercises in the field of cybersecurity,  organised by GovCERT.CZ, also serve as professional training.  The Police Academy (The Police Academy of the Czech Republic, n.d.) also takes cybercrime  into account in its lifelong training for officers. These training activities are organised with  CEPOL and many of the courses are the result of the EMPACT initiatives (Europol, n.d.d).  The Judicial Academy (The Judicial Academy, n.d.) organises training activities for LE and  prosecutors on cybercrime and electronic evidence in cooperation with the Police Academy.  (21) This is the main cybersecurity exercise organised by Czechia – it is focused mainly on technical issues, but also  deals with cooperation, legal and organisational issues. It involves the simulation of cooperation between CSIRTs,  the police, the media, data protection authorities, users, other infrastructure operators, etc. For more information see  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech.  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  27  Finally, tabletop exercises take place between CSIRTs and LE and help to improve  communication.  4.2.  FRANCE  France is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, appointed  by the president who is the directly elected head of state. France’s territory consists of 18  administrative regions – 13 metropolitan (i.e. European France) and 5 overseas regions’  (European Union, n.d.f).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in France is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant French legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  France adopted its updated NCSS in 2015 (ANSSI, n.d.) (ENISA, n.d.h). ‘An initial cybersecurity  strategy was developed in France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011’ (Prime  Minister of France, 2015, p. 7).  4.2.1. Roles and duties  In France, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.

National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité  des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is responsible for implementing the NCSS in France. ‘The  role of ANSSI is to foster a coordinated, ambitious, pro-active response to cybersecurity issues  in France, to drive raising-awareness actions, as well as to spread French vision and expertise,  and European values, abroad’ (ANSSI, n.d. a).  4.2.1.2. CSIRTs  France has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT-FR (French government CERT,  Centre gouvernemental de veille, d’alerte et de réponse aux attaques informatiques).  CERT-FR is part of ANSSI. ‘Its mission is to coordinate and investigate IT security incident  response for the French government, critical national infrastructure operators and operators of  essential services as defined by the French law.  CERT-FR’s missions cover prevention, detection, response and recovery by:   Helping to prevent security incidents by setting up necessary protection measures;   Detecting vulnerabilities on networks and systems;   Managing incident response, with the support of trusted partners if necessary;   Organizing trusted networks of CSIRT’ (ANSSI, 2018).  As a national CSIRT it is the preferred international contact point for any cyber-related incident  affecting France. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week..  CERT-FR is a member of well-known networks of CSIRTs such as the CSIRTs Network, the  FIRST and it participates in the TF-CSIRT activities. CERT-FR also creates a French initiative to  structure the national incident response ecosystem called InterCERT-FR. As part of ANSSI,  CERT-FR also work closely with the CyCLONe’s officers.  CSIRT of the Judicial Police (CSIRT Police Judiciaire – CSIRT-PJ) is the CSIRT of the Central  Directorate of the Judicial Police, operating under the Cybercrime Centre (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.).  CSIRT-PJ aims to provide LE with CSIRT-like services: incident response, threat intelligence,  and malware analysis tooling. It is a member of TF-CSIRT (listed) and belongs to the French  CSIRT community called InterCERT-FR.  4.2.1.3. LE  The National Police (Police nationale) has the principal mission of fighting against any form of  criminality and delinquency including cybercrime. One of the directorates of the National Police  is the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (Direction centrale de la police judiciaire –  DCPJ), which performs investigative tasks and supports the prosecution service in cybercrime  cases. Within the DCPJ, a sub-directorate for ICT-related offences has been established for the  fight against cybercrime (Sous-direction de lutte contre la cybercriminalité – SDLC), which  includes the Central Office for Combating Information and Communication Technology Crime  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  29  (Office Central de lutte contre la Criminalité liée aux Technologies de l’iInformation et de la  Communication – OCLCTIC) (22), a cyber-intelligence unit.  The National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) is a branch of the French Armed Forces  that is placed, as far as its civilian role goes, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.  The Central Criminal Intelligence Service of the National Gendarmerie (Service central de  renseignement criminel de la Gendarmerie nationale – SCRCGN) is responsible for providing  information and a precise understanding of organised and mass crime, to guide actions in the  fight against crime in the pre-judicial and judicial phases. In parallel, within the SCRCGN, the  Centre for the Fight against Digital Crimes (Centre de lutte contre les criminalités numériques –  C3N) aims to conduct or coordinate investigations of national scope relating to cybercrime, and  to carry out permanent surveillance of the internet, to detect and collect evidence of any  offences that may be committed there.  Under the structure of the Paris Police Prefecture (Préfecture de police), the Cybercrime Unit  (Brigade de lutte contre la cybercriminalité – BL2C) is assigned with cybercrime investigation  tasks, in the capacity of judicial police (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.).  The Directorate-General for Internal Security (Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure –  DGSI), among other duties, has jurisdiction over investigations into cyberattacks with a national  security component. More precisely, the DGSI has exclusive judicial competence to carry out  cybercrime investigations related to attacks against critical infrastructure, national institutional  networks and operators of essential services (Ministère de l'Interieur, 2019).  4.2.1.4. Judiciary  The French judicial system consists of ordinary courts, which include the criminal courts, and  administrative courts. The Court of Cassation (Cour de Cassation) is the supreme court in the  French judicial system of ordinary courts. The public prosecutor is the authority exercising  prosecution tasks, referring cases to the ‘investigative judge’ (juge d’instruction) and overseeing  the criminal investigation process and the judicial police (European Union, n.d.g) (Ministère de  la Justice, 2012).  Within the public prosecutor’s offices, ‘an internal organisation has been set up to include a  “specialist judge” (magistrat référent) for cybercrime, who can provide technical support to  colleagues involved in cybercrime cases’ (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The Prosecutor of Paris now has national jurisdiction for cybercrime cases. As was highlighted  during one of the interviews, the prosecutor can evoke any case on national territory. This  approach provides better management of expertise as judges are specialised and handle a  great number of cases. The Prosecutor of Paris has a cell of three magistrates who specialise in  cybercrime.  One of the interviewees reported that the Mission against Cybercrime was established in 2015  within the French Ministry of Justice. This mission has a more strategic role. The following  information emerged in this interview: ‘The tasks undertaken are not at an operational level but  directly at the ministry level, to analyse the phenomenon, represent the ministry and provide  official guidelines to handle relevant cases. An example of its work is to issue official guidelines  for Prosecutors to treat and prosecute some cases, such as a document to centralize judicial  treatment of ransomware. Public policy on the fight against cybercrime is elaborated at the level  of this Mission to support the judiciary.’  (22) The SLDC responds to the need to develop a global policy to combat cybercrime. It defines the strategies to be  implemented in the operational, training and prevention areas for the general public and the financial sector.  Strategic coordination of SDLC activities is handled by the OCLCTIC.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  30  France cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.2.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from the interviews ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR and FR law enforcement perimeters and  mandates are complementary. As part of the national authority on cybersecurity, ANSSI/CERT-  FR has the expertise on many cyber-related topics.’ ANSSI/CERT-FR helps both LE and the  judiciary ‘by sharing […] expertise in cybersecurity and […] knowledge on threats’. As was  stated during one of the interviews, ‘There are different directions [of interaction] between  CSIRTs and LE but also the judiciary from the administrative and the operational side. ANSSI  […], according to French law, […is] a public agency [and] has the obligation to inform the  competent authorities in the event of a suspicious criminal case’. Therefore, ANSSI informs the  Prosecutor Office when it becomes aware of a crime. On the other hand, the prosecutors can  also ask for ‘help from ANSSI (e.g. on particular infrastructure data and on modus operandi), but  this is still quite rare. There are [indeed] rather few cases […where] the judiciary has initiated a  contact with the CSIRTs to handle a case.’  Usually, ANSSI is informed of an attack on its constituency (critical infrastructure operators)  directly or the victim files a complaint to LE. ANSSI teams collect evidence in a legally sound  manner and begin remediation. LE then receives and processes the evidence and conducts its  analysis (on network logs, for example). The objective of LE is different from that of ANSSI:  ANSSI is looking for every details of intrusion while LE is looking for identification information.  Thus, ANSSI is able to suggest efficient remediation actions to the victim. In addition, as the  interviewees noted, ‘a liaison officer has been appointed between the ANSSI/CERT-FR and the  Ministry of [the] Interior and a dedicated process has been set up to share information on  incidents that are reported to ANSSI and are relevant for [French] LE entities’.  Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, restrictions on information sharing may occur, such  as ‘when an investigation is launched on a […] case [that is under judicial examination]’. In such  cases, ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR has to follow strict rules on information sharing with its other partners  in order to respect the confidentiality of investigations’. Eventually, ANSSI may request  authorisation from the judiciary for information sharing with other members of the CNW for  prevention purposes; a known C2 IP can help other CSIRTs protect their constituency. As  emerged from the interviews, the information-sharing process with international partners could  therefore be delayed in some cases. As ‘threats are international but the law enforcement  administration is national’, the main challenge identified is to address these delays.  Furthermore, as one of the interviewees highlighted, another challenge that may arise is to have  the victim ‘file a legal complaint, in order to allow LE to take over before [launching the]  remediation actions that could potentially alter the evidence’.  To better understand each other’s work, some public prosecutor’s offices have regular formal  meetings with specialised police investigation services. In addition, such meetings help to clarify  which investigative tasks can be requested of local police to avoid overloading the specialised  services. Indeed, the communities are committed to a ‘continuous improvement of the close  relations’ that they have established.  In addition, under the framework of the French cyber defence strategy entitled “La Revue  stratégique de cyberdéfense”, a public–private initiative was launched in 2017 to raise  awareness of the risks of cyberattacks to society and to support the victims of such attacks. The  initiative is handled by the Public Interest Group for Action against Malicious Cyber Activities (Le  Groupement d’Intérêt Public Action contre la Cybermalveillance (GIP ACYMA). The state actors  involved are ANSSI, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy  and Finance and the Secretary of State in charge of the digital sector. Civil society is also  represented in this Public Interest Group through consumer associations or victim support  entities, as well as trade and labour unions. This public–private initiative also handles the online  cybersecurity platform Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, which was put in place to guide individuals,  EXAMPLE OF  SYNERGY –  THE CSIRT-PJ  The CSIRT Police  Judiciaire is part of  French LE. It  supports  investigations into  cybercrime. As full  member of the  CSIRT community, it  is a privileged actor  in terms of  cooperation and  information  exchange.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  31  small businesses and local authorities in taking preventive steps against cyberattacks and  addressing malicious events once they occur (Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, 2019).  4.2.3. Examples of training  ANSSI offers free cybersecurity training to public organisations, among them LEAs, covering a  wide variety of topics and expertise levels. A lot of the training addresses basic security for end  users, as well as system administrators. It also deals with a wide range of advanced topics such  as security audits, network security, security certificate management and implementation of  cybersecurity certification. Finally, it provides training on very specialised topics such as radio  security against TEMPEST attacks.  As discussed during the interviews, the communities could benefit from joint training, as this  would ‘be useful to help strengthen the relationship between the CERT-FR/ANSSI and the LE  [and] judiciary [communities]’. Moreover, the communities could benefit from learning more  about each other’s counterparts in the ‘international cooperation process, [the] mechanisms and  [the] main players [involved]’ to overcome the difficulties that occur in identifying competent  actors and the actions to be expected.  Trainees at police, gendarmerie and judicial academies receive basic training on cybercrime.  These courses are often complemented by conferences or scientific and technical police  workshops.  The OCLCTIC of the National Police organises on an annual basis a training course for French  judges and investigators entitled ‘Approach to cybercrime’, focusing on legal aspects related to  cybercrime and the special investigation techniques. It also organises a ‘first responder’ training  course aimed at police officers who have to carry out basic cybercrime-related investigative  procedures (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The BL2C, part of the Paris Police Prefecture, participates in private sector training and  provides two approved training courses to the judiciary and customs officers on digital police  investigations.  The Information Systems Security Training Centre (CFSSI) is the main point of contact for  ANSSI for the training of various agencies. It is also involved in the definition and  implementation of the training policy.  CECyF, also called F-CCENTRE, is the French Expert Centre against Cybercrime. CECyF  started in the context of the European project 2Centre (Cybercrime Centres of Excellence  Network for Training Research and Education). CECyF provides support to LE researchers from  both academia and the private sector and educational institutions to create projects that  contribute to training, education and research on cybercrime (CECyF, n.d.).  Finally, the French National School for the Judiciary (Ecole nationale de la magistrature – ENM)  provides multidisciplinary training to French and foreign judges, police officers, gendarmerie and  customs officers on recent legislative developments, as well as specific aspects of digital  investigations and the judicial handling of cybercrime.  4.3.  GERMANY  Germany is ‘a federal, parliamentary republic, with a head of government, the chancellor, and a  head of state, the president, whose primary responsibilities are representative. The country  comprises of sixteen federal States (Länder), which each have their own constitution and are  largely autonomous regarding their internal organisation’ (European Union, n.d.c.). Power is  distributed between the federal and the state governments. Considering the state structure in  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  32  the country, preventing and responding to cybercrime require close cooperation at the federal  and Länder levels.  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Germany is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant German legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Germany adopted its NCSS initially in 2011 (BMI, 2011); this was updated in 2016 (ENISA,  n.d.f).  4.3.1. Roles and duties  In Germany, the following authorities and departments in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name  in the original language  (if applicable)  Federal Office for Information Security  Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik  BSI  - CERT-Bund (part of BSI) CERT-Bund CERT-Bund  National Cyber Response Centre Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum Cyber-AZ  Federal Criminal Police Office Bundeskriminalamt BKA  - Division CC – Cybercrime Abteilung ‘Cyber­crime’  CC  Federal Police Bundespolizei BPOL  Criminal police offices of the federal states  (Länder)  Landeskriminalämter LKAs  The Federal Public Prosecutor General and the  Federal Court of Justice  Der Generalbundesanwalt beim  Bundesgerichtshof and  Bundesgerichtshof  GBA and BGH  Public Prosecutor’s Offices and Courts of the  federal states (Länder)  Die Staatsanwaltschaften der Länder and  Landgerichte  Individual per federal state  4.3.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik  – BSI) is the federal cybersecurity authority that ‘shapes information security in digitization  through prevention, detection and reaction for government, business and society’ (BSI, n.d.). Its  ‘goal […] is to promote IT security in Germany. The BSI is first and foremost the central IT  security service provider for the federal government in Germany’ (BSI, n.d.). CERT-Bund is part  of the BSI. The mandate and competences of the BSI are provided by the Act on the Federal  Office for Information Security of 2009, last amended on 2017 (BSI, 2017).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  33  The National Cyber Response Centre (Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum – Cyber-AZ) has been  set up to ‘optimize operational cooperation between all state authorities and improve the  coordination of protection and response measures’. Different governmental agencies are part of  this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK, BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND). ‘Cooperation in the  National Cyber Response Centre […] strictly observe[s] the statutory tasks and powers of all  authorities involved on the basis of cooperation agreements.’  4.3.1.2. CSIRTs  As mentioned, CERT-Bund is part of the BSI. CERT-Bund is the national CSIRT and ‘acts as  the central point of contact regarding IT-security incidents concerning the German government.  In addition it provides services to critical infrastructure, industry and SME [small and medium-  sized enterprises] as well as citizens. Germany’s national IT Situation Centre and the national  Cyber Response Centre are supported by CERT-Bund’ (BSI, n.d. a). CERT-Bund is therefore  responsible for a large constituency and handling IT security incidents related to government  institutions, federal authorities, critical infrastructures and organisations.  The services that CERT-Bund offers are:   ‘24-hour on-call duty in cooperation with the IT Situation Centre;   analysis of incoming incident reports;   creation of recommendations derived from incidents;   support during IT security incidents;   operation of a warning and information service;   active alerting of the Federal Administration in case of imminent danger’ (CERT-Bund,  n.d.).  CERT-BPOL (23) is part of the Federal Police (Bundespolizei). ‘After an attack in 2017, the  CERT-BPOL was founded as the cyber attack analysis and defense center and has been  reinforced continually ever since. The team comprises IT security staff from the Federal Police.  The team consists of IT experts from the Federal Police supported by experts from industry and  science. In order to detect and investigate incidents in the German Federal Police infrastructure,  intrusion prevention systems are operated and infrastructure vulnerabilities are identified by  CERT-BPOL. Liaison officers from CERT-BPOL represent the Federal Police Headquarters at  the […] Cyber-AZ’ (Bundespolizei, 2017).  4.3.1.3. LE  As of 1 April 2020, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt - BKA, n.d.)  includes a separate division dealing with cybercrime, named Division CC – Cybercrime  (Abteilung ‘Cyber­crime’). This division emerged from the Cybercrime and Information and  Communication Crime (ICT) group of the Serious and Organised Crime (SO) Department.  The main tasks of the Division CC – Cybercrime are to investigate cybercriminals and provide  support to other departments, analyse information, protect federal institutions and critical  infrastructures against cyberattacks and provide training to non-specialist employees of the  BKA, as well as provide advice on relevant legal provisions (BKA-CC, n.d.).  The BKA is in communication with prosecutors and judges. The BSI has appointed a CSIRT-LE  liaison officer to the BKA.  (23) CERT-BPOL is listed in the ENISA inventory: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-  inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  34  The German Federal Police is a (primarily) uniformed federal police force (Bundespolizei, n.d.).  It is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesminister des Innern, für Bau und  Heimat (BMI), n.d.).  LE authority is also exercised at the state level: the criminal police offices of the Länder  (Landeskriminalämter – LKAs) are independent LEAs in all 16 states (Länder) and are  subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The state police are known as the Landespolizei.  They are the main points of contact for cybercrime for most of the Länder. The ‘16 federal states  (Länder) [have] the authority to maintain their own police forces within their territory, along with  the right to pass legislation and exercise police authority’ (BMI, n.d.).  4.3.1.4. Judiciary  Following the federal structure of Germany, ‘the court system is also structured federally.  Jurisdiction is exercised by federal courts and by the courts of the sixteen federal states  (Länder). The main workload of the administration of justice lies with the Länder’ (European  Union, n.d.b).  The BGH (Federal Court of Justice) is at the head of the local, regional and higher regional  courts and functions as a court of appeal for both civil and criminal cases. In general its  interpretations of the law are adopted by all regional courts and therefore do have far-reaching  effects on German jurisdiction in general.  ‘The prosecution offices are set up at every regional court’ and ‘are competent to investigate all  kinds of criminal offences except of offences against the state and other offences falling  withinthe competence of the Federal Public Prosecution Office’. […] ‘On the federal level there  is only one prosecution office, the Federal Public Prosecution Office which has its seat in  Karlsruhe. In the area of investigation and prosecution of crimes, the Federal Public Prosecution  Office is competent to investigate and prosecute crimes against the state and terrorist crimes as  well as other cases, if they involve serious crime that goes beyond individual Länder borders’  (EJN, n.d.a).  Certain State Prosecutor’s Offices, such as the one in North Rhine-Westphalia, have a central  cybercrime unit dealing ‘with significant cybercrime proceedings’ (Council of the European  Union, 2017a, p. 28).  ‘There are no courts with specific jurisdiction in most of the Länder. In North Rhine-Westphalia,  however, Cologne regional court has a criminal division with special jurisdiction on account of  the Central Cybercrime Unit and Contact Point located at Cologne Public Prosecution office’  (Council of the European Union, 2017a, p. 28). Indeed, as was also highlighted during one of  the interviews conducted, ‘Certain major courts have created special chambers with judges  specifically trained in cybercrime cases (example of Chamber in the High Regional Court of  Cologne).’ For more information on this point see (Landgericht Köln, pp. 90, section 242,  subsections c) and d) ).  Germany cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.3.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from both the desk research and the interviews, there are several synergies  between the communities, and the Cyber-AZ plays an important role in bringing the  communities together and facilitating their synergies. For instance, as one of the interviewees  explained, the different agencies that are part of this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK,  BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND) have ‘a daily interaction and coordination on handling and treating  cases’. In addition, the agencies involved collaborate in ‘producing situation reports to cover the  different aspects of an incident, from the perspective and within the limits of each agency’s  [competence]’.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  35  As emerged from the interviews, ‘There is a daily flow of exchange of information [between  CSIRTs and LE] for ongoing investigations and in the framework of analysing projects and  indicating prevention measures.’ For instance, the BSI may ‘recover data and information from  suspected systems’, which could also be used to support LE investigations and ‘be presented in  Court as testimonies by BSI experts’.  As one of the interviewees explained, the current legal framework does not anticipate having  CSIRT personnel permanently assigned to prosecution authorities. Instead, according to the  German Code of Criminal Proceedings, the role that CSIRTs may play is either that of a witness  or that of an expert. The CSIRT community can help prosecution authorities when there is a  need for a qualified technical expert. Indeed, ‘Even if the CSIRTs contacted do not have the  specific qualified technical experts within their team, they can still support the prosecution  authorities as they have many links in the technical community.’ Moreover, CSIRTs can provide  support to prosecution authorities by reaching out to civil organisations and non-governmental  organisations, as they are in a better position to perform this task.  As one of the interviewees highlighted, ‘The major field of interference during an investigation  [between the different communities] is how to deal with the incident. The prosecution service  aims at gathering proper judicial evidence, while the CSIRTs aim at dealing with the incident  and fixing the issue. From the prosecutor’s perspective, gathering evidence takes much longer  time than the CSIRTs would want. In any major case the usual discussion is what can be done  to gather evidence and close the collection process as soon as possible in order to proceed with  the CSIRT activity of unlocking the system.’  4.3.3. Examples of training  The BKA has developed various national training programmes on cybercrime, including in the  field of information and communication technology (ICT) forensics. The BKA is also responsible  for training experts in the Federation and the Länder. As part of this training, it is possible to  specialise in specific operating systems, networks/internet, mobile forensics and cryptology. The  BKA also organises an internal basic training course on cybercrime once a year (Council of the  European Union, 2017a).  Courses on cybercrime are offered at all levels, from basic to advanced/specialised, for all  police officers and court experts in Germany.  The German Judicial Academy (Deutsche Richterakademie) also offers further training on  criminal law and the internet on an annual basis and organises conferences and training on  criminal law, forensics, criminal proceedings and investigative measures for judges and public  prosecutors who are involved in combating internet crime (German Judicial Academy, n.d.).  The Brandenburg Judicial Academy (Justizakademie des Landes Brandenburg) organises  regular training sessions for senior judiciary who handle cybercrime cases (Brandenburg  Judicial Academy, n.d.). In addition, at a local level, training is organised (e.g. by the Joint  Judicial Examination Office of the Länder of Berlin and Brandenburg) on combating cybercrime,  including topics such as preservation of computer evidence, data network investigations,  including a cross-border dimension, the challenges presented by big data and data protection-  related issues.  At the Länder level, various training initiatives are offered for LE officers and prosecutors, such  as in North Rhine-Westphalia, which organises ‘a joint training programme for specialists from  the Land police force and public prosecutors’. However, practices such as working meetings  and exchange of information are more common between the police and the public prosecutor’s  offices on different aspects of combating cybercrime (Council of the European Union, 2017a). .  AN EXAMPLE  OF  FACILITATING  SYNERGIES  The Nationales  Cyber-  Abwehrzentrum  (National Cyber  Response Centre)  plays an important  role in bringing the  communities  together and  facilitating their  synergies.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  36  As emerged from the interviews, joint training takes place between the CSIRTs and LE, and, in  particular, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), with judiciary representatives also invited to  participate in this training as observers.  As an interviewee explained, ‘In a joint exercise/practical training on critical infrastructures,  which was held with the support of a private company, a representative from the prosecution  office was invited to actively participate and the prosecutor was then on call during the real-life  scenario.’ As another interviewee underlined, ‘The judges are usually not involved in such joint  trainings, also due to [their] obligation to remain neutral/impartial (e.g. there could be a conflict if  a training is organised by a private entity or an exercise hosted in a company’s premises).’  In addition, it should be noted that, as stated by one of the interviewees, the ‘Prosecution team  has the responsibility for providing State justice academy trainings to LE officials. Regarding the  CSIRT community, prosecutors actively engage in seminars and training sessions also involving  the BSI. Through these, they are trying to share the information by inviting CSIRT experts in  such events or participating respectively in trainings of the CSIRT community.’  However, what emerged from the interviews is that CSIRTs and LE work closely together on a  daily basis and that they ‘have managed to learn from each other and understand each entity’s  role and actions’. Since CSIRTs and the judiciary – because of their mandates and the legal  framework – do not have many opportunities to work so closely together, the judiciary could  ‘benefit greatly’ if the CSIRT community could provide training for prosecutor and judges to  further improve their technical skills.  4.4.  LUXEMBOURG  Luxembourg ‘is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy (Grand Duchy) with a head of  government, the prime minister, and a head of state, the Grand Duke. The country is divided  into 4 […] regions, 12 […] cantons and 105 communes’ (European Union, n.d.d.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Luxembourg is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Luxembourg legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Luxembourg adopted its NCSS in 2018 for the period 2018–2020 (ENISA, n.d.g).  4.4.1. Roles and duties  In Luxembourg, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the  authority/department in English  Name of the authority/department  in the original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Agency for the Security of  Information Systems  Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d’information  ANSSI  CERT.LU  CERT.LU CERT.LU  Computer emergency response  team of the Government of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  Équipe Gouvernementale de  Réponse aux Urgences  Informatiques  GOVCERT.LU  Computer Incident Response  Center Luxembourg  Computer Incident Response Center  Luxembourg  CIRCL  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  37  National CERT Luxembourg National CERT Luxembourg NCERT.LU  Grand-Ducal Police Police Grand-Ducale  High Commission for National  Protection  Haut-Commissariat à la Protection  Nationale  HCPN  Cybersecurity Board  CSB  Public Prosecution and Judges  Ministère de la Justice  4.4.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité  des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is part of the High Commission for National Protection  (Haut-Commisariat à la Protection nationale – HCPN) and is responsible for establishing  information security policies and guidelines on non-classified information within the Luxembourg  state bodies (ministries, state departments and administrations). ANSSI assists these bodies  with risk analysis in the domain of information security, in order to help build up a culture of risk-  based governance within the Luxembourg state, as required by the general information security  policy. Furthermore, ANSSI is in charge of promoting information security awareness and may  advise the Luxembourg state’s training institute on training programmes in the domain of  information security.  4.4.1.2. CSIRTs  National CERT Luxembourg (NCERT.LU), the CERT of the Government of the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg (Équipe gouvernementale de réponse aux urgences informatiques –  GOVCERT.LU) and the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) are the  main actors responsible for the detection of and response to incidents.  NCERT.LU, run by GOVCERT.LU, is the national CSIRT (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.b). NCERT.LU  gathers and disseminates information about security incidents that affect information and  communication systems in Luxembourg. It also serves as interlocutor for natural and legal  persons, entities and bodies, both national and international. Once it has received information,  NCERT.LU must convey it to the CERTs in charge of the affected victim’s sector or, if no  sectorial CERT exists, directly to the victim. NCERT.LU also advises about the specific points of  contact according to the targeted sector.  CERT.LU, run by SECURITYMADEIN.LU, is the Cyber Emergency Response Community  Luxembourg (CERT.LU, n.d.). It is an initiative to enhance collaboration between public and  private CERTs in Luxembourg. The objective is to create a community of all of the major actors  for sharing expertise.  GOVCERT.LU, the governmental CSIRT, ‘is the single point of contact dedicated to the  treatment of all computer related incidents jeopardising the information systems of the  government and defined critical infrastructure operators, whether they are public or private’  (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.). The services provided by GOVCERT.LU include incident handling,  coordination and resolution, and also proactive services such as notification of malware and  vulnerabilities, as well as compromised (infected) systems, among others. ‘The Constituency of  GOVCERT.LU is made of:   all ministries, administrations and services of the Luxembourgish government  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  38   military organizations and administrations using a military system of the  Luxembourgish government (e.g. embassies)   critical infrastructure operators of the Grand-duchy of Luxembourg   some major players in sensitive sectors within the Grand-duchy of Luxembourg’  (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.a).  CIRCL ‘is a government-driven initiative designed to gather, review, report and respond to  computer security threats and incidents’ (CIRCL.LU, n.d.). ‘CIRCL is the CERT for the private  sector, communes and non-governmental entities for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. b).  CIRCL provides incident response capacities and remediation to national ICT users. It also  takes a coordinator’s role during incidents involving multiple actors, both national and  international. It is also charged with collecting information about incidents to enhance future  responses. CIRCL also handles vulnerability management and disclosure and incident  response training (CIRCL, 2020).  CIRCL has created a large number of tools applicable to forensics, incident responses, network  analysis, dark web monitoring and threat intelligence. The most successful of these tools is  MISP (Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform & Open Standards For Threat Information  Sharing), which is a threat intelligence database with very large information-sharing capabilities.  It is used by more than 6000 entities worldwide and is becoming a de facto standard in the  CSIRT community.  CIRCL already has a strong LE cooperation culture through frequent informal exchanges and  training programmes, such as the Horizon 2020 ENFORCE project and the NEOLEA initiative  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  The HCPN is a coordinating mechanism for responding to serious cyberattacks (HCPN, n.d.). It  also includes a Cybernetic Risk Evaluation Cell (Cellule d’Evaluation du Risque Cybernétique)  known as CERC (The Luxembourg Government, 2018).  4.4.1.3. LE  The Grand-Ducal Police (Police Grand-Ducale, n.d.) is the primary LEA in Luxembourg.  The Directorate of the Judicial Police Service (SPJ) ‘is responsible, inter alia, for the  Coordination of judicial activities at the national and international level. It is also responsible for  defining and managing, in collaboration with the judicial authorities, judicial investigations.’  Within the SPJ the Department of Property Crime has a section on cybercrime (OSCE, n.d.a).  The SPJ is composed of two units:   Cybercrime Unit. This unit deals with pure cybercrime mainly against ICT systems. It  handles felonies such as data theft, modification and erasure, as well as cyberbullying  and property scam. It is the international point of contact for Europol, Interpol and 24/7  networks.   High Tech Analysis Unit. This unit provides forensic support to other police units. It  handles lawful evidence collection, interception management and maintenance for  audio/video special equipment.  To prevent and combat cybercrime, LE in Luxembourg cooperates with the following authorities:   Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office (mutual legal assistance);   Public Prosecutor (investigation and prosecution)/Parquet général;   Office of the Examining Magistrate (preparatory enquiries and enforcement action);  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  39   Financial Intelligence Unit (financial crime using new technologies);   criminal courts.  4.4.1.4. Judiciary  The judicial system of Luxembourg is ‘divided into a judicial branch’, including the criminal  courts, ‘and an administrative branch’ (European Union, n.d.e).  Some magistrates from the Public Prosecutor’s Office and a magistrate at the level of the  Financial Intelligence Unit are responsible, among other duties, for cybercrime cases.  Luxembourg also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.4.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The different communities in Luxembourg have a strong tradition of cooperation and  collaboration. The CSIRT/LE and judiciary cybercrime working group brings together national  authorities (Public Prosecutor’s Office, LE and CSIRTs) to exchange information regularly, for  instance on their interactions with service providers.  The police rely on mutual legal assistance instruments and the direct exchange of information  with Europol and Interpol, but also on the voluntary sharing of information by communication  service providers.  An interesting case of synergies was mentioned during the interviews. This was a case ‘where  the LE performed a significant data interception, that CSIRTs were not allowed to do but  onwards CSIRTs supported in analysing this data package. Similarly, [synergies are achieved]  in cases of seizing of equipment performed by the LE, later on, analysed with the support of  CSIRTs.’  An example of synergies in developing training was also provided during the interviews, in the  context of the ENFORCE project (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a) during the training, CSIRT technologies  were shown and feedback from the LE received and improvements in tools.  CSIRTs (such as CIRCL) can provide technical pre-investigation and investigation support  before LE intervention. They also support requests from the judiciary and other LEAs for  technical assistance.  Information sharing is carried out automatically using MISP, using sharing groups to implement  information sharing rules. Specific information regarding financial fraud is shared with the  judiciary.  Main synergies occur through cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. LEAs have legal tools to  enable data acquisition by seizing and intercepting servers. Other synergies can be handled  during training (see below).There is a memorandum of understanding between CSIRTs and LE.  Potential interferences can occur when LEAs and CSIRTs come into conflicts. LEAs may disturb  CSIRT monitoring operations when seizing a piece of infrastructure studied by CSIRTs.  Outside the EU, the use of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) can cause extensive delays  and impede cooperation.  Another challenge is the discrepancy in data-handling capacities. CSIRTs generate a lot of  data, for example in the field of child abuse. Since LEAs works on a case-by-case model, they  cannot handle large numbers of data without predefined agreements.  TRADITION OF  ACHIEVING  SYNERGIES  The different  communities in  Luxembourg have a  strong tradition of  cooperation and  collaboration.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  40  The final challenge is to improve evidence handling by MISP: large data sets need to be  handled in such a way as to preserve the chain of custody.  One way to improve synergies would be to share information in real time. This is legally  challenging but would be more profitable for all entities.  4.4.3. Examples of training  ‘Law enforcement officers are trained at the Police school of the Grand-Ducal Police. […]. In  addition, the Police school is responsible for managing the continuing education of the  personnel of the Grand-Ducal Police’ At the Police School, cybercrime is covered during basic  training and professional development for police officers and investigators (OSCE, n.d.a).  To increase opportunities to provide specialised training to IT forensic experts and investigators  working on cybercrime cases, the SPJ arranges training in coordination with neighbouring  police agencies. It is also common practice for personnel attending external training to pass on  their knowledge to others by organising internal training sessions.  Luxembourg ‘does not have a specific institution or school for the training of its judges and  prosecutors, therefore, the Ministry of Justice has reached an agreement with the French Ecole  Nationale de la Magistrature and the German Judicial Academy’ (Deutschen Richterakademie)  (EJTN, n.d.).  In addition, the New Technologies Section of the SPJ provides training for judges, especially on  new tools and methods used by cybercriminals (darknet, bitcoin, etc.).  In the interviews, further examples of training were discussed. For example, when customers  share their issues and needs in the field of cybercrime, this helps CSIRTs understand the  requirements of cybercrime investigations. Further, the Prosecutor’s Office also provides  training related to the four ways of filing a complaint for a CSIRT’s constituency.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘There is a set of training that is already provided by CSIRTs to  LE, i.e. for OSINT [open-source intelligence], cryptographic keys ([…] published under the  ENFORCE project) and forensic tools, including forensics acquisition. There are cases of  prosecutors and judges that joint such trainings, as they had a demonstrated interest in the field’  LE and CSIRTs also participate in training exercises provided by the ENFORCE Project. The  ENFORCE project is a ‘European project co-funded by the European Commission in the  framework of the Internal Security Fund – Police. […]. The ENFORCE project aims at designing,  setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This  curriculum will be validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g.  law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs) and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together  using state-of-the-art training technology’. CEIS, the coordinator of the ENFORCE Project, also  co-organizes a cybercrime training with the Luxembourgian CIRCL and the French National  Police” (CEIS, n.d.). This training material specifically addresses aspects of cooperation.  According to the data collected during the interviews, CSIRTs have received training from the  Customs Authority. This was in the form of a workshop, where the Customs Authority shared  concerns related to cybercrime and was able to discuss how CSIRTs can help (e.g. when  seizing equipment at the borders and how this should be handled before being submitted for  analysis  4.5.  NORWAY  Norway is a constitutional monarchy and a member country of EFTA and a signatory to the  European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement (EFTA, n.d.a), (EFTA, n.d.).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  41  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Norway is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Norwegian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Norway adopted a new NCSS in 2019; this is the fourth edition of the NCSS, with the first  strategy published in 2003 (ENISA, n.d.i) (Norwegian Ministeries, n.d.).  4.5.1. Roles and duties  In Norway, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the  authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name  in the original language  (if applicable)  Norwegian Computer Emergency  Response Team  NorCERT  National Criminal Investigation  Service  Den nasjonale enhet for  bekjempelse av organisert og  annen alvorlig kriminalitet  Kripos  Norwegian National Security  Authority  Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet  NSM  Norwegian National Cyber  Security Centre  Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter  NCSC  National Authority for  Investigation and Prosecution of  Economic and Environmental  Crime  Den sentrale enhet for  etterforsking og påtale av  økonomisk kriminalitet og  miljøkriminalitet  Økokrim  Norwegian Police Security  Service  Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste PST  Norwegian Prosecuting Authority Påtalemyndigheten  Judicial system  Joint Cyber Coordination Centre Felles cyberkoordineringssenter FCKS  Norwegian Data Protection  Authority  Datatilsynet  Norwegian Communications  Authority  Nasjonal  kommunikasjonsmyndigheit  Nkom  4.5.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Ministry of Justice and Public Security is primarily the responsible authority for network and  information security in Norway. The Norwegian National Security Authority (Nasjonal  sikkerhetsmyndighet – NSM) is the national organisation focusing on cybersecurity in the  country. Under the NSM, organisations run different functions related to cybersecurity and  cybercrime, such as the Norwegian CERT (NorCERT) and the Norwegian National Cyber  Security Centre (Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter – NCSC) (NSM, n.d.).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  42  4.5.1.2. CSIRTs  Norway has an officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (NSM, n.d.). The NSM is  responsible for NorCERT.  The main activities of NorCERT are “response to cyber threats in our technical threat operation  centre 24/7; operate and organise a national sensor network on the internet to detect data  breaches in critical infrastructure across sectors; reverse engineering, forensics, network  analysis and counterintelligence” (NCSC, n.d.).  In addition, Norway has different sectorial CSIRTs, such as:   HelseCERT, which supports the Norwegian healthcare sector (HelseCERT, n.d.)   UNINETT CERT, of the UNINETT ‘ICT infrastructure company in Norway’ (UNINETT,  n.d. ) (UNINETT , n.d a).   UiO-CERT, the University of Oslo’s CSIRT (UiO-CERT, n.d.);   FinansCERT, the CSIRT supporting the Norwegian financial sector (FinansCERT,  n.d.).  4.5.1.3. LE  The Norwegian Police Security Service (Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste – PST) is the national  security service of Norway. The activities of the PST are assigned by the Police Act and it  reports directly to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.  The main aim of the National Criminal Investigation Service (Den nasjonale enhet for  bekjempelse av organisert og annen alvorlig kriminalitet – Kripos) is to prevent and combat  serious organised crime. Its main functions are criminal investigations, forensic investigations,  gathering criminal intelligence and undertaking international police cooperation (Politiet, n.d.).  The National Cybercrime Centre (NC3) falls under Kripos. The main activities of NC3 fall under  the following areas: cybercrime investigations, digital forensics, internet investigations and  internet crimes against children (Politiet, n.d. a). Within Kripos there is also a high-tech crime  division that acts as a 24/7 point of contact.  The National Police Directorate is the highest police authority in Norway and ‘falls under the  Ministry of Justice and Public Security’. The National Police Directorate supports police bodies  and special units and provides expertise (Politiet, n.d.c)  As emerged from one of the interviews conducted, in relation to cybercrime, the role of the  national police in Norway, in particular Kripos, is prevention and investigation and intelligence  gathering. For LEAs in Norway, fighting cybercrime is no different from fighting other crimes.  Prosecutors are integrated into LEAs, sharing the same offices with LE personnel; hence, there  is a seamless exchange of information and close cooperation between the two. On the legal  framework side a specific Police Act allows police to share information with the national CERT  to prevent criminal activities.  4.5.1.4. Judiciary  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority (Påtalemyndigheten) is the competent authority for legal  prosecutions in Norway. It handles investigations and prosecutions of criminal cases.  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is divided into the following levels:   the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP);   the Regional Public Prosecution Offices (PPO);   the Prosecuting Authority in the Police (Higher Prosecuting Authority, n.d.)  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  43  The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime  (Den sentrale enhet for etterforsking og påtale av økonomisk kriminalitet og miljøkriminalitet –  Økokrim) provides services as a police unit but also as a prosecution authority with specific  expertise in computer crime and fraud (Økokrim, n.d.).  In Norwegian judicial system, the supreme court ‘is the highest court in Norway […] and has an  authority in all areas of the law’ (Domstol, n.d.). Judicial cooperation in criminal matters with EU  Member States is based on the principles of mutual recognition and direct contact between the  judicial authorities.  Norway also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.5.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As mentioned above, Økokrim, because of its dual nature as a police unit and a prosecution  authority, cooperates with a number of other authorities, such as surveillance authorities, the  business sector, in combating economic and environmental crime.  In addition, the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre (Felles cyberkoordineringssenter – FCKS) is a  key collaborative hub that consists of representatives from the NSM, the Norwegian Intelligence  Service, the PST and Kripos. The FCKS is also coordinated by the NSM (FCKS, n.d.).  NC3 cooperates closely with public and private security entities in Norway and abroad,  especially regarding the exchange of information (Politiet, n.d.b). Cooperation mechanisms  have also been established between LE and NorCERT.  The interviews showed that a lot of synergies are established in tactical operations and at  strategic levels. There are cases of LEAs and national CERTs attending crime scenes together  and conducting investigations together, to complement each other’s capabilities. For instance, if  information is discovered by LE that is deemed important for a national CERT, this information  is passed on to the CERT. Joint reports are prepared and submitted to the government in the  field of cybercrime, including on risks. Another example is LEAs and CERTs discussing and  analysing the issues together. Through the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre, prosecutors hold  monthly meetings with the legal officers of the CERT communities.  However, as emerged in the interviews, there are also potential interferences. In one example, in  the early stages of cooperation the national CERT found a CC server abroad and passed the  information to the hosting country. The hosting country could have decided to shut down the  server, which may have been problematic for the LEA and its operational plan.  4.5.3. Examples of training  “The Norwegian Police University College (/Politihøgskolen –  (NPUC) ‘is the central  educational institution for the police service in Norway. Basic training for police officers is a  three-year university college education aimed at providing a broad practical and theoretical  foundation’. The college provides education in areas such as ‘policing, crime investigation and  prevention, and prosecution and administrative responsibilities’ (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The college also provides training in areas such as:   international civil crisis management;   Schengen Border and Immigration Service;   Nordic Baltic Police Academy (NPUC, n.d.) (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The NPUC is also a member of the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group  (ECTEG) (ECTEG, n.d. a).  ESTABLISHED  SYNERGIES  Through the Joint  Cyber Coordination  Centre, prosecutors  hold monthly  meetings with the  legal officers of the  CERT communities.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  44  The Norwegian Center for Cyber and Information Security (CCIS) develops cybersecurity  competences for Norwegian agencies, companies and academia. It is supported by the Ministry  of Justice and Public Security and members of its board of directors come from authorities such  as the NSM, the Police Directorate and the NPUC, among others (CCIS, n.d.).  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that the different communities (CSIRTs, LE  and judiciary) participate in shared exercises with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO), as well as other national exercises held by private partners. LEAs also participate in  such training activities along with the private sector, mostly in the telecoms field.  NC3 organises training for LEAs as well as prosecutors.  4.6.  PORTUGAL  Portugal is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, and a  head of state, the president, who has power to appoint the prime minister and other government  members. The country is administratively divided into 308 municipalities, subdivided into 3 092  civil parishes’ (European Union, n.d.i.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Portugal is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Portuguese legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Portugal adopted its first NCSS in 2015. In 2019, the Portuguese government issued the NCSS  for 2019–2023 (ENISA, n.d.j).  4.6.1. Roles and duties  In Portugal, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.

National cyber security agency  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre (Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança – CNCS)  (CNCS, n.d.) monitors and coordinates the implementation of the NCSS and is the single point  of contact. Its main focus is informing and raising the awareness of not only public entities and  critical infrastructures but also the business sector and civil society.  4.6.1.2. CSIRTs  Portugal has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT.PT (CNCS, n.a.a). CERT.PT ‘is a  service integrated in the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre that coordinates the  response to incidents involving State entities, operators of Critical infrastructures, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and, in general, the national cyberspace, including  any device belonging to a network or address block attributed to an operator of electronic  communications, institution, collective or singular person based, or physically located, in  Portuguese territory’ (CNCS, n.a.a). Its mission is to enhance national capacity in cybersecurity  by creating new CSIRTs and developing the capacities of existing ones. CERT.PT is a member  of the National CSIRT Network and a national representative in the CNW.  CC-CRISI is the CSIRT for the Portuguese Armed Forces Estado Maior General das Forças  Armadas – EMGFA) (EMPFGA, n.d.).  4.6.1.3. LE  The Judicial Police  (Polícia Judiciária, n.d.) investigates violent crime, organised crime and  financial crime. It is ‘a higher criminal police force falling under the Ministry of Justice. Its  mission is to assist judicial and prosecuting authorities with investigations and to develop and  foster preventive, detection and investigative actions, falling within its remit or entrusted with by  the competent judicial and prosecuting authorities. […]. Polícia Judiciária is also responsible for  ensuring the operation of the Europol National Unit and the Interpol National Central Bureau,  within the framework established by national legislation” (Europol, n.d.b).  With the aim to fight against cybercrime, the Judicial Police established in February 2017 the  National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (Unidade Nacional de Combate  ao Cibercrime e à Criminalidade Tecnológica), also known as UNCT3. A specialised team  within the UNCT3 supports criminal investigations with technical and legal aspects (Polícia  Judiciária , n.d.).  The Public Security Police (Polícia de Segurança Pública – PSP) is responsible for maintaining  security and public order and investigating non-organised crimes and violent crimes (PSP, n.d.).  The Internal Intelligence Service (Serviço de Informações de Segurança – SIS, (SIS, n.d.)  produces security intelligence to assist political decision-makers in fighting cybercrime, among  other crimes. To accomplish its mission, the SIS is supported by all of the security and LEAs  and public authorities in general.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  46  According to the data collected in the interviews, the organisation in Portugal in charge of  cybercrime is Judicial Police, the police force that deals with anti-corruption, counter-terrorism,  drug prevention and serious cybercrime.  Since the transposition of the NIS Directive, a new national law (Cybersecurity law) mentioned  the needs of cooperation between the Portuguese CERT (the Portuguese national CERT is  within the Cyber Centre) and other national CSIRTs. In addition, there is a clause in the law  stating that the CNCS and the national criminal police should cooperate. This group involves  four entities (known as G4): (1) the CNCS, (2) the Judicial Police, (3) the Cyber defence and (4)  intelligence services. The G4 group collaborates with cyber diplomacy, a body within the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is also tasked with supporting national services with  information exchange in the EU space.  However, magistrates are not part of the G4 group because they have their own powers and  can act directly/ask LE and the CNCS for services and information. They are therefore not  explicitly mentioned in the legal act. Members of the G4 group have regular meetings and  occasionally, if needed, undertake joint operations.  4.6.1.4. Judiciary  The Portuguese judicial system ‘has two separate sets of courts, the civil courts and the  administrative courts. Provision is also made for other courts, such as the Constitutional Court.  In the civil sphere, the ordinary courts with civil and criminal jurisdiction are the judicial courts’  (European Union, n.d.j).  The Public Prosecution Service (Ministério Público – PPS) (PPS, n.d.) is the Portuguese  prosecution authority. Within the PPS, the Prosecutor General’s Office (Procurador-Geral da  República – PGO) (PGO, n.d.) acts as the central authority for international judicial cooperation  in criminal matters. In addition, within the PPS, the Central Department of Criminal Investigation  and Prosecution (Departamento Central de Investigação e Ação Penal – DCIAP) (DCIAP, n.d.)  is a body entrusted with the coordination of the investigation of organised crime, as well as  crime prevention.  Portugal cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.6.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The National Cybersecurity Centre is the operational coordinator and the Portuguese national  authority specialised in cybersecurity working in this field with State entities, operators of Critical  Infrastructures, operators of essential services and digital service providers, ensuring that the  cyberspace is used as an area of freedom, security and justice, for the protection of all the  sectors of society that materialize national sovereignty and the Democratic State under the rule  of law’ (CNCS, n.d.b).  ANACOM (National Communications Authority, Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações) is the  regulator, supervisor and representative of the communications sector in Portugal. The authority  is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Electronic Communications Law (ANACOM,  n.d.). In terms of criminal investigations, there is close cooperation between ANACOM, the  Judicial Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office on combating cybercrime and obtaining  digital evidence (ANACOM, n.d a).  As highlighted by one of the interviewees, ‘Nothing prevents the cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and […judiciary]. However, there are no particular laws in place’. ‘CSIRTs officers have the  obligation to report malicious/suspicious events to the prosecution service’, which derives from  the general rule stating that all ‘public institutions have the obligation to cooperate with the LE  and the prosecution service during criminal investigations’.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  47  CERT-PT ‘coordinates the response to incidents involving State entities, operators of essential  services, operators of national critical infrastructures and digital service providers’. In addition,  the National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (UNC3T) collaborates and  directly supports the actions of prevention, detection and mitigation developed by national  entities (Polícia Judiciária , n.d.). Finally, the Internal Intelligence Service (SIS, n.d.) collaborates  closely with LEAs and public authorities, as well as providing support when this is requested.  As emerged from the interviews, one example of synergy is the sharing of methodologies: both  CSIRTs and LEAs run regular laboratories and/or joint exercises and share methodologies.  Another example is the sharing of information: LEAs frequently share indicators of compromise  or indicators of threat with the other G4 members through the communication channel to verify  the information. There are also synergies across the different communities with regard to  training: the police provide lectures to the school of magistrates and criminal police schools, as  well as annual lectures to magistrates and the academic community.  Nevertheless, addressing cybersecurity means dealing with the global security of cyberspace  and sometimes there is an overlap between the CNCS and the police. For example, if a CSIRT  decides to bring down (‘takedown procedure’) a botnet without consulting a LEA that may be in  the process of investigating it, this can cause disruptions. The G4 group was created to try and  avoid conflicts and overlapping activities, and weekly meetings increase the levels of  communication between the parties.  4.6.3. Examples of training  The CNCS ensures that suitable training activities are provided to the CSIRT community,  including but not limited to training sessions for CSIRT operators and coordination of national  cybersecurity exercises and participation to international cybersecurity exercises. In addition,  the CNCS supports the establishment of new CSIRTs, defines the required capabilities and  circulates best practices for the handling of cybersecurity incidents (CNCS, n.d.c.).  In terms of LE training, the PSP offers both training/teaching courses at a basic level and  specialised courses. The courses are taught by the Higher Institute of Police Sciences and  Internal Security (Instituto Superior de Ciências Policiais e Segurança Interna – ISCPSI)  (ISCPSI, n.d.) and the Police Training School (Escola Prática de Polícia). The Police Training  School provides training in criminal investigations. In addition, UNC3T is responsible for  ensuring collaboration and direct participation in initial and ongoing training on cybercrime for  staff involved in criminal investigations and in supporting the Judicial Police.  The Centre for Judiciary Studies (Centro de Estudos Judiciários – CEJ) (CEJ, n.d.) provides  training for the judiciary on cybercrime and digital evidence, as well as on cyber components of  the penal code and criminal investigations, aiming to provide to all judges and prosecutors a  minimum level of knowledge and information on cybercrime. As reported during one of the  interviews, “The judiciary community has established initiatives that usually try to involve experts  from the other communities in their training activities (provided for prosecutors, judges,  sometimes lawyers and LE). This is a common practice as they have observed the benefits of  such an exchange.’ This will also help ‘to ensure that judiciary experts provide guidance to  CSIRTs’.  The interviews revealed that CSIRTs and LE carry out joint exercises; however, in 2020 any  planned training was not held because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  The judiciary (prosecutors and judges) do not currently participate in such activities. The  interviewees noted that CSIRTs and LE want to find a common approach. Once this is  accomplished, they will expand the training to the judiciary community as well.  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that LE personnel participate in civil  postgraduate programmes (legal or engineering programmes). Efforts are also being made to  SYNERGIES IN  MULTIPLE  LEVELS  Examples of  synergies include  sharing of  methodologies,  sharing of  information and  training activities.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  48  provide more engineering courses to legal actors and more legal knowledge to engineers and  set up links with the academic community. This is something that LE supports heavily through  liaising with professors and students to inspire collaborations. LE participates in lectures on  cybercrime law, digital forensics, ethics, etc.  As indicated in the interviews, the CNCS delivers such training online along with awareness  courses for the public. LEAs receive training provided by the school of magistrates and criminal  police schools, with the CNCS also providing annual lectures to magistrates.  4.7.  ROMANIA  Romania is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government – the prime minster – and a  head of state – the president. The country is divided into 41 counties and the municipality of  Bucharest’ (European Union, n.d.h).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Romania is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Romania legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Romania adopted its NCSS in 2013 (ENISA, n.d.k) and legislation that transposes the EU NIS  Directive (Law No 362/2018) in 2018 (CERT RO, 2020).  4.7.1. Roles and duties  In Romania the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation in the  original language (if  applicable)  Romanian National Computer  Security Incident Response Team  Centrul Național de Răspuns la  Incidente de Securitate Cibernetică  CERT-RO  Cyber Security Incident Response  Center  Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică  CERT-MIL  Operational Response Centre for  Security Incidents  Centrul Operațional de Răspuns la  Incidente de Securitate  CORIS-STS  National Cyberint Center  Centrul Național Cyberint  General Inspectorate of Romanian  Police  Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei  Române  IGPR  Directorate for Investigating  Organised Crime and Terrorism  Direcția de Investigare a Infracțiunilor  de Criminalitate Organizată și  Terorism  DIICOT  Judicial system  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  49  4.7.1.1. National cyber security agency  The implementation of the NCSS in Romania is coordinated by the Chancellery of the Prime  Minister.  In Romania, there are multiple cybersecurity authorities. Currently, the Romanian National  Computer Security Incident Response Team (Centrul Național de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică – CERT-RO) (CERT-RO, n.d.) no longer operates under the Ministry of  Communication and Information Society (MCSI), but is coordinated by the Chancellery of the  Prime Minister (Portal Legislativ, n.d.). According to the law transposing the NIS Directive (Law  No 362/2018), CERT-RO is the national competent authority for network and information  systems and has an operational role (CERT RO, 2020).  4.7.1.2. CSIRTs  Romania has an officially recognised national CSIRT: CERT-RO ‘is the National CERT of  Romania, established as an independent structure for research, development and expertise in  the field of cyber-security. It is a specialized organization responsible for preventing, analysing,  identifying and reacting to cyber incidents. CERT-RO is the national contact point for similar  structures. CERT-RO is responsible for elaborating and distributing public politics for prevention  and counteracting the incidents that occur within national cyber infrastructures’ (CERT-RO, n.d.  a).  CORIS-STS (Operational Response Centre for Security Incidents, Centrul Operațional de  Răspuns la Incidente de Securitate) is the Romanian governmental CSIRT and is part of the  Romanian Special Telecommunications Service (STS). This CERT ‘is designated to prevent  and respond to security incidents related to information and communications systems of the  Special Telecommunications Service and its clients’ (CORIS-STS, n.d.).  CERT-MIL (Cyber Security Incident Response Center, Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică) (CERT-MIL, n.d.) is the Romanian Military CSIRT, under the Ministry of  Defence CSIRT, and is responsible for the management of cybersecurity incidents in the  relevant cyber infrastructures, ensuring their detection, investigation and response in  accordance with the regulations and procedures in force under the Ministry of National Defence.  It was established in 2007 within the Ministry of National Defence and since 2020 has been the  responsibility of the Cyber Defence Command.  The National Cyberint Centre (Centrul Național Cyberint) is the cyber intelligence centre of the  Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). Its main focus is on counter-espionage, economic  security, transnational threats and the protection of classified information. The SRI focuses on  cyberattacks, including those that originate in other states, and cybercrime groups, which may  also be associated with terrorist organisations or extremists (hacktivists) (SRI, n.d.).  4.7.1.3. LE  The Central Cybercrime Unit within the Romanian Police (Politia Romana, n.d.) is the primary  LEA dealing with cybercrime, with local capacities as well. More specifically it deals with:   online fraud and fraud committed with electronic payment instruments;   digital forensics;   online child abuse;   computer-related crimes (crimes against/through computer systems; unauthorised  computer/data access or data transfer).  It is a specialised unit (Politia Romana, n.d.a), with general territorial competence, that is  involved in combating and coordinating the fight against organised crime, including cybercrime,  at the national level. The activities carried out by the Directorate for Combating Organized  Crime include:  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  50   Operational activity   Control, support and guidance decisive in obtaining results at territorial level   Information and decision support   International representation/training (Politia Romana, n.d.a).  The challenges facing this specialised unit in 2020 are phishing campaigns/mobile malware  distribution related to COVID-19, ransomware attacks on health facilities/hospitals, attacks  against critical infrastructure holding personal data on COVID-19 patients, online fraud and SIM  SWAP scams (Council of Europe, 2020).  4.7.1.4. Judiciary  The supreme court in Romania is the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The judicial  authorities are divided by the regional and specialised jurisdiction (European e-Justice Portal ,  n.d.)  In Romania, the issuing and execution of the request for international judicial cooperation in  criminal matters is under the competence of the courts and prosecution offices (EJN, n.d.a).  The Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice and  the Ministry of Internal Affairs have responsibility for international judicial cooperation in criminal  matters (EJN, n.d.).  Romania cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.7.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘National cyber security system (NSCC) is the general framework of cooperation which brings  together public authorities and institutions with responsibilities and capabilities in the field in  order to ensure coordination of actions at national level for cyberspace security, including  through cooperation with academia and business, professional associations and organizations  NGOs’ (CERT-RO, n.d.b).  Romania has developed official programmes for cybersecurity interagency cooperation and  information sharing, with CERT-RO playing a major role. CERT-RO has ‘signed a Memorandum  of Understanding (MoU) and Protocols with public institutions in the cybersecurity field’ (ITU,  n.d.).  The Romanian CSIRT, LE and judiciary are cooperating on cybercrime cases under the national  legal framework, which is expected to be updated to provide further support for this kind of  cooperation, for example to stipulate in the criminal procedure code that CERT-RO could be  called to provide expertise to the Prosecutor’s Office and in court.  One example of this cooperation is the Romanian CSIRT, LE and judiciary working together to  fight banking/financial malware (botnets) affecting Romanian citizens and financial institutions.  In terms of synergies, CERT-RO and the Romanian Police are working together to continuously  adapt the framework for information exchange and cooperation. One important aspect of this is  the tools needed to support the cooperation framework, and here CERT-RO has made  important steps recently by implementing a National Cybersecurity Services Platform (NCSP)  that can be used by all stakeholders: LEAs, CSIRTs, internet service providers, public and  private partners, and other authorities.  Another common objective is to assure that technical training is provided for those who work in  the areas of cybersecurity and cybercrime. CERT-RO also has a leading role here by organising  regular technical workshops and seminars for all relevant stakeholders.  SYNERGIES IN  FIGHTING  CYBER  THREATS  The Romanian  CSIRT, LE and  judiciary cooperate  in fighting cyber  threats affecting the  national IT  infrastructure,  citizens and  organisations.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  51  Possible interferences have been reduced drastically as a result of recent developments in  implementation of an optimal cooperation framework between the CSIRT, police and judiciary.  Some interferences may still occur in cybercrime investigations, mainly because of the different  focuses that these communities have, i.e. incident mitigation (CSIRTs) compared with evidence  preservation and criminal prosecution (LE and judiciary).  4.7.3. Examples of training  Since 2017, a national cyber exercise called CyDEX has been organised by the SRI through its  National Cyberint Center, in cooperation with the national CSIRT (CERT-RO), the Ministry of  Defence, the Military Technical Academy, the STS, the Protection and Guard Service and  organisations form different private sectors. The latest exercise included participants from more  than 90 organisations in the public and private sector, including CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  Training for LE at a foundational level and at advanced levels is provided by the Police  Academy and the Police Officers School in Romania.  The training of judges and public prosecutors is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice.  Since 2004, the Ministry of Justice, through its website, has made available guides and useful  information on judicial cooperation, such as handbooks and manuals, for Romanian judges and  prosecutors (Romanian Ministry of Justice, n.d.).  In addition, the Romanian Centre of Excellence for Cybercrime Investigation (CYBEREX-RO)  offers training to those organisations working to combat cybercrime in Romania, such as CERT-  RO, the General Inspectorate of Romanian Police (Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei Române –  IGPR) – Fraud Investigations Directorate (GIRP-FID, n.d.), the Prosecutor’s Office attached to  the High Court of Cassation and Justice (POHCCJ, n.d.), the National Institute for Magistracy  (NIM, n.d.), the Police Academy and others (European Commission, n.d.).Currently, there are  no examples of joint training between the three communities.  4.8.  SWEDEN  Sweden is ‘a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a head of government  – the prime minister – and a head of state – the monarch. Sweden is a unitary state, divided into  20 counties and 290 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.k.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Sweden is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Swedish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Sweden adopted its NCSS in 2017, followed by a comprehensive cyber security action plan for  the period 2019–2022 (ENISA, n.d.l) (Swedish Government, n.d.).  4.8.1. Roles and duties  In Sweden the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  52  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation in the  original language (if  applicable)  CERT-SE  Sveriges nationella Computer Security  Incident Response Team  CERT-SE  Swedish Civil Contingencies  Agency  Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och  beredskap  MSB  National Defence Radio  Establishment  Försvarets radioanstalt FRA  Swedish Defence Materiel  Administration  Försvarets materielverk FMV  Swedish Armed Forces Försvarsmakten FM  Swedish Post and Telecom  Authority  Post-och telestyrelsen PTS  Swedish Police Authority Polismyndigheten  Swedish Security Service  Säkerhetspolisen SÄPO  Swedish Prosecution Authority Åklagarmyndigheten  Swedish Economic Crime  Authority  Ekobrottsmyndigheten  Swedish National Courts  Administration  Domstolsverket  4.8.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskaps –  MSB) is the responsible authority for network and information security in Sweden (MSB, n.d.).  The cybersecurity action plan of Sweden contains measures that the MSB will undertake, along  with the authorities mentioned above in Section 4.8.1.  4.8.1.2. CSIRTs  CERT-SE is the officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (CERT-SE, 2015). The  MSB is the authority that operates the national CERT.  CERT-SE also collaborates with the military CERT of Sweden, Försvarsmakten FM-CERT (FM-  CERT, n.d.) (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  SUNet-CERT is the Swedish University Network CERT. It supports academic and educational  institutions as well as other organisations connected to the SUNET network (SUNet-CERT,  n.d.).  4.8.1.3. LE  The Swedish Police Authority (Polismyndigheten) (Polisen, n.d.) falls under the Ministry of  Justice. The LEAs listed below undertake cybercrime investigation tasks, among other types of  criminal investigations, and are overseen by the Swedish Police Authority:   the Swedish Cybercrime Centre (SC3);   the National Fraud Centre;   the National Forensic Centre (Nationellt forensiskt centrum – NFC);   the National Operations Department (Nationella operativa avdelningen – NOA).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  53  The SC3 was established ‘to investigate all forms of cybercrime. [SC3] is responsible for  detecting, preventing and averting serious cybercrime’. The SC3 shares information on threats,  as well as technical methods to combat cybercrime, with partner agencies (Council of the  European Union, 2017b); see also (Polisen, n.d. a).  The main tasks of the NFC are to conduct forensic investigations and analyses for the judicial  authorities (NFC, n.d.). The National Fraud Centre has a coordinating and supportive role. The  centre supports investigators regionally and locally and shares best practices. It collaborates  with the NFC and the SC3 (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Polisen, n.d. a).  The NOA has a leading role in operational activities. The International Affairs Division within the  NOA acts as the National Unit of Europol and is the national point of contact for international  police cooperation (Polisen, n.d. a).  4.8.1.4. Judiciary  The Swedish Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) and the Swedish Economic Crime  Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) are the national authorities that carry out public prosecution  tasks (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Åklagarmyndigheten, n.d.)  (Ekobrottsmyndigheten, n.d.).  The Swedish Prosecution Authority comprises the following offices:   the National Anti-Corruption Unit, which deals with corruption;   the National Unit for Environment and Working Environment Cases, which deals with  the environmental crimes;   the National Security Unit, which deals with security-related cases;   the National Unit against Organised Crime, which deals with organised cross-border  crime.  Cybercrime and criminal investigations fall under the responsibility of the general prosecution  service. In addition, the Swedish Prosecution Authority has developed a network of prosecutors  who deal with cybercrime in the different regions of the country (Council of the European Union,  2017b).  The Swedish judicial system has “ two parallel types of courts: Ordinary courts, which deal with  criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts, which deal with cases relating to  public administration” (European Union, n.d.l.).  “Cybercrime acts are dealt with by the general courts […] in the same manner as other criminal  acts” (Council of the European Union, 2017b). The Swedish National Courts Administration  (Domstolsverket) (Swedish National Courts Administration, n.d.) is the coordinating organisation  for the Swedish courts.  Judicial cooperation in criminal matters with EU Member States is based on the principles of  mutual recognition and direct contact between judicial authorities.  Sweden also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.8.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The SC3 and the Civil Contingencies Agency are developing cooperation mechanisms at  operational as well as at strategic level’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  54  Cooperation mechanisms have also been established between LE and the CERT-SE. In  addition, collaboration between the private sector and financial institutions and LE has been  established, mainly based on information sharing.  As indicated in the interviews with competent experts, there is a frequent exchange of  information between the CSIRT and LE communities as part of monthly meetings established to  support their cooperation. In addition, there is ‘spontaneous communication on a daily basis’  under the principle that ‘it is better to share than not to share’. The cooperation mechanisms  established between the two communities have allowed them to complement each other when  performing different tasks. This is particularly the case in interactions with the victims of an  incident/cybercrime. ‘In some cases the LE provide CSIRTs with information’ so that they can  notify ‘their community and […] the victims. Examples are cases of Distributed Denial-of-Service  (DDoS) attacks and ransomware’. The CSIRT community ‘has a responsibility to advise the  victims of an incident/cybercrime but cannot report the incident on behalf of the victim. CSIRTs  do not have a mandate that would allow them to reach out to the victims to obtain information.  [On their side, however,] LE are able to contact the victim and ensure their cooperation during  an investigation process.’ It was also stressed that the CSIRT community relies on the trust  relationships established with other CSIRT teams and organisations to ensure a flow of  information and smooth collaboration. On the other hand, ‘the LE community has a strong legal  framework that allows them to enforce their role and access information’.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘The national CSIRT [also] provides their technical expertise’ in  cases where they are ‘called as expert witnesses in court proceedings. An example was a fraud  case where CSIRT provided technical support in analysing evidence.’  Based on the feedback provided by the interviewees, ‘interferences have been noted due to the  different tasks that the CSIRT and LE community have. But through mutual efforts [and trust],  they have developed an understanding and have managed to benefit from each other’s skills.’  For instance, CSIRTs have been able to ‘support LE in evidence preservation if requested’.  Concerning the interaction between LE and the judiciary, LEAs share with prosecutors  information connected to investigations. LEAs ‘share information with the judges only for court  proceedings. Intervention by a judge during an investigation is rare (mainly limited to cases  where decision needs to be made about restricting fundamental freedoms).’  4.8.3. Examples of training  The Swedish National Police Academy (Polishögskolan) provides training for police officers  (Polishögskolan, n.d.). The academy organises basic training for police officers in collaboration  with higher education institutes such as Växjö University and Umeå University. It also  coordinates participation in international courses such as those organised by CEPOL and the  Association of European Police Colleges (AEPC) (OSCE, n.d.).  The SC3 also organises training for LE and coordinates the exchange of expertise through its  website. It also participates in the ‘first responders e-learning’ package on IT forensics and IT  crime knowledge, in cooperation with ECTEG and supported by Europol, CEPOL, the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Council of Europe (ECTEG, n.d.)  (Polisen, n.d. a). The material is used to support training for LE.  The Training Centre of the Swedish Prosecution Authority provides a specialised course on  cybercrime ‘in the mandatory initial training and in the further training for prosecutors’. In  addition, training in different areas is provided, such as on international legal assistance and on  the legal systems of other countries. The Prosecution Authority also shares through its website  a platform for prosecutors to exchange information and knowledge (Council of the European  Union, 2017b).  A CULTURE OF  SYNERGY  Established  cooperation and  spontaneous  communication  under the principle  that ‘it is better to  share than not to  share’ .  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  55  The Swedish Judicial Training Academy organises training programmes for the judiciary.  Although specialised training on cybercrime is not offered, ‘the Academy organises annual  criminal law seminars on relevant topics’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (The Swedish  Judicial Training Academy , n.d.).  The SC3 organises training for LE as well as prosecutors.  4.9.  FINAL REMARKS  4.9.1. Overview of skills and competences  The technical complexity and the cross-border nature of cybercrime has challenged the  competences (including skills, knowledge, attributes and behaviours (IAEA, n.d.) (UN, n.d.)  (OECD, 2014) of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, driving the three communities to refine their  expertise and establish cooperation mechanisms. Interviews with country experts affirmed that  interferences can occur during incident handling and cybercrime investigations, but that the  communities make efforts to avoid such interferences, create effective partnerships and take  advantage of their synergies.  The CSIRT community holds the technical expertise that is required to detect and mitigate  cybersecurity incidents and restore cyber-secure environments. The LE and judiciary experts  interviewed highlighted that the technical competences of the CSIRT community are also  particularly valuable when it comes to assisting with evidence collection, preservation and  presentation before a court of law. In addition, several interviewees confirmed that the  information flow between CSIRTs and LE has been fundamental in ensuring operational and  strategic awareness of cyberthreats.  Although each Member State has its own specific operational and legal framework for shaping  the response to cybercrime, it emerged from the interviews that the LE community has an  institutional role and carries out the following tasks: determining whether a cybersecurity  incident has a criminal nature, conducting the investigation of cybercrime cases and reaching  out to the victims of such cases to advise them and ensure their collaboration. To perform these  tasks, the LE community applies its knowledge and expertise in digital forensics and criminal  investigations. Provided they have a legal mandate, LEAs can aggregate pertinent information  on cybercrime cases using their own evidence collection methods, directly from victims , but  also through their LE counterparts in other countries and the CSIRT community. In the evidence  collection framework, the LE community bears the responsibility for preserving the chain of  custody and following the necessary procedures to bring criminals to justice.  The LE investigative activities are closely monitored by the judiciary and, in particular, by public  prosecution authorities. Depending on the judicial system of each Member State, a prosecutor  or an investigative judge is responsible for leading the cybercrime investigation process and has  the authority to issue warrants and instructions to support evidence collection activities. The  judiciary community (mainly the judges) assesses the admissibility of the evidence collected,  examines the witnesses and pronounces the verdict, determining the criminal and civil liability of  cybercrime perpetrators. In addition to their legal competences, given the technical nature of  cybercrime, the judiciary needs to understand the technical matters to the extent required to be  able to judge whether a suspect has committed a crime and the relevant circumstances to  determine the sentence and they may require the support of the CSIRT community, whose  delegates may be invited as expert witnesses before the courts.  The interviewees provided examples of training activities involving all three communities,  sometimes in the form of joint exercises. These joint training exercises help enhance overall the  competences required to respond to cybercrime. With joint training, the three communities can  reach a ‘better understanding [of] the role and how the other communities work’, they become  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  56  more aware of the skills and strengths of the other communities and can enhance their  competences by learning from each other. For instance, the CSIRT community can learn more  about investigative techniques and ‘data acquisition, so that the data acquired by […CSIRTs]  could more easily serve as evidence in criminal and other types of proceedings’, and can  acquire legal knowledge, for example ‘how to identify if an incident is a crime, and what role LE  has on that’. The LE community can obtain a better insight into the different ways that the  CSIRT community shares information, as well as the tools used, and further knowledge on  analysing data logs and performing incident analysis in specific areas. The judiciary community  can benefit by gaining more awareness of cyberthreats and developing, in general, a better  understanding of the technical aspects of cybercrime.  Finally, because of the cross-border nature of cybercrime, all three communities need to know  about the different EU and international legal frameworks (notably the Convention on  Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2003) and cooperation mechanisms and networks (e.g. CSIRTs  Network (CNW) (ENISA, n.d.a), European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF) (Europol,  n.d.a), Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c) (25), and European Judicial  Cybercrime Network (EJCN) (Eurojust, n.d.b), 24/7 Points of Contact Network under the Council  of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (26)). In addition, the communities need to develop their  competences and build organisational and intercultural skills to liaise effectively with  counterparts from other Member State and EFTA countries.  4.9.2. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cooperation  It is indisputable that ‘The outbreak of Covid-19 has brought an immense change in the way we  conduct our lives. In this increasingly connected world, we can, fortunately, continue our  professional and private lives virtually’ (ENISA, n.d.b). Fortunately, cooperation among the  CSIRT, LE, and judiciary communities has also continued during the pandemic crisis, and this is  more crucial than ever because ‘The COVID-19 pandemic renders individuals and society  extremely vulnerable in all respects’ (Council of Europe, 2020a) and ‘Criminals have quickly  adapted their techniques to exploit [the situation and] our fears around the COVID-19 pandemic’  (Europol, 2020).  It emerged in quite an unequivocal manner from the data collected in the interviews that, in all  eight countries analysed in this study, overall, the COVID‑19 pandemic has not hindered  cooperation between the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities; instead, it has generally  become even closer and more frequent.  Some interviewees highlighted that meetings in person occurred less frequently (in particular  those ‘that concerned very sensitive matters that cannot be handled on the phone or via e-  mails)’, some meetings were postponed and some ‘joint training plans [were] disrupted’;  however, more meetings took place using video/teleconferencing, several events were moved  online and electronic communication, as well as the automatic exchange of information, overall  seemed to have increased: ‘There is more information sharing. The big change is that we  moved physical meetings to virtual ones.’ One of the interviewees stated that ‘Operations [were]  still ongoing despite the pandemic, to avoid interrupting investigations in most of the cases’,  although the fact that some meetings and court hearings were suspended represented a  challenge.  In addition, the interviewees noted that the COVID-19 crisis ‘did not change the communication  but rather made it more present and more frequent – almost a daily interaction and exchange of  information was established. During this period [indeed], joint work and joint approaches were  (25) Information on J-CAT is available through https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint- cybercrime-action-taskforce  (26) A recent study of the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) highlighted the benefits and  successful examples of international cooperation that stem from the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  (Council of Europe, 2020b).  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  57  established covering a broader scope of activities, including joint statements. In other words,  COVID made the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE take place not only on criminal  investigations and incidents but also on raising awareness.’ According to the interviewees, ‘The  crisis [actually] helped the institutions to enhance their distance working capacities, e.g. to  organise meetings through secure videoconference platforms’, and during the pandemic crisis  ‘there was more close cooperation on updates that needed to be provided to the Government’.  One of the interviewees defined the pandemic period as ‘a productive work period in terms of  communication since the exchanges were multiplied between the entities, especially CSIRTs  and LE. Cooperation with other communities was facilitated at the end. They had to adapt to the  electronic means and work more hours but they adapted well in the new situation.’  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  58  5. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  5.1.  CONCLUSIONS  This report presents a methodology (based on desk research, interviews and compilation of a  SoD matrix) to collect data on CSIRTs and LE cooperation, in particular their roles, synergies  and interferences, competences and training initiatives related to cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and their interactions with the judiciary. This methodology has been used to collect data on  some Member State/EFTA countries, namely Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway,  Portugal, Romania and Sweden. The results of this data collection and related analysis are  presented in the report.  Using the analysis of the data collected, the conclusions summarised below were drawn. Some  of these conclusions found clear confirmation in the discussions at the 9th ENISA/EC3  Workshop on CSIRT and LE cooperation that took place on 16 September 2020; this was an  online event, by invitation only (ENISA, 2020).   All countries analysed have signed the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime and almost all of them have ratified it and the Additional Protocol on the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer  systems. Each country, however, has specific legislation on cybercrime, which is  mandated through many different national laws and different criminal procedural law  that governs investigations and the prosecution of (cyber)crime.   All countries analysed have a NCSS, which sets up the general framework for the  coordination and cooperation of all authorities and defines their roles and  responsibilities.   In terms of incident response, in line with the NIS Directive, all countries analysed have  established national CSIRTs. However, although there are similarities, the way they  are organised and the position they have in the national institutional framework vary  from country to country.   The way that LEAs dealing with cybercrime are organised also varies from country  to country: some countries have specialised central cybercrime units, whereas others  have decentralised specialised units or both.   The structure and organisation of the judiciary also vary by country: in some  countries there are ‘specialised prosecutors or specialised structures within the  Prosecution Services dealing with cybercrime offences’, while in other countries ‘the  responsibility for dealing with such crimes usually lies “de facto” with specialised public  prosecutors and judges, who have been trained or have experience in the area of  cybercrime’ (Council of the European Union, 2017c).   Among the three communities – CSIRTs, LE and judiciary – different approaches and  different levels of cooperation exist. While operational cooperation, especially in  daily interactions and informal communication, seems to be well established,  sometimes it appears that more structured cooperation would be useful in order to  achieve a less fragmented information flow between the three communities. In  addition, there is a bigger gap in the interaction between CSIRTs and the judiciary than  in the cooperation established between LE and the judiciary.   LEAs are not solely involved in the detection and investigation of cybercrimes. A key  component of their role is the preventive aspects of cybercrime, and it is here that  COVID-19  The pandemic crisis  has changed the way  that CSIRTs, LE and  the judiciary work and  interact together. In  some instances, it has  actually meant  increased interactions  among the  communities..  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  59  cooperation with other communities, particularly the CSIRT community, becomes  apparent, to support preventive strategies.   CSIRTs and LEAs need to cooperate to decrease the risk of evidence being  compromised or destroyed.   CSIRTs and LE also cooperate during the analysis of evidence.   CSIRTs play an important role in informing (potential) victims of cybercrime and in  providing them with information on how to report a crime to the police.   CSIRTs may be called as witnesses in court, although this rarely happens.   Several competences are required for incident handling and cybercrime investigation;  while each community has developed its own set of skills and knowledge, each could  benefit from the competences of the other communities.   Some initiatives are in place to facilitate training within each community and some  joint training takes place involving two of the communities (e.g. CSIRTs and LE, or LE  and the judiciary); however, there is a need for further initiatives and for training and  exercises that involve the three communities together.   The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary work  together and interact. The greatest impact has been on training and workshop  events, as well as meetings, which were cancelled in the early stages of the pandemic  and later delivered online. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, the use of online  tools to facilitate meetings and events has become the norm. Overall, there does not  appear to have been a significant impact of the pandemic on the ability of the three  communities to cooperate. In some instances, the level of vigilance and interaction  among the communities has actually increased, with even daily interaction taking  place, to ensure that each community is kept up to date.  5.2.  WAYS FORWARD  5.2.1. Use the methodology proposed to extend the analysis to additional  countries  Additional EU and EFTA countries could be analysed using the methodology outlined in this  report.  The methodology could be easily tailored and used to analyse cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and judiciary in countries other than EU Member State and EFTA countries, beginning with  candidate countries, potential candidate countries and neighbouring countries of the EU (27).  5.2.2. Use the results to develop additional training material  In its continuous effort to provide training material for the CSIRT community, including on  cooperation with the LE community and other operational communities (ENISA, n.d.), ENISA  has developed a handbook and a toolset (ENISA, 2021) based on the results outlined in this  current report. Additional training material could be developed based on the results of an  analysis extended to additional EU Member States and EFTA countries, and possibly candidate  countries, potential candidate countries and neighbouring countries of the EU.  5.2.3. Use the results to develop a catalogue of competences across  authorities in EU Member States and EFTA countries  A catalogue of the competences required during incident handling and cybercrime  investigations, with an indication of the authorities in each Member State and EFTA country that  could offer such competences, would help CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary become more aware of  (27) For more information on neighbouring countries of the EU, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-  euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring- countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en  https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  60  the skills and strengths of other communities in their country, and also across the EU and EFTA  area. This would allow authorities to learn from each other’s initiatives and also facilitate the  provision of expertise where required for incident handling and/or criminal investigation. Such a  catalogue of competences could be developed using information collected using this  methodology (slightly adapting the questionnaire and the SoD matrix, if necessary, to further  focus on competences).  5.2.4. Use the results to develop decision support systems  The results of an extended analysis could help complete the picture and serve as a basis for the  development of decision support systems that a CSIRT, LE or judiciary authority could easily  consult to obtain information on which authorities are responsible for, supporting, consulted  about and informed about a specific duty related to fighting cybercrime in one or more countries  (see Annex D for an example of how the SoD matrix can be used to develop a decision support  system). These support systems can aid in decision-making and in taking actions in cases  where the evidence is located in several countries.  5.2.5. Organise joint training and exercises for the three communities  Although there might be organisational and legal constraints against the participation of the  judiciary in joint training and exercises, wherever possible initiatives involving all three  communities should take place. This would help the communities better understand each  other’s capabilities, needs and boundaries, to enable them to better respond in practice to cyber  incidents of a criminal nature by exploiting synergies and avoiding interferences.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  61  6.

Example of completed SoD matrix  In the following table, an indicative example of a SoD matrix, completed using the RSCI  method, is presented. The broader scope of the SoD methodology on CSIRT–LE cooperation is  to develop a decision support system that could provide information related to the authorities  that can be contacted in the case of a cybersecurity incident/cybercrime. In particular, the user  of such a decision support system should be able to find the appropriate contact (i.e. the  authority or the community) who is responsible (R – as described in the RSCI method) for a  specific duty.  For instance, someone who is responsible for collecting cyberthreat intelligence in Romania  could use the SoD matrix to find who to contact, i.e. to find the CSIRT in Romania that is  responsible for performing this specific duty.  The data in the following table were provided by the Member State representatives who  participated in the interviews conducted for collecting data for this report. Although some  interviewees provided their consent for their affiliation and country to be included in the report,  information on countries and authorities have been removed from the table. A greater sample of  replies is needed to validate the data collected during the interviews and to enable official  results to be presented for each country.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  103  E ANNEX:  INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE  Questionnaire to Support the interviews with subject matter experts to collect data for the 2020  ENISA Report on CSIRTs and LE Cooperation.  The questions below have been prepared to support the interviews with subject matter experts  to collect data for the 2020 ENISA report on CSIRTs and LE cooperation along with their  interaction with the judiciary. This report contributes to the implementation of the ENISA  programming document 2020–2022 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-  documents/enisa-programming-document-202020132022) in particular “Output O.4.2.2 –  Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA and other  operational communities”.  The report is expected to be ready for publication by the end of 2020.  ENISA selected some external experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the  ENISA Call for Expression of Interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) to support the data  collection (including the interviews) and the drafting of this report.  The expected duration of the interview is 1 hour.  For more information regarding this questionnaire and the report, please contact: CSIRT-LE-  cooperation@enisa.europa.eu  Contact details  Interviewer:  Date of the interview:  Name of the interviewee:  Affiliation:  Position:  Country:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-202020132022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-202020132022 mailto:CSIRT-LE-cooperation@enisa.europa.eu mailto:CSIRT-LE-cooperation@enisa.europa.eu  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  104  Section 1 – Questions on general legal/organisational  aspects  1. What is the role of your organisation in fighting cybercrime activities?  2. Does your legal framework support the cooperation between CSIRT/LEA and  the interaction/information flow with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges) in  cybercrime proceedings and in general in responding to cybercrime? If so,  how?  3. Regarding cybercrime cases, could you briefly describe how information is  shared between CSIRTs – national and governmental in particular – LEAs,  prosecutors and judges?  QUESTIONS ON SEGREGATION OF DUTIES (SOD) MATRIX  4. Referring to the SoD matrix that was sent to you prior to this interview (and  you can also find it in Annex I at the end of this questionnaire), could you fill it  out by identifying for each duty which actor (CSIRT, LE, Prosecutors, Judges) in  your country is:   Responsible (R): responsible for performing this duty, is the decision-maker   Supporting (S): providing support when performing this duty (if applicable)   Consulted (C): consulted during the performance of this duty (if applicable)   Informed (I): informed when performing this duty? (if applicable)    SEE SoD MATRIX in ANNEX I at the end of this questionnaire  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  105  Section 2: Questions on possible synergies and potential  interferences  5. In your opinion, which are the possible synergies across CSIRT/LE and judiciary  during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have you  seen in reality such synergies taking place? Could you give us an example?  In your opinion, which are the potential interferences across CSIRT/LE and judiciary  during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have you seen in  reality such interference taking place? Could you provide an example?  Section 3 – Questions on challenges  6. Are there any specific challenges that you would like to mention about cooperation  across the CSIRT/LE and judiciary communities? If yes, what kind of challenges (e.g.  legal, organisational, technical, cultural).  7. Are there any challenges that you would like to mention in particular regarding  digital forensics and electronic evidence (e-evidence)?  Section 4 – Questions on competences and training  8. What are the competencies that your organisation/community has and could share  with the other communities (in particular CSIRT with LE/judiciary, LE with CSIRT, and  judiciary with CSIRT)?  9. Which competencies do you feel are lacking/could be improved in your  organisation/community and you might improve by learning from another  community (e.g. CSIRT from LE/judiciary, LE from CSIRT, and judiciary from CSIRT)  Does your organisation organise and/or participate in joint training across CSIRTs, LEAs and  judiciary (prosecutor and judges) communities? If yes, do you find them useful?  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  106  10. Section 5 – Question on COVID-19 pandemic crisis  11. Has the COVID-19 pandemic crisis changed the way CSIRT/LE/judiciary work together?  If yes, how so? Could you provide an example? (e.g. less meetings in person, but on the  other hand more communication via email and over the phone)  Section 6 – Question on cybersecurity certification of  forensic tools  12. Do you think that a cybersecurity certification of forensic tools would help the  CSIRT/LE/judiciary cooperation? (e.g. if CSIRTs use certified tools, the LE and Judiciary  might trust more the data provided by CSIRT and use them more easily as evidence in  court)  Section 7 – Question on any additional information or  comments  13. Would you like to share any additional information or provide us with any comment?

The data controller of the processing operation is ENISA Core Operations Department.  The legal basis for the processing operation is: Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725,  on the basis of Regulation (EU) 2019/881, in particular the provisions establishing the tasks of  ENISA. With the view of contributing to the fulfilment of such tasks and according to the ENISA  Programming Document 2020–2022 as approved by Management Board in Decision No  MB/2019/16 [2], ENISA is preparing a report to further enhance the cooperation between the  CSIRTs and the law enforcement along with their interaction with the judiciary (see Output  O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA and other  operational communities).  The purpose of this processing operation is to collect data via subject matter interviews for the  drafting of the ENISA report to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs and the law  enforcement along with their interaction with the judiciary.  The data processors of the processing operation will be external experts who will be  contracted by ENISA to support the data collection and drafting of the report. The interviews will  be conducted face-to-face, over the phone, via skype or with other means to be agreed with the  interviewee.  The following personal data are collected for the respondents of the interviews:  Contact and professional data: name, surname, community they belong to (e.g. CSIRT, LE,  prosecutors, judges, etc.), position, affiliation, country, email address, phone number (optional).  Replies to interviews: Note that the data produced by the data subjects’ replies to interviews are  not generally considered as personal data, since they are only of professional nature. Still, there  might be cases where a respondent produces ad hoc personal data, e.g. by disclosing during  the interview data relating to his/her private life or by expressing his/her specific personal  opinion regarding certain professional matters that may influence the behaviour or status of  other individuals. ENISA will make any possible effort to remove ad hoc personal data from the  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  108  replies to interviews. In all cases, the replies to interviews will be presented in the final report in  a fully aggregated form.  The recipients of the data will be designated ENISA staff involved in the data collection and  drafting of the report, as well as designated ENISA contractors supporting ENISA with the data  collection and the drafting of the report (data processors). Only when explicit written consent is  provided by the data subject, name, surname, affiliation, country, might be included in the  acknowledgements of the report. The data may also be available to EU bodies charged with  compliance monitoring and inspection tasks.  Personal data will be kept up to a maximum period of six months after the publication of the  report (possibly in December 2020). After the end of this period, the contact and professional data  will be manually deleted. However, replies to interviews will be kept by ENISA beyond this period  in an anonymised form (without linking to specific respondents) for future ENISA projects.  You have the right of access to your personal data and to relevant information concerning how  we use it. You have the right to rectify your personal data. Under certain conditions, you have the  right to ask that we delete your personal data or restrict their use. You have the right to object to  our processing of your personal data, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time.  We will consider your request, take a decision and communicate it to you.

This report follows a number of previous reports published by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA), including Tools and methodologies to support cooperation between  CSIRTs and law enforcement (ENISA, 2017), Improving cooperation between CSIRTs and law  enforcement: legal and organisational aspects, Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2017a), An Overview on Enhancing  Technical Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019a) and Roadmap of the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019b).  This report proposes a methodology to analyse the legal and organisational framework, the  roles and duties of CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary, and their required competences, as well as  synergies and potential interferences in their activities related to their responses to cyber  incidents and fight against cybercrime, respectively. In addition, this report aims to present a  detailed analysis focusing on some Member States (MSs) and European Free Trade  Association (EFTA) countries, namely Czechia (1), France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway,  Portugal, Romania and Sweden.  The data for this report were collected via desk research and interviews with subject-matter  experts. The data collected showed, among other things, that:   The communities make efforts to avoid interferences where possible and attempt to  create effective partnerships and take advantage of their synergies to support each  other in the fight against cybercrime; however, some interferences might occur during  incident handling and cybercrime investigations.   There are examples of joint training activities, mainly involving two communities (CSIRTs  and LEAs or LEAs and the judiciary, especially prosecutors) and, more rarely, involving  all three communities, in particular in the form of joint exercises. These joint training  activities help enhance overall the competences required to respond to cybercrime.   There has been no significant impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic on cooperation and interaction between the three communities and their  ability to function. In some instances, interaction among the communities has  increased, with even daily interactions, to ensure that each community is kept up to  date. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, the use of online tools to facilitate  meetings and events has become the norm.  This report, the 2020 handbook and the 2020 toolset on CSIRT and LE (law enforcement)  cooperation (ENISA, 2021) are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows:   The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences  across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and judiciary).   The handbook helps a trainer explain these concepts through scenarios.   The toolset contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  (1) Czechia has been the short-form name for the Czech Republic since 2016.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1.  BACKGROUND OF THE REPORT  This report follows up previous work in the area of Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) and law enforcement (LE) cooperation. With the view of enhancing the response to  cyberattacks and supporting the fight against cybercrime, this report aims to continue to  facilitate cooperation between the CSIRT and the LE communities and the extensions that this  collaboration may have to other communities, especially the judiciary. The ENISA Programming  Document 2020–2022 (ENISA, 2019) includes Objective 4.2 – Community building and  operational cooperation. Under this objective, Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA and other operational communities  anticipates as one of the deliverables a report on a topic emanating from the 2019 report on  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE.  The report presented here originates in particular from one of the recommendations of the 2019  report on cooperation between CSIRTs and LE entitled “An Overview on Enhancing Technical  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE” (ENISA, 2019a), namely:   ‘To promote the use of Segregation (or separation) of Duties (SoD) matrices to avoid  overlapping duties across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary in relation to the sharing  information’ (ENISA, 2019a, p. 35).  An overview and timeline of the previous work carried out by the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in the area of CSIRT and LE cooperation is presented in the figure  below (2).  Figure 1: Overview and timeline of previous ENISA work on CSIRT–LE cooperation  (2) All reports and training materials are available on the ENISA website under publications  (www.enisa.europa.eu/publications) and training resources (www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity- specialists/online-training-material).  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material http://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  8  This report, the 2020 handbook and the 2020 toolset on CSIRT and LE (law enforcement)  cooperation (ENISA, 2021) are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows:   The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences  across the three communities (CSIRTs, LE and judiciary).   The handbook helps a trainer explain these concepts through scenarios.   The toolset contains exercises for trainees based on these scenarios.  1.2.  REPORT OBJECTIVES  The main objectives of this report are to:   propose a methodology to analyse:  - the legal and organisational framework defining the roles and duties (3) of  CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary;  - the required competences (4) of LEAs and CSIRTs, especially national and  governmental CSIRTs;  - synergies and potential interferences in their activities related to their  responses to incidents of a criminal nature and their fight against cybercrime.   present, focusing on some Member States/European Free Trade Association (EFTA)  countries, a detailed analysis of the roles and duties of CSIRTs and LEAs and  required competences, showing synergies and potential interferences in their  activities related to their responses to incidents of a criminal nature and their fight  against cybercrime.  This report is meant to provide a basis for a further, more comprehensive analysis covering  additional Member States and EFTA countries. The methodology proposed could be used, with  some adaptation, for further analysis of candidate countries, potential candidate countries (5)  and neighbouring countries of the EU (6), as well as other countries.  1.3.  REPORT SCOPE  The report focuses on the cooperation of national and governmental (n/g) CSIRTs (7) with LEAs,  although most of the analysis is largely applicable to CSIRTs in general (i.e. other than n/g  CSIRTs).  No specific sector is targeted in this report; the results are applicable to the different levels of  cooperation between the three communities in response to incidents of a criminal nature and in  the fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to energy and from transport to health).  (3) The term ‘duties’, as used here, as well as in the SoD matrix and in other parts of the reports, is synonymous to the  term ‘tasks’.  (4) ‘Competency’ refers to a ‘combination of skills, knowledge, attributes and behaviours that enables an individual to  perform a task’ (IAEA, n.d., p. 5) For more information on competences see also (UN, n.d., p. 6) and (OECD, 2014).  (5) For a list of candidate countries and potential candidate countries see https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-  enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en  (6) For a list of neighbourhood countries see https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-  policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring- countries-eu_en  (7) ‘National/government (n/g) CSIRTs’ refers to teams ‘that serve a country’s government by helping to protect its  critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant  stakeholders at national level. They also bear responsibility for cooperation with other countries’ national and  governmental teams (ENISA, n.d.d)]” (ENISA, 2019c, p. 9).  https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  9  Following the methodology presented in this report (see Chapter 3), an analysis of the roles and  duties, required competences, and synergies and potential interferences has been conducted  and is presented in Chapter 4.  The general geographical scoping of the report is limited to EU/EFTA countries. The analysis  presented in Chapter 4 focuses in particular on:   Czechia;   France;   Germany;   Luxembourg;   Norway;   Portugal;   Romania;   Sweden.  This selection of countries was based on the following criteria:   geographical balance;   balance of different legal systems;   balance in terms of size (area and population) of the countries;   balance in terms of maturity of the CSIRT–LE cooperation.  This report does not seek to provide an exhaustive analysis; rather, it focuses on a small  number of topics affecting cooperation – in particular roles and duties, synergies and possible  overlaps and interferences, required competences – as might be of interest in cross-border  investigations.  In the future, this report is likely to be followed up with an extended version covering additional  countries.  1.4.  TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience of this report is:   CSIRTs, in particular n/g CSIRTs;   LE (8);   the judiciary (in this report this refers both to prosecutors (9) and to judges (10));   individuals and organisations with an interest in cybersecurity.  Policymakers and lawmakers may also benefit from particular aspects of the analysis presented  in this report as they prepare policies and legislation to enhance cooperation between  operational communities in responding to cyberattacks and fighting cybercrime, including  CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary, in the Member States and in jurisdictions interested in  cooperating with the EU in their transition to and affirmation of the rule of law.  (8) Similarly to previous ENISA reports, law enforcement (LE), law enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police  agencies are used synonymously; see, for instance, (ENISA, 2018).  (9) On the status and role of prosecutors, see (UNODC, 2014).  (10) On judges and principles to ensure their competence, independence and impartiality, see the European Charter on  the Statute for Judges (Council of Europe, 1998).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  10  2. DATA COLLECTION METHODS  This chapter describes the methods used to collect data for this report, starting with the desk  research that was undertaken using publicly available sources such as legislative acts, policy  reports, training programmes and other country-specific material. This is followed by a  description of the interviews that were conducted, which were semi-structured and guided by a  questionnaire, while allowing interviewees to discuss issues and topics pertinent to them and  provide additional information. Finally, a description is provided of the SoD matrix that was used  to collect additional data during the interviews to further support the research.  Qualitative research (11) was conducted for this report. A combination of research methods was  used to collect data for analysing CSIRT, LE and judiciary cooperation, roles and duties,  required competences, synergies and potential interferences in the selected Member  State/EFTA countries, in particular:   desk research;   subject matter expert interviews;   SoD matrix.  Desk research was also conducted to develop the methodology presented in Chapter 3, which  was also used to collect data for the analysis of the eight EU Member States and EFTA  countries presented in Chapter 4 and proposed for expanding the analysis to other countries.  The cut-off date for data collection was 31 August 2020; however, some input received at the  beginning of October 2020 has also been integrated in this report.  2.1.  DESK RESEARCH  Initially, desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources such as  legislative acts, policy reports, training programmes and country-specific sources, including  ENISA publications.  The first findings from this desk research were particularly useful for:   developing the methodology (presented in Chapter 3); and   drafting the questionnaire to support the interviews.  Additional desk research was carried out focused on specific topics considered relevant by the  project team following the analysis of the data collected during the initial desk research and the  interviews. For instance, some additional desk research was conducted on the role of certain  national bodies or joint initiatives mentioned during the interviews.  Desk research was also conducted to collect information on the included countries; the main  sources consulted for each country are listed in Annex A.  Some legal material (EU and national legal acts, but also legislation-related legal assessments,  policies and legal literature) covering areas such as principles of criminal procedure,  (11) Qualitative research is focused on explaining the reasons for people’s behaviour and understanding their opinions  and options while quantitative research aims to quantify attitudes, opinions or other defined variables to generalise  results from a population (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Interviewing is the most common format used for data collection in  qualitative research while the questionnaire is the research instrument that is used most widely for both quantitative  and qualitative approaches.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  11  comparative criminal law and procedure, and European law was consulted. No specific  thorough case law research was conducted on the role of CSIRTs in supporting the fight against  cybercrime; however, from the limited research undertaken, it appears that such case law is  rare and/or not publicly available.  In addition, documents such as the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU and specific country  National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSSs) (12) were reviewed.  Regarding aspects of cooperation and coordination between CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, in  addition to previous ENISA reports and projects, some reports by the European Commission,  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union  Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), the Council of Europe and Interpol were  also reviewed.  Academic publications were reviewed focusing on aspects such as the cybersecurity culture of  CSIRTs and their effectiveness, capacity building and international cooperation, as well as  national criminal justice practices.  Several course offerings and training programmes for CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, as well as  joint training initiatives, were reviewed, including, but not limited to, those provided by:   ENISA: ‘Trainings for Cybersecurity Specialists (ENISA, n.d.);   Task Force on Computer Security Incident Response Teams (TF-CSIRT):  ‘TRANSITS training: High-quality training for computer security teams’ (GÉANT,  n.d.);   Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST): ‘Trainings’ (FIRST,  n.d.);   European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL): ‘Education and  training’ (CEPOL, n.d.);   Europol European Cybercrime Centre (EC3): ‘Training and capacity building’  (Europol , n.d.);   European Judicial Training Network (EJTN, n.d.a);   Council of Europe: ‘Cybercrime Programme Office (C-PROC)’ (Council of Europe,  n.d.a);   Academy of European Law (ERA) (ERA, n.d.);   ENFORCE Project (13) (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  Examples of the course offerings and training programmes reviewed are presented in Annex B.  Several different sources were also consulted to collect country-specific information.  The main sources consulted for the drafting of this report are listed in Annex C, grouped  according to the following categories:   legal framework-related material;   policy reports;   ENISA reports in the area of CSIRT and LE cooperation;  (12) The ENISA NCSS Interactive Map lists all of the documents of the NCSSs in the EU, together with their strategic  objectives and good examples of implementation. The map is available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies- interactive-map  (13) ‘ENFORCE is an 18-month European project co-funded by the European Commission in the framework of the  Internal Security Fund – Police.’ The project was concluded in May 2020. ‘The ENFORCE project aims at designing,  setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This curriculum will be  validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g. law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs)  and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together using state-of-the-art training technology. ENFORCE project  is coordinated by CEIS and a partnership between CIRCL, French Ministry of Interior and CEIS’ (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  12   training-related material;   country-specific material;   academic papers;   other material.  The search for policy reports took place from April to June 2020 using the following keywords:  cybercrime, cybersecurity, national cybersecurity strategy, CSIRT, cybercrime legislation,  criminal code, Budapest Convention, law enforcement, prosecutors, judiciary, criminal court,  training, e-evidence.  2.2.  INTERVIEWS  A questionnaire was designed to collect data through semi-structured interviews with experts  from the selected countries.  The questionnaire was developed through several rounds of internal reviews to ensure that it  was appropriate and relevant. The questionnaire was piloted and following the pilot interviews a  few changes, mainly editorial, were made.  The questionnaire was divided into the following sections:   Section 1: General and organisational aspects;   Section 2: Possible synergies and potential interferences;   Section 3: Challenges;   Section 4: Competences and training;   Section 5: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;   Section 6: Certification of forensic tools.   Section 7: Any additional information and comments  The questionnaire consisted of 14 open questions; in one question the interviewees were asked  to fill in a SoD matrix (further details on the SoD matrix are provided in section 2.3). The  interviewees were given the possibility of providing additional input and comments as free text.  The questionnaire was sent to the interviewees before the interviews.  Twenty interviews were conducted. The interviewees were carefully selected to ensure that the  data collected would be as consistent as possible across the different communities (CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary) and countries. One representative each from a CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  from each country was identified, mostly in a top/middle management role and with a good  understanding or experience of cooperation between communities within their own country and  possibly across the EU.  The interviews took place between June and August 2020. Unless the interviewees asked for  an interview in person, the interviews were conducted by telephone. Interviews lasted for  approximately 1 hour. To ensure that the data collected were of the highest quality, two  members of the project team – in most cases at least one ENISA expert and one Call for  Expressions of Interest (CEI) subject matter expert (14) – participated in the interviews and took  detailed notes. After the interviews these detailed notes were sent to the interviewees for  validation.  2.3.  SOD MATRIX  In addition to the desk research and interview questions, a SoD matrix was used to collect data.  The interviewees were sent the matrix, together with the questionnaire, before the interviews.  (14) For more information on CEI Experts see Section 2.4.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  13  During the interview they were asked to identify which actor(s) in their country for each of the  given duties is Responsible, Supporting (if applicable), Informed (if applicable) and Consulted (if  applicable). Some interviewees preferred to fill in the matrix after the interview and send it back  by email.  SoD is a control that is used to ensure compliance with laws and regulations; it is already well  known in financial accounting systems. In particular, regulatory mandates such as the  Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 (US Congress, 2002) and the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act  (GLBA) (US Congress, 1999) introduced the concept of SoD and associated it with information  technology (IT) organisation.  The importance of roles and duties has also been highlighted more recently in the General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Parliament and Council of the European Union,  2016a). The SoD is also presented in the ISO 27001 standard (ISO, n.d.) as one of the potential  controls used for ensuring implementation and operation of information security within the  organisation (control A.6.1.2 from Annex A of the ISO 27001 standard). Conflicting duties and  areas of responsibilities should be segregated to reduce the risk of exposure to unauthorised or  unintentional modification or misuse.  Thus, applying a SoD is a crucial aspect of an effective risk management strategy. In the  context of CSIRT and LE cooperation, the risks that the communities may be exposed to are:   reciprocal interference in the performances of duties;   duplication of efforts because of overlapping duties;   delays during a cybercrime investigation because of improper allocation of duties;  which could lead to:   ineffective management of a cybersecurity incident and/or loss of information  important for the investigation or of electronic evidence to prove the crime.  The SoD approach mandates a separation between actors performing different duties. Detected  conflicts can be better managed as the actors, i.e. the CSIRTs, LE and judiciary, will be aware  of the other communities’ duties.  The SoD approach for the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities was proposed in the 2018  ENISA report Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE: interaction with the judiciary (ENISA,  2018). In 2019, this matrix was developed further and the updated version was published in the  2019 report An overview on enhancing technical cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA,  2019a) and the Roadmap on the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019b).  Indicative examples of completed SoD matrices are provided in the 2019 ENISA Training  material on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA, n.d.c). It should be noted that the content of this  framework was validated by the Member States during the 8th ENISA/EC3 Workshop that took  place in November 2019 (ENISA, n.d.n); the workshop participants provided feedback and their  views have been considered in the version of the SoD matrix presented in this report.  The SoD matrix used to collect data for this report and proposed as a methodology to collect  data on CSIRT and LE cooperation is presented in more detail in Section 3.3. This SoD matrix  is inspired by COBIT (15) methodology, in particular COBIT 5 (ISACA, n.d.), especially by the  (15) COBIT (‘Formerly known as Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT); with this iteration  used only as the acronym’) is ‘a broad and comprehensive I&T governance and management framework and  continues to establish itself as a generally accepted framework for I&T governance’ (ISACA, n.d.). This SoD matrix is  inspired by COBIT 5 (released in 2012); however, it should be noted that there is a newer version of COBIT, COBIT  2019. ‘Earlier versions of COBIT – [including COBIT 5] – focused on IT, whereas COBIT 2019 focuses on  information and technology aimed at the whole enterprise, recognizing that I&T has become crucial in the support,  sustainability and growth of enterprises’. For more information see (ISACA, n.d. a).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  14  ‘RACI’ charts (for more information on RACI charts, see, for instance, (Tomczack, 2014)). In  COBIT 5 methodology the RACI charts are introduced to ensure the correct allocation of tasks  within an organisation, with RACI denoting Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed.  The use of a responsibility assignment matrix such as the RACI charts, which describe  participation in different roles, allows more detailed input than the symbols that have been used  in previous ENISA studies on CSIRT and LE cooperation. Although responsibility assignment  matrices are offered by various frameworks, the role distinction presented in COBIT 5 seemed  to better fit the needs of this project. It should be noted that the COBIT 5 framework was not  implemented in this study; however, the methodology used for collecting data was inspired by  its RACI charts.  In the SoD matrix used to collect data for this report and proposed as a methodology to collect  data on CSIRT–LE cooperation, namely ‘RSCI’, the four possible roles for CSIRTs, LE,  prosecutors and judges concern the performance of duties related to (supporting) cybercrime-  fighting activities: Responsible (R), Supporting (S) (if applicable), Consulted (C) (if applicable),  and informed (I) (if applicable).  Figure 2 depicts the roles that can be assigned to the communities when they perform their  duties, comparing them with those presented in the COBIT 5 RACI charts. The roles that were  used to collect data for this project are highlighted in blue. The new role that replaced  ‘accountable’ in COBIT 5 is highlighted in light blue. It should be noted that when a community  is ‘responsible’ for a specific duty its representatives are also accountable when performing this  duty.  Figure 2: RSCI method used to collect data  The SoD matrix has been converted to a Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) Galaxy  ‘matrix’ format and made available on GitHub, together with some additional documentation (16).  For this project, a JSON file (17) was created that can be easily converted to the data format that  is supported not only by MISP but also by other sharing platforms that are accessible by both  CSIRTs and LE. As mentioned in the 2019 ENISA report on technical cooperation between  CSIRTs and LE (ENISA, 2019a), MISP seems to be the most popular information sharing  platform used by both communities. ‘MISP Galaxy is a simple method used to express a large  object called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or attributes’ (GitHub, n.d.). MISP  Galaxies and Clusters can be added to MISP events and attributes for additional context and  clarification. For instance, they can be used in MISP instances where LEAs/CSIRTs carry out  joint threat research.

CONTRIBUTION BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS  ENISA selected nine external subject matter experts, of whom eight were selected from the List  of Network and Information Security (NIS) Experts compiled following the ENISA CEI (ref.  ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.m).  Of these nine experts, five contributed to this report by supporting data collection (interviews  and desk research) and report drafting; one contributed in particular to the desk research and  the development of the methodology; one acted as the editor and coordinator of the input; and  two reviewed the report over several rounds, including the first draft in April 2020, the  intermediate draft in June 2020 and the final draft in August 2020 (these reviews were in  addition to the reviews by ENISA reviewers and other external reviewers).  All nine contributed on an individual basis by their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime,  including but not limited to technical, legal, organisational and behavioural aspects of CSIRT  and LE cooperation.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  16  3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY  This chapter presents in detail the methodology suggested for the analysis of roles, synergies  and potential interferences between CSIRT, LE and judiciary cooperation in specific countries in  the desk research. This methodology has been piloted and used for the data collection for the  current report and can be used for analysing additional countries.  The description of the desk research is followed by a description of the questionnaire to collect  data via semi-structured interviews. Finally, the SoD matrix is proposed to support and/or  complement the semi-structured interviews.  3.1.  DESK RESEARCH  The desk research aims to collect information on:   roles and duties;   synergies and potential interferences;   required competences.  To collect this information, with a focus on specific countries, the following sources are  proposed to be consulted:   national laws and other legal acts, including but not necessarily limited to:  o constitutions;  o criminal codes;  o criminal procedural codes;  o other laws specific to cybercrime and e-evidence, including laws  implementing relevant EU law (18) and laws implementing the Council of  Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2003);   NCSSs;   policy documents;   official websites of national and governmental CSIRTs, including their  RFC2350 (19);   official police websites, especially the pages dedicated to fighting cybercrime  activities;   official websites of prosecution offices, especially the pages dedicated to fighting  cybercrime activities;   official websites of criminal courts, especially the pages dedicated to fighting  cybercrime activities;   information dedicated to the different countries on the following portals/web  pages:  o ENISA National Cyber Security Strategies – Interactive Map  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-  map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map);  (18) For an overview of the relevant EU legal framework see (ENISA, 2017a).  (19) An RFC2350 (where ‘RFC’ stands for Request for Comments) provides basic information about a CSIRT, its  channels of communication and its roles and responsibilities. For more details on RFC2350 see (Brownlee &  Guttman, 1998).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  17  o ENISA CSIRTs by Country – Interactive Map  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-  country-interactive-map);  o FIRST members (https://www.first.org/members/map);  o Trusted Introducer (TI) European database of CSIRTs (20)  (https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/index.html);  o Europol website (https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-  agreements/member-states);  o Eurojust website  (http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/about/background/Pages/History.aspx);  o Council of Europe website (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/47-members-  states);  o e-Justice Portal (https://e-justice.europa.eu and https://beta.e-  justice.europa.eu – beta version);  o European Judicial Network (EJN) (https://www.ejn-  crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/Ejn_Home/EN) and in particular the following pages:  o ‘Info about national systems’ (https://www.ejn-  crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/ejn_infoaboutall.aspx);  o ‘e-Evidence’ (https://www.ejn-  crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_DynamicPage/EN/83);   courses and training for CSIRTs, LE, prosecutors and judges, focusing on preventing  and fighting cybercrime.  The desk research aims to collect data on the competences that are needed for CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary to perform their roles and duties related to fighting cybercrime. Special focus  should also be given to training initiatives to facilitate cooperation across the communities.  3.2.  QUESTIONNAIRE  The following questionnaire can be used to support semi-structured interviews to collect data on  roles and duties, required competences, synergies and potential interferences:  Section 1 – Questions on general legal/organisational aspects  1. What is the role of your organisation in fighting cybercrime activities?  2. Does your legal framework support the cooperation between CSIRT/LEA and the  interaction/information flow with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges) in  cybercrime  3. Regarding cybercrime cases, could you briefly describe how information is shared  between CSIRTs – national and governmental in particular – LEAs, prosecutors  and judges?  Segregation of duties (SoD) matrix  4. Referring to the SoD matrix that was sent to you before this interview […], could  you fill it out by identifying for each duty which actor (CSIRT, LE, Prosecutors,  Judges) in your country is:  o Responsible (R): responsible for performing this duty, is the decision-maker  o Supporting (S): providing support when performing this duty (if applicable)  o Consulted (C): consulted during the performance of this duty (if applicable)  o Informed (I): informed when performing this duty? (if applicable)  (20) The Trusted Introducer (TI) maintains the European database of CSIRTs (also known as CERTs) and security  teams. See https://www.trusted-introducer.org  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map https://www.first.org/members/map https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/index.html https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-agreements/member-states https://www.europol.europa.eu/partners-agreements/member-states http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/about/background/Pages/History.aspx https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/47-members-states https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/47-members-states https://e-justice.europa.eu/ https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/ https://beta.e-justice.europa.eu/ https://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/Ejn_Home/EN https://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/Ejn_Home/EN https://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/ejn_infoaboutall.aspx https://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/ejn_infoaboutall.aspx https://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_DynamicPage/EN/83 https://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_DynamicPage/EN/83 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  18  Section 2 – Questions on possible synergies and potential interferences  5. In your opinion, which are the possible synergies across CSIRT/LE and judiciary  during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have you seen  in reality such synergies taking place? Could you give us an example?  6. In your opinion, which are the potential interferences across CSIRT/LE and  judiciary during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have  you seen in reality such interference taking place? Could you provide an example?  Section 3 – Questions on challenges  7. Are there any specific challenges that you would like to mention about cooperation  across the CSIRT/LE and judiciary communities? If yes, what kind of challenges  (e.g. legal, organisational, technical, cultural)?  8. Are there any challenges that you would like to mention in particular regarding  digital forensics and electronic evidence (e-evidence)?  Section 4 – Questions on competences and training  9. What are the competencies that your organisation/community has and could share  with the other communities (in particular CSIRT with LE/judiciary, LE with CSIRT,  and judiciary with CSIRT)?  10. Which competencies do you feel are lacking/could be improved in your  organisation/community and you might improve by learning from another  community (e.g. CSIRT from LE/judiciary, LE from CSIRT, and judiciary from  CSIRT)?  11. Does your organisation organise and/or participate in joint training across CSIRTs,  LEAs and judiciary (prosecutor and judges) communities? If yes, do you find them  useful?  Section 5 – Question on covid-19 pandemic crisis  12. Has the COVID-19 pandemic crisis changed the way CSIRT/LE/judiciary work  together? If yes, how so? Could you provide an example? (e.g. fewer meetings in  person, but on the other hand more communication via email and over the phone)  Section 6 – Question on cybersecurity certification of forensic tools  13. Do you think that a cybersecurity certification of forensic tools would help the  CSIRT/LE/judiciary cooperation? (e.g. if CSIRTs use certified tools, the LE and  Judiciary might trust more the data provided by CSIRT and use them more easily  as evidence in court)  Section 7 – Question on any additional information or comments  14. Would you like to share any additional information or provide us with any  comment?  The complete questionnaire is presented in Annex E.  3.3.  SOD MATRIX  To complement and support data collection using the desk research and the semi-structured  interviews, the SoD matrix in Table 1 is proposed to be used to collect data on the different  roles  of CSIRT, LE and judiciary, in the different phases of a cybercrime investigation. The  development of this SoD matrix is described in Section 2.3, while a detailed description of the  different roles and guidelines on how to fill in the matrix are provided below.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  19  Table 1: SoD matrix used to collect data by implementing the RSCI method  Version 1.6 of 5 June 2020   Responsible (R): Who is responsible for performing this duty?

Reviewing the response and  updating policies and  procedures  As it was the case for the data collection for this report, the matrix in Table 1 can be sent to  interviewees along with the questionnaire before the interviews.  Some explanations on the matrix are provided below:   At the top of the SoD matrix the four possible roles that each actor (CSIRTs, LE,  prosecutors and judges) may play are listed and explained: Responsible (R),  Supporting (S) (if applicable), Consulted (C) (if applicable), and informed (I) (if  applicable).   In the rows, the duties are listed and numbered for convenience (e.g. 10. Collecting  data that may be evidence/evidence collection). It should be noted that ‘duties’ refers  to the tasks performed by the communities during the cybercrime investigation phases.   Columns 2–5 refer to the key actors throughout the cybercrime investigation life cycle:  CSIRTs, LE, prosecutors and judges.   In this matrix, the interviewees were asked to indicate which role(s) each actor  (CSIRTs, LE, prosecutors, judges) plays in the performance of duties during a  cybercrime (supporting)-fighting activity. In particular, the interviewees were asked to  identify whether the CSIRT, LE, the prosecutor or the judge ‘Responsible’ for a  particular duty and, if applicable, which other actor is responsible for ‘Supporting’ the  performance of that duty, and who is ‘Consulted’ or ‘Informed’ during the performance  of that duty.   Column 6 (optional) is used to capture information on training topics that need to be  covered for the communities to be able to successfully perform their tasks. It should be  noted that the training needs are directly linked to the competences required for the  performance of the specific duties.   Column 7 is used for any additional information an interviewee might provide, with the  aim of recording possible synergies and potential interferences, especially for those  cases where a task is performed by more than one community.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  21  An example of how to fill in the SoD matrix using the RSCI method is presented in Table 2. A  LEA has been asked to indicate the roles that each community plays when ‘collecting data that  may be evidence’.   The LEA is Responsible (R) for evidence collection while the CSIRT is Supporting (S)  this cybercrime-fighting activity, as it also collects evidence that may be useful for LE.   The prosecutor may be Consulted (C) and Informed (I) during the evidence collection  phase to provide guidance on the types of data that need to be collected and to  confirm if these data are admissible in criminal proceedings. Judges do not participate  in this activity.  Table 2: Example of completed information related to one duty in the SoD matrix   Responsible (R): Who is responsible for performing this duty?

COUNTRY FOCUS  This chapter presents the analysis of the data collected using the methodology outlined in  Chapter 3 for the following MSs/EFTA countries:   Czechia;   France;   Germany;   Luxembourg;   Norway;   Portugal;   Romania;   Sweden.  For each country, first, an analysis of the roles and duties of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary is  provided. This is followed by a description of synergies and potential interferences. Finally,  some examples of existing training programmes are provided.  The country profile analysis was based on desk research and interviews with CSIRTs, LE and  some judiciary representatives. Contributions from the interviewees are acknowledged in the  report. However, the following points should be noted:   For consistency, the names of those interviewed are not provided, as some  interviewees requested not to be named in the report.   Interviewees provided their contributions based on their knowledge and expertise and  were not acting as representatives of their country.  In each country section, a subsection is dedicated to the ‘roles and duties’ of competent  authorities and departments that perform duties related to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  The tables of competent authorities and departments provided are not exhaustive but rather aim  to present the reader with a quick overview. Additional information on the authorities and  departments and their roles and duties can be found in the subsections that follow these tables.  It should be noted that each country has its own organisations in terms of CSIRTs, including  national and governmental CSIRTs (as well as other CSIRTs), and also LE and judiciary  authorities.  4.1.  CZECHIA  Czechia is a ‘parliamentary republic with a head of government, the prime minister – and a head  of state, the president. The country is divided into 14 regions, including the capital, Prague’  (European Union, n.d.a).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Czechia is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Czech legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  In 2014 Czechia adopted its NCSS for 2015–2020 (NBÚ, 2015) (ENISA, n.d.e)). Cybersecurity  has been regulated by the Cyber Security Act since 2014 (NCKB, 2014). The Cyber Security  Act regulates the rights and obligations of persons, as well as the powers and competences of  public authorities, in the field of cybersecurity. It also implements relevant EU provisions  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  23  (transposing, for example, the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council, 2016)) and  regulates the security requirements for electronic communications networks and information  systems.  4.1.1.  Roles and duties  In Czechia, the following authorities and departments play a role in and perform duties related  to preventing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in  English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Cyber and Information Security  Agency (NCISA)  Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační  bezpečnost  NÚKIB  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Národní centrum kybernetické bezpečnosti  NCKB  GovCert.CZ: Government CERT of the  Czech Republic  GovCERT.CZ: Vládní CERT České republiky GovCERT.CZ  National CSIRT of the Czech Republic Národní CSIRT České republiky CSIRT.CZ  Police of the Czech Republic – National  Centre Against Organized Crime – Unit of  Special Activities  Národní centrála proti organizovanému zločinu  – Útvar zvláštních činností  NCOZ – ÚZČ  Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Offices and  Judges  Nejvyšší státní zastupitelství České republiky  4.1.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) is responsible for the  implementation of the NCSS in Czechia. It is ‘the central administrative body for cyber security,  including the protection of classified information in the field of information and communication  systems and cryptographic protection’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). It can also act as an ‘expert’ on  cybersecurity issues for LE and provide technical help in criminal investigations. NCISA  ‘operate[s] the government security team, the so-called Government CERT of the Czech  Republic (GovCERT.CZ)’ (NÚKIB, n.d. a). It also engages in dialogue with the other EU  Member States. NCISA cooperates with other national and foreign CSIRTs, supports education  and research and development in the field of cybersecurity, performs security audits and  exercises, and engages in international cooperation and policy work. It also offers legal and  policy support in the field of cybersecurity to other governmental bodies and their CSIRTs.  4.1.1.2. CSIRTs  In Czechia, there are officially two nationwide CSIRT teams recognized by the Cyber Security  Act: the governmental CERT (GovCERT.CZ) and a national CSIRT (CSIRT.CZ).  GovCERT.CZ is a public entity operated by the executive section of NCISA. GovCERT.CZ’s  ‘goal is to help [the critical information infrastructure and the state bodies] to effectively face  security challenges, react on the incidents, coordinate actions to solve them and effectively  prevent them’ (NÚKIB, n.d.). Its ‘constituency are public sector institutions and critical  information infrastructure of the Czech Republic’ (NCBK, 2015, p. 8). Operators of these  infrastructures are required by law to report cybersecurity incidents to NCISA. GovCERT.CZ is  therefore responsible for the evaluation of, and coordination of the response to, severe incidents  and the sharing of relevant information about incidents or threats with relevant authorities,  operators of relevant infrastructures and the public. GovCERT.CZ/NCISA may require regulated  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  24  entities to implement reactive or preventive measures in reaction to specific cybersecurity  incidents and threats.  CSIRT.CZ is a private entity operated by the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC on the basis of a  public contract arranged with NCISA. CSIRT.CZ fulfils the role of a national CSIRT, as defined  in the Cyber Security Act. It collects mandatory reports of cybersecurity incidents from operators  of important networks and digital services, coordinates the response to them and shares data  and information with GovCERT.CZ.  There are three main reasons why there are two nationwide CSIRTs in Czechia. The first  reason is because of the principle of the minimisation of state intervention – it is not necessary  for the state to strictly regulate all operators of information infrastructures; therefore,  GovCERT.CZ deals only with the most important infrastructures in terms of national security  and provides other infrastructures with the opportunity to cooperate through the national CSIRT.  The second reason is that private infrastructure operators are more willing to cooperate with  another private entity than with the state; therefore, a greater intensity and scope of cooperation  between the infrastructure operators and the private national CSIRT is expected. The third  reason is that a public institution can do only what the law expressly allows, whereas the private  national CSIRT can be much more creative in coordinating and organising the response to  cybersecurity incidents, as it can act praeter legem and can do anything that the law does not  explicitly prohibit it from doing (Government of the Czech Republic, 2020).  4.1.1.3. LE  The National Centre against Organized Crime (Národní centrála proti organizovanému  zločinu – NCOZ) was established in 2016 by merging the Organized Crime Detection Unit  (Útvar pro odhalování organizovaného zločinu – ÚOOZ) and the Corruption and Financial Crime  Detection Unit (Útvar pro odhalování korupce a finanční criminality – ÚOKFK). It currently plays  a key role in the fight against cybercrime in Czechia. As a central body, it specialises in the fight  against organised and large-scale cybercrime and cybercrime against critical and important  information infrastructures. NCOZ also plays a coordinating role and a role in the preparation of  standard and recommended procedures for cybercrime investigations.  The Unit of Special Activities (Útvar zvláštních činností – ÚZČ) of the Police of the Czech  Republic intercepts and records telecommunication traffic, conducts surveillance of persons and  objects, and collects digital evidence and carries out other specialised actions aimed at securing  such evidence.  At the regional level there are information crime units at each of the regional criminal police  directorates. These units include specialists and have technical equipment for investigating  cybercrime and securing electronic evidence. They conduct investigations and provide support  and technical equipment in cybercrime investigations to lower organisational units.  4.1.1.4. Judiciary  ‘The Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Czech Republic is the competent central  authority in the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings whereas the Ministry of Justice of Czechia  is the competent central authority for the trial stage of criminal proceedings and when the  execution of sentences is concerned’ (Council of Europe, n.d.b).  A network of prosecutors specialising in cybercrime has been formally established at the  national level (Council of the European Union, 2017).  At the level of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and courts, an informal expert group has been set  up at the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, which focuses on computer crime.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  25  Judges in Czechia are independent in the performance of their duties and there is no  specialisation of judges in criminal chambers. Cases are therefore assigned to judges according  to a random key and it is up to each judge to educate themselves on the issue at hand.  However, because of the increasing number of cybercrime cases, as well as cases in which  familiarisation with the issue of electronic evidence is necessary, there is an increased interest  in this area on the part of the judges. There is also a clear effort on the part of prosecutors and  the police to provide relevant information on the context of, and to explain the technical details  of, cases, including in cooperation with CSIRTs, academia and other members of the  professional public.  Czechia cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.1.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As in most countries, useful synergies and also at the same time reciptocal potential  interferences in the activities of individual communities can be identified. In general,  representatives of these communities agreed that, if the activities of individual communities are  coordinated, they are significantly more effective. In such cases, individual communities can  support each other and share specific competences, powers, knowledge, information and  equipment.  Over the last few years, many steps have been taken to strengthen the effectiveness of  intercommunity cooperation. The Cyber Security Act has been adopted, regulating the  obligation to provide information and formulating the powers of NCISA and national and  governmental CSIRTs; a memorandum was concluded between NCISA and the police; the  position of liaison officer to enable police and CSIRT coordination was established; and  cooperation mechanisms have been set up and implemented. These steps have led to many  synergistic effects. In particular, they enable the immediate and effective bilateral transfer of  information on threats and incidents between LE and CSIRTs, the mutual use of professional  and technical capabilities of individual communities, mutual assistance in actions to fulfil  relevant obligations, and cooperation with other communities. One synergistic effect specifically  identified during the interviews is that CSIRTs share with LE information obtained from a  constituency or cooperating alliances that would otherwise be unavailable to LE. However,  although these synergies are particularly evident between CSIRTs and LE, they are relatively  new in the case of the judiciary.  There are also some interferences that may occur between the communities. According to the  interviewees the most important potential interference relates to the collection of digital  evidence and stems from the differences between the goals and approaches of the different  communities. Activities of CSIRTs focused on the mitigation of cyber incidents may seriously  hinder collection of the evidence necessary for a criminal investigation, or even destroy it or  render it inadmissible at court. In addition, one of the limitations of cooperation identified during  the interviews is the effort made by CSIRTs to maintain trust within their constituencies.  Although CSIRTs recommend that victims of cybercrime report incidents to and cooperate with  LEAs, they sometimes refuse to do so for different reasons. In such cases CSIRTs are  discouraged from sharing information about relevant incidents with LE because they fear a loss  of trust on the part of their constituency. Another limitation identified is the lack of  understanding, specifically between CSIRT and LE community technical experts and the  judiciary.  During the interviews, the following recommendations were formulated by the interviewees:   provide more coordination of activities – through training, more precise legal and  procedural regulation and cooperation mechanisms;   provide transparent information-sharing mechanisms;  INTERCOMMUNITY  COOPERATION  Cooperation  mechanisms have  been set up and  implemented  [enabling] immediate  and effective bilateral  transfer of information  on threats and  incidents between LE  and CSIRTs.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  26   strengthen cooperation with the judiciary (CSIRT–LE cooperation is mostly already  in place);   provide better descriptions of individual groups/units, so that everyone knows who  to contact and when;   implement sustainable and trustworthy cooperation routines for all the institutions  involved;   involve all of the communities in training; the training should be focused on the  ability to rapidly share information between all communities.  4.1.3. Examples of training  The Action Plan of the Cyber Security Strategy of Czechia (NCKB) considers promoting the  development of Czechia’s police capabilities with regard to cybercrime. It mainly aims to:   reinforce the personnel of individual police cybercrime departments;   modernise the technological equipment of specialised police departments;   develop cooperation with foreign counterparts;   provide professional education and training to police specialists, including  language training.  The Conception of the Development of Capabilities of the Police of Czechia to Investigate  Cybercrime was drafted by the Police Presidium of Czechia and adopted by the National  Security Council in October 2015 (Council of the European Union, 2017).  Actions aimed at the prevention and public awareness of cybercrime are carried out by several  authorities within Czechia, such as the National Cyber Security Centre, LEAs, the private sector,  academia and non-governmental organisations.  The National Cybersecurity Competence Centre (NC3) (National Cybersecurity Competence  Centre , n.d.) at Masaryk University, Brno (Masaryk University , n.d.), has developed a special  tool, KYPO (Kybernetický polygon), which is a cyber range platform (KYPO, n.d.), and built a  laboratory that is used to organise cybersecurity exercises. These consist of large-scale  exercises held two to four times a year, with smaller exercises taking place a couple of times a  month, and are offered to public authorities, businesses and education providers. NC3 offers  training to judicial and police academies, investigators and public prosecutors. NCISA, in  cooperation with NC3, also organises the annual Cyber Czech exercise using KYPO and its  laboratory (21).  Law enforcement and judicial authorities are provided with professional training on cybercrime.  The aim is to establish standard practices and knowledge for the detection and investigation of  cybercrime, with the main focus being to secure digital traces and evidence. Certain educational  activities on dealing with cybercrime also take place at Secondary Police Schools of the Ministry  of the Interior. Participation in national and international exercises in the field of cybersecurity,  organised by GovCERT.CZ, also serve as professional training.  The Police Academy (The Police Academy of the Czech Republic, n.d.) also takes cybercrime  into account in its lifelong training for officers. These training activities are organised with  CEPOL and many of the courses are the result of the EMPACT initiatives (Europol, n.d.d).  The Judicial Academy (The Judicial Academy, n.d.) organises training activities for LE and  prosecutors on cybercrime and electronic evidence in cooperation with the Police Academy.  (21) This is the main cybersecurity exercise organised by Czechia – it is focused mainly on technical issues, but also  deals with cooperation, legal and organisational issues. It involves the simulation of cooperation between CSIRTs,  the police, the media, data protection authorities, users, other infrastructure operators, etc. For more information see  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech.  https://csirt.muni.cz/projects/cyber-czech  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  27  Finally, tabletop exercises take place between CSIRTs and LE and help to improve  communication.  4.2.  FRANCE  France is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, appointed  by the president who is the directly elected head of state. France’s territory consists of 18  administrative regions – 13 metropolitan (i.e. European France) and 5 overseas regions’  (European Union, n.d.f).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in France is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant French legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  France adopted its updated NCSS in 2015 (ANSSI, n.d.) (ENISA, n.d.h). ‘An initial cybersecurity  strategy was developed in France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011’ (Prime  Minister of France, 2015, p. 7).  4.2.1. Roles and duties  In France, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.

National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité  des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is responsible for implementing the NCSS in France. ‘The  role of ANSSI is to foster a coordinated, ambitious, pro-active response to cybersecurity issues  in France, to drive raising-awareness actions, as well as to spread French vision and expertise,  and European values, abroad’ (ANSSI, n.d. a).  4.2.1.2. CSIRTs  France has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT-FR (French government CERT,  Centre gouvernemental de veille, d’alerte et de réponse aux attaques informatiques).  CERT-FR is part of ANSSI. ‘Its mission is to coordinate and investigate IT security incident  response for the French government, critical national infrastructure operators and operators of  essential services as defined by the French law.  CERT-FR’s missions cover prevention, detection, response and recovery by:   Helping to prevent security incidents by setting up necessary protection measures;   Detecting vulnerabilities on networks and systems;   Managing incident response, with the support of trusted partners if necessary;   Organizing trusted networks of CSIRT’ (ANSSI, 2018).  As a national CSIRT it is the preferred international contact point for any cyber-related incident  affecting France. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week..  CERT-FR is a member of well-known networks of CSIRTs such as the CSIRTs Network, the  FIRST and it participates in the TF-CSIRT activities. CERT-FR also creates a French initiative to  structure the national incident response ecosystem called InterCERT-FR. As part of ANSSI,  CERT-FR also work closely with the CyCLONe’s officers.  CSIRT of the Judicial Police (CSIRT Police Judiciaire – CSIRT-PJ) is the CSIRT of the Central  Directorate of the Judicial Police, operating under the Cybercrime Centre (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.).  CSIRT-PJ aims to provide LE with CSIRT-like services: incident response, threat intelligence,  and malware analysis tooling. It is a member of TF-CSIRT (listed) and belongs to the French  CSIRT community called InterCERT-FR.  4.2.1.3. LE  The National Police (Police nationale) has the principal mission of fighting against any form of  criminality and delinquency including cybercrime. One of the directorates of the National Police  is the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (Direction centrale de la police judiciaire –  DCPJ), which performs investigative tasks and supports the prosecution service in cybercrime  cases. Within the DCPJ, a sub-directorate for ICT-related offences has been established for the  fight against cybercrime (Sous-direction de lutte contre la cybercriminalité – SDLC), which  includes the Central Office for Combating Information and Communication Technology Crime  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  29  (Office Central de lutte contre la Criminalité liée aux Technologies de l’iInformation et de la  Communication – OCLCTIC) (22), a cyber-intelligence unit.  The National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) is a branch of the French Armed Forces  that is placed, as far as its civilian role goes, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.  The Central Criminal Intelligence Service of the National Gendarmerie (Service central de  renseignement criminel de la Gendarmerie nationale – SCRCGN) is responsible for providing  information and a precise understanding of organised and mass crime, to guide actions in the  fight against crime in the pre-judicial and judicial phases. In parallel, within the SCRCGN, the  Centre for the Fight against Digital Crimes (Centre de lutte contre les criminalités numériques –  C3N) aims to conduct or coordinate investigations of national scope relating to cybercrime, and  to carry out permanent surveillance of the internet, to detect and collect evidence of any  offences that may be committed there.  Under the structure of the Paris Police Prefecture (Préfecture de police), the Cybercrime Unit  (Brigade de lutte contre la cybercriminalité – BL2C) is assigned with cybercrime investigation  tasks, in the capacity of judicial police (CSIRT-PJ, n.d.).  The Directorate-General for Internal Security (Direction générale de la sécurité intérieure –  DGSI), among other duties, has jurisdiction over investigations into cyberattacks with a national  security component. More precisely, the DGSI has exclusive judicial competence to carry out  cybercrime investigations related to attacks against critical infrastructure, national institutional  networks and operators of essential services (Ministère de l'Interieur, 2019).  4.2.1.4. Judiciary  The French judicial system consists of ordinary courts, which include the criminal courts, and  administrative courts. The Court of Cassation (Cour de Cassation) is the supreme court in the  French judicial system of ordinary courts. The public prosecutor is the authority exercising  prosecution tasks, referring cases to the ‘investigative judge’ (juge d’instruction) and overseeing  the criminal investigation process and the judicial police (European Union, n.d.g) (Ministère de  la Justice, 2012).  Within the public prosecutor’s offices, ‘an internal organisation has been set up to include a  “specialist judge” (magistrat référent) for cybercrime, who can provide technical support to  colleagues involved in cybercrime cases’ (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The Prosecutor of Paris now has national jurisdiction for cybercrime cases. As was highlighted  during one of the interviews, the prosecutor can evoke any case on national territory. This  approach provides better management of expertise as judges are specialised and handle a  great number of cases. The Prosecutor of Paris has a cell of three magistrates who specialise in  cybercrime.  One of the interviewees reported that the Mission against Cybercrime was established in 2015  within the French Ministry of Justice. This mission has a more strategic role. The following  information emerged in this interview: ‘The tasks undertaken are not at an operational level but  directly at the ministry level, to analyse the phenomenon, represent the ministry and provide  official guidelines to handle relevant cases. An example of its work is to issue official guidelines  for Prosecutors to treat and prosecute some cases, such as a document to centralize judicial  treatment of ransomware. Public policy on the fight against cybercrime is elaborated at the level  of this Mission to support the judiciary.’  (22) The SLDC responds to the need to develop a global policy to combat cybercrime. It defines the strategies to be  implemented in the operational, training and prevention areas for the general public and the financial sector.  Strategic coordination of SDLC activities is handled by the OCLCTIC.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  30  France cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.2.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from the interviews ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR and FR law enforcement perimeters and  mandates are complementary. As part of the national authority on cybersecurity, ANSSI/CERT-  FR has the expertise on many cyber-related topics.’ ANSSI/CERT-FR helps both LE and the  judiciary ‘by sharing […] expertise in cybersecurity and […] knowledge on threats’. As was  stated during one of the interviews, ‘There are different directions [of interaction] between  CSIRTs and LE but also the judiciary from the administrative and the operational side. ANSSI  […], according to French law, […is] a public agency [and] has the obligation to inform the  competent authorities in the event of a suspicious criminal case’. Therefore, ANSSI informs the  Prosecutor Office when it becomes aware of a crime. On the other hand, the prosecutors can  also ask for ‘help from ANSSI (e.g. on particular infrastructure data and on modus operandi), but  this is still quite rare. There are [indeed] rather few cases […where] the judiciary has initiated a  contact with the CSIRTs to handle a case.’  Usually, ANSSI is informed of an attack on its constituency (critical infrastructure operators)  directly or the victim files a complaint to LE. ANSSI teams collect evidence in a legally sound  manner and begin remediation. LE then receives and processes the evidence and conducts its  analysis (on network logs, for example). The objective of LE is different from that of ANSSI:  ANSSI is looking for every details of intrusion while LE is looking for identification information.  Thus, ANSSI is able to suggest efficient remediation actions to the victim. In addition, as the  interviewees noted, ‘a liaison officer has been appointed between the ANSSI/CERT-FR and the  Ministry of [the] Interior and a dedicated process has been set up to share information on  incidents that are reported to ANSSI and are relevant for [French] LE entities’.  Nevertheless, according to the interviewees, restrictions on information sharing may occur, such  as ‘when an investigation is launched on a […] case [that is under judicial examination]’. In such  cases, ‘ANSSI/CERT-FR has to follow strict rules on information sharing with its other partners  in order to respect the confidentiality of investigations’. Eventually, ANSSI may request  authorisation from the judiciary for information sharing with other members of the CNW for  prevention purposes; a known C2 IP can help other CSIRTs protect their constituency. As  emerged from the interviews, the information-sharing process with international partners could  therefore be delayed in some cases. As ‘threats are international but the law enforcement  administration is national’, the main challenge identified is to address these delays.  Furthermore, as one of the interviewees highlighted, another challenge that may arise is to have  the victim ‘file a legal complaint, in order to allow LE to take over before [launching the]  remediation actions that could potentially alter the evidence’.  To better understand each other’s work, some public prosecutor’s offices have regular formal  meetings with specialised police investigation services. In addition, such meetings help to clarify  which investigative tasks can be requested of local police to avoid overloading the specialised  services. Indeed, the communities are committed to a ‘continuous improvement of the close  relations’ that they have established.  In addition, under the framework of the French cyber defence strategy entitled “La Revue  stratégique de cyberdéfense”, a public–private initiative was launched in 2017 to raise  awareness of the risks of cyberattacks to society and to support the victims of such attacks. The  initiative is handled by the Public Interest Group for Action against Malicious Cyber Activities (Le  Groupement d’Intérêt Public Action contre la Cybermalveillance (GIP ACYMA). The state actors  involved are ANSSI, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy  and Finance and the Secretary of State in charge of the digital sector. Civil society is also  represented in this Public Interest Group through consumer associations or victim support  entities, as well as trade and labour unions. This public–private initiative also handles the online  cybersecurity platform Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, which was put in place to guide individuals,  EXAMPLE OF  SYNERGY –  THE CSIRT-PJ  The CSIRT Police  Judiciaire is part of  French LE. It  supports  investigations into  cybercrime. As full  member of the  CSIRT community, it  is a privileged actor  in terms of  cooperation and  information  exchange.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  31  small businesses and local authorities in taking preventive steps against cyberattacks and  addressing malicious events once they occur (Cybermalveillance.gouv.fr, 2019).  4.2.3. Examples of training  ANSSI offers free cybersecurity training to public organisations, among them LEAs, covering a  wide variety of topics and expertise levels. A lot of the training addresses basic security for end  users, as well as system administrators. It also deals with a wide range of advanced topics such  as security audits, network security, security certificate management and implementation of  cybersecurity certification. Finally, it provides training on very specialised topics such as radio  security against TEMPEST attacks.  As discussed during the interviews, the communities could benefit from joint training, as this  would ‘be useful to help strengthen the relationship between the CERT-FR/ANSSI and the LE  [and] judiciary [communities]’. Moreover, the communities could benefit from learning more  about each other’s counterparts in the ‘international cooperation process, [the] mechanisms and  [the] main players [involved]’ to overcome the difficulties that occur in identifying competent  actors and the actions to be expected.  Trainees at police, gendarmerie and judicial academies receive basic training on cybercrime.  These courses are often complemented by conferences or scientific and technical police  workshops.  The OCLCTIC of the National Police organises on an annual basis a training course for French  judges and investigators entitled ‘Approach to cybercrime’, focusing on legal aspects related to  cybercrime and the special investigation techniques. It also organises a ‘first responder’ training  course aimed at police officers who have to carry out basic cybercrime-related investigative  procedures (Council of the European Union, 2015).  The BL2C, part of the Paris Police Prefecture, participates in private sector training and  provides two approved training courses to the judiciary and customs officers on digital police  investigations.  The Information Systems Security Training Centre (CFSSI) is the main point of contact for  ANSSI for the training of various agencies. It is also involved in the definition and  implementation of the training policy.  CECyF, also called F-CCENTRE, is the French Expert Centre against Cybercrime. CECyF  started in the context of the European project 2Centre (Cybercrime Centres of Excellence  Network for Training Research and Education). CECyF provides support to LE researchers from  both academia and the private sector and educational institutions to create projects that  contribute to training, education and research on cybercrime (CECyF, n.d.).  Finally, the French National School for the Judiciary (Ecole nationale de la magistrature – ENM)  provides multidisciplinary training to French and foreign judges, police officers, gendarmerie and  customs officers on recent legislative developments, as well as specific aspects of digital  investigations and the judicial handling of cybercrime.  4.3.  GERMANY  Germany is ‘a federal, parliamentary republic, with a head of government, the chancellor, and a  head of state, the president, whose primary responsibilities are representative. The country  comprises of sixteen federal States (Länder), which each have their own constitution and are  largely autonomous regarding their internal organisation’ (European Union, n.d.c.). Power is  distributed between the federal and the state governments. Considering the state structure in  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  32  the country, preventing and responding to cybercrime require close cooperation at the federal  and Länder levels.  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Germany is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant German legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Germany adopted its NCSS initially in 2011 (BMI, 2011); this was updated in 2016 (ENISA,  n.d.f).  4.3.1. Roles and duties  In Germany, the following authorities and departments in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department in English  Name of the authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name  in the original language  (if applicable)  Federal Office for Information Security  Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik  BSI  - CERT-Bund (part of BSI) CERT-Bund CERT-Bund  National Cyber Response Centre Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum Cyber-AZ  Federal Criminal Police Office Bundeskriminalamt BKA  - Division CC – Cybercrime Abteilung ‘Cyber­crime’  CC  Federal Police Bundespolizei BPOL  Criminal police offices of the federal states  (Länder)  Landeskriminalämter LKAs  The Federal Public Prosecutor General and the  Federal Court of Justice  Der Generalbundesanwalt beim  Bundesgerichtshof and  Bundesgerichtshof  GBA and BGH  Public Prosecutor’s Offices and Courts of the  federal states (Länder)  Die Staatsanwaltschaften der Länder and  Landgerichte  Individual per federal state  4.3.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik  – BSI) is the federal cybersecurity authority that ‘shapes information security in digitization  through prevention, detection and reaction for government, business and society’ (BSI, n.d.). Its  ‘goal […] is to promote IT security in Germany. The BSI is first and foremost the central IT  security service provider for the federal government in Germany’ (BSI, n.d.). CERT-Bund is part  of the BSI. The mandate and competences of the BSI are provided by the Act on the Federal  Office for Information Security of 2009, last amended on 2017 (BSI, 2017).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  33  The National Cyber Response Centre (Nationale Cyber-Abwehrzentrum – Cyber-AZ) has been  set up to ‘optimize operational cooperation between all state authorities and improve the  coordination of protection and response measures’. Different governmental agencies are part of  this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK, BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND). ‘Cooperation in the  National Cyber Response Centre […] strictly observe[s] the statutory tasks and powers of all  authorities involved on the basis of cooperation agreements.’  4.3.1.2. CSIRTs  As mentioned, CERT-Bund is part of the BSI. CERT-Bund is the national CSIRT and ‘acts as  the central point of contact regarding IT-security incidents concerning the German government.  In addition it provides services to critical infrastructure, industry and SME [small and medium-  sized enterprises] as well as citizens. Germany’s national IT Situation Centre and the national  Cyber Response Centre are supported by CERT-Bund’ (BSI, n.d. a). CERT-Bund is therefore  responsible for a large constituency and handling IT security incidents related to government  institutions, federal authorities, critical infrastructures and organisations.  The services that CERT-Bund offers are:   ‘24-hour on-call duty in cooperation with the IT Situation Centre;   analysis of incoming incident reports;   creation of recommendations derived from incidents;   support during IT security incidents;   operation of a warning and information service;   active alerting of the Federal Administration in case of imminent danger’ (CERT-Bund,  n.d.).  CERT-BPOL (23) is part of the Federal Police (Bundespolizei). ‘After an attack in 2017, the  CERT-BPOL was founded as the cyber attack analysis and defense center and has been  reinforced continually ever since. The team comprises IT security staff from the Federal Police.  The team consists of IT experts from the Federal Police supported by experts from industry and  science. In order to detect and investigate incidents in the German Federal Police infrastructure,  intrusion prevention systems are operated and infrastructure vulnerabilities are identified by  CERT-BPOL. Liaison officers from CERT-BPOL represent the Federal Police Headquarters at  the […] Cyber-AZ’ (Bundespolizei, 2017).  4.3.1.3. LE  As of 1 April 2020, the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt - BKA, n.d.)  includes a separate division dealing with cybercrime, named Division CC – Cybercrime  (Abteilung ‘Cyber­crime’). This division emerged from the Cybercrime and Information and  Communication Crime (ICT) group of the Serious and Organised Crime (SO) Department.  The main tasks of the Division CC – Cybercrime are to investigate cybercriminals and provide  support to other departments, analyse information, protect federal institutions and critical  infrastructures against cyberattacks and provide training to non-specialist employees of the  BKA, as well as provide advice on relevant legal provisions (BKA-CC, n.d.).  The BKA is in communication with prosecutors and judges. The BSI has appointed a CSIRT-LE  liaison officer to the BKA.  (23) CERT-BPOL is listed in the ENISA inventory: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-  inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=CERT-BPOL  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  34  The German Federal Police is a (primarily) uniformed federal police force (Bundespolizei, n.d.).  It is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesminister des Innern, für Bau und  Heimat (BMI), n.d.).  LE authority is also exercised at the state level: the criminal police offices of the Länder  (Landeskriminalämter – LKAs) are independent LEAs in all 16 states (Länder) and are  subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The state police are known as the Landespolizei.  They are the main points of contact for cybercrime for most of the Länder. The ‘16 federal states  (Länder) [have] the authority to maintain their own police forces within their territory, along with  the right to pass legislation and exercise police authority’ (BMI, n.d.).  4.3.1.4. Judiciary  Following the federal structure of Germany, ‘the court system is also structured federally.  Jurisdiction is exercised by federal courts and by the courts of the sixteen federal states  (Länder). The main workload of the administration of justice lies with the Länder’ (European  Union, n.d.b).  The BGH (Federal Court of Justice) is at the head of the local, regional and higher regional  courts and functions as a court of appeal for both civil and criminal cases. In general its  interpretations of the law are adopted by all regional courts and therefore do have far-reaching  effects on German jurisdiction in general.  ‘The prosecution offices are set up at every regional court’ and ‘are competent to investigate all  kinds of criminal offences except of offences against the state and other offences falling  withinthe competence of the Federal Public Prosecution Office’. […] ‘On the federal level there  is only one prosecution office, the Federal Public Prosecution Office which has its seat in  Karlsruhe. In the area of investigation and prosecution of crimes, the Federal Public Prosecution  Office is competent to investigate and prosecute crimes against the state and terrorist crimes as  well as other cases, if they involve serious crime that goes beyond individual Länder borders’  (EJN, n.d.a).  Certain State Prosecutor’s Offices, such as the one in North Rhine-Westphalia, have a central  cybercrime unit dealing ‘with significant cybercrime proceedings’ (Council of the European  Union, 2017a, p. 28).  ‘There are no courts with specific jurisdiction in most of the Länder. In North Rhine-Westphalia,  however, Cologne regional court has a criminal division with special jurisdiction on account of  the Central Cybercrime Unit and Contact Point located at Cologne Public Prosecution office’  (Council of the European Union, 2017a, p. 28). Indeed, as was also highlighted during one of  the interviews conducted, ‘Certain major courts have created special chambers with judges  specifically trained in cybercrime cases (example of Chamber in the High Regional Court of  Cologne).’ For more information on this point see (Landgericht Köln, pp. 90, section 242,  subsections c) and d) ).  Germany cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.3.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As emerged from both the desk research and the interviews, there are several synergies  between the communities, and the Cyber-AZ plays an important role in bringing the  communities together and facilitating their synergies. For instance, as one of the interviewees  explained, the different agencies that are part of this centre (BSI, BKA, BW-KdoCIR, BBK,  BPOL, BfV, MAD and BND) have ‘a daily interaction and coordination on handling and treating  cases’. In addition, the agencies involved collaborate in ‘producing situation reports to cover the  different aspects of an incident, from the perspective and within the limits of each agency’s  [competence]’.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  35  As emerged from the interviews, ‘There is a daily flow of exchange of information [between  CSIRTs and LE] for ongoing investigations and in the framework of analysing projects and  indicating prevention measures.’ For instance, the BSI may ‘recover data and information from  suspected systems’, which could also be used to support LE investigations and ‘be presented in  Court as testimonies by BSI experts’.  As one of the interviewees explained, the current legal framework does not anticipate having  CSIRT personnel permanently assigned to prosecution authorities. Instead, according to the  German Code of Criminal Proceedings, the role that CSIRTs may play is either that of a witness  or that of an expert. The CSIRT community can help prosecution authorities when there is a  need for a qualified technical expert. Indeed, ‘Even if the CSIRTs contacted do not have the  specific qualified technical experts within their team, they can still support the prosecution  authorities as they have many links in the technical community.’ Moreover, CSIRTs can provide  support to prosecution authorities by reaching out to civil organisations and non-governmental  organisations, as they are in a better position to perform this task.  As one of the interviewees highlighted, ‘The major field of interference during an investigation  [between the different communities] is how to deal with the incident. The prosecution service  aims at gathering proper judicial evidence, while the CSIRTs aim at dealing with the incident  and fixing the issue. From the prosecutor’s perspective, gathering evidence takes much longer  time than the CSIRTs would want. In any major case the usual discussion is what can be done  to gather evidence and close the collection process as soon as possible in order to proceed with  the CSIRT activity of unlocking the system.’  4.3.3. Examples of training  The BKA has developed various national training programmes on cybercrime, including in the  field of information and communication technology (ICT) forensics. The BKA is also responsible  for training experts in the Federation and the Länder. As part of this training, it is possible to  specialise in specific operating systems, networks/internet, mobile forensics and cryptology. The  BKA also organises an internal basic training course on cybercrime once a year (Council of the  European Union, 2017a).  Courses on cybercrime are offered at all levels, from basic to advanced/specialised, for all  police officers and court experts in Germany.  The German Judicial Academy (Deutsche Richterakademie) also offers further training on  criminal law and the internet on an annual basis and organises conferences and training on  criminal law, forensics, criminal proceedings and investigative measures for judges and public  prosecutors who are involved in combating internet crime (German Judicial Academy, n.d.).  The Brandenburg Judicial Academy (Justizakademie des Landes Brandenburg) organises  regular training sessions for senior judiciary who handle cybercrime cases (Brandenburg  Judicial Academy, n.d.). In addition, at a local level, training is organised (e.g. by the Joint  Judicial Examination Office of the Länder of Berlin and Brandenburg) on combating cybercrime,  including topics such as preservation of computer evidence, data network investigations,  including a cross-border dimension, the challenges presented by big data and data protection-  related issues.  At the Länder level, various training initiatives are offered for LE officers and prosecutors, such  as in North Rhine-Westphalia, which organises ‘a joint training programme for specialists from  the Land police force and public prosecutors’. However, practices such as working meetings  and exchange of information are more common between the police and the public prosecutor’s  offices on different aspects of combating cybercrime (Council of the European Union, 2017a). .  AN EXAMPLE  OF  FACILITATING  SYNERGIES  The Nationales  Cyber-  Abwehrzentrum  (National Cyber  Response Centre)  plays an important  role in bringing the  communities  together and  facilitating their  synergies.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  36  As emerged from the interviews, joint training takes place between the CSIRTs and LE, and, in  particular, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), with judiciary representatives also invited to  participate in this training as observers.  As an interviewee explained, ‘In a joint exercise/practical training on critical infrastructures,  which was held with the support of a private company, a representative from the prosecution  office was invited to actively participate and the prosecutor was then on call during the real-life  scenario.’ As another interviewee underlined, ‘The judges are usually not involved in such joint  trainings, also due to [their] obligation to remain neutral/impartial (e.g. there could be a conflict if  a training is organised by a private entity or an exercise hosted in a company’s premises).’  In addition, it should be noted that, as stated by one of the interviewees, the ‘Prosecution team  has the responsibility for providing State justice academy trainings to LE officials. Regarding the  CSIRT community, prosecutors actively engage in seminars and training sessions also involving  the BSI. Through these, they are trying to share the information by inviting CSIRT experts in  such events or participating respectively in trainings of the CSIRT community.’  However, what emerged from the interviews is that CSIRTs and LE work closely together on a  daily basis and that they ‘have managed to learn from each other and understand each entity’s  role and actions’. Since CSIRTs and the judiciary – because of their mandates and the legal  framework – do not have many opportunities to work so closely together, the judiciary could  ‘benefit greatly’ if the CSIRT community could provide training for prosecutor and judges to  further improve their technical skills.  4.4.  LUXEMBOURG  Luxembourg ‘is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy (Grand Duchy) with a head of  government, the prime minister, and a head of state, the Grand Duke. The country is divided  into 4 […] regions, 12 […] cantons and 105 communes’ (European Union, n.d.d.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Luxembourg is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Luxembourg legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Luxembourg adopted its NCSS in 2018 for the period 2018–2020 (ENISA, n.d.g).  4.4.1. Roles and duties  In Luxembourg, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the  authority/department in English  Name of the authority/department  in the original language  Abbreviation/short name in  the original language (if  applicable)  National Agency for the Security of  Information Systems  Agence nationale de la sécurité des  systèmes d’information  ANSSI  CERT.LU  CERT.LU CERT.LU  Computer emergency response  team of the Government of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  Équipe Gouvernementale de  Réponse aux Urgences  Informatiques  GOVCERT.LU  Computer Incident Response  Center Luxembourg  Computer Incident Response Center  Luxembourg  CIRCL  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  37  National CERT Luxembourg National CERT Luxembourg NCERT.LU  Grand-Ducal Police Police Grand-Ducale  High Commission for National  Protection  Haut-Commissariat à la Protection  Nationale  HCPN  Cybersecurity Board  CSB  Public Prosecution and Judges  Ministère de la Justice  4.4.1.1. National cyber security agency  The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (Agence nationale de la sécurité  des systèmes d’information – ANSSI) is part of the High Commission for National Protection  (Haut-Commisariat à la Protection nationale – HCPN) and is responsible for establishing  information security policies and guidelines on non-classified information within the Luxembourg  state bodies (ministries, state departments and administrations). ANSSI assists these bodies  with risk analysis in the domain of information security, in order to help build up a culture of risk-  based governance within the Luxembourg state, as required by the general information security  policy. Furthermore, ANSSI is in charge of promoting information security awareness and may  advise the Luxembourg state’s training institute on training programmes in the domain of  information security.  4.4.1.2. CSIRTs  National CERT Luxembourg (NCERT.LU), the CERT of the Government of the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg (Équipe gouvernementale de réponse aux urgences informatiques –  GOVCERT.LU) and the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) are the  main actors responsible for the detection of and response to incidents.  NCERT.LU, run by GOVCERT.LU, is the national CSIRT (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.b). NCERT.LU  gathers and disseminates information about security incidents that affect information and  communication systems in Luxembourg. It also serves as interlocutor for natural and legal  persons, entities and bodies, both national and international. Once it has received information,  NCERT.LU must convey it to the CERTs in charge of the affected victim’s sector or, if no  sectorial CERT exists, directly to the victim. NCERT.LU also advises about the specific points of  contact according to the targeted sector.  CERT.LU, run by SECURITYMADEIN.LU, is the Cyber Emergency Response Community  Luxembourg (CERT.LU, n.d.). It is an initiative to enhance collaboration between public and  private CERTs in Luxembourg. The objective is to create a community of all of the major actors  for sharing expertise.  GOVCERT.LU, the governmental CSIRT, ‘is the single point of contact dedicated to the  treatment of all computer related incidents jeopardising the information systems of the  government and defined critical infrastructure operators, whether they are public or private’  (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.). The services provided by GOVCERT.LU include incident handling,  coordination and resolution, and also proactive services such as notification of malware and  vulnerabilities, as well as compromised (infected) systems, among others. ‘The Constituency of  GOVCERT.LU is made of:   all ministries, administrations and services of the Luxembourgish government  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  38   military organizations and administrations using a military system of the  Luxembourgish government (e.g. embassies)   critical infrastructure operators of the Grand-duchy of Luxembourg   some major players in sensitive sectors within the Grand-duchy of Luxembourg’  (GOVCERT.LU, n.d.a).  CIRCL ‘is a government-driven initiative designed to gather, review, report and respond to  computer security threats and incidents’ (CIRCL.LU, n.d.). ‘CIRCL is the CERT for the private  sector, communes and non-governmental entities for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. b).  CIRCL provides incident response capacities and remediation to national ICT users. It also  takes a coordinator’s role during incidents involving multiple actors, both national and  international. It is also charged with collecting information about incidents to enhance future  responses. CIRCL also handles vulnerability management and disclosure and incident  response training (CIRCL, 2020).  CIRCL has created a large number of tools applicable to forensics, incident responses, network  analysis, dark web monitoring and threat intelligence. The most successful of these tools is  MISP (Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform & Open Standards For Threat Information  Sharing), which is a threat intelligence database with very large information-sharing capabilities.  It is used by more than 6000 entities worldwide and is becoming a de facto standard in the  CSIRT community.  CIRCL already has a strong LE cooperation culture through frequent informal exchanges and  training programmes, such as the Horizon 2020 ENFORCE project and the NEOLEA initiative  (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a).  The HCPN is a coordinating mechanism for responding to serious cyberattacks (HCPN, n.d.). It  also includes a Cybernetic Risk Evaluation Cell (Cellule d’Evaluation du Risque Cybernétique)  known as CERC (The Luxembourg Government, 2018).  4.4.1.3. LE  The Grand-Ducal Police (Police Grand-Ducale, n.d.) is the primary LEA in Luxembourg.  The Directorate of the Judicial Police Service (SPJ) ‘is responsible, inter alia, for the  Coordination of judicial activities at the national and international level. It is also responsible for  defining and managing, in collaboration with the judicial authorities, judicial investigations.’  Within the SPJ the Department of Property Crime has a section on cybercrime (OSCE, n.d.a).  The SPJ is composed of two units:   Cybercrime Unit. This unit deals with pure cybercrime mainly against ICT systems. It  handles felonies such as data theft, modification and erasure, as well as cyberbullying  and property scam. It is the international point of contact for Europol, Interpol and 24/7  networks.   High Tech Analysis Unit. This unit provides forensic support to other police units. It  handles lawful evidence collection, interception management and maintenance for  audio/video special equipment.  To prevent and combat cybercrime, LE in Luxembourg cooperates with the following authorities:   Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office (mutual legal assistance);   Public Prosecutor (investigation and prosecution)/Parquet général;   Office of the Examining Magistrate (preparatory enquiries and enforcement action);  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  39   Financial Intelligence Unit (financial crime using new technologies);   criminal courts.  4.4.1.4. Judiciary  The judicial system of Luxembourg is ‘divided into a judicial branch’, including the criminal  courts, ‘and an administrative branch’ (European Union, n.d.e).  Some magistrates from the Public Prosecutor’s Office and a magistrate at the level of the  Financial Intelligence Unit are responsible, among other duties, for cybercrime cases.  Luxembourg also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.4.2. Synergies and potential interferences  The different communities in Luxembourg have a strong tradition of cooperation and  collaboration. The CSIRT/LE and judiciary cybercrime working group brings together national  authorities (Public Prosecutor’s Office, LE and CSIRTs) to exchange information regularly, for  instance on their interactions with service providers.  The police rely on mutual legal assistance instruments and the direct exchange of information  with Europol and Interpol, but also on the voluntary sharing of information by communication  service providers.  An interesting case of synergies was mentioned during the interviews. This was a case ‘where  the LE performed a significant data interception, that CSIRTs were not allowed to do but  onwards CSIRTs supported in analysing this data package. Similarly, [synergies are achieved]  in cases of seizing of equipment performed by the LE, later on, analysed with the support of  CSIRTs.’  An example of synergies in developing training was also provided during the interviews, in the  context of the ENFORCE project (CIRCL.LU, n.d. a) during the training, CSIRT technologies  were shown and feedback from the LE received and improvements in tools.  CSIRTs (such as CIRCL) can provide technical pre-investigation and investigation support  before LE intervention. They also support requests from the judiciary and other LEAs for  technical assistance.  Information sharing is carried out automatically using MISP, using sharing groups to implement  information sharing rules. Specific information regarding financial fraud is shared with the  judiciary.  Main synergies occur through cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. LEAs have legal tools to  enable data acquisition by seizing and intercepting servers. Other synergies can be handled  during training (see below).There is a memorandum of understanding between CSIRTs and LE.  Potential interferences can occur when LEAs and CSIRTs come into conflicts. LEAs may disturb  CSIRT monitoring operations when seizing a piece of infrastructure studied by CSIRTs.  Outside the EU, the use of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) can cause extensive delays  and impede cooperation.  Another challenge is the discrepancy in data-handling capacities. CSIRTs generate a lot of  data, for example in the field of child abuse. Since LEAs works on a case-by-case model, they  cannot handle large numbers of data without predefined agreements.  TRADITION OF  ACHIEVING  SYNERGIES  The different  communities in  Luxembourg have a  strong tradition of  cooperation and  collaboration.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  40  The final challenge is to improve evidence handling by MISP: large data sets need to be  handled in such a way as to preserve the chain of custody.  One way to improve synergies would be to share information in real time. This is legally  challenging but would be more profitable for all entities.  4.4.3. Examples of training  ‘Law enforcement officers are trained at the Police school of the Grand-Ducal Police. […]. In  addition, the Police school is responsible for managing the continuing education of the  personnel of the Grand-Ducal Police’ At the Police School, cybercrime is covered during basic  training and professional development for police officers and investigators (OSCE, n.d.a).  To increase opportunities to provide specialised training to IT forensic experts and investigators  working on cybercrime cases, the SPJ arranges training in coordination with neighbouring  police agencies. It is also common practice for personnel attending external training to pass on  their knowledge to others by organising internal training sessions.  Luxembourg ‘does not have a specific institution or school for the training of its judges and  prosecutors, therefore, the Ministry of Justice has reached an agreement with the French Ecole  Nationale de la Magistrature and the German Judicial Academy’ (Deutschen Richterakademie)  (EJTN, n.d.).  In addition, the New Technologies Section of the SPJ provides training for judges, especially on  new tools and methods used by cybercriminals (darknet, bitcoin, etc.).  In the interviews, further examples of training were discussed. For example, when customers  share their issues and needs in the field of cybercrime, this helps CSIRTs understand the  requirements of cybercrime investigations. Further, the Prosecutor’s Office also provides  training related to the four ways of filing a complaint for a CSIRT’s constituency.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘There is a set of training that is already provided by CSIRTs to  LE, i.e. for OSINT [open-source intelligence], cryptographic keys ([…] published under the  ENFORCE project) and forensic tools, including forensics acquisition. There are cases of  prosecutors and judges that joint such trainings, as they had a demonstrated interest in the field’  LE and CSIRTs also participate in training exercises provided by the ENFORCE Project. The  ENFORCE project is a ‘European project co-funded by the European Commission in the  framework of the Internal Security Fund – Police. […]. The ENFORCE project aims at designing,  setting-up, and disseminating a cybercrime training curriculum at the European level. This  curriculum will be validated during a training exercise allowing different European public (e.g.  law enforcement agencies and CSIRTs) and private actors fighting cybercrime to train together  using state-of-the-art training technology’. CEIS, the coordinator of the ENFORCE Project, also  co-organizes a cybercrime training with the Luxembourgian CIRCL and the French National  Police” (CEIS, n.d.). This training material specifically addresses aspects of cooperation.  According to the data collected during the interviews, CSIRTs have received training from the  Customs Authority. This was in the form of a workshop, where the Customs Authority shared  concerns related to cybercrime and was able to discuss how CSIRTs can help (e.g. when  seizing equipment at the borders and how this should be handled before being submitted for  analysis  4.5.  NORWAY  Norway is a constitutional monarchy and a member country of EFTA and a signatory to the  European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement (EFTA, n.d.a), (EFTA, n.d.).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  41  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Norway is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Norwegian legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Norway adopted a new NCSS in 2019; this is the fourth edition of the NCSS, with the first  strategy published in 2003 (ENISA, n.d.i) (Norwegian Ministeries, n.d.).  4.5.1. Roles and duties  In Norway, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the  authority/department in the  original language  Abbreviation/short name  in the original language  (if applicable)  Norwegian Computer Emergency  Response Team  NorCERT  National Criminal Investigation  Service  Den nasjonale enhet for  bekjempelse av organisert og  annen alvorlig kriminalitet  Kripos  Norwegian National Security  Authority  Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet  NSM  Norwegian National Cyber  Security Centre  Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter  NCSC  National Authority for  Investigation and Prosecution of  Economic and Environmental  Crime  Den sentrale enhet for  etterforsking og påtale av  økonomisk kriminalitet og  miljøkriminalitet  Økokrim  Norwegian Police Security  Service  Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste PST  Norwegian Prosecuting Authority Påtalemyndigheten  Judicial system  Joint Cyber Coordination Centre Felles cyberkoordineringssenter FCKS  Norwegian Data Protection  Authority  Datatilsynet  Norwegian Communications  Authority  Nasjonal  kommunikasjonsmyndigheit  Nkom  4.5.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Ministry of Justice and Public Security is primarily the responsible authority for network and  information security in Norway. The Norwegian National Security Authority (Nasjonal  sikkerhetsmyndighet – NSM) is the national organisation focusing on cybersecurity in the  country. Under the NSM, organisations run different functions related to cybersecurity and  cybercrime, such as the Norwegian CERT (NorCERT) and the Norwegian National Cyber  Security Centre (Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter – NCSC) (NSM, n.d.).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  42  4.5.1.2. CSIRTs  Norway has an officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (NSM, n.d.). The NSM is  responsible for NorCERT.  The main activities of NorCERT are “response to cyber threats in our technical threat operation  centre 24/7; operate and organise a national sensor network on the internet to detect data  breaches in critical infrastructure across sectors; reverse engineering, forensics, network  analysis and counterintelligence” (NCSC, n.d.).  In addition, Norway has different sectorial CSIRTs, such as:   HelseCERT, which supports the Norwegian healthcare sector (HelseCERT, n.d.)   UNINETT CERT, of the UNINETT ‘ICT infrastructure company in Norway’ (UNINETT,  n.d. ) (UNINETT , n.d a).   UiO-CERT, the University of Oslo’s CSIRT (UiO-CERT, n.d.);   FinansCERT, the CSIRT supporting the Norwegian financial sector (FinansCERT,  n.d.).  4.5.1.3. LE  The Norwegian Police Security Service (Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste – PST) is the national  security service of Norway. The activities of the PST are assigned by the Police Act and it  reports directly to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.  The main aim of the National Criminal Investigation Service (Den nasjonale enhet for  bekjempelse av organisert og annen alvorlig kriminalitet – Kripos) is to prevent and combat  serious organised crime. Its main functions are criminal investigations, forensic investigations,  gathering criminal intelligence and undertaking international police cooperation (Politiet, n.d.).  The National Cybercrime Centre (NC3) falls under Kripos. The main activities of NC3 fall under  the following areas: cybercrime investigations, digital forensics, internet investigations and  internet crimes against children (Politiet, n.d. a). Within Kripos there is also a high-tech crime  division that acts as a 24/7 point of contact.  The National Police Directorate is the highest police authority in Norway and ‘falls under the  Ministry of Justice and Public Security’. The National Police Directorate supports police bodies  and special units and provides expertise (Politiet, n.d.c)  As emerged from one of the interviews conducted, in relation to cybercrime, the role of the  national police in Norway, in particular Kripos, is prevention and investigation and intelligence  gathering. For LEAs in Norway, fighting cybercrime is no different from fighting other crimes.  Prosecutors are integrated into LEAs, sharing the same offices with LE personnel; hence, there  is a seamless exchange of information and close cooperation between the two. On the legal  framework side a specific Police Act allows police to share information with the national CERT  to prevent criminal activities.  4.5.1.4. Judiciary  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority (Påtalemyndigheten) is the competent authority for legal  prosecutions in Norway. It handles investigations and prosecutions of criminal cases.  The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is divided into the following levels:   the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP);   the Regional Public Prosecution Offices (PPO);   the Prosecuting Authority in the Police (Higher Prosecuting Authority, n.d.)  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  43  The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime  (Den sentrale enhet for etterforsking og påtale av økonomisk kriminalitet og miljøkriminalitet –  Økokrim) provides services as a police unit but also as a prosecution authority with specific  expertise in computer crime and fraud (Økokrim, n.d.).  In Norwegian judicial system, the supreme court ‘is the highest court in Norway […] and has an  authority in all areas of the law’ (Domstol, n.d.). Judicial cooperation in criminal matters with EU  Member States is based on the principles of mutual recognition and direct contact between the  judicial authorities.  Norway also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.5.2. Synergies and potential interferences  As mentioned above, Økokrim, because of its dual nature as a police unit and a prosecution  authority, cooperates with a number of other authorities, such as surveillance authorities, the  business sector, in combating economic and environmental crime.  In addition, the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre (Felles cyberkoordineringssenter – FCKS) is a  key collaborative hub that consists of representatives from the NSM, the Norwegian Intelligence  Service, the PST and Kripos. The FCKS is also coordinated by the NSM (FCKS, n.d.).  NC3 cooperates closely with public and private security entities in Norway and abroad,  especially regarding the exchange of information (Politiet, n.d.b). Cooperation mechanisms  have also been established between LE and NorCERT.  The interviews showed that a lot of synergies are established in tactical operations and at  strategic levels. There are cases of LEAs and national CERTs attending crime scenes together  and conducting investigations together, to complement each other’s capabilities. For instance, if  information is discovered by LE that is deemed important for a national CERT, this information  is passed on to the CERT. Joint reports are prepared and submitted to the government in the  field of cybercrime, including on risks. Another example is LEAs and CERTs discussing and  analysing the issues together. Through the Joint Cyber Coordination Centre, prosecutors hold  monthly meetings with the legal officers of the CERT communities.  However, as emerged in the interviews, there are also potential interferences. In one example, in  the early stages of cooperation the national CERT found a CC server abroad and passed the  information to the hosting country. The hosting country could have decided to shut down the  server, which may have been problematic for the LEA and its operational plan.  4.5.3. Examples of training  “The Norwegian Police University College (/Politihøgskolen –  (NPUC) ‘is the central  educational institution for the police service in Norway. Basic training for police officers is a  three-year university college education aimed at providing a broad practical and theoretical  foundation’. The college provides education in areas such as ‘policing, crime investigation and  prevention, and prosecution and administrative responsibilities’ (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The college also provides training in areas such as:   international civil crisis management;   Schengen Border and Immigration Service;   Nordic Baltic Police Academy (NPUC, n.d.) (OSCE, n.d.b.).  The NPUC is also a member of the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group  (ECTEG) (ECTEG, n.d. a).  ESTABLISHED  SYNERGIES  Through the Joint  Cyber Coordination  Centre, prosecutors  hold monthly  meetings with the  legal officers of the  CERT communities.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  44  The Norwegian Center for Cyber and Information Security (CCIS) develops cybersecurity  competences for Norwegian agencies, companies and academia. It is supported by the Ministry  of Justice and Public Security and members of its board of directors come from authorities such  as the NSM, the Police Directorate and the NPUC, among others (CCIS, n.d.).  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that the different communities (CSIRTs, LE  and judiciary) participate in shared exercises with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO), as well as other national exercises held by private partners. LEAs also participate in  such training activities along with the private sector, mostly in the telecoms field.  NC3 organises training for LEAs as well as prosecutors.  4.6.  PORTUGAL  Portugal is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government, the prime minister, and a  head of state, the president, who has power to appoint the prime minister and other government  members. The country is administratively divided into 308 municipalities, subdivided into 3 092  civil parishes’ (European Union, n.d.i.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Portugal is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Portuguese legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Portugal adopted its first NCSS in 2015. In 2019, the Portuguese government issued the NCSS  for 2019–2023 (ENISA, n.d.j).  4.6.1. Roles and duties  In Portugal, the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.

National cyber security agency  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre (Centro Nacional de Cibersegurança – CNCS)  (CNCS, n.d.) monitors and coordinates the implementation of the NCSS and is the single point  of contact. Its main focus is informing and raising the awareness of not only public entities and  critical infrastructures but also the business sector and civil society.  4.6.1.2. CSIRTs  Portugal has an officially recognised national CSIRT, CERT.PT (CNCS, n.a.a). CERT.PT ‘is a  service integrated in the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre that coordinates the  response to incidents involving State entities, operators of Critical infrastructures, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and, in general, the national cyberspace, including  any device belonging to a network or address block attributed to an operator of electronic  communications, institution, collective or singular person based, or physically located, in  Portuguese territory’ (CNCS, n.a.a). Its mission is to enhance national capacity in cybersecurity  by creating new CSIRTs and developing the capacities of existing ones. CERT.PT is a member  of the National CSIRT Network and a national representative in the CNW.  CC-CRISI is the CSIRT for the Portuguese Armed Forces Estado Maior General das Forças  Armadas – EMGFA) (EMPFGA, n.d.).  4.6.1.3. LE  The Judicial Police  (Polícia Judiciária, n.d.) investigates violent crime, organised crime and  financial crime. It is ‘a higher criminal police force falling under the Ministry of Justice. Its  mission is to assist judicial and prosecuting authorities with investigations and to develop and  foster preventive, detection and investigative actions, falling within its remit or entrusted with by  the competent judicial and prosecuting authorities. […]. Polícia Judiciária is also responsible for  ensuring the operation of the Europol National Unit and the Interpol National Central Bureau,  within the framework established by national legislation” (Europol, n.d.b).  With the aim to fight against cybercrime, the Judicial Police established in February 2017 the  National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (Unidade Nacional de Combate  ao Cibercrime e à Criminalidade Tecnológica), also known as UNCT3. A specialised team  within the UNCT3 supports criminal investigations with technical and legal aspects (Polícia  Judiciária , n.d.).  The Public Security Police (Polícia de Segurança Pública – PSP) is responsible for maintaining  security and public order and investigating non-organised crimes and violent crimes (PSP, n.d.).  The Internal Intelligence Service (Serviço de Informações de Segurança – SIS, (SIS, n.d.)  produces security intelligence to assist political decision-makers in fighting cybercrime, among  other crimes. To accomplish its mission, the SIS is supported by all of the security and LEAs  and public authorities in general.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  46  According to the data collected in the interviews, the organisation in Portugal in charge of  cybercrime is Judicial Police, the police force that deals with anti-corruption, counter-terrorism,  drug prevention and serious cybercrime.  Since the transposition of the NIS Directive, a new national law (Cybersecurity law) mentioned  the needs of cooperation between the Portuguese CERT (the Portuguese national CERT is  within the Cyber Centre) and other national CSIRTs. In addition, there is a clause in the law  stating that the CNCS and the national criminal police should cooperate. This group involves  four entities (known as G4): (1) the CNCS, (2) the Judicial Police, (3) the Cyber defence and (4)  intelligence services. The G4 group collaborates with cyber diplomacy, a body within the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is also tasked with supporting national services with  information exchange in the EU space.  However, magistrates are not part of the G4 group because they have their own powers and  can act directly/ask LE and the CNCS for services and information. They are therefore not  explicitly mentioned in the legal act. Members of the G4 group have regular meetings and  occasionally, if needed, undertake joint operations.  4.6.1.4. Judiciary  The Portuguese judicial system ‘has two separate sets of courts, the civil courts and the  administrative courts. Provision is also made for other courts, such as the Constitutional Court.  In the civil sphere, the ordinary courts with civil and criminal jurisdiction are the judicial courts’  (European Union, n.d.j).  The Public Prosecution Service (Ministério Público – PPS) (PPS, n.d.) is the Portuguese  prosecution authority. Within the PPS, the Prosecutor General’s Office (Procurador-Geral da  República – PGO) (PGO, n.d.) acts as the central authority for international judicial cooperation  in criminal matters. In addition, within the PPS, the Central Department of Criminal Investigation  and Prosecution (Departamento Central de Investigação e Ação Penal – DCIAP) (DCIAP, n.d.)  is a body entrusted with the coordination of the investigation of organised crime, as well as  crime prevention.  Portugal cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.6.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The National Cybersecurity Centre is the operational coordinator and the Portuguese national  authority specialised in cybersecurity working in this field with State entities, operators of Critical  Infrastructures, operators of essential services and digital service providers, ensuring that the  cyberspace is used as an area of freedom, security and justice, for the protection of all the  sectors of society that materialize national sovereignty and the Democratic State under the rule  of law’ (CNCS, n.d.b).  ANACOM (National Communications Authority, Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações) is the  regulator, supervisor and representative of the communications sector in Portugal. The authority  is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Electronic Communications Law (ANACOM,  n.d.). In terms of criminal investigations, there is close cooperation between ANACOM, the  Judicial Police and the Prosecutor General’s Office on combating cybercrime and obtaining  digital evidence (ANACOM, n.d a).  As highlighted by one of the interviewees, ‘Nothing prevents the cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and […judiciary]. However, there are no particular laws in place’. ‘CSIRTs officers have the  obligation to report malicious/suspicious events to the prosecution service’, which derives from  the general rule stating that all ‘public institutions have the obligation to cooperate with the LE  and the prosecution service during criminal investigations’.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  47  CERT-PT ‘coordinates the response to incidents involving State entities, operators of essential  services, operators of national critical infrastructures and digital service providers’. In addition,  the National Unit to Combat Cybercrime and Technological Crime (UNC3T) collaborates and  directly supports the actions of prevention, detection and mitigation developed by national  entities (Polícia Judiciária , n.d.). Finally, the Internal Intelligence Service (SIS, n.d.) collaborates  closely with LEAs and public authorities, as well as providing support when this is requested.  As emerged from the interviews, one example of synergy is the sharing of methodologies: both  CSIRTs and LEAs run regular laboratories and/or joint exercises and share methodologies.  Another example is the sharing of information: LEAs frequently share indicators of compromise  or indicators of threat with the other G4 members through the communication channel to verify  the information. There are also synergies across the different communities with regard to  training: the police provide lectures to the school of magistrates and criminal police schools, as  well as annual lectures to magistrates and the academic community.  Nevertheless, addressing cybersecurity means dealing with the global security of cyberspace  and sometimes there is an overlap between the CNCS and the police. For example, if a CSIRT  decides to bring down (‘takedown procedure’) a botnet without consulting a LEA that may be in  the process of investigating it, this can cause disruptions. The G4 group was created to try and  avoid conflicts and overlapping activities, and weekly meetings increase the levels of  communication between the parties.  4.6.3. Examples of training  The CNCS ensures that suitable training activities are provided to the CSIRT community,  including but not limited to training sessions for CSIRT operators and coordination of national  cybersecurity exercises and participation to international cybersecurity exercises. In addition,  the CNCS supports the establishment of new CSIRTs, defines the required capabilities and  circulates best practices for the handling of cybersecurity incidents (CNCS, n.d.c.).  In terms of LE training, the PSP offers both training/teaching courses at a basic level and  specialised courses. The courses are taught by the Higher Institute of Police Sciences and  Internal Security (Instituto Superior de Ciências Policiais e Segurança Interna – ISCPSI)  (ISCPSI, n.d.) and the Police Training School (Escola Prática de Polícia). The Police Training  School provides training in criminal investigations. In addition, UNC3T is responsible for  ensuring collaboration and direct participation in initial and ongoing training on cybercrime for  staff involved in criminal investigations and in supporting the Judicial Police.  The Centre for Judiciary Studies (Centro de Estudos Judiciários – CEJ) (CEJ, n.d.) provides  training for the judiciary on cybercrime and digital evidence, as well as on cyber components of  the penal code and criminal investigations, aiming to provide to all judges and prosecutors a  minimum level of knowledge and information on cybercrime. As reported during one of the  interviews, “The judiciary community has established initiatives that usually try to involve experts  from the other communities in their training activities (provided for prosecutors, judges,  sometimes lawyers and LE). This is a common practice as they have observed the benefits of  such an exchange.’ This will also help ‘to ensure that judiciary experts provide guidance to  CSIRTs’.  The interviews revealed that CSIRTs and LE carry out joint exercises; however, in 2020 any  planned training was not held because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  The judiciary (prosecutors and judges) do not currently participate in such activities. The  interviewees noted that CSIRTs and LE want to find a common approach. Once this is  accomplished, they will expand the training to the judiciary community as well.  From the data collected in the interviews, it emerged that LE personnel participate in civil  postgraduate programmes (legal or engineering programmes). Efforts are also being made to  SYNERGIES IN  MULTIPLE  LEVELS  Examples of  synergies include  sharing of  methodologies,  sharing of  information and  training activities.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  48  provide more engineering courses to legal actors and more legal knowledge to engineers and  set up links with the academic community. This is something that LE supports heavily through  liaising with professors and students to inspire collaborations. LE participates in lectures on  cybercrime law, digital forensics, ethics, etc.  As indicated in the interviews, the CNCS delivers such training online along with awareness  courses for the public. LEAs receive training provided by the school of magistrates and criminal  police schools, with the CNCS also providing annual lectures to magistrates.  4.7.  ROMANIA  Romania is ‘a semi-presidential republic with a head of government – the prime minster – and a  head of state – the president. The country is divided into 41 counties and the municipality of  Bucharest’ (European Union, n.d.h).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Romania is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Romania legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Romania adopted its NCSS in 2013 (ENISA, n.d.k) and legislation that transposes the EU NIS  Directive (Law No 362/2018) in 2018 (CERT RO, 2020).  4.7.1. Roles and duties  In Romania the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation in the  original language (if  applicable)  Romanian National Computer  Security Incident Response Team  Centrul Național de Răspuns la  Incidente de Securitate Cibernetică  CERT-RO  Cyber Security Incident Response  Center  Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică  CERT-MIL  Operational Response Centre for  Security Incidents  Centrul Operațional de Răspuns la  Incidente de Securitate  CORIS-STS  National Cyberint Center  Centrul Național Cyberint  General Inspectorate of Romanian  Police  Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei  Române  IGPR  Directorate for Investigating  Organised Crime and Terrorism  Direcția de Investigare a Infracțiunilor  de Criminalitate Organizată și  Terorism  DIICOT  Judicial system  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  49  4.7.1.1. National cyber security agency  The implementation of the NCSS in Romania is coordinated by the Chancellery of the Prime  Minister.  In Romania, there are multiple cybersecurity authorities. Currently, the Romanian National  Computer Security Incident Response Team (Centrul Național de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică – CERT-RO) (CERT-RO, n.d.) no longer operates under the Ministry of  Communication and Information Society (MCSI), but is coordinated by the Chancellery of the  Prime Minister (Portal Legislativ, n.d.). According to the law transposing the NIS Directive (Law  No 362/2018), CERT-RO is the national competent authority for network and information  systems and has an operational role (CERT RO, 2020).  4.7.1.2. CSIRTs  Romania has an officially recognised national CSIRT: CERT-RO ‘is the National CERT of  Romania, established as an independent structure for research, development and expertise in  the field of cyber-security. It is a specialized organization responsible for preventing, analysing,  identifying and reacting to cyber incidents. CERT-RO is the national contact point for similar  structures. CERT-RO is responsible for elaborating and distributing public politics for prevention  and counteracting the incidents that occur within national cyber infrastructures’ (CERT-RO, n.d.  a).  CORIS-STS (Operational Response Centre for Security Incidents, Centrul Operațional de  Răspuns la Incidente de Securitate) is the Romanian governmental CSIRT and is part of the  Romanian Special Telecommunications Service (STS). This CERT ‘is designated to prevent  and respond to security incidents related to information and communications systems of the  Special Telecommunications Service and its clients’ (CORIS-STS, n.d.).  CERT-MIL (Cyber Security Incident Response Center, Centrul de Răspuns la Incidente de  Securitate Cibernetică) (CERT-MIL, n.d.) is the Romanian Military CSIRT, under the Ministry of  Defence CSIRT, and is responsible for the management of cybersecurity incidents in the  relevant cyber infrastructures, ensuring their detection, investigation and response in  accordance with the regulations and procedures in force under the Ministry of National Defence.  It was established in 2007 within the Ministry of National Defence and since 2020 has been the  responsibility of the Cyber Defence Command.  The National Cyberint Centre (Centrul Național Cyberint) is the cyber intelligence centre of the  Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). Its main focus is on counter-espionage, economic  security, transnational threats and the protection of classified information. The SRI focuses on  cyberattacks, including those that originate in other states, and cybercrime groups, which may  also be associated with terrorist organisations or extremists (hacktivists) (SRI, n.d.).  4.7.1.3. LE  The Central Cybercrime Unit within the Romanian Police (Politia Romana, n.d.) is the primary  LEA dealing with cybercrime, with local capacities as well. More specifically it deals with:   online fraud and fraud committed with electronic payment instruments;   digital forensics;   online child abuse;   computer-related crimes (crimes against/through computer systems; unauthorised  computer/data access or data transfer).  It is a specialised unit (Politia Romana, n.d.a), with general territorial competence, that is  involved in combating and coordinating the fight against organised crime, including cybercrime,  at the national level. The activities carried out by the Directorate for Combating Organized  Crime include:  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  50   Operational activity   Control, support and guidance decisive in obtaining results at territorial level   Information and decision support   International representation/training (Politia Romana, n.d.a).  The challenges facing this specialised unit in 2020 are phishing campaigns/mobile malware  distribution related to COVID-19, ransomware attacks on health facilities/hospitals, attacks  against critical infrastructure holding personal data on COVID-19 patients, online fraud and SIM  SWAP scams (Council of Europe, 2020).  4.7.1.4. Judiciary  The supreme court in Romania is the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The judicial  authorities are divided by the regional and specialised jurisdiction (European e-Justice Portal ,  n.d.)  In Romania, the issuing and execution of the request for international judicial cooperation in  criminal matters is under the competence of the courts and prosecution offices (EJN, n.d.a).  The Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice and  the Ministry of Internal Affairs have responsibility for international judicial cooperation in criminal  matters (EJN, n.d.).  Romania cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.7.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘National cyber security system (NSCC) is the general framework of cooperation which brings  together public authorities and institutions with responsibilities and capabilities in the field in  order to ensure coordination of actions at national level for cyberspace security, including  through cooperation with academia and business, professional associations and organizations  NGOs’ (CERT-RO, n.d.b).  Romania has developed official programmes for cybersecurity interagency cooperation and  information sharing, with CERT-RO playing a major role. CERT-RO has ‘signed a Memorandum  of Understanding (MoU) and Protocols with public institutions in the cybersecurity field’ (ITU,  n.d.).  The Romanian CSIRT, LE and judiciary are cooperating on cybercrime cases under the national  legal framework, which is expected to be updated to provide further support for this kind of  cooperation, for example to stipulate in the criminal procedure code that CERT-RO could be  called to provide expertise to the Prosecutor’s Office and in court.  One example of this cooperation is the Romanian CSIRT, LE and judiciary working together to  fight banking/financial malware (botnets) affecting Romanian citizens and financial institutions.  In terms of synergies, CERT-RO and the Romanian Police are working together to continuously  adapt the framework for information exchange and cooperation. One important aspect of this is  the tools needed to support the cooperation framework, and here CERT-RO has made  important steps recently by implementing a National Cybersecurity Services Platform (NCSP)  that can be used by all stakeholders: LEAs, CSIRTs, internet service providers, public and  private partners, and other authorities.  Another common objective is to assure that technical training is provided for those who work in  the areas of cybersecurity and cybercrime. CERT-RO also has a leading role here by organising  regular technical workshops and seminars for all relevant stakeholders.  SYNERGIES IN  FIGHTING  CYBER  THREATS  The Romanian  CSIRT, LE and  judiciary cooperate  in fighting cyber  threats affecting the  national IT  infrastructure,  citizens and  organisations.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  51  Possible interferences have been reduced drastically as a result of recent developments in  implementation of an optimal cooperation framework between the CSIRT, police and judiciary.  Some interferences may still occur in cybercrime investigations, mainly because of the different  focuses that these communities have, i.e. incident mitigation (CSIRTs) compared with evidence  preservation and criminal prosecution (LE and judiciary).  4.7.3. Examples of training  Since 2017, a national cyber exercise called CyDEX has been organised by the SRI through its  National Cyberint Center, in cooperation with the national CSIRT (CERT-RO), the Ministry of  Defence, the Military Technical Academy, the STS, the Protection and Guard Service and  organisations form different private sectors. The latest exercise included participants from more  than 90 organisations in the public and private sector, including CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  Training for LE at a foundational level and at advanced levels is provided by the Police  Academy and the Police Officers School in Romania.  The training of judges and public prosecutors is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice.  Since 2004, the Ministry of Justice, through its website, has made available guides and useful  information on judicial cooperation, such as handbooks and manuals, for Romanian judges and  prosecutors (Romanian Ministry of Justice, n.d.).  In addition, the Romanian Centre of Excellence for Cybercrime Investigation (CYBEREX-RO)  offers training to those organisations working to combat cybercrime in Romania, such as CERT-  RO, the General Inspectorate of Romanian Police (Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei Române –  IGPR) – Fraud Investigations Directorate (GIRP-FID, n.d.), the Prosecutor’s Office attached to  the High Court of Cassation and Justice (POHCCJ, n.d.), the National Institute for Magistracy  (NIM, n.d.), the Police Academy and others (European Commission, n.d.).Currently, there are  no examples of joint training between the three communities.  4.8.  SWEDEN  Sweden is ‘a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a head of government  – the prime minister – and a head of state – the monarch. Sweden is a unitary state, divided into  20 counties and 290 municipalities’ (European Union, n.d.k.).  In the following subsections, an overview of the main authorities involved in the response to  cybercrime in Sweden is provided, synergies and possible interferences are discussed and  examples of relevant training are provided. More information on the relevant Swedish legal  framework can be found in Annex C.  Sweden adopted its NCSS in 2017, followed by a comprehensive cyber security action plan for  the period 2019–2022 (ENISA, n.d.l) (Swedish Government, n.d.).  4.8.1. Roles and duties  In Sweden the following authorities and departments, in particular, are responsible for  preventing, analysing and fighting cybercrime.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  52  Name of the authority/department  in English  Name of the authority/department in  the original language  Abbreviation in the  original language (if  applicable)  CERT-SE  Sveriges nationella Computer Security  Incident Response Team  CERT-SE  Swedish Civil Contingencies  Agency  Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och  beredskap  MSB  National Defence Radio  Establishment  Försvarets radioanstalt FRA  Swedish Defence Materiel  Administration  Försvarets materielverk FMV  Swedish Armed Forces Försvarsmakten FM  Swedish Post and Telecom  Authority  Post-och telestyrelsen PTS  Swedish Police Authority Polismyndigheten  Swedish Security Service  Säkerhetspolisen SÄPO  Swedish Prosecution Authority Åklagarmyndigheten  Swedish Economic Crime  Authority  Ekobrottsmyndigheten  Swedish National Courts  Administration  Domstolsverket  4.8.1.1. National cyber security agency  The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskaps –  MSB) is the responsible authority for network and information security in Sweden (MSB, n.d.).  The cybersecurity action plan of Sweden contains measures that the MSB will undertake, along  with the authorities mentioned above in Section 4.8.1.  4.8.1.2. CSIRTs  CERT-SE is the officially recognised national and governmental CSIRT (CERT-SE, 2015). The  MSB is the authority that operates the national CERT.  CERT-SE also collaborates with the military CERT of Sweden, Försvarsmakten FM-CERT (FM-  CERT, n.d.) (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  SUNet-CERT is the Swedish University Network CERT. It supports academic and educational  institutions as well as other organisations connected to the SUNET network (SUNet-CERT,  n.d.).  4.8.1.3. LE  The Swedish Police Authority (Polismyndigheten) (Polisen, n.d.) falls under the Ministry of  Justice. The LEAs listed below undertake cybercrime investigation tasks, among other types of  criminal investigations, and are overseen by the Swedish Police Authority:   the Swedish Cybercrime Centre (SC3);   the National Fraud Centre;   the National Forensic Centre (Nationellt forensiskt centrum – NFC);   the National Operations Department (Nationella operativa avdelningen – NOA).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  53  The SC3 was established ‘to investigate all forms of cybercrime. [SC3] is responsible for  detecting, preventing and averting serious cybercrime’. The SC3 shares information on threats,  as well as technical methods to combat cybercrime, with partner agencies (Council of the  European Union, 2017b); see also (Polisen, n.d. a).  The main tasks of the NFC are to conduct forensic investigations and analyses for the judicial  authorities (NFC, n.d.). The National Fraud Centre has a coordinating and supportive role. The  centre supports investigators regionally and locally and shares best practices. It collaborates  with the NFC and the SC3 (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Polisen, n.d. a).  The NOA has a leading role in operational activities. The International Affairs Division within the  NOA acts as the National Unit of Europol and is the national point of contact for international  police cooperation (Polisen, n.d. a).  4.8.1.4. Judiciary  The Swedish Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) and the Swedish Economic Crime  Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) are the national authorities that carry out public prosecution  tasks (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (Åklagarmyndigheten, n.d.)  (Ekobrottsmyndigheten, n.d.).  The Swedish Prosecution Authority comprises the following offices:   the National Anti-Corruption Unit, which deals with corruption;   the National Unit for Environment and Working Environment Cases, which deals with  the environmental crimes;   the National Security Unit, which deals with security-related cases;   the National Unit against Organised Crime, which deals with organised cross-border  crime.  Cybercrime and criminal investigations fall under the responsibility of the general prosecution  service. In addition, the Swedish Prosecution Authority has developed a network of prosecutors  who deal with cybercrime in the different regions of the country (Council of the European Union,  2017b).  The Swedish judicial system has “ two parallel types of courts: Ordinary courts, which deal with  criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts, which deal with cases relating to  public administration” (European Union, n.d.l.).  “Cybercrime acts are dealt with by the general courts […] in the same manner as other criminal  acts” (Council of the European Union, 2017b). The Swedish National Courts Administration  (Domstolsverket) (Swedish National Courts Administration, n.d.) is the coordinating organisation  for the Swedish courts.  Judicial cooperation in criminal matters with EU Member States is based on the principles of  mutual recognition and direct contact between judicial authorities.  Sweden also cooperates with Eurojust and is a member of Eurojust’s Cybercrime Network.  4.8.2. Synergies and potential interferences  ‘The SC3 and the Civil Contingencies Agency are developing cooperation mechanisms at  operational as well as at strategic level’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b).  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  54  Cooperation mechanisms have also been established between LE and the CERT-SE. In  addition, collaboration between the private sector and financial institutions and LE has been  established, mainly based on information sharing.  As indicated in the interviews with competent experts, there is a frequent exchange of  information between the CSIRT and LE communities as part of monthly meetings established to  support their cooperation. In addition, there is ‘spontaneous communication on a daily basis’  under the principle that ‘it is better to share than not to share’. The cooperation mechanisms  established between the two communities have allowed them to complement each other when  performing different tasks. This is particularly the case in interactions with the victims of an  incident/cybercrime. ‘In some cases the LE provide CSIRTs with information’ so that they can  notify ‘their community and […] the victims. Examples are cases of Distributed Denial-of-Service  (DDoS) attacks and ransomware’. The CSIRT community ‘has a responsibility to advise the  victims of an incident/cybercrime but cannot report the incident on behalf of the victim. CSIRTs  do not have a mandate that would allow them to reach out to the victims to obtain information.  [On their side, however,] LE are able to contact the victim and ensure their cooperation during  an investigation process.’ It was also stressed that the CSIRT community relies on the trust  relationships established with other CSIRT teams and organisations to ensure a flow of  information and smooth collaboration. On the other hand, ‘the LE community has a strong legal  framework that allows them to enforce their role and access information’.  As emerged from the interviews, ‘The national CSIRT [also] provides their technical expertise’ in  cases where they are ‘called as expert witnesses in court proceedings. An example was a fraud  case where CSIRT provided technical support in analysing evidence.’  Based on the feedback provided by the interviewees, ‘interferences have been noted due to the  different tasks that the CSIRT and LE community have. But through mutual efforts [and trust],  they have developed an understanding and have managed to benefit from each other’s skills.’  For instance, CSIRTs have been able to ‘support LE in evidence preservation if requested’.  Concerning the interaction between LE and the judiciary, LEAs share with prosecutors  information connected to investigations. LEAs ‘share information with the judges only for court  proceedings. Intervention by a judge during an investigation is rare (mainly limited to cases  where decision needs to be made about restricting fundamental freedoms).’  4.8.3. Examples of training  The Swedish National Police Academy (Polishögskolan) provides training for police officers  (Polishögskolan, n.d.). The academy organises basic training for police officers in collaboration  with higher education institutes such as Växjö University and Umeå University. It also  coordinates participation in international courses such as those organised by CEPOL and the  Association of European Police Colleges (AEPC) (OSCE, n.d.).  The SC3 also organises training for LE and coordinates the exchange of expertise through its  website. It also participates in the ‘first responders e-learning’ package on IT forensics and IT  crime knowledge, in cooperation with ECTEG and supported by Europol, CEPOL, the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Council of Europe (ECTEG, n.d.)  (Polisen, n.d. a). The material is used to support training for LE.  The Training Centre of the Swedish Prosecution Authority provides a specialised course on  cybercrime ‘in the mandatory initial training and in the further training for prosecutors’. In  addition, training in different areas is provided, such as on international legal assistance and on  the legal systems of other countries. The Prosecution Authority also shares through its website  a platform for prosecutors to exchange information and knowledge (Council of the European  Union, 2017b).  A CULTURE OF  SYNERGY  Established  cooperation and  spontaneous  communication  under the principle  that ‘it is better to  share than not to  share’ .  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  55  The Swedish Judicial Training Academy organises training programmes for the judiciary.  Although specialised training on cybercrime is not offered, ‘the Academy organises annual  criminal law seminars on relevant topics’ (Council of the European Union, 2017b) (The Swedish  Judicial Training Academy , n.d.).  The SC3 organises training for LE as well as prosecutors.  4.9.  FINAL REMARKS  4.9.1. Overview of skills and competences  The technical complexity and the cross-border nature of cybercrime has challenged the  competences (including skills, knowledge, attributes and behaviours (IAEA, n.d.) (UN, n.d.)  (OECD, 2014) of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, driving the three communities to refine their  expertise and establish cooperation mechanisms. Interviews with country experts affirmed that  interferences can occur during incident handling and cybercrime investigations, but that the  communities make efforts to avoid such interferences, create effective partnerships and take  advantage of their synergies.  The CSIRT community holds the technical expertise that is required to detect and mitigate  cybersecurity incidents and restore cyber-secure environments. The LE and judiciary experts  interviewed highlighted that the technical competences of the CSIRT community are also  particularly valuable when it comes to assisting with evidence collection, preservation and  presentation before a court of law. In addition, several interviewees confirmed that the  information flow between CSIRTs and LE has been fundamental in ensuring operational and  strategic awareness of cyberthreats.  Although each Member State has its own specific operational and legal framework for shaping  the response to cybercrime, it emerged from the interviews that the LE community has an  institutional role and carries out the following tasks: determining whether a cybersecurity  incident has a criminal nature, conducting the investigation of cybercrime cases and reaching  out to the victims of such cases to advise them and ensure their collaboration. To perform these  tasks, the LE community applies its knowledge and expertise in digital forensics and criminal  investigations. Provided they have a legal mandate, LEAs can aggregate pertinent information  on cybercrime cases using their own evidence collection methods, directly from victims , but  also through their LE counterparts in other countries and the CSIRT community. In the evidence  collection framework, the LE community bears the responsibility for preserving the chain of  custody and following the necessary procedures to bring criminals to justice.  The LE investigative activities are closely monitored by the judiciary and, in particular, by public  prosecution authorities. Depending on the judicial system of each Member State, a prosecutor  or an investigative judge is responsible for leading the cybercrime investigation process and has  the authority to issue warrants and instructions to support evidence collection activities. The  judiciary community (mainly the judges) assesses the admissibility of the evidence collected,  examines the witnesses and pronounces the verdict, determining the criminal and civil liability of  cybercrime perpetrators. In addition to their legal competences, given the technical nature of  cybercrime, the judiciary needs to understand the technical matters to the extent required to be  able to judge whether a suspect has committed a crime and the relevant circumstances to  determine the sentence and they may require the support of the CSIRT community, whose  delegates may be invited as expert witnesses before the courts.  The interviewees provided examples of training activities involving all three communities,  sometimes in the form of joint exercises. These joint training exercises help enhance overall the  competences required to respond to cybercrime. With joint training, the three communities can  reach a ‘better understanding [of] the role and how the other communities work’, they become  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  56  more aware of the skills and strengths of the other communities and can enhance their  competences by learning from each other. For instance, the CSIRT community can learn more  about investigative techniques and ‘data acquisition, so that the data acquired by […CSIRTs]  could more easily serve as evidence in criminal and other types of proceedings’, and can  acquire legal knowledge, for example ‘how to identify if an incident is a crime, and what role LE  has on that’. The LE community can obtain a better insight into the different ways that the  CSIRT community shares information, as well as the tools used, and further knowledge on  analysing data logs and performing incident analysis in specific areas. The judiciary community  can benefit by gaining more awareness of cyberthreats and developing, in general, a better  understanding of the technical aspects of cybercrime.  Finally, because of the cross-border nature of cybercrime, all three communities need to know  about the different EU and international legal frameworks (notably the Convention on  Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2003) and cooperation mechanisms and networks (e.g. CSIRTs  Network (CNW) (ENISA, n.d.a), European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF) (Europol,  n.d.a), Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) (Europol, n.d.c) (25), and European Judicial  Cybercrime Network (EJCN) (Eurojust, n.d.b), 24/7 Points of Contact Network under the Council  of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (26)). In addition, the communities need to develop their  competences and build organisational and intercultural skills to liaise effectively with  counterparts from other Member State and EFTA countries.  4.9.2. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cooperation  It is indisputable that ‘The outbreak of Covid-19 has brought an immense change in the way we  conduct our lives. In this increasingly connected world, we can, fortunately, continue our  professional and private lives virtually’ (ENISA, n.d.b). Fortunately, cooperation among the  CSIRT, LE, and judiciary communities has also continued during the pandemic crisis, and this is  more crucial than ever because ‘The COVID-19 pandemic renders individuals and society  extremely vulnerable in all respects’ (Council of Europe, 2020a) and ‘Criminals have quickly  adapted their techniques to exploit [the situation and] our fears around the COVID-19 pandemic’  (Europol, 2020).  It emerged in quite an unequivocal manner from the data collected in the interviews that, in all  eight countries analysed in this study, overall, the COVID‑19 pandemic has not hindered  cooperation between the CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities; instead, it has generally  become even closer and more frequent.  Some interviewees highlighted that meetings in person occurred less frequently (in particular  those ‘that concerned very sensitive matters that cannot be handled on the phone or via e-  mails)’, some meetings were postponed and some ‘joint training plans [were] disrupted’;  however, more meetings took place using video/teleconferencing, several events were moved  online and electronic communication, as well as the automatic exchange of information, overall  seemed to have increased: ‘There is more information sharing. The big change is that we  moved physical meetings to virtual ones.’ One of the interviewees stated that ‘Operations [were]  still ongoing despite the pandemic, to avoid interrupting investigations in most of the cases’,  although the fact that some meetings and court hearings were suspended represented a  challenge.  In addition, the interviewees noted that the COVID-19 crisis ‘did not change the communication  but rather made it more present and more frequent – almost a daily interaction and exchange of  information was established. During this period [indeed], joint work and joint approaches were  (25) Information on J-CAT is available through https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint- cybercrime-action-taskforce  (26) A recent study of the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) highlighted the benefits and  successful examples of international cooperation that stem from the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  (Council of Europe, 2020b).  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  57  established covering a broader scope of activities, including joint statements. In other words,  COVID made the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE take place not only on criminal  investigations and incidents but also on raising awareness.’ According to the interviewees, ‘The  crisis [actually] helped the institutions to enhance their distance working capacities, e.g. to  organise meetings through secure videoconference platforms’, and during the pandemic crisis  ‘there was more close cooperation on updates that needed to be provided to the Government’.  One of the interviewees defined the pandemic period as ‘a productive work period in terms of  communication since the exchanges were multiplied between the entities, especially CSIRTs  and LE. Cooperation with other communities was facilitated at the end. They had to adapt to the  electronic means and work more hours but they adapted well in the new situation.’  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  58  5. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  5.1.  CONCLUSIONS  This report presents a methodology (based on desk research, interviews and compilation of a  SoD matrix) to collect data on CSIRTs and LE cooperation, in particular their roles, synergies  and interferences, competences and training initiatives related to cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and their interactions with the judiciary. This methodology has been used to collect data on  some Member State/EFTA countries, namely Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway,  Portugal, Romania and Sweden. The results of this data collection and related analysis are  presented in the report.  Using the analysis of the data collected, the conclusions summarised below were drawn. Some  of these conclusions found clear confirmation in the discussions at the 9th ENISA/EC3  Workshop on CSIRT and LE cooperation that took place on 16 September 2020; this was an  online event, by invitation only (ENISA, 2020).   All countries analysed have signed the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on  Cybercrime and almost all of them have ratified it and the Additional Protocol on the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer  systems. Each country, however, has specific legislation on cybercrime, which is  mandated through many different national laws and different criminal procedural law  that governs investigations and the prosecution of (cyber)crime.   All countries analysed have a NCSS, which sets up the general framework for the  coordination and cooperation of all authorities and defines their roles and  responsibilities.   In terms of incident response, in line with the NIS Directive, all countries analysed have  established national CSIRTs. However, although there are similarities, the way they  are organised and the position they have in the national institutional framework vary  from country to country.   The way that LEAs dealing with cybercrime are organised also varies from country  to country: some countries have specialised central cybercrime units, whereas others  have decentralised specialised units or both.   The structure and organisation of the judiciary also vary by country: in some  countries there are ‘specialised prosecutors or specialised structures within the  Prosecution Services dealing with cybercrime offences’, while in other countries ‘the  responsibility for dealing with such crimes usually lies “de facto” with specialised public  prosecutors and judges, who have been trained or have experience in the area of  cybercrime’ (Council of the European Union, 2017c).   Among the three communities – CSIRTs, LE and judiciary – different approaches and  different levels of cooperation exist. While operational cooperation, especially in  daily interactions and informal communication, seems to be well established,  sometimes it appears that more structured cooperation would be useful in order to  achieve a less fragmented information flow between the three communities. In  addition, there is a bigger gap in the interaction between CSIRTs and the judiciary than  in the cooperation established between LE and the judiciary.   LEAs are not solely involved in the detection and investigation of cybercrimes. A key  component of their role is the preventive aspects of cybercrime, and it is here that  COVID-19  The pandemic crisis  has changed the way  that CSIRTs, LE and  the judiciary work and  interact together. In  some instances, it has  actually meant  increased interactions  among the  communities..  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  59  cooperation with other communities, particularly the CSIRT community, becomes  apparent, to support preventive strategies.   CSIRTs and LEAs need to cooperate to decrease the risk of evidence being  compromised or destroyed.   CSIRTs and LE also cooperate during the analysis of evidence.   CSIRTs play an important role in informing (potential) victims of cybercrime and in  providing them with information on how to report a crime to the police.   CSIRTs may be called as witnesses in court, although this rarely happens.   Several competences are required for incident handling and cybercrime investigation;  while each community has developed its own set of skills and knowledge, each could  benefit from the competences of the other communities.   Some initiatives are in place to facilitate training within each community and some  joint training takes place involving two of the communities (e.g. CSIRTs and LE, or LE  and the judiciary); however, there is a need for further initiatives and for training and  exercises that involve the three communities together.   The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary work  together and interact. The greatest impact has been on training and workshop  events, as well as meetings, which were cancelled in the early stages of the pandemic  and later delivered online. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, the use of online  tools to facilitate meetings and events has become the norm. Overall, there does not  appear to have been a significant impact of the pandemic on the ability of the three  communities to cooperate. In some instances, the level of vigilance and interaction  among the communities has actually increased, with even daily interaction taking  place, to ensure that each community is kept up to date.  5.2.  WAYS FORWARD  5.2.1. Use the methodology proposed to extend the analysis to additional  countries  Additional EU and EFTA countries could be analysed using the methodology outlined in this  report.  The methodology could be easily tailored and used to analyse cooperation between CSIRTs,  LE and judiciary in countries other than EU Member State and EFTA countries, beginning with  candidate countries, potential candidate countries and neighbouring countries of the EU (27).  5.2.2. Use the results to develop additional training material  In its continuous effort to provide training material for the CSIRT community, including on  cooperation with the LE community and other operational communities (ENISA, n.d.), ENISA  has developed a handbook and a toolset (ENISA, 2021) based on the results outlined in this  current report. Additional training material could be developed based on the results of an  analysis extended to additional EU Member States and EFTA countries, and possibly candidate  countries, potential candidate countries and neighbouring countries of the EU.  5.2.3. Use the results to develop a catalogue of competences across  authorities in EU Member States and EFTA countries  A catalogue of the competences required during incident handling and cybercrime  investigations, with an indication of the authorities in each Member State and EFTA country that  could offer such competences, would help CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary become more aware of  (27) For more information on neighbouring countries of the EU, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-  euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring- countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en  https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/international-economic-relations/enlargement-and-neighbouring-countries/neighbouring-countries-eu_en  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  60  the skills and strengths of other communities in their country, and also across the EU and EFTA  area. This would allow authorities to learn from each other’s initiatives and also facilitate the  provision of expertise where required for incident handling and/or criminal investigation. Such a  catalogue of competences could be developed using information collected using this  methodology (slightly adapting the questionnaire and the SoD matrix, if necessary, to further  focus on competences).  5.2.4. Use the results to develop decision support systems  The results of an extended analysis could help complete the picture and serve as a basis for the  development of decision support systems that a CSIRT, LE or judiciary authority could easily  consult to obtain information on which authorities are responsible for, supporting, consulted  about and informed about a specific duty related to fighting cybercrime in one or more countries  (see Annex D for an example of how the SoD matrix can be used to develop a decision support  system). These support systems can aid in decision-making and in taking actions in cases  where the evidence is located in several countries.  5.2.5. Organise joint training and exercises for the three communities  Although there might be organisational and legal constraints against the participation of the  judiciary in joint training and exercises, wherever possible initiatives involving all three  communities should take place. This would help the communities better understand each  other’s capabilities, needs and boundaries, to enable them to better respond in practice to cyber  incidents of a criminal nature by exploiting synergies and avoiding interferences.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  61  6.

In particular, the user  of such a decision support system should be able to find the appropriate contact (i.e. the  authority or the community) who is responsible (R – as described in the RSCI method) for a  specific duty.  For instance, someone who is responsible for collecting cyberthreat intelligence in Romania  could use the SoD matrix to find who to contact, i.e. to find the CSIRT in Romania that is  responsible for performing this specific duty.  The data in the following table were provided by the Member State representatives who  participated in the interviews conducted for collecting data for this report. Although some  interviewees provided their consent for their affiliation and country to be included in the report,  information on countries and authorities have been removed from the table. A greater sample of  replies is needed to validate the data collected during the interviews and to enable official  results to be presented for each country.  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  103  E ANNEX:  INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE  Questionnaire to Support the interviews with subject matter experts to collect data for the 2020  ENISA Report on CSIRTs and LE Cooperation.  The questions below have been prepared to support the interviews with subject matter experts  to collect data for the 2020 ENISA report on CSIRTs and LE cooperation along with their  interaction with the judiciary. This report contributes to the implementation of the ENISA  programming document 2020–2022 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-  documents/enisa-programming-document-202020132022) in particular “Output O.4.2.2 –  Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA and other  operational communities”.  The report is expected to be ready for publication by the end of 2020.  ENISA selected some external experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the  ENISA Call for Expression of Interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) to support the data  collection (including the interviews) and the drafting of this report.  The expected duration of the interview is 1 hour.  For more information regarding this questionnaire and the report, please contact: CSIRT-LE-  cooperation@enisa.europa.eu  Contact details  Interviewer:  Date of the interview:  Name of the interviewee:  Affiliation:  Position:  Country:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-202020132022 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-202020132022 mailto:CSIRT-LE-cooperation@enisa.europa.eu mailto:CSIRT-LE-cooperation@enisa.europa.eu  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  104  Section 1 – Questions on general legal/organisational  aspects  1. What is the role of your organisation in fighting cybercrime activities?  2. Does your legal framework support the cooperation between CSIRT/LEA and  the interaction/information flow with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges) in  cybercrime proceedings and in general in responding to cybercrime? If so,  how?  3. Regarding cybercrime cases, could you briefly describe how information is  shared between CSIRTs – national and governmental in particular – LEAs,  prosecutors and judges?  QUESTIONS ON SEGREGATION OF DUTIES (SOD) MATRIX  4. Referring to the SoD matrix that was sent to you prior to this interview (and  you can also find it in Annex I at the end of this questionnaire), could you fill it  out by identifying for each duty which actor (CSIRT, LE, Prosecutors, Judges) in  your country is:   Responsible (R): responsible for performing this duty, is the decision-maker   Supporting (S): providing support when performing this duty (if applicable)   Consulted (C): consulted during the performance of this duty (if applicable)   Informed (I): informed when performing this duty? (if applicable)    SEE SoD MATRIX in ANNEX I at the end of this questionnaire  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  105  Section 2: Questions on possible synergies and potential  interferences  5. In your opinion, which are the possible synergies across CSIRT/LE and judiciary  during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have you  seen in reality such synergies taking place? Could you give us an example?  In your opinion, which are the potential interferences across CSIRT/LE and judiciary  during the performance of their fighting cybercrime-related duties? Have you seen in  reality such interference taking place? Could you provide an example?  Section 3 – Questions on challenges  6. Are there any specific challenges that you would like to mention about cooperation  across the CSIRT/LE and judiciary communities? If yes, what kind of challenges (e.g.  legal, organisational, technical, cultural).  7. Are there any challenges that you would like to mention in particular regarding  digital forensics and electronic evidence (e-evidence)?  Section 4 – Questions on competences and training  8. What are the competencies that your organisation/community has and could share  with the other communities (in particular CSIRT with LE/judiciary, LE with CSIRT, and  judiciary with CSIRT)?  9. Which competencies do you feel are lacking/could be improved in your  organisation/community and you might improve by learning from another  community (e.g. CSIRT from LE/judiciary, LE from CSIRT, and judiciary from CSIRT)  Does your organisation organise and/or participate in joint training across CSIRTs, LEAs and  judiciary (prosecutor and judges) communities? If yes, do you find them useful?  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  106  10. Section 5 – Question on COVID-19 pandemic crisis  11. Has the COVID-19 pandemic crisis changed the way CSIRT/LE/judiciary work together?  If yes, how so? Could you provide an example? (e.g. less meetings in person, but on the  other hand more communication via email and over the phone)  Section 6 – Question on cybersecurity certification of  forensic tools  12. Do you think that a cybersecurity certification of forensic tools would help the  CSIRT/LE/judiciary cooperation? (e.g. if CSIRTs use certified tools, the LE and Judiciary  might trust more the data provided by CSIRT and use them more easily as evidence in  court)  Section 7 – Question on any additional information or  comments  13. Would you like to share any additional information or provide us with any comment?

The data controller of the processing operation is ENISA Core Operations Department.  The legal basis for the processing operation is: Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725,  on the basis of Regulation (EU) 2019/881, in particular the provisions establishing the tasks of  ENISA. With the view of contributing to the fulfilment of such tasks and according to the ENISA  Programming Document 2020–2022 as approved by Management Board in Decision No  MB/2019/16 [2], ENISA is preparing a report to further enhance the cooperation between the  CSIRTs and the law enforcement along with their interaction with the judiciary (see Output  O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA and other  operational communities).  The purpose of this processing operation is to collect data via subject matter interviews for the  drafting of the ENISA report to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs and the law  enforcement along with their interaction with the judiciary.  The data processors of the processing operation will be external experts who will be  contracted by ENISA to support the data collection and drafting of the report. The interviews will  be conducted face-to-face, over the phone, via skype or with other means to be agreed with the  interviewee.  The following personal data are collected for the respondents of the interviews:  Contact and professional data: name, surname, community they belong to (e.g. CSIRT, LE,  prosecutors, judges, etc.), position, affiliation, country, email address, phone number (optional).  Replies to interviews: Note that the data produced by the data subjects’ replies to interviews are  not generally considered as personal data, since they are only of professional nature. Still, there  might be cases where a respondent produces ad hoc personal data, e.g. by disclosing during  the interview data relating to his/her private life or by expressing his/her specific personal  opinion regarding certain professional matters that may influence the behaviour or status of  other individuals. ENISA will make any possible effort to remove ad hoc personal data from the  2020 REPORT ON CSIRT-LE COOPERATION  January 2021  108  replies to interviews. In all cases, the replies to interviews will be presented in the final report in  a fully aggregated form.  The recipients of the data will be designated ENISA staff involved in the data collection and  drafting of the report, as well as designated ENISA contractors supporting ENISA with the data  collection and the drafting of the report (data processors). Only when explicit written consent is  provided by the data subject, name, surname, affiliation, country, might be included in the  acknowledgements of the report. The data may also be available to EU bodies charged with  compliance monitoring and inspection tasks.  Personal data will be kept up to a maximum period of six months after the publication of the  report (possibly in December 2020). After the end of this period, the contact and professional data  will be manually deleted. However, replies to interviews will be kept by ENISA beyond this period  in an anonymised form (without linking to specific respondents) for future ENISA projects.  You have the right of access to your personal data and to relevant information concerning how  we use it. You have the right to rectify your personal data. Under certain conditions, you have the  right to ask that we delete your personal data or restrict their use. You have the right to object to  our processing of your personal data, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time.  We will consider your request, take a decision and communicate it to you.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report is to further explore and support the cooperation between computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), in particular national and governmental (n/g) CSIRTs, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and their interactions with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges). This report proposes a methodology to analyse the legal and organisational framework, the roles and duties of CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary, and their required competences, as well as synergies and potential interferences in their activities related to their responses to cyber incidents and fight against cyber-crime, respectively. In addition, this report aims to present a detailed analysis focusing on some Member States (MSs) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, namely Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden."

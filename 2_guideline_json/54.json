Standards and Technology  (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems.  NIST standards and guidelines are developed in an open and transparent manner that enlists broad industry and academia expertise from around  the world.  While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and  accepted throughout the world.  The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues to be critical for the Nation.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, CSD continued to align its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative security  technologies and methodologies that enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational  research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography; identity and access management; cloud,  virtualization, and mobile technologies; and advanced security testing and measurement.  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2013, the President issued Executive  Order 13636 that directed NIST to work collaboratively with industry to develop a voluntary framework - based on existing standards, guidelines, and  practices - to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity practices.  NIST held several workshops, meetings, webinars, and informal sessions to  gather feedback with the goals of generating content for the framework and discuss several topics that help inform and guide NIST in this effort.  In  August 2013, we produced a discussion draft of the preliminary framework.  Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving and expanding security automation  capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and technologies. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and  education programs also exemplify the importance of these partnerships by engaging with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium  businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.  Active engagement with the diverse federal community continues to be critical to our success.  This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened  collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common  foundation for information security across the federal government. Through this partnership, NIST released Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision  4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in April 2013. This guideline provides organizations with state-of- the-practice security controls to fundamentally strengthen their systems and the environments in which those systems operate. SP 800-53 Revision  4 and other NIST standards and guidelines contribute to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.  Late in FY 2013, news reports about leaked classified documents caused concern from the cryptographic community about the security of NIST  cryptographic standards and guidelines. Recognizing community concern regarding some specific standards, we reopened the public comment period  for three Special Publications to give the public a second opportunity to view and comment on the documents.  This initial step will be followed by a  review of our cryptographic development process and NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines in FY 2014.  For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government,  has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward  to furthering these relationships in FY 2014 as we lead the development and practical implementation of  scalable and sustainable information security standards and practices in areas such as cyber-physical and  industrial control systems, privacy engineering, security automation, and mobile technologies.

Overview: CTG’s work in the field of cryptography includes researching,  analyzing, and standardizing cryptographic technology, such  as hash algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic  techniques, key management, authentication, and random  number generation. CTG’s goal is to identify and promote  methods to enhance trust in communications, data, and storage  through cryptographic technology, encouraging innovative  development and helping technology users to manage risk.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, CTG continued to make an impact in  the field of cryptography, both within and outside the Federal  Government, by collaborating with national and international  agencies, academic and research organizations, and standards  bodies to develop interoperable security standards and  guidelines. In addition, CTG worked with industry partners to  promote the use of NIST-approved cryptographic methods.  Federal agency collaborators include the National Security  Agency (NSA), the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects  Activity (IARPA), the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA), the National Strategy for  Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), General Services  Administration (GSA), the United States Postal Service (USPS),  and the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  CTG also works closely with foreign government agencies,  such as the Communications Security Establishment of  Canada and Australia’s Defense Signals Agency and Centrelink.  Additionally, CTG is active in national and international standards  bodies, including the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9  (financial industry standards), the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG). Industry collaborators include Intel,  Microsoft, and Cisco.  Academic collaborators include Carnegie Mellon University,  Yale University, University of Southern Denmark, the University  of Milan, Malaga University, and the University of Lisbon.  Research organizations include the Information-technology  Promotion Agency (IPA)/Cryptography Research and Evaluation  Committees (CRYPTREC) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry (METI) of Japan.  Group Manager (Acting):  Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  Security Components and Mechanisms Group  (SCMG)  Mission Statement: Research, develop, and standardize foundational security  mechanisms, protocols, and services.  Overview: The SCMG’s security research focuses on the development  and management of foundational building-block security  mechanisms and techniques that can be integrated into a  wide variety of mission-critical U.S. information systems. The  group’s work spans the spectrum from near-term hardening  and improvement to the design and analysis of next- generation, leap-ahead security capabilities. Computer security  depends fundamentally on the level of trust for computer  software and systems. This work, therefore, focuses strongly  on assurance building activities ranging from the analysis of  software configuration settings to advanced trust architectures  to testing tools that surface flaws in software modules. This  work also focuses significantly on increasing the applicability  and effectiveness of automated techniques, wherever feasible.  The SCMG conducts collaborative research with government,  industry, and academia. Outputs of this research consist of  prototype systems, software tools, demonstrations, NIST  Special Publications (SP), NIST Interagency or Internal Reports  (NISTIR), and conference and journal papers.  SCMG works on a variety of topics, such as specifications  for the automated exchange of security information between  systems, computer security incident handling guidelines,  formulation of high-assurance software configuration settings,  hardware roots of trust for mobile devices, secure Basic  Input Output System (BIOS) layers, combinatorial testing  techniques, conformity assessment of software implementing  biometric standards, and adoption of Internet Protocol Version  6 and Internet Protocol security extensions. SCMG collaborates  extensively with government, academia, and the private sector.  In FY 2013, collaborations have included Carnegie Mellon  University (test development environment), Johns Hopkins  Applied Physics Lab (practical application of combinatorial  coverage measurement tool), North Carolina State University  (access control policy testing), University of North Texas and  University of Maryland-Baltimore County (test prioritization  algorithms), University of Texas at Arlington (covering array  generation algorithm), Mexico’s Centro Nacional de Metrología  (constraints for testing coverage tool), National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA) (practical application for  combinatorial coverage measurement), U.S. Air Force Test and  Evaluation (a new event sequence testing method), the National  Security Agency (secure software tool chain competition  development), and the Department of Homeland Security  (incident coordination).  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  5  SCMG accomplishments include the Advanced Combinatorial  Testing System (ACTS) software and documentation, the NIST  BioCTS 2013 biometric conformance testing tool and test  assertions, and a security log analysis tool.  Group Manager:  Mr. Mark (Lee) Badger  (301) 975-3176  mark.badger@nist.gov  Secure Systems and Applications  Group (SSAG)  Mission Statement: Integrate and apply security technologies, standards, and  guidelines for computing platforms and information systems.  Overview: SSAG’s security research focuses on the identification of  emerging and high-priority technologies and on the development  of security solutions that will enhance the security of U.S.  critical information infrastructure. The group conducts research  and development on behalf of government and industry from  the earliest stages of technology development through proof- of-concept, reference and prototype implementations, and  demonstrations. SSAG works to transfer new technologies to  industry; to produce new standards and guidance for federal  agencies and industry; and to develop tests, test methodologies,  and assurance methods.  SSAG investigates topics such as mobile device security,  cloud computing and virtualization, identity management,  access control and authorization management, and software  assurance. SSAG research helps federal agencies meet  information security requirements that might not be fully  addressed by existing technology. The group collaborates  extensively with government, academia, and private sector  entities.  Example successes from this work include tools for access  control policy testing, new concepts in access control and  policy enforcement, methods for achieving comprehensive  policy enforcement and data interoperability across enterprise  data services, and test methods for mobile device (smart phone)  application security. For example, the SSAG Mobile Application  Testing Portal (ATP) went operational for military use (known in  the U.S. Army as PANTHR) and is in the process of transitioning  to other federal agencies as open source. In support of the  Federal Government’s cloud computing initiatives, SSAG led  the NIST Security Working Group that published the NIST Cloud  Computing - Security Reference Architecture. The SSAG also  completed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) 201-2, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, which was approved by the  Secretary of Commerce and published in September of 2013.  To improve access to new technologies, SSAG chaired,  edited, and participated in the development of a wide variety of  national and international security standards.  Group Manager:  Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-3046  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Security Outreach and Integration Group (SOIG)  Mission Statement: Develop, integrate, and promote the mission-specific  application of information security standards, guidelines, best  practices, and technologies.  Overview: The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely on  information technology (IT); so the protection of IT and  information infrastructure is critical. SOIG leverages broad  cybersecurity and risk management expertise to develop,  integrate, and promote security standards, guidelines, tools,  technologies, methodologies, tests, and measurements to  address cybersecurity needs in many areas of national and  international importance.  The SOIG collaborates with stakeholders to address  cybersecurity considerations in many diverse program areas,  including the Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT) supply chain, Smart Grid, Electronic Voting, Health  Information Technology, and Cyber Physical and Industrial  Control Systems. The group continues to increase its efforts to  research, develop, and align cybersecurity standards, practices,  and testing methods necessary to foster interoperable and  secure public safety communications. In our Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA) implementation program,  the group produces standards and guidelines to help federal  agencies build strong cybersecurity risk management programs.  In each of these program areas, the group extends outreach  to stakeholders across federal, state, and local governments;  industry; academia; small businesses; and the public. The SOIG  also leads several broad cybersecurity awareness, training,  education, and outreach efforts, including the National Initiative  for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the Small- and Medium- sized Business (SMB) outreach program, the Federal Computer  Security Managers’ Forum, and the Federal Information Systems  Security Educators’ Association (FISSEA).  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact with a  broad constituency to ensure that SOIG’s program is consistent  with national objectives related to or impacted by information  Introduction to CSD’s Five Groups  mailto:mark.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 20136  security. Through open and transparent public engagement,  collaboration, and cooperation, the group works to address  critical cybersecurity challenges, enable greater U.S. industrial  competitiveness, and facilitate practical implementation of  scalable and sustainable information security standards and  practices.  Group Manager:  Mr. Kevin Stine  (301) 975-4483  kevin.stine@nist.gov  Security Testing, Validation, and Measurement  Group (STVMG)  Mission Statement: Advance information security testing, measurement science,  and conformance.  Overview: Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on cryptography  for the protection of information and communications used  in electronic commerce, critical infrastructure, and other  application areas. The STVMG supports testing and validation  of underlying cryptographic modules and cryptographic  algorithms in consideration of established standards. These  cryptographic modules and algorithms enable products and  systems to provide security services, such as confidentiality,  integrity, and authentication. Although cryptography provides  security, poor designs or weak algorithms can render a product  insecure and place highly sensitive information at risk. When  protecting sensitive data, Federal Government agencies require  a minimum level of assurance that cryptographic products meet  established security requirements and use only tested and  validated cryptographic modules.  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating  cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic  modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)- compliant products; developing test suites and test methods;  providing implementation guidance and technical support  to industry forums; and conducting education, training, and  outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories  that are accredited by the NIST National Voluntary Laboratory  Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Based on the independent  laboratory test report and test evidence, the Validation Program  then validates the implementation under test. NIST publishes,  through public websites, lists of validations awarded.

The following sections describe CSD’s programs  and project achievements that include extensive research  and development for high-quality, cost-effective security and  privacy mechanisms, standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics  that address current and future computer and information  security challenges.  NIST Responsibilities Under Executive Order  13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity”  Recognizing that the national and economic security of the  United States depends on the reliable functioning of critical  infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order (EO)  13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in  February 2013. This Executive Order directed NIST to work  with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based  on existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure.  The Cybersecurity Framework will provide a prioritized,  flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective  approach, including information security measures and controls  to help owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other  interested entities to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity- related risk while protecting business confidentiality, individual  privacy, and civil liberties.  To enable technical innovation  and account for organizational differences, the Cybersecurity  Framework will not prescribe particular technological solutions  or specifications.  In FY 2013, NIST worked with a diverse stakeholder  community to develop the Framework through an open public  process. This process included:  � Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) in the Federal  Register in February 2013  � Conducting five open workshops to provide the public  with additional opportunities to provide input.  These  workshops were hosted at the Department of Commerce  in Washington, D.C. (April 2013), Carnegie Mellon  University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (May 2013), the  University of California, San Diego (July 2013), the  University of Texas at Dallas (September 2013), and the  North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina  (November 2013)  � Preparing a Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework for  official public review and comment  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to conduct stakeholder outreach  and will work collaboratively to further develop and issue the  Cybersecurity Framework. NIST will initiate a 45-day public  comment period on the Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework,  review and adjudicate all public comments received, and issue  a final Cybersecurity Framework (version 1.0) in February 2014  as specified in the Executive Order.  http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  Contacts:  Mr. Kevin Stine Mr. Adam Sedgewick  (301) 975-4483 (301) 367-4678  kevin.stine@nist.gov adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov mailto:adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  11  Contributions to National and International  Standards Development  Figure 1 (below) shows many of the national and international  Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) involved in  cybersecurity standardization. CSD participates in cybersecurity  standards activities in many of these organizations, either in  leadership positions or as editors and contributors. Many of  CSD’s publications have been the basis for both national and  international standards projects. This section discusses CSD  standards activities in conjunction with InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cyber Security 1 (CS1), where Dan Benigni serves  as Chair and U.S. Head of Delegation to subcommittee SC 27,  and Sal Francomacaro serves as CS1 Vice Chair.

It develops, maintains, promotes,  and facilitates IT standards required by global markets, meeting  business and user requirements concerning:  � Design and development of IT systems and tools  � Performance and quality of IT products and systems  � Security of IT systems and information  � Portability of application programs  � Interoperability of IT products and systems  � Unified tools and environments  � Harmonized IT vocabulary  � User-friendly and ergonomically designed user interfaces  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs) and  working groups that address specific technologies. SCs that  produce standards relating to IT security include:  � SC 06 − Telecommunications and Information Exchange  Between Systems  � SC 17 − Cards and Personal Identification  � SC 27 − IT Security Techniques  � SC 37 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST, Chair)  JTC 1 also has:  � Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services  � SC 2 − Operations and Procedures including Security  � SC 4 – Securities  � SC 6 − Financial Transaction Cards, Related Media, and  Operations  � SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  ANSI is a private, nonprofit organization (501(c)(3)) that  administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization  and conformity assessment system and facilitates the  development of American National Standards (ANS) by  accrediting the procedures of SDOs.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally,  advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international  and regional standards organizations, and encourages the  adoption of international standards as national standards where  they meet the needs of the user community. ANSI is the sole  U.S. representative and dues-paying member of the two major  non-treaty international standards organizations, ISO and, via  the United States National Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS is accredited by ANSI and serves as the ANSI Technical  Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1.  INCITS is sponsored by the Information Technology Industry  (ITI) Council, a trade association representing the leading U.S.  providers of information technology products and services.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that focus  on the creation of standards for different technology areas.  Technical committees that focus on IT security and IT security- related technologies or that may require separate security  standards include:  � B10 – Identification Cards and Related Devices  � CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, NIST, Chair; Sal  Francomacaro, NIST, Vice Chair; and Richard Kissel, NIST,  Principal voting member)  � E22 – Item Authentication  � M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST, Chair)  � T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP)  � T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology  � GIT1 – Governance of IT  � DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms and Services  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops United  States, national, ANSI-accredited standards in the area of  cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses:  � Management of information security and systems  � Management of third-party information security service  providers  � Intrusion detection  � Network security  � Cloud computing security  � Supply chain risk management  � Incident handling  � IT security evaluation and assurance  � Security assessment of operational systems  13  � Security requirements for cryptographic modules  � Protection profiles  � Role-based access control  � Security checklists  � Security metrics  � Cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques  and mechanisms, including confidentiality, entity  authentication, non-repudiation, key management, data  integrity, message authentication, hash functions, and  digital signatures  � Future service and applications standards supporting  the implementation of control objectives and controls as  defined in ISO 27001, in the areas of business continuity  and outsourcing  � Identity management, including identity management  framework, role-based access control, and single sign- on  � Privacy technologies, including privacy framework,  privacy reference architecture, privacy infrastructure,  anonymity and credentials, and specific privacy- enhancing technologies  The scope of CS1 explicitly excludes the areas of work on  cybersecurity standardization presently under way in INCITS  B10, M1, T3, T10, and T11, as well as other standard groups,  such as the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions  (ATIS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.  (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Travel  Industry Association of America (TIAA), and the Accredited  Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The CS1 scope of work includes  standardization in most of the same cybersecurity areas as are  covered in the NIST CSD.  As the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, CS1 contributes to  the SC 27 program of work on IT Security Techniques in terms of  U.S. comments and contributions on SC 27 standards projects;  votes on SC 27 standards documents at various stages of  development; and nominates U.S. experts to work on various SC  27 projects as editors, coeditors, or in other SC 27 leadership  positions. Currently, over a dozen CS1 members are serving  as SC 27 document editors or coeditors on various standards  projects, including CSD staff Randy Easter and Richard Kissel.  All input from CS1 is processed through INCITS to ANSI,  then to SC 27. CS1 also serves as a conduit for getting U.S.- based new work item proposals and U.S.-developed national  standards into the international SC 27 standards development  process. In its international efforts, CS1 responded to all calls  for U.S. contributions and/or voting positions on all international  security standards projects in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27 in a  consistent, efficient, and timely manner.  NIST contributes to many of CS1’s national and international  IT security standards efforts through its membership on CS1,  where Dan Benigni serves as the non-voting chair and Richard  Kissel as the NIST Principal voting member. Internationally,  there are over 100 published standards, and almost all have  been adopted as U.S. national standards. There are more than  80 current international standards projects. During FY 2013,  29 new standards were published in SC 27, and most of them  have been recommended by CS1 for adoption as U.S. national  standards.  CSD Contributions to Cybersecurity  Standardization in INCITS CS1  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role in the  Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at the national  level. Nationally during FY 2013:  � The NIST Policy Machine research and development has  resulted in three ongoing national standards projects  in CS1, each in the early stages of development. They  include:  • INCITS 499-2013, “Next Generation Access Control  –Functional Architecture (NGAC-FA)”, David Ferraiolo,  NIST, Editor, Published May 2013  • “Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC- GOADS)”, Project Number: 2195-D, Serban Gavrila,  NIST, Editor (Planned Publication FY 2014)  • “Next Generation Access Control-Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions (NGAC- IRPADS)”, Project Number: 2193-D  Within CS1, liaisons are maintained with nearly 20  organizations, including:  � ABA Federated Identity Management Legal (IdM Legal)  Task Force  � American Bar Association (ABA), section on Science and  Technology  � Cloud Security Alliance  � Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201314  � IEEE P1700 and P1619  � INCITS T11, M1, GIT1, DAPS38, and PL22  � Internet Security Alliance  � Kantara Initiative Identity Assurance Working Group  (IAWG)  � Open Group  � SC 7 TAG  � Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE)  � The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)  � Trusted Computing Group  Dan Benigni also serves as cybersecurity standards  coordinator in CSD.  Contact:  Mr. Daniel Benigni  (301) 975-3279  benigni@nist.gov  Identity Management Standards within INCITS  B10 and ISO JTC1/SC 17  CSD supports identity management standardization activities  through participation in national and international standards  bodies and organizations.  CSD actively participates in the  INCITS B10 committee, which is focused on interoperability of  Identification Cards and Related Devices. CSD staff serves as  Chair and Vice Chair of the B10.12 committee, which develops  interoperable standards for Integrated Circuit Cards with  Contacts. CSD staff also serves as the U.S. Head of delegation  to ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 17 Working Groups 4 and 11.  In addition to chairing the B10.12 committee, CSD provides  technical and editorial support in the development of national  and international standards. Specifically, CSD staff serves as  the technical editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command  Set (GICS). GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and  Common Access Card (CAC) card applications, and others, to  be built from a single platform. GICS defines an open platform  where identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and  used in an interoperable way between the credential issuers  and credential users. CSD staff also provides significant input  to standards of major interest to U.S. government agencies and  U.S. markets. CSD influences the development and revision of  ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit Cards),  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit Card  Programming Interfaces), and ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics  “Match On Card” Comparison).  During FY 2013, INCITS 504 Parts 1, 2, and 4 were published  and ISO/IEC 7816 Part 4 was published with significant changes  added per NIST’s request. CSD provides contributions and  feedback on many other INCITS B10 identity management  standards projects.  During the FY 2014, the INCITS B10 committee, along with  the active collaboration of CSD staff, plans to publish Part  3 of INCITS 504 and contribute to the publication of several  standards of the ISO/IEC 7816 family (all relevant to FIPS 201  specifications). CSD staff will continue actively supporting  relevant ID management standard initiatives.  CSD’s investment in these activities is motivated by new  technical ideas that emerge from these standards. For example,  INCITS 504 is an ID platform that leverages the FIPS 201  infrastructure to support a larger number of government and  enterprise initiatives. In particular, INCITS 504 aims to support  initiatives such as the NSTIC. ISO/IEC 24727 aims to create  an interoperability framework that increases the resilience  and scalability of identity management solutions and fosters  domestic and international interoperability.

Previously, the  Joint Task Force developed common security guidance in the  critical areas of security controls for information systems and  organizations, security assessment procedures to demonstrate  security control effectiveness, security authorizations for risk  acceptance decisions, and continuous monitoring activities  to ensure that decision makers receive the most up-to-date  information on the security state of their information systems. In  addition, CSD worked with the General Services Administration  (GSA) Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) to identify security assessment requirements, and  prototype a process for approving Third-Party Assessment  Organizations (3PAOs) that demonstrate capability in assessing  Cloud Service Providers (CSP) information systems for  conformance to NIST standards and guidelines.  In FY 2013, CSD worked on the following three initiatives:  1. Risk Management and Risk Assessment Guidelines:  Developed a comprehensive risk assessment guideline  examining the relationships among key risk factors,  including threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and likelihood.  Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 4, Security  and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems  and Organizations, provides a holistic approach  to information security and risk management. The  publication provides organizations with security controls  necessary to appropriately strengthen their information  systems and the environments in which those systems  operate − contributing to systems that are resilient in  the face of attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right”  strategy combines with a variety of security controls  for “Continuous Monitoring” to give organizations near  real-time information that is essential for senior leaders  making ongoing risk-based decisions affecting their  critical missions and business functions.  To take advantage of the expanded set of security and  privacy controls, and to give organizations greater  flexibility and agility in defending their information  systems, the revision introduces the concept of  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  1  GENERIC RISK MODEL WITH KEY RISK FACTORS  producing  initiates  exploits  causing  Threat Source  Threat  Predisposing Conditions  Event Vulnerability  with Risk  as a combination of Impact and Likelihood  with Severity In the context of  Inputs from Risk Framing Step  (Risk Management Strategy or Approach)  Influencing and Potentially Modifying  Key Risk Factors  with Characteristics  (e.g., Capability, Intent, and Targeting for Adversarial Threats)  with Sequence  of actions, activities,  or scenarios  with Likelihood of Initiation  with Likelihood of Success  with Degree  with Pervasiveness  with Effectiveness  Security Controls Planned / Implemented  ORGANIZATIONAL RISK To organizational operations (mission, functions,  image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

Overlays provide a structured approach to  help organizations tailor security control baselines  and develop specialized security plans for specific  missions/business functions, environments of operation,  and/or technologies. This specialization approach is  important as the number of threat-driven controls and  control enhancements in the catalog increases and  organizations develop risk management strategies to  address their specific protection needs within defined  risk tolerances.  2. Criteria and Guidelines for Recognizing Security  Assessment Provider Organizations: CSD updated  proficiency tests and technical requirements for  evaluating FedRAMP 3PAO providers’ capability to  conduct security assessment of cloud-based information  systems for compliance with FISMA in accordance  with FedRAMP and ISO/IEC 17020 Inspection Bodies  requirements. Additionally, CSD provided input to GSA  requirements (including orientation and training) for  private sector accreditation body of FedRAMP 3PAOs that  resulted in GSA FedRAMP Program Management Office  (PMO) selecting one 3PAO private sector accreditation  body.  3. FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private Sector  Organizations: CSD conducted cybersecurity outreach  briefings and provided support to state and local  governments as well as private sector organizations on  topics of interest, such as effective implementation of  the NIST Risk Management Framework. In addition, CSD  conducted outreach activities with academic institutions,  providing information on NIST’s security standards and  guidelines, and exploring new areas of cybersecurity  research and development.  In FY 2013, CSD completed the following outreach activities:  � Finalized SP 800-53, Revision 4  � Collaborated with the ITL Software and Systems Division  and the NIST Standards Coordination Office using the  International Standard ISO/IEC 17020:2008, Conformity  Assessment – Requirements for the operation of various  types of bodies performing inspection, in support of GSA  in establishing a process for qualifying 3PAOs to conduct  security assessments of CSPs information systems  consistent with GSA requirements based on NIST  standards and guidelines  � Developed a preliminary draft of SP 800-53A, Revision 4,  Guide for Assessing the Security and Privacy Controls in  Federal Information Systems and Organizations  � Developed a preliminary draft of SP 800-18, Revision  2, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations  In FY 2014, CSD intends to:  � Finalize SP 800-53A, Revision 4, Guide for Assessing  the Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information  Systems and Organizations  � Finalize SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide for Mapping Types  of Information and Information Systems to Security  Categories  � Finalize SP 800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing  Security Plans for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations  � Expand cybersecurity outreach to include additional  state, local, and tribal governments, as well as private  sector organizations and academic institutions  � Continue to support federal agencies in effective  implementation of the NIST Risk Management  Framework.  http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert  Contacts:  Dr. Ron Ross  Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-5390  (301) 975-5140  ron.ross@nist.gov  patricia.toth@nist.gov  Mr. Arnold Johnson  Ms. Kelley Dempsey  (301) 975-3247  (301) 975-2827  arnold.johnson@nist.gov  kelley.dempsey@nist.gov  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-2489  peggy.himes@nist.gov  Biometric Standards and Associated Conformity  Assessment Testing Tools  The CSD staff responds to government, industry, and market  requirements for open systems standards by:  � Accelerating development of formal biometric standards  � Providing effective leadership and technical participation  in the development of these standards  � Developing Conformance Test Architectures (CTA)  and Conformance Test Suites (CTS) designed to test  implementations of biometric standards  � Supporting harmonization of biometric, tokens, and  security standards  http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert mailto:ron.ross@nist.gov mailto:patricia.toth@nist.gov mailto:arnold.johnson@nist.gov mailto:kelley.dempsey@nist.gov mailto:peggy.himes@nist.gov  17  � Promoting biometric standards adoption  � Promoting conformity assessment efforts  To achieve these project goals, CSD continues to work in close  partnership with government agencies, industry partners, and  academic institutions. CSD actively participates in a number of  biometric standards development projects, contributes to the  development of biometric standards, and leads national and  international biometric standards bodies. Nationally, CSD’s staff  leads the INCITS Technical Committee 1 (M1) – Biometrics;  international efforts include ISO JTC 1 and IEC Subcommittee  SC 37 - Biometrics - JTC 1/SC 37. CSD plans to continue this  work in FY 2014.  During FY 2013, the development of object-oriented CTAs and  CTSs to test implementations of biometric standards progressed  at an accelerated pace. CSD developed and publicly released  two fully functional object-oriented CTAs. One CTA supports  CTSs designed to test implementations of Extensible Markup  Language (XML) encoded biometric data interchange formats  and the other supports CTSs designed to test implementations  of ISO/IEC data formats developed by JTC 1/SC 37 as well as  PIV profiles of biometric standards. CSD released these test  tools as “BioCTS 2013 for ANSI/NIST 1-2011” and “BioCTS  2013 for ISO/IEC” respectively. As depicted in the figure, CTA/ CTSs’ key features include search capabilities of the Text Log  Outputs (very useful to debug errors in large implementations),  formatted test results, and test result basic statistics (on batch  of files or individual files).  In addition to previously designed CTSs (e.g., CTS for  ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011 [AN-2011] traditional encoding  transactions and ISO/IEC biometric data interchange format  implementations), BioCTS 2013 conformance test software  includes a CTS designed to test National Information Exchange  Model (NIEM) XML encoded AN-2011 implementations. The  functionality of this tool goes beyond the existing basic  XML testing techniques, such as schema validation. CSD’s  project team concluded that the XML schema validation was  insufficient to address full conformance testing of the AN- 2011 requirements. The team implemented over 1,200 test  assertions beyond the schema validation (validating an XML  file against an XSD file) for this standard, including those for  AN-2011 Record Types 1, 4, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 17. NISTIR 7957,  Conformance Test Architecture and Test Suite for ANSI/NIST-ITL  1-2011 NIEM XML Encoded Transactions (September 2013)  and a presentation delivered at the last Biometric Consortium  conference3 discussed these test tools and provided technical  implementation details.  BioCTS 2013 conformance test software also includes CTSs  to test PIV profiles (e.g., finger minutia and image data formats)  and to test implementations of the second-generation face  recognition data format developed by JTC 1/SC 37 (published  in 2011). The PIV profile of the SC 37 iris data format was  aligned with SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal  Identity Verification. The face recognition CTS was aligned with  the associated conformance testing methodology developed by  JTC 1/SC 37.  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Figure 3: Biometric Conformance Test Software by NIST/ITL CSD  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201318  These conformance-testing tools provide significant  functionality, usability, and performance. In addition to supplying  an installer version of the CTAs, which supports new and  existing CTSs with new graphical user interface enhancements,  the CSD project team extended the work to a command line  interface version for AN-2011 traditional encoding that runs  under Windows and Linux (with Mono). The test tools developed  support a Web-based environment. A prototype was developed,  tested, and demonstrated at the last Biometric Consortium  Conference.  Based on the detailed analysis of the biometric standards  (ISO/IEC and AN-2011) required to develop the associated  conformance test tools, the CSD team provided technical  contributions to the relevant standards bodies. In FY 2013,  these included:  � Over 200 test assertions for AN-2011 Record Type 18 –  DNA Data Record  � Technical contributions on the AN-2011 standard and the  published XML schema  � Technical contributions to JTC 1/SC 37 (via INCITS M1)  on SC 37 XML namespaces, data elements, schemas,  and related items; an XML-based data interchange  format framework and DNA data interchange format  In addition to ongoing participation and management  of biometric standards activities in INCITS M1 and JTC 1/ SC 37, in FY 2014, CSD plans to develop additional CTSs to  test implementations of selected international biometric  data interchange formats specified in XML encoding (under  development in JTC 1/SC 37). The CSD team also plans to  develop conformance test assertions for selected record types  of the 2013 version of the ANSI/NIST standard and plans  to develop the associated CTA/CTS for traditional and XML  encoded transactions. The latest version of the ANSI/NIST  standard now incorporates extended forensics-related data,  such as a dental supplement and additional record types, such  as voice data record. The team will continue researching and  developing additional test environments support, such as web  services and tools in the cloud. The research plan expands to  technical interfaces, such as Biometric Application Programming  Interface standards specified in Object Oriented Programming  and Biometric Information Assurance Services standards.  Outreach efforts in FY 2013 in support of biometric standards  development and conformity assessment efforts included:  � Contribution of the area editor for articles on biometric  standards for Springer’s second edition of the Biometrics  Encyclopedia (under development), where 25 papers  were reviewed and edited  � Keynote talks and presentations on biometric standards  and conformity assessment at national and international  conferences  � Related technical publications and participation in  conference program committees and paper reviews  NIST helped develop the program of the 2013 Biometric  Consortium Conference, which CSD’s Mr. Fernando Podio co- chaired.  Held September 17-19, 2013, in Tampa, Florida, this  year’s conference included nearly 1,600 attendees from 30  countries representing government, industry, and academia.  CSD supported a booth at the conference’s technical  exposition and presented material regarding the conformance  test tool development project. The conference program included  sessions on Federal Government programs, advances in  biometric technologies and standards, and Biometrics Identity  and Security (BIdS) research. NIST’s session highlighted  achievements and ongoing biometric research, testing, and  standards projects. Over 140 speakers participated in the  program.

CPS are  hybrid networked cyber and  engineered physical elements co-designed to create adaptive  and predictive systems that respond in real-time to enhance  performance with varying degrees of human interaction, and  are commonly used in the nation’s critical infrastructure.  Such systems control the electrical grid, provide clean water,  produce chemicals, and underlie transportation systems. CPS  capabilities continue to grow as a result of technological  advances, enabling future engines of growth, such as advanced  manufacturing, and advancements in safety initiatives, such as  autonomous vehicles.  Cybersecurity is an important crosscutting discipline that is  critical to safeguarding CPS and supporting communications  and information infrastructure. CPS presents unique challenges,  including the need for real-time response in support of  extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability. Despite  the ubiquity and criticality of CPS, additional thought is required  regarding the design of secure CPS. As a result, there have been  numerous successful attacks targeting CPS for the control of  critical infrastructure (e.g., Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame, Gauss).  In April 2013, CSD and the Cyber Security Research Alliance  (CSRA) co-hosted a 2-day workshop to explore emerging  research needs for cybersecurity in CPS with the diverse  cyber-physical community at large.  The workshop brought  together engineering and IT experts who have dealt with  security issues related to CPS. Representatives from industry,  academia, and government engaged in interactive discussions  during the workshop in the areas of supply chain, assurance,  threat information, identifying existing tools and practices to  secure CPS, security in acquisition and implementation, and  trustworthy operations. Attendees were invited to participate  in break-out sessions where the discussion topics were briefly  framed, allowing the attendees to explore the discussion topics  and to share their experiences with integrating security into  existing organizations (e.g., lessons learned and examples).  CSD, in conjunction with ITL’s Advanced Network  Technologies division, Information Access division, and NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, collaborated to develop an initial NIST  notional reference architecture for CPS.  This notional reference  architecture was designed at such a level of abstraction that  it can be applied across the breadth of the CPS, yet provides  modularization and context for integration.  The notional  CPS reference architecture was driven from a community  need to provide a common lexicon and taxonomy, a common  architectural vision to help facilitate interoperability between  elements and systems, and promotes communication across  the breadth of CPS stakeholders.  CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory, will  finalize the revision of SP 800-82 in FY 2014. CSD will continue  to participate in the International Society of Automation (ISA)  99 Committee, which develops and establishes standards,  recommended practices, technical reports, and related  information that define procedures for implementing  electronically secure industrial automation and control systems  and security practices, and for assessing electronic security  performance.  Leveraging the initial NIST notional reference  architecture as a starting point to address the lack of an  industry-wide consensus definition, reference architecture,  and taxonomy for CPS, CSD will work in collaboration with  NIST’s Engineering Laboratory and ITL’s Software and Systems  division, and Advanced Networking Technologies division to  lead a public-private working group of government, academia,  and industry stakeholders.  The working group will consist of 5  technical subgroups: 1) Definitions and Taxonomy, 2) Reference  Architecture, 3) Use Cases, 4) Cybersecurity and Privacy, and 5)  Timing.  CSD will lead the Cybersecurity and Privacy subgroup  focused on identifying strategies for cybersecurity and privacy  in CPS, and work collaboratively with the other subgroups to  ensure that cybersecurity is included as a design principle in  development.

CSD remained committed to the value of communicating its  R&D efforts to other federal colleagues and identifying the  opportunities to support R&D efforts throughout the Federal  Government.  In FY 2013, the CSIA Interagency Working Group (IWG) monthly  meetings provided an opportunity to learn and share about  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:tbrewer@nist.gov mailto:suzanne.lightman@nist.gov mailto:victoria.yan@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201320  ongoing research related to the themes and thrusts expressed  in the Strategic Plan for the Federal Cybersecurity Research and  Development. CSD briefed the working group regarding efforts  on Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity,” under which NIST has been directed to work  with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework for reducing  cyber risks to critical infrastructure.  CSD also described  work on the Advanced Network Technologies division’s High  Assurance Domain project, which exists to foster development  and deployment of new network security technologies to  increase trust in online communications.  CSD is also a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the federal Special Cyber Operations Research and  Engineering (SCORE) Committee.  SCORE enables technology  transfer through the sharing of NIST cybersecurity expertise  and output. The SCORE committee interacts with federal  leaders as part of the White House’s Comprehensive National  Cybersecurity Initiatives (CNCI).

HAVA established the Election Assistance Commission  (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines Development Committee  (TGDC), chaired by the Director of NIST. HAVA directs NIST to  provide technical support to the EAC and TGDC in efforts related  to human factors, security, and laboratory accreditation. As part  of NIST’s efforts, CSD supports the activities of the EAC related  to voting equipment security.  In the past year, NIST supported the EAC by developing  responses to public comments on the Voluntary Voting System  Guidelines (VVSG) 1.1. The security guidelines were updated  in FY 2012 to improve the auditability of voting systems, to  provide greater software integrity protections, to expand and  improve access control requirements, and to help ensure  cryptographic security mechanisms are implemented properly.  In addition, CSD supported the efforts of the EAC and Federal  Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) of DoD to improve the voting  process for citizens under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens  Voting Act (UOCAVA) by leveraging electronic technologies. The  team worked with the TDCG’s UOCAVA Working Group to develop  a risk analysis on technologies used in current UOCAVA voting  processes, including vote-by-mail, online voter registration,  electronic ballot delivery, and online ballot marking.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to assist the EAC in developing  responses to public comments and providing updates to VVSG  1.1. Additionally, CSD will continue to support efforts for the  EAC and FVAP to improve the voting process for UOCAVA voters.  CSD will continue security research efforts to support future  standards development efforts, particularly in the areas of risks  to voting systems and innovative voting system architectures.  http://vote.nist.gov  Contacts:  Mr. Andrew Regenscheid Mr. Joshua Franklin  (301) 975-5155  (301) 975-8463  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  joshua.franklin@nist.gov  Health Information Technology Security  Health information technology (HIT) enables better patient  care through secure use and sharing of health information. It  leads to improvements in healthcare quality, reduced medical  errors, increased efficiencies in care delivery and administration,  and improved population  health. Central to reaching  these goals is the assurance  of the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of health  information. CSD works  with government, industry,  academia, and others to  provide security tools, technologies, and methodologies that  provide for the security and privacy of health information.  NIST continued its HIT security outreach efforts in FY 2013.  NIST and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (DHHS)  Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cohosted the sixth annual HIPAA  Security Rule conference, “Safeguarding Health Information:  Building Assurance through HIPAA Security,” in May 2013 at  mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov mailto:ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov http://vote.nist.gov mailto:andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov mailto:joshua.franklin@nist.gov  21  the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in  Washington, D.C. The conference offered important sessions  that focused on broad topics of interest to the healthcare  and health IT security community. Over 600 in-person and  virtual attendees from federal, state, and local governments,  academia, HIPAA-covered entities and business associates,  industry groups, and vendors heard from, and interacted with,  healthcare, security, and privacy experts on technologies and  methodologies for safeguarding health information and for  implementing the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.  Presentations covered a variety of current topics including:  � Updates on the OCR privacy, security, and breach  notification audit program  � Patient and provider identity management, HIPAA  requirements in cloud and mobile environments  � HIPAA rule changes affecting breach notification and  HIPAA security  � Cybersecurity Framework for improving critical  infrastructure cybersecurity  � Health IT activities at the National Cybersecurity Center  of Excellence  � Methods for managing insider threat  � Tools available to manage security settings on end-user  devices  The keynote address was delivered by Eric Dishman, Fellow  and General Manager of the Health Strategy & Solutions Group  at Intel.  In FY 2014, NIST plans to issue a  draft revision to Special Publication  (SP) 800-66, An Introductory  Resource Guide for Implementing  the HIPAA Security Rule. As part of  its continued outreach efforts, NIST  also plans to co-host the seventh  annual Safeguarding Health  Information conference with OCR.  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/  Contact:  Mr. Kevin Stine  (301) 975-4483  kevin.stine@nist.gov  Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) for  Information and Communications Technology  (ICT)  Federal agency information systems are increasingly at risk  of both intentional and unintentional supply chain compromise.  The management of ICT supply chain risk includes ensuring the  integrity, security, and resilience of the supply chain and the  products and services it delivers (Figure 4). Today’s ICT supply  chains have increased complexity, diversity, and scale. Federal  Government information systems have rapidly expanded in  terms of capability and number, with an increased reliance on  outsourcing and commercially available products. These trends  have caused federal departments and agencies to have a lack  of visibility and understanding of how acquired technology is  developed, integrated, and deployed. Supply chain risks also  affect the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure  the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of products and  services. This lack of visibility and understanding, in turn,  has decreased federal departments’ and agencies’ control  regarding decisions affecting the inherited supply chain risks  and the ability to manage those risks.  Figure 4: The Four Elements of ICT SCRM  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201322  Figure 5: ICT Supply Chain Risk  The ICT SCRM project seeks to provide federal agencies with  a toolkit of standardized, repeatable, and practical resources  to strategically manage supply chain risk throughout the entire  lifecycle of systems, products, and services.  In October 2012, NIST held a workshop with industry,  academic, and government stakeholders to discuss:  � The fundamental underpinnings of ICT SCRM (terms,  definitions, characterizations)  � Current and needed commercially reasonable ICT  SCRM-related standards and practices (need, scope, and  development approach)  � Current and needed ICT SCRM tools, technology, and  techniques useful in securing the ICT supply chain  � Current and needed research and resources  NIST used input from the workshop and additional stakeholder  forums to begin developing an initial public draft of NIST SP  800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations, which is scheduled to  be finalized in FY 2014.  This document provides guidance to  federal departments and agencies on identifying, assessing,  and mitigating ICT supply chain risks at all levels in their  organizations and utilizes and builds on existing guidance in  the unified information security framework.  Additionally in FY 2013, a grant was awarded to the University  of Maryland’s Supply Chain Management Center to support the  development and hosting of a web application with the following  capabilities:  � Enterprise Risk Assessments: A three-tier risk analysis  system based on the ICT SCRM Community Framework  Reference Architecture – A Strategic Assessment/  Organizational Readiness, Best Practices and Standards,  and a composite network vulnerability map of physical  and cyber hubs and nodes, with risk ratings  � Collaboration/Crowdsourcing Portal: User-documented  ICT SCRM use/abuse cases and real-time polling about  vulnerabilities and responses  � ICT SCRM Initiatives: A dynamic matrix of current  industry and public sector ICT SCRM best practices,  standards, and policy reform initiatives that can be  updated by appropriate individuals from across industry,  academia, and government  � ICT SCRM Digital Library: An online repository of policy  and academic documents related to ICT SCRM  In FY 2014, CSD will continue its work to develop and  publish draft NIST SP 800-161. It will research and develop  tools and guidance to help agencies more effectively manage  their ICT supply chain risk. Additionally, NIST will continue to  co-chair Working Group 2 of the White House’s Comprehensive  National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) 11, Develop a Multi- Pronged Approach for Global Supply Chain Risk Management,  and participate in national and international standards  activities related to supply chain risk management. Feedback  from organizations implementing ICT SCRM programs will  be evaluated, and best practices will be accumulated. NIST  will continue to engage stakeholders to identify needs and  opportunities for providing additional guidance regarding  identifying and implementing supply chain protections.  http://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/  ICT SCRM Team email: scrm-nist@nist.gov  Contacts:  Mr. Jon Boyens Ms. Celia Paulsen  Project Lead (301) 975-5549  (301) 975-5981 celia.paulsen@nist.gov  jon.boyens@nist.gov  http://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/ mailto:scrm-nist@nist.gov mailto:celia.paulsen@nist.gov mailto:jon.boyens@nist.gov  23  Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network  (NPSBN) Security  In February 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax  Relief and Job Creation Act. One portion of this legislation calls  for the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable public  safety broadband network based on Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be deployed and operated by  the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet). The planned  National Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) will “create  a much needed nationwide interoperable broadband network  that will help police, firefighters, emergency medical service  professionals and other public safety  officials stay safe and do their jobs.”  (h t tp : / /www.nt ia .doc .gov/ca tegor y / public-safety). NIST is directed to  establish a list of certified devices and  required components for interacting with  the nationwide network by public safety  officials, vendors, and other interested  parties. NIST is directed to conduct  research and development that supports  the acceleration and advancement of the  nationwide network.  In FY 2013, CSD supported the joint National Telecommuni-  cations and Information Administration (NTIA) and NIST  Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) program  (http://www.pscr.gov) efforts by developing and establishing  security-related activities to support the proposed NPSBN. CSD  presented details of the PSCR security-related activities at  PSRC’s Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference  in June 2013.  CSD provided comments and contributed text for the security- related aspects of the National Public Safety Telecommunications  Council (NPSTC) Public Safety Broadband High-Level Launch  Requirements, published in December 2012, that describe, in  increasing levels of detail, the technical requirements of the  NPSBN infrastructure, equipment, and communications.  CSD began participating in the standards development  process for LTE technology within the 3rd Generation Partnership  Project (3GPP) supporting public safety’s security requirements  related to Proximity Services (ProSe) and Group Communication  System Enablers (GCSE). In addition, CSD broadened its scope  within the IETF to include efforts related to public safety.  In FY 2014, CSD will continue supporting NPSTC’s efforts  related to NPSBN and to representing public safety in  international standardization efforts, such as IETF and 3GPP.  CSD will work to incorporate security capabilities into the  PSCR’s Public Safety Broadband Demonstration Network  located in Boulder, conduct research into identity management  technologies for mobile devices that can support the NPSBN,  and investigate ways to enhance the security of mobile  applications used by the public safety community. CSD  will continue to engage the public safety communications  community by participating in events such as PSRC’s Annual  Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference.

Key to the  successful deployment of the smart grid infrastructure is  the development of the cybersecurity strategy that includes  cybersecurity as a design consideration for new and emerging  systems, and an approach to adding cybersecurity into  existing systems. The electric grid is critical to the economic  and physical well-being of the nation, and emerging cyber  threats targeting power systems highlight the need to integrate  advanced security to protect critical assets.  In January 2013, the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP)  became a membership-supported organization. The SGIP  Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed the Smart  Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC).  All three of these groups  have been led by a NIST representative since their respective  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Im ag  e  So  ur ce  :  ht  tp ://  ww w.  ps cr.  go v/i  nd ex  .p hp  http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public http://www.pscr.gov mailto:sheila.frankel@nist.gov mailto:nelson.hastings@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201324  creations, originating with the Cybersecurity Coordination  Task Group (CSCTG), created by NIST in support of the Energy  Independence and Security Act of 2007. The SGIP SGCC includes  additional leadership by a management team, comprised of  three volunteer vice-chairs representing the Department of  Energy (DOE), an electric utility, and a smart grid vendor, and a  volunteer secretariat.  During the past year, members of the CSWG/SGCC worked to  revise NISTIR 7628, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity, to  address changes in technologies and implementations since the  publication’s original release.  The revision updates and expands the  development strategy, cryptography and key management, privacy,  vulnerability classes, research and development topics, standards  review, and key power system use cases to reflect changes in the  smart grid environment since 2010.  The final version is expected to  be posted in FY 2014.  In addition to the revision of NISTIR 7628, the CSWG/ SGCC has focused on specific topics such as cybersecurity  risk management, security architecture, security testing and  certification, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) security,  the development of a User’s Guide for NISTIR 7628, and cloud  computing and privacy for the smart grid.  Work in these areas  is completed through SGCC subgroups, which are created and  disbanded in order to meet present needs.  The SGCC currently  consist of the following subgroups:  � The Architecture subgroup continues to refine the  smart grid cybersecurity architecture in coordination  with the SGIP Smart Grid Architecture Committee on the  European Union architecture harmonization effort.  � The Cloud Computing subgroup is addressing  the unique cybersecurity issues of using and managing  smart grid applications that utilize the cloud.  � The High-Level Requirements subgroup  maintains the high-level security requirements in NISTIR  7628 and develops analyses between NISTIR 7628 and  other documents, standards, and guidelines.  � The NISTIR 7628 User’s Guide subgroup is  developing a User’s Guide for utilities and other entities  involved in implementing smart grid systems can use  to apply the NISTIR 7628; including the identification,  risk assessment and selection of the applicable security  requirements needed to secure their smart grid systems.  � The Privacy subgroup identifies and describes  privacy risks and concerns within developed or emerging  interoperability standards for the smart grid, and then  determines the most appropriate and feasible practices  for mitigating the risks.  � The Standards subgroup assesses cybersecurity  requirements associated with SGIP-identified smart grid  standards and other documents for the SGIP Catalog of  Standards (CoS). The subgroup has reviewed over 75  documents to date.  An example of a SGCC deliverable in 2013 is the analysis  of cybersecurity regulations relevant to electricity subsector  stakeholders and of NIST security guidance.  The analysis  identifies the relationship, similarities, and differences among  NISTIR 7628, SP 800-53, and the draft North American Electric  Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection  Standards (CIP) v5, recognizing that each document has a  different scope and audience.  The SGCC also supports the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS),  a compendium of standards, practices, guidelines and other  technical documents considered relevant for the development  of a robust, secure, and interoperable smart grid.  Through the  ongoing efforts of the SGCC, these documents are reviewed for  cybersecurity, and recommendations are made for how to include  cybersecurity in future revisions and in the implementation  of the standards.  CSD supports the SGCC in assessing the  security of cryptographic methods used in these standards,  practices, guidelines, and other technical documents.  In many  cases, the standards bodies have taken the results of the  reviews and modified the standards or documents to address  our recommendations. The SGCC has worked closely with some  of the standards bodies to ensure that the recommendations  are interpreted correctly and that the mitigation strategies  selected meet the intent of the NISTIR 7628 high-level  security requirements. The result is cybersecurity “baked-in”  to the standards rather than “bolted-on” after the standard is  implemented.  In FY 2014, CSD will continue to support the SGCC in the  evaluation of the cryptographic methods used standards,  practices, guidelines, and other technical documents for  inclusion in the SGIP CoS.  Future activities include working with the SGIP Committees,  Domain Expert Working Groups, and Priority Action Plans to  integrate cybersecurity into their work efforts. The SGCC will  establish a new subgroup to produce a cybersecurity risk  25  management process case study to accompany the Department  of Energy Risk Management Process guideline. Members of  the committee will produce white papers on security defense  in depth and breadth, unique cloud computing considerations  for the smart grid, as well as a User’s Guide for NISTIR 7628.  Additionally, the SGIP SCCC will continue to collaborate with  industry, academia, other working groups, and government  agencies to address the cybersecurity needs for the smart grid.  In addition to the SGIP SGCC activities, CSD will also  coordinate with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory (EL) and Smart  Grid Program Office on the development of a Cybersecurity  Smart Grid Test Lab, part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility  now under construction. CSD will also collaborate with ITL’s  Software and Systems Division on cybersecurity research in  relation to the IEEE 1588, Precision Time Protocol, a standard  on time synchronization that is used for the electric grid and  other special-purpose industrial automation and measurement  networks.  http://www.sgip.org  Contacts:  Ms. Vicky Yan Pillitteri Ms. Tanya Brewer  (301) 975-8542 (301) 975-4534  victoria.yan@nist.gov tbrewer@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  qdang@nist.gov  Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, Education,  and Outreach  ªNational Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE)  NIST has served as the lead for the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) since 2010. NICE is responsive  to President Obama’s declaration that the “cyber threat is one  of the most serious economic and national security challenges  we face as a nation” and “America’s economic prosperity in the  21st century will depend on cybersecurity.”  The goal of NICE is to enhance the overall cybersecurity  posture of the United States by accelerating the availability of  educational and training resources designed to improve the  cyber behavior, skills, and knowledge of every segment of the  population, enabling a safer cyberspace for all. NICE addresses  this challenging goal by:  � Raising national awareness about risks in cyberspace  � Broadening the pool of individuals prepared to enter the  cybersecurity workforce  � Cultivating a globally competitive cybersecurity  workforce  This initiative comprises four component areas:  � National Cybersecurity Awareness  � Formal Cybersecurity Education  � Cybersecurity Workforce Structure  � Cybersecurity Workforce Training and Professional  Development  CSD is home to the NIST NICE Leadership Team (NNLT) that  focuses on the following activities:  � Developing planning documents and building consensus  on the strategy and implementation activities of NICE  � Facilitating cross-functional cooperation among NICE  component lead agencies  � Fostering communication between the component  lead agencies by coordinating meetings, facilitating  discussions, and disseminating information  � Promoting the initiative and its efforts by representing  NICE and speaking at cybersecurity events nationwide  � Planning and hosting an annual workshop to promote  and support the evolving issues in cybersecurity  education  � Coordinating with other federal initiatives and efforts  related to NICE  � Maintaining and updating the NICE website  In FY 2013, NIST stewarded the National Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework (NCWF), developed within NICE’s  Cybersecurity Workforce Training and Professional  Development Component, through government-wide review.  NIST also planned, organized and hosted the fourth annual NICE  Workshop, “Navigating the National Cybersecurity Education  Interstate Highway,” from September 17-19, 2013.  The  workshop highlighted cybersecurity awareness, education,  and training programs that can be adopted, copied,  used, or  built-on by small businesses, educational institutions, industry,  and government at the state, local, tribal and federal levels to  advance the strategic goals of NICE.  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://www.sgip.org mailto:victoria.yan@nist.gov mailto:tbrewer@nist.gov mailto:qdang@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201326  The NNLT attended more than 100 events, symposia, forums,  competitions, educational outreach meetings, and workshops  to promote the activities within NICE. The NNLT worked with  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the OPM Cross- Agency Priority Goal: “Closing Skills Gap” for IT/Cybersecurity  and on the OPM Special Cybersecurity Workforce Project focused  on reducing cybersecurity workforce skills gaps.  The project  will allow agencies to identify and address their needs for  cybersecurity skill sets to meet their missions.  In accomplishing  this project, agencies will also be updating their cybersecurity  positions with codes that revise the definitions of and taxonomy  used for cybersecurity work. In FY 2013, the NNLT supported  DHS in the launch of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Careers and Studies (NICCS), (http://niccs.us-cert.gov), an  online resource for cybersecurity career, education, and training  information.  NICCS leverages efforts of government, industry,  and academia to provide a comprehensive, single resource to  address the nation’s cybersecurity knowledge needs.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to promote the coordination  of existing and future cybersecurity education, training, and  awareness activities while planning the transition of NICE  leadership. NIST will also identify opportunities to extend and  integrate NICE activities to raise cybersecurity awareness in the  context of other sectors, and promote the NCWF as a resource  to be used to identify workforce gaps, lead bi-weekly NICE  component meetings, and continue to conduct broad outreach  on the NICE program.  http://www.nist.gov/nice/  Contacts:  Dr. Ernest McDuffie Mr. Bill Newhouse  NICE Project Lead NICE Program Lead  (301) 975-8897 (301) 975-2869  ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov william.newhouse@nist.gov  ª Computer Security Division Publications  During FY 2013, CSD continued its efforts to improve  the quality of information about its publications on various  NIST websites. CSD also explored new ways to make those  publications available to CSD’s customers, who access CSD’s  technical security publications in various ways: (1) directly from  the CSRC website, (2) through the NIST Publications Portal, via  Internet search or (3) direct links from digital content, or (4)  from external information providers. By the end of FY 2013, CSD  had more than 270 current publications in the NIST technical  series (FIPS, Special Publications (SPs) and NISTIRs).  Providing accurate metadata about publications improves  users’ abilities to locate the information they are seeking. In FY  2013, CSD cleaned up the NIST Publications Portal records and  PDF metadata for all of its NIST technical series publications  and for more than 100 journal articles and conference papers  co-authored by CSD staff in recent years. By improving  the metadata—such as title, authors, report numbers and  keywords—within the PDFs themselves, Internet searches  provide more informative results and make NIST’s security  publications easier to find. CSD continues to apply those  consistent metadata practices to all new publications.  Additionally, CSD expanded the dissemination of its  publications to the Association for Computing Machinery  (ACM) Digital Library (DL). ACM DL now has a “collection”  of NIST Computer Security Publications, which includes SP  800-series publications. CSD initiated an internal project to  test the feasibility of creating electronic book (e-book) editions  of its FIPS, SPs and NISTIRs, to supplement the PDF editions  currently available on CSRC. The aim is to provide a wider range  of options for CSD customers to view and use CSD’s technical  publications. The pilot project uses the EPUB file format, an open  standard for e-books from the International Digital Publication  Forum (IDPF). CSD intends to begin posting EPUB versions of  selected publications in FY 2014, which will especially benefit  users of mobile devices.  http://niccs.us-cert.gov http://www.nist.gov/nice mailto:ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov  27  In FY 2014, CSD intends to explore more ways to improve  the consistency of its publications and associated metadata,  enhance users’ ability to browse and search publications on  CSRC, make more e-book editions available, and expand  publication availability on external sites.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  Contact:  Mr. Jim Foti  (301) 975-8018  jfoti@nist.gov  ª Computer Security Resource Center  (CSRC)  The Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), CSD’s  website, is one of the most visited websites at NIST.

The Forum, which serves  more than 1,100 members, strives to provide an ongoing  opportunity for managers of federal information security  programs to exchange information security materials in a timely  manner, build upon the experiences of other programs, and  reduce possible duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism  for NIST to share information directly with federal agency  information security program managers in fulfillment of NIST’s  leadership mandate under FISMA. It assists NIST in establishing  and maintaining relationships with other individuals or  organizations that are actively addressing information security  issues within the Federal Government. NIST serves as the  Secretariat of the Forum, providing necessary administrative  and logistical support. Kevin Stine serves as the Chairperson.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is only open to Federal  Government employees who participate in the management of  their organization’s information system security program. There  are no membership dues. The Forum also holds bimonthly  meetings and an annual 2-day conference to discuss current  issues and developments of interest to those responsible for  protecting sensitive (unclassified) federal systems. Participation  in Forum meetings is open to Federal Government employees,  and their designated support contractors, who participate in  the management of their organization’s information security  program.  Topics of discussion at Forum meetings in FY 2013 included  briefings from various federal agencies on Preparing for  and Responding to Certification Authority Compromise and  Fraudulent Certificate Issuance; Software Assurance: Enabling  Security throughout the Software Development Lifecycle; Use  of Cybersecurity Function Code; Census Risk Management  Program Implementation; National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE); demonstration of Trusted Geolocation in  the Cloud; and Policy Machine: Enabling an Enterprise-wide,  Data Centric Computing Environment.  This year’s annual 2-day offsite meeting featured updates on  the computer security activities of the Government Accountability  Office (GAO), General Services Administration (GSA), Bureau of  the Fiscal Service, and NIST.  Recent administration guidance  directing federal agencies to reduce travel and conference  budgets significantly reduced attendance. Technical sessions  included briefings on evolving cybersecurity strategies, IT  security concerns during a consolidation (merger), supply chain  risk management activities, the National Vulnerability Database  (NVD), SP 800-53 Revision 4, continuous monitoring, industrial  control systems security, and EO 13636.  On August 8, 2013, a Cybersecurity and Risk Management  Training Workshop was held at the Department of Commerce  with over 500 registrants.  Attendees gained a greater  understanding of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and  its practical application.  Dr. Ron Ross discussed SP 800-53  Revision 4 and the fundamentals of continuous monitoring. Two  afternoon panels discussed case studies regarding RMF and  “ongoing authorization.”  The Forum plays a valuable role in helping NIST and other  federal agencies to develop and maintain a strong, proactive  stance in the identification and resolution of new strategic  and tactical IT security issues as they emerge. The number  of members on the email list has grown steadily and provides  a valuable resource for federal security program managers.

FISSEA  strives to elevate the general level of information systems  security knowledge for the Federal Government and the federal  workforce. It also seeks to assist the professional development  of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information systems security  professionals, professional trainers and educators, and  managers responsible for information systems security training  programs in federal agencies, as well as contractors of these  agencies and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security training  and education. There are no membership fees to join FISSEA; all  that is required is a willingness to share products, information,  and experiences. A working group meets monthly to administer  business activities  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and participates  in a social networking site as a means of communication for its  members. NIST assists FISSEA with its operations by providing  staff support for several of its activities and by being FISSEA’s  host agency.  FISSEA membership in 2013 spanned federal agencies,  industry, military, contractors, state governments, academia, the  press, and foreign organizations to reach over 1,395 members  in a total of ten countries. The 700 federal agency members  represent 89 agencies from the executive and legislative  branches of government.  The 26th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March 19-21,  2013, at NIST. Approximately 140 information systems security  professionals and trainers attended from federal agencies,  academia, as well as industry representatives from firms that  support federal information systems and security programs.  Recent government sequestration efforts prevented some from  receiving permission to attend, which had a noticeable effect  on attendance. NIST’s Pat Toth and Peggy Himes, as well as  Gretchen Morris, Susan Hansche, and other members of the  FISSEA Technical Working Group, were integral to the effort to  support the conference.  This year’s theme was, “Making Connections in Cybersecurity  and Information Security Education,” to solicit presentations  that reflect current projects, trends, and initiatives that provide  for future solutions in federal security programs. Attendees  gained new techniques for developing/conducting training,  cost-effective practices, workforce development, free resources  and contacts, as well as an update on NICE activities.  NIST ITL Computer Security Division Deputy Chief, Matthew  Scholl, welcomed attendees. Keynote presentations were  given by John J. Suess, VP of IT & CIO, University of Maryland,  Baltimore County; Bryant Tow, Vice President, InfraGard National  Members Alliance; and Lamont Hames, Chief Development  Officer, UNCF Special Programs Corporation. Mr. Hames  presented on Expanding the Role of Minorities in Cyber Security.  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, DOS, DOE, NSA and the  Library of Congress as well as private industry and academia.  Conference attendees had the opportunity to visit vendors,  receive a government best practice poster, and attend a  demonstration session, which provided an opportunity for  agencies to share about their specific awareness and training  programs.  Traditional FISSEA conference events included announcing  the winners of FISSEA contests and awarding prize drawings.  Susan Hansche, Avaya Gov/U.S. Department of State, presented  the FISSEA Educator of the Year plaque to Mr. J. Paul Wahnish,  Career Technical Education Foundation, Inc., for his work in  preparing the future workforce. The FISSEA Security Awareness,  Training & Education Contest includes five categories from  one of FISSEA’s three key areas of Awareness, Training, and  Education.  The winner is selected from each category and  awarded a certificate. The categories include: (1) awareness  poster, (2) motivational item (e.g., pens, stress relief items,  t-shirts), (3) awareness website, (4) awareness newsletter, and  (5) role-based training & education.  The winners of the 2013 FISSEA Awareness, Training, and  Education Contest are:  � Poster Winner: Alexis Benjamin – Department of State,  Office of Computer Security  � Website Winner: Sara Fitzgerald and Kimberly Conway –  Food & Drug Administration (FDA)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/forum mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov mailto:peggy.himes@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201330  � Motivational Item Winner: Jennie Blizzard, Shannon  Jones, and Shirley Clement – Federal Reserve Bank  � Newsletter Winner: Deborah Coleman – Department of  Education, Office of the Chief Information Officer  � Role-Based Training Winner: DISA, SAIC, and Carney, Inc.

During Pecha Kucha (Lightning Round) speakers had 6 minutes  40 seconds to present a limited number of slides (20 slides at  most), and only 20 seconds per slide. The presentation method  is challenging for the speaker and enjoyable for audience  members. There were four participants and their fast-paced  talks proved to be lively and entertaining.  Attendee networking is a valuable benefit of attending  the FISSEA conference. The conference continues to be a  valuable forum in which individuals from government, industry,  and academia who are involved with information systems/ cybersecurity workforce development (awareness, training,  education, certification, and professionalization) learn of  ongoing and planned training and education programs and  initiatives.  It provides NIST the opportunity to provide assistance  to departments and agencies as they work to meet their FISMA  responsibilities.  The 2014 FISSEA conference is planned for March 18-20,  2014, at NIST.  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea  fisseamembership@nist.gov  Contacts:  Ms. Patricia Toth Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-5140 (301) 975-2489  patricia.toth@nist.gov peggy.himes@nist.gov  ª Information Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (ISPAB)  The ISPAB was originally created by the Computer Security  Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) as the Computer System Security  and Privacy Advisory Board, and amended by Public Law  107-347, The E-Government Act of 2002, Title III, The Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.  The  statutory objectives of the Board include identifying emerging  managerial, technical, administrative, and physical safeguard  issues relative to information security and privacy.  In drafting the Computer Security Act of 1987, which  created this Advisory Board, the Congress saw a need for an  independent, non-federally dominated group of computer  security experts to offer its advice to senior government officials  on emerging computer security areas.  The Board members,  with their individual and collective skills, responsibilities, and  experiences fulfill this requirement.  No other similar group of  experts meets regularly to review information security issues  involved in unclassified Federal Government computer systems  and networks.  Also, Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002  reaffirmed the need for this Board by giving it additional  responsibilities.  The ISPAB’s statutory purpose is to advise the Secretary of  Commerce, the Director of the NIST, and the Director of the  OMB on information security and privacy related issues. Title III  of the E-Government Act of 2002 also mandated the Board to  thoroughly review all of the proposed information technology  standards and guidelines developed under Section 20 of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C.  278g-3) as amended.  The charter (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/ documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf) defines that the  Board’s membership should consist of 12 members and  a Chairperson. The Secretary of Commerce appoints the  Chairperson, and the Board members are selected for their  preeminence in the information technology industry or related  disciplines. The term of office for each board member is four  years.  The Board is comprised of members from a broad range of  interested parties.  There are three main categories and each  category has four members.  Category 1 includes members  from outside the Federal Government eminent in the information  technology industry, at least one of whom is representative of  small or medium-sized companies in such industries.  Category 2  also includes members from outside the Federal Government and  not employed by or representative of a producer of information  but are eminent in the field of information technology, or related  disciplines.  Category 3 includes experienced information  system managers from the Federal Government, including  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea mailto:fisseamembership@nist.gov mailto:patricia.toth@nist.gov mailto:peggy.himes@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf  31  those with experience in information security and privacy,  at least one of whom should be from the National Security  Agency.  Federal members bring a detailed understanding of  the federal processing environment; industry brings concerns  and experiences regarding product development and market  formation, while private computer security experts are able to  bring their experiences of commercial cost-effective security  measures into Board discussion.  In October 2012, Matt Thomlinson agreed to assume the  responsibilities of Chairperson from Dan Chenok.  The Board  expressed its gratitude to Dan Chenok for his leadership and  contributions to ISPAB both as a member and Chair since 2005.  Presently, ISPAB has nine members and a Chairperson.  The  ISPAB Board members are:  � Matthew Thomlinson, (Chair), Microsoft  � Daniel Chenok (Chair – Retired from the Board in October  2012), IBM Center for The Business of Government  � Julie Boughn, Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Innovation, Department of Human Health and Services,  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (DHHS/CMS)  � Christopher Boyer, AT&T  � John Centafont, National Security Agency (NSA)  � Kevin Fu, The University of Michigan  � Gregory Garcia, Garcia Cyber Partners  � Brian Gouker, NSA - U.S. Army War College  � Toby Levin, Retired  � Edward Roback, U.S. Department of Treasury  � Phyllis Schneck, (Retired from the Board in September  2013), McAfee, Inc.  � Gale Stone, Social Security Administration  � Peter Weinberger, Google, Inc.

The President signed the EO and also approved the  presidential directive to improve the security and resilience of  critical infrastructure in both the cyber and physical realms.  Dr. Patrick Gallagher, Under Secretary of Commerce for  Standards and Technology and NIST Director, provided the  opening remarks on the EO.  A group of distinguished panelists  presented more information:  � Andy Ozment, Senior Director of Cybersecurity, Executive  Office of the President  � Samara Moore, Cyber Director for Critical Infrastructure,  Executive Office of the President  � Adam Sedgewick, Senior Information Technology Policy  Advisor, National Institute of Standards and Technology  � Bruce McConnell, Senior Counselor for Cybersecurity,  Department of Homeland Security  � Ari Schwartz, Internet Policy Advisor, National Institute of  Standards and Technology  � Jenny Menna, Director, Stakeholder Engagement and  Cyber Infrastructure Resilience Division, Department of  Homeland Security  ISPAB meeting agendas are established based on the Board’s  list of emerging issues developed from previous meetings. The  meeting agenda topics also include non-work list items that  are of immediate security and privacy concerns to the Board.  During FY 2013, the Board provided guidance on many issues  relating to security and privacy such as:  � Security and Privacy Controls  � Digital and Mobile Security  � FISMA as privacy appendix on SP 800-53, metrics,  FISMA review, reduction of reporting  � A130 Appendix A  � GAO Reports: Security and Privacy  � Medical Device Security  � Cybersecurity – Education, Training, Awareness  � Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals  � Cloud Computing and Security Challenges  � Exploring the Future of Privacy for Federal IT  � IT System Performance  � Supply Chain and Risk Management  � SEC Security Breach Notification  The presenters at every Board meeting were leaders and  experts from private industries, academia, federal agency CIOs,  IGs and CISOs.  Copies of the current list of members and their bios, the  Board’s charter and past Board activities can be located at  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab.

A computer  failure or system breach  could jeopardize the  company’s reputation and may result in significant damage  and recovery cost or going out of business. The small business  owner who recognizes the threat of computer crime and takes  steps to deter inappropriate activities is less likely to become  a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports that  over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent of all  U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer (http:// www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf). While the  threats to individual SMBs may not be significantly different  from those facing larger organizations, a SMB frequently has  fewer resources available to protect systems, detect attacks,  or respond to security issues. A vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the nation’s  information infrastructure and economic base.  To help address information security risk, these businesses  require assistance with identification of security mechanisms  and with practical, cost-effective training. Training helps SMB’s  use their limited resources most effectively to address relevant  and serious threats. In response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) co-sponsor a series  of cyber security training workshops for small businesses.  These workshops provide an overview of cyber security  threats, vulnerabilities, and corresponding protective tools and  techniques, with a special emphasis on information that small  business personnel can apply directly.  In FY 2013, the SMB outreach team provided 15 workshops  in 15 cities: Toledo, Ohio; Burlington, Vermont; Portland, Maine;  Providence, Rhode Island; Lexington, Kentucky; Louisville,  Kentucky; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit,  Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport,  Louisiana; Alexandria, Louisiana; Ruston, Louisiana; and  Monroe, Louisiana.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, CSD is planning  locations for small business cyber security workshops in FY  2014.  http://sbc.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Richard Kissel  (301) 975-5017  richard.kissel@nist.gov  Cryptographic Technology  ª Cryptographic Standards Program  Hash Algorithms and the Secure Hash Algorithm  (SHA-3) Standard (Draft FIPS 202)  In response to vulnerabilities discovered in 2005 in the  NIST-approved, government hash algorithm standard, SHA-1,  NIST opened a public competition in 2007 to develop a new  cryptographic hash algorithm, SHA-3, to augment the hash  algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard.  After 64 entries, 3 rounds of the competition, and 5 years of  intensive analysis, provided mostly by the world cryptographic  community, NIST announced the selection of KeccaK as the  winning algorithm on October 2, 2012, and summarized its  decision in NISTIRs after each round.  After the competition had ended, NIST invited the winning  team to NIST in February 2013, and hosted a 2-day workshop to  discuss the KeccaK features and options for standardization as  the new SHA-3 hash standard. CSD developed a standardization  plan and shared with the KeccaK designers and subsequently  with the cryptographic community at the 2013 RSA Conference,  the 2013 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded  Systems (CHES), and at the IETF 86 and 87 Workshops. In  addition, this standardization plan was posted at the NIST hash  website for public comment.  A draft of the SHA-3 Permutation-based Hash Standard (Draft  FIPS 202) is being finalized, and NIST is preparing a Federal  Register Notice to announce this draft standard. NIST expects  to release the draft standard during FY 2014 and plans a 60-day  public comment period. After the comment period closes, NIST  will analyze the comments, make changes to the document, as  appropriate, and propose the draft standard to the Secretary  of Commerce for approval as a FIPS. In addition to publishing  FIPS 202 in FY 2014, NIST is also considering standardizing a  generic “tree hashing” mode and other KeccaK features. NIST  plans to host a workshop in FY 2014 to discuss these options.  Information about the SHA-3 competition and  the SHA-3 standardization effort is available at  http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition.

A hash algorithm processes a  message, which can be very large, and produces a condensed  representation, called a message digest. A cryptographic hash  algorithm is a fundamental component of many cryptographic  functions, such as digital signature algorithms, key derivation  functions, keyed-hash message authentication codes, and  random number generators. Cryptographic hash algorithms  are frequently used in Internet protocols and other security  applications.  FIPS 180-4 specifies seven hash algorithms: SHA-1, SHA-224,  SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.  Their security properties in different cryptographic applications  are discussed in SP 800-107, Revision 1, Recommendation for  Applications Using Approved Hash Algorithms.  CSD authored an article, “Changes in Federal Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4, Secure Hash Standard,”  which was published in the January 2013 issue of the journal  Cryptologia. The article describes the rationale behind the  standardization of the SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 hash  algorithms in FIPS 180-4 and the performance advantage of  these two hash algorithms over the SHA-224 and SHA-256 hash  algorithms. This article was written to help the adoption of the  two new hash algorithms in security protocols and applications  to improve performance.

TLS is a widely used cryptographic protocol  that provides communication security for a variety of network  applications, such as email, e-commerce, and healthcare.  The first version of SP 800-52, published in 2005, was  withdrawn in March 2013. A draft of SP 800-52 Revision 1  was issued for public review and comment in September  2013. The revision is a substantially different document than  the original and includes recommendations providing higher  levels of security, both for TLS and aspects of the Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI) that TLS relies on. New recommendations  include the support of TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2, guidance on  certificate profiles and validation methods, TLS extensions, and  support for a greater variety of cryptographic algorithms.  The final version of SP 800-52 Revision 1 will be published  in FY 2014.

For example, random numbers are  used to generate the keys needed for encryption and digital  signature applications.  In the late 1990s, a project to develop more rigorous  requirements and specifications for random number generation  (RNG) was initiated in coordination with the American National  Standards Institute’s (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee  (ASC) X9. The resulting standard (X9.82) contains four parts:  Part 1 provides general information; Part 2, which is nearing  completion, will provide requirements for entropy sources;  Part 3 provides specifications for deterministic random bit  generator (DRBG) mechanisms; and Part 4 provides guidance  on constructing random bit generators (RBGs) from entropy  sources and DRBG mechanisms.  In March 2007, NIST published SP 800-90, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random  Bit Generators, which contained the DRBG mechanisms in  Part 3 of ANS X9.82, plus an additional DRBG mechanism. This  recommendation was revised as SP 800-90A, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators, in January 2012 to include additional capabilities  identified during the development of Part 4 of ANS X9.82.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B, Recommendation for  the Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation and SP  800-90C, Recommendation for Random Bit Generator (RBG)  Constructions) are under development and are available for  public comment. SP 800-90B addresses the development  and testing of entropy sources, including descriptions of the  validation tests for NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program to validate candidate entropy sources. SP 800-90C  provides basic guidance on the construction of RBGs from  entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms.  CSD held a workshop in December 2012 to discuss the drafts  of SP 800-90B and C, after which NIST began the adjudication  of the comments received during the public comment period  and the workshop.  mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  35  In September 2013, articles from major news organizations  based on leaked classified documents raised public concern  that one of the DRBGs specified in SP 800-90A, the Dual_EC_ DRBG, could contain a backdoor. This could allow attackers to  successfully predict the secret cryptographic keys that form the  foundation for the assurances provided by security products.  Taking these concerns seriously, NIST assured the community  of its commitment to producing strong cryptographic standards,  and took immediate steps to examine and remediate the issue.  Shortly after these concerns were raised, CSD published  an ITL Bulletin that provided a high-level discussion of the  issues, reopened the SP 800-90 series of publications for  public comment, and recommended that the Dual_EC_DRBG no  longer be used, pending the resolution of the comments.  Since  that time, NIST has released a revised draft of SP 800-90A that  removes the questioned algorithm and addresses other issues  that were identified in the public comment process.  NIST  intends to finalize the revised SP800-90A publication in FY14.

The guidelines are available at http://csrc.nist. gov/publications.  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment  Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, specifies  approved methods for key establishment using Diffie-Hellman  and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV) schemes. This document was  first published in 2006 and was revised in May 2013 to provide  further clarification and additional methods for key derivation.  SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment  Schemes Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, was first  published in August 2009. It is under revision to provide further  clarification and additional methods for key derivation; these  changes are consistent with those made in SP 800-56A. The  revision of SP 800-56B will be available for public comment in  FY 2014.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management, Part 3:  Application-Specific Key Management Guidance, was first  published in 2009. A revision of this document has been under  development. The revision will include an additional section on  the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and the removal of the Transport  Layer Security (TLS) section, which is now being addressed in SP  800-52, Revision 1, Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration,  and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations. The  revised SP 800-57, Part 3 will be available for public comment  in FY 2014.  SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key  Management Systems, was completed in August 2013 and  provides guidance on a Cryptographic Key Management System  (CKMS) framework.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key  Management Systems (CKMS), is under development. This  document is intended to provide refinements of the framework  requirements in SP 800-130 that are appropriate for use in a  CKMS employed by the Federal Government, plus guidance on  its implementation, procurement, installation, configuration,  and operation. This document will be available for public  comment in early FY 2014.  A new publication will provide guidance on the security  strength of a cryptographic key that is used to protect data  (i.e., a data-protection key), given the manner in which the key  was generated and handled prior to its use to protect the target  data. This document, SP 800-158, Key Management: Obtaining  a Targeted Security Strength, involves a considerable amount  of new research, since it is an area that has not been fully  addressed to date. This publication will be available for public  comment in FY 2014.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/key_mgmt/  Contacts:  Ms. Elaine Barker Dr. Dustin Moody  (301) 975-2911 (301) 975-8136  elaine.barker@nist.gov dustin.moody@nist.gov  Dr. Lily Chen Mr. Ray Perlner  (301) 975-6974 (301) 975-3357  lily.chen@nist.gov ray.perlner@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  quynh.dang@nist.gov  Digital Signatures  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), specifies  three techniques for the generation and verification of digital  signatures that can be used for the protection of data: the Digital  Signature Algorithm (DSA), the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature  Algorithm (ECDSA), and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:john.kelsey@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/publications http://csrc.nist.gov/publications http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/key_mgmt mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov mailto:ray.perlner@nist.gov mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201336  algorithm. A digital signature is represented in a computer as  a string of bits and is computed using a set of rules and a set  of parameters that allow the identity of the signatory and the  integrity of the data to be verified.  FIPS 186, first published in 1994, has been revised several  times since then. In FY 2013, the Secretary of Commerce  approved the latest version of the standard, FIPS 186-4.

A block cipher transforms some  fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”) into seemingly random  data of the same length. The transformation is determined by  the choice of some secret data called the “key.” The key can  also be used to recover the original block of data.  A method of using the block cipher to protect one or more  blocks of data is called a block cipher mode of operation.  The approved modes are specified in the SP 800-38 series.  Each approved mode provides data confidentiality and/or  authenticity/integrity.  In December 2012, NIST approved block cipher modes for  key wrapping (i.e., the protection of the confidentiality and  integrity of cryptographic keys). In particular, SP 800-38F,  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods  for Key Wrapping, identifies existing methods that are approved  for key wrapping, and also specifies three deterministic  authenticated-encryption modes: the AES Key Wrap (KW) mode,  the AES Key Wrap with Padding (KWP) mode, and one TDEA  mode, called TKW.  Block cipher modes can also provide format-preserving  encryption (FPE). A format can be a sequence of decimal digits,  such as a credit card number or a social security number;  formats can also be defined for other sets of characters besides  decimal digits. FPE is expected to be very useful because this  property facilitates the retrofitting of encryption to existing  applications.  NIST proposed the approval of three block cipher modes for  FPE in Draft SP 800-38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption,  which was released for a 60-day period of public comment  in July 2013. This publication specifies three schemes for  FPE:  FF1, FF2, and FF3. These schemes were submitted for  NIST’s consideration in recent years under the names FFX- base, VAES3, and BPS; the original submission documents  are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/ modes_development.html, in the FFX and BPS entries under  the heading “Encryption Modes.”  Contact:  Dr. Morris Dworkin  (301) 975-2354  morris.dworkin@nist.gov  ª Cryptographic Research  Post-Quantum Cryptography  In FY 2013, NIST researchers Stephen Jordan, Yi-Kai Liu,  Dustin Moody, Ray Perlner, and Daniel Smith-Tone internally  presented status reports in the areas of quantum computation,  coding-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and  multivariate cryptography, which included detailed surveys of  the respective fields, as well as security overviews and specific  results. The project members also created evaluation criteria to  compare proposed post quantum cryptosystems with the end  goal of standardization.  NIST also engaged the international cryptographic community  with presentations and publications. Daniel Smith-Tone and  Ray Perlner presented a paper at PQCrypto 2013, in addition to  Dr. Smith-Tone speaking at the Joint Romanian Mathematical  Society, and the Quantum Cryptanalysis Seminar in Schloss  Dagstuhl, Germany. Yi-Kai Liu presented his research at QCrypt  2013, as well as giving a talk at the European Telecommunication  Standard Institute (ETSI) Quantum-safe Crypto Workshop. Lily  Chen also spoke at the ETSI Quantum-safe Crypto Workshop.  Stephen Jordan delivered a keynote address at the 16th  Workshop on Quantum Information Processing on a paper that  was published in Science magazine. In FY 2013, Dr. Jordan also  spoke about research at the Institute for Quantum Information  and Matter, the Hughes Research Laboratory, and the Lorentz  Center, as well as submitting some research papers for  publication.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to explore the security capacity  of purported quantum-resistant technologies with the ultimate  goal of uncovering the fundamental mechanisms necessary for  efficient, trustworthy, and cost-effective information assurance  in the post-quantum market. Upon the successful completion  of this phase of the project, NIST will be prepared for possible  standardization efforts in this area.

The prototype uses two independent, commercially available  sources of randomness, each with an independent hardware  entropy source.  The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability, autonomy,  and consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot  algorithmically predict bits before they are made available  by the source. Autonomy means that the source is resistant  to attempts by outside parties to alter the distribution of the  random bits. Consistency means that a set of users can access  the source in such a way that they are confident that they all  receive the same random string.  The Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every  60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and signed by  NIST and includes the hash of the previous value to chain the  sequence of values together. This prevents anyone, even the  Beacon itself, from retroactively changing an output packet  without being detected. The Beacon keeps all output packets  and makes them available online at https://beacon.nist.gov/ home.  Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution. In the  digital age, algorithmic random number generators have largely  replaced those tables. The NIST Randomness Beacon expands  the use of public randomness to multiple scenarios in which  the latter methods cannot be used. The extra functionalities  stem mainly from three features. First, the Beacon-generated  numbers cannot be predicted before they are published.  Second, the public, time-bound, and authenticated nature of  the Beacon allows a user application to prove to anybody that  it used truly random numbers not known before a certain point  in time. Third, this proof can be presented offline and at any  point in the future. For example, the proof could be mailed to a  trusted third party, encrypted, and signed by an application, to  be opened if needed and authorized.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned applications of the Beacon, NIST is working on  developing a source of verifiably random sequences. Given that  it is impossible to construct such sequences in any classical  physical context, CSD is collaborating with the NIST Physical  Measurement Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum source.  The aim is to use quantum effects to generate sequences  that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even if an attacker  has access to the random source. For more information on this  collaboration,  see http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_ numbers_bell_test.cfm.  As the bits posted by the Beacon are public, these are not  to be used as secret values, such as cryptographic keys or  seeds for random number generators used in the construction  of cryptographic keys. NIST encourages the community-at- large to research and publish novel ways in which this tool  can be used. Some examples of applications are unpredictable  sampling, new authentication mechanisms, and secure multi- party computation. More details are available at http://beacon. nist.gov.

There are  many technical challenges in doing this, as it is typically hard  to separate private data from general data (e.g., to convert a  third-party-signed date-of-birth certificate into a certificate  that a person is of voting age). Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof  techniques and their variants can be used to accomplish this  for a large class of assertions. These techniques allow one party  to prove to another party that a given statement is true, without  conveying any additional information apart from the fact that  the statement is indeed true. Although many such ZK protocols  are practical, adoption by industry is slow. CSD is following the  progress of emerging technologies, such as fully homomorphic  encryption (FHE). FHE could potentially solve a large class of  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:pqc@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov mailto:ray.perlner@nist.gov mailto:daniel.smith@nist.gov mailto:yi-kai.liu@nist.gov https://beacon.nist.gov/home https://beacon.nist.gov/home http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm http://beacon.nist.gov http://beacon.nist.gov mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201338  problems, by allowing computation on encrypted data without  decryption. CSD has also shown that the NIST Randomness  Beacon (discussed in the previous section) can be used as a  primitive in secure multi-party computation, such as sealed-bid  online auctions in which losing bids are never opened.  Team members continue to be in close collaboration with  the NSTIC program and the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange  (FCCX) project. In this context, CTG has served as evaluators  and in technical support roles. Information about NSTIC and  FCCX is available at http://www.nist.gov/nstic/.  Current communication security standards are primarily  designed for two-party communication. Future protocols,  such as those for identification, commercial transactions,  and social media, will necessitate standards for three-party  communications (e.g., two parties involved in a commercial  transaction and a third party that serves as an enabler of some  aspects of the transaction). This is particularly important if  standards are to provide privacy protection. NIST has developed  some basic protocols for this purpose. One such protocol allows  for privacy-preserving identification with the aid of a mediator.  In this protocol, the issuer of an assertion, such as “John Smith  is an employee of the Department of Commerce,” does not need  to know who the consumer of the assertion is, yet it can encrypt  the assertion with a key only known to that consumer (i.e., the  mediator does not get to see the unencrypted assertion).  Contact:  Dr. René Peralta  (301) 975-8702  rene.peralta@nist.gov  Cryptography for Constrained Environments  Pervasive computing is an emerging technical area in which  many highly constrained devices (e.g., limited resources, such  as program space and RAM) are interconnected, typically  communicating wirelessly with one another, and working in  concert to accomplish some task. These systems apply to a  wide variety of fields. Sample application areas include sensor  networks, medical devices, distributed control systems, and the  Smart Grid. Security can be very important in each of these  areas. For example, an unauthorized party should not be able  to take control of an insulin pump or the brakes on a car. There  are also privacy concerns, particularly in the area of Health IT.  Because the majority of the current cryptographic algorithms  were designed for desktop/server environments, many of these  algorithms cannot operate under these constraints, or if they  can be made to operate in these constrained environments,  their performance is typically not acceptable. A particular  problem is the use of asymmetric (public key) algorithms. These  algorithms tend to be much more computational and resource- intensive and are not easily accommodated in such constrained  environments.  As a result, CSD is currently focusing on studying the use  of the NIST-approved symmetric-key algorithms in constrained  environments. Symmetric-key algorithms can perform  encryption for confidentiality, and can generate message  authentication codes (MAC) for authenticity and integrity.  NIST has implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard  (AES) to provide both confidentiality and the AES-based  message authentication code, CMAC mode, for authentication.  Additionally, CTG has implemented the 256-bit version of the  Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256) to provide a Hash-based  Message Authentication Code (HMAC) for authentication.  The emerging KeccaK algorithm has also been implemented  – both the original 1600-bit permutation that won the hash  competition (see the SHA-3 report above) and the reduced  800-bit permutation. It has been demonstrated that the KeccaK  algorithm allows a more efficient construction for computing  MACs than SHA-256, which requires the HMAC construction.  CTG has also investigated other, non-NIST-approved algorithms  for constrained environments.  CTG will continue to analyze the resource requirements and  performance characteristics of these algorithms, and study  their use as building blocks to perform other cryptographic  functions beyond encryption.  Contact:  Mr. Lawrence Bassham  (301) 975-3292  lawrence.bassham@nist.gov  ªNew Research Areas in Cryptographic  Techniques for Emerging Applications  Stream Ciphers  Stream ciphers are symmetric-key cryptographic primitives  that encrypt plaintext bits individually using a time-varying  transformation. The performance advantages of dedicated  stream ciphers make them more attractive than block ciphers  in stream-cipher-type modes (e.g., AES counter mode) for  some niche software and hardware applications. In 2004,  the European Network of Excellence for Cryptology (ECRYPT)  announced the ECRYPT Stream Cipher (eSTREAM) project with  the goal of identifying new stream ciphers that offer some  performance advantages over AES. The eSTREAM portfolio,  published in 2012, includes: 1) four algorithms for software  applications: HC-128, Rabbit, Salsa20/12 and Sosemanuk, and  http://www.nist.gov/nstic mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov mailto:lawrence.bassham@nist.gov  39  2) three algorithms for hardware applications: Grain, Trivium  and Mickey.  The primary focus of the project is to study the eSTREAM  candidates and other commonly used stream ciphers for  possible standardization. During FY 2013, three internal talks  were given: “Stream Ciphers for Constrained Environments,”  “Authenticated Encryption In Stream Ciphers,” and “Stream  Ciphers For Software Applications.” NIST researchers Meltem  Sönmez Turan and Santanu Sarkar were two of the co-authors  of “A Chosen IV Related Key Attack on Grain-128,” published  at the 18th Australasian Conference on Information Security  and Privacy, ACISP 2013. Dr. Turan also published “Related-Key  Slide Attacks On Block Ciphers With Secret Components” at the  Second International Lightweight Cryptography for Security and  Privacy workshop, LightSec 2013.  After comparing the security and performance of stream  ciphers to block ciphers designed for constrained environments,  CTG observed that the gate array requirements for block and  stream ciphers are comparable, but stream ciphers have  a better throughput/area performance characteristic. CTG  currently believes that well-designed lightweight block ciphers  may be more suitable than stream ciphers for constrained  environments. This determination is based upon the following  factors: 1) the maturity of literature on block ciphers; 2) the  availability of better tools to analyze the security of block  ciphers; 3) reduced round attacks on the stream cipher finalists;  and 4) lack of flexible key sizes for stream ciphers.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to study the security and  performance of software-oriented stream ciphers and block  ciphers designed for constrained environments.

A variety of metrics is relevant  to designing “good” circuits. In particular, minimizing the size  and maximizing the throughput of a circuit closely translate into  the combinatorial problem of designing circuits with few gates  and short depth. The project team has shown that solving this  design problem, even approximately, is “MAX-SNP Complete.”  In practice, this means that it is necessary to settle for heuristics  that design “good” circuits, as opposed to provably optimal  circuits. It also means that many basic questions are likely to  remain unanswered for the foreseeable future, even if quantum  computers are ever built. For example, it is unlikely that the  minimum number of gates necessary to implement the AES can  be found. In the 12 years since the approval of AES, successive  improvements have roughly cut the gate count in half. The  standard reference for the smallest published circuit for AES  is from a study funded by the National Security Agency. CTG  improved on this work significantly by designing combinatorial  circuits that are smaller (meaning that they are likely to use  less energy) and others that are of lower depth (meaning that  they are likely to be faster). The general technique was issued a  patent held jointly between NIST and the University of Southern  Denmark.  CTG is also researching circuit-based security metrics for  cryptographic functions. For a function to be secure (one- way), it must be the case that any circuit that implements it  is sufficiently complex. In particular, a function is insecure if  it can be implemented by a circuit containing too few Boolean  AND gates. This security metric, namely the number of AND  gates necessary and sufficient to implement a function, is  referred to as its multiplicative complexity. When comparing  two cryptographic functions, all other things being equal,  the one with higher multiplicative complexity is preferable.  Unfortunately, determining multiplicative complexity is  extremely hard. Mathematicians attempted this in the 1970s,  but the effort had been largely abandoned by the 1980s. CTG  has been able to compute tight bounds for the multiplicative  complexity of an important class of functions (the symmetric  functions). This theory seems to have wide applicability and  it points to exciting directions for both theoretical and applied  research in security and cryptography.  A partial list of results includes:  � The construction of the smallest known circuits for  multiplication in several small finite fields.  � The construction of the smallest known circuits for  binary multiplication (i.e., multiplication of polynomials  of degree n over the Galois Field with two elements).  � The construction of optimal circuits – with respect to  multiplicative complexity – for all predicates on four  bits. There are 65,536 such predicates. Surprisingly, the  multiplicative complexity of all these functions turned  out to be at most three.  � Circuits with small multiplicative complexity can be  used to design more efficient multiparty computation  protocols. Such circuits are useful for protocols that  use either partially homomorphic schemes or fully  homomorphic schemes. Some of the published circuits  are being used as benchmarking tools in those areas.

This standard is  applicable to all federal agencies that use cryptography-based  security systems to protect sensitive information in computer  and telecommunication systems (including voice systems),  as defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology  Management Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106, and the  Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, Public  Law 107-347. The standard must be used in designing and  implementing cryptographic modules that federal departments  and agencies operate, or that are operated for them under  contract.  The current version of the standard is FIPS 140-2. Draft  FIPS 140-3, a revision proposed to supersede FIPS 140-2, has  been developed. The draft revision of the standard adds new  security requirements for cryptographic modules to reflect the  latest advances in technology and security and to mirror other  new or updated standards published by NIST in the areas of  cryptography and key management. Additionally, software and  firmware requirements are addressed in a new topic area while  another new area specifying requirements to protect against  noninvasive attacks is also provided.  The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of  security, intended to cover a wide range of potential applications  and environments.  The security requirements cover areas  related to the secure design, implementation and operation of  a cryptographic module.  These areas include cryptographic  module specification; cryptographic module physical ports and  logical interfaces; roles, authentication, and services; software  security; operating environment; physical security; physical  security – non-invasive attacks; sensitive security parameter  management; self-tests; life-cycle assurance; and mitigation of  other attacks.  The draft of FIPS 140-3 has had two rounds of public review.  The resolutions to the public comments received on the second  draft of FIPS 140-3 include: 1) a description of the assumed threat  models (e.g., attacker’s level of experience, expectations from  the cryptographic module) for each of the four security levels;  2) an insertion of missing definitions for terms and acronyms;  3) changes to the Trusted Channel requirements; 4) the removal  of the Trusted Role; 5) the inclusion of an identity-based  authentication mechanism that would be allowed at Security  Level (SL) 2; 6) the addition of a self-initiated cryptographic  output capability and remote control capability; 7) the inclusion  of additional integrity-technique requirements for the software  components of a cryptographic module; 8) a restructure of the  annexes and enhancement of the requirements for the allowed  operator-authentication mechanisms; 9) an update of the list  of the noninvasive attacks covered by the standard; and 10) an  update of the requirements for the allowed modifiable operating  environments.  During the process of addressing the public comments  received on the second draft, CSD determined that additional  feedback was required from the public to resolve gaps and  inconsistencies among the comments received for particular  sections of the second draft of FIPS 140-3. As a result, CSD  requested additional public comments in August 2012 on  several clearly identified sections.  During FY 2013, CSD discussed and addressed all comments  received on the identified issues and prepared the updated draft  FIPS 140-3 for a final internal review. The completion of the  internal review and submission for approval by the Secretary of  Commerce are expected in FY 2014.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/  Contact:  Dr. Michaela Iorga  (301) 975-8431  michaela.iorga@nist.gov  Authentication  To support the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Memorandum M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal  Agencies, NIST developed SP 800-63, Electronic Authentication  Guideline. Its subsequent revision, SP 800-63-1 (published  at the end of FY 2012) significantly expanded the range of  included technologies, such as Security Assertion Markup  Language (SAML) assertions. The OMB memorandum defines  four levels of authentication in terms of assurance about the  validity of an asserted identity. This recommendation covers  remote authentication of users (such as employees, contractors,  mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3 mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov  41  or private individuals) interacting with government IT systems  over open networks. It defines technical requirements for each  of four levels of assurance in the areas of identity proofing,  registration, tokens, management processes, authentication  protocols and related assertions.  As more electronic service delivery systems that require  authentication and identity management became available,  large-scale enrollment and registration issues became a  significant problem for agencies, particularly for health care.  Enrollment and identity proofing result in much of the up-front  cost to agencies of implementing online service delivery and  can be a barrier to user adoption. SP 800-63-2, a revision  with changes largely limited to identity proofing and credential  issuance, was published at the end of FY 2013 and is available  at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-63-2 is intended to facilitate more efficient and  convenient user enrollment and identity proofing, mainly by  exploiting the identity proofing already done for professional  licensing, registration, or certification (e.g., for doctors, nurses,  lawyers, professional engineers). SP 800-63-2 also reduces the  number of cases where postal mailings are required to confirm  addresses, saving expense and making registration easier and  more immediate for users.  In FY 2014, NIST expects its authentication work to be  driven by the needs of the ongoing rapid expansion of online  service delivery, as experience accumulates and technology  progresses.  Efforts to develop accreditation programs for  e-authentication have revealed problem areas in the text of  the specifications, while the rapidly growing and evolving use  of mobile devices with Internet access and new capabilities  present both challenges and opportunities. Practical business  models for large-scale registration and credential issuance  seem to indicate that separate organizations should do both,  and NIST has been urged to make a clearer delineation of  these activities in a future revision of SP 800-63. Unattended  biometric authentication is considered problematic for remote  authentication in SP 800-63-2, but the relatively high quality  and online video/audio capabilities of the current mobile  devices, as well as the fingerprint readers in some mobile  phones, all deserve fresh consideration. Level 4 identity  proofing currently requires an in-person appearance, which is  often both expensive for agencies and inconvenient and time  consuming for registrants, particularly in rural or remote areas.  A comment received during the public review of SP 800-63-2  urged allowing the use of secure kiosks with high-quality video,  document scanners and biometric readers that would be linked  to a human registration operator in a registration center, as  a viable solution. While this was judged to be too complex to  evaluate in the schedule for SP 800-63-2, the idea is intriguing  and deserves a detailed consideration.  NIST, therefore, plans to actively consider another incremental  revision to SP 800-63-2 in response to the issues noted above  and other issues that can be dealt with in time to assist in the  intense ongoing efforts to expand online services.  Contact:  Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  Wireless Networks and Mobile Device Security  Today, wireless networks often provide connections for  mobile devices using multiple and different radio technologies.  In such a heterogeneous network, a mobile device may switch  its between different wireless technologies. The procedure  of conducting such a switch is called a “handover.” Inter- technology handover has brought many challenges to existing  security solutions, such as the delays caused by access  authentication for each handover. CSD has conducted intensive  research in the security for media-independent handover (MIH)  and has worked closely with the working group of IEEE 802.21  on security solutions for MIH services. The services specified  in IEEE 802.21 include information service, event service, and  command service. The security mechanisms were developed  by Task Group A of IEEE 802.21 and specified in Amendment  2 of IEEE 802.21, which provide MIH message protection and  accommodate proactive authentications.  However, the protection mechanisms specified in Amendment  2 of IEEE 802.21 are only applied to unicast messages; that  is, the mechanisms protect messages between a point of  service (PoS) and a mobile node. When the services provided  by the pervasive heterogeneous networks are extended to  other applications, such as Smart Grid applications, the MIH  needs to be processed for a group of wireless nodes, such as  smart meters, for the reliability of the services. For example,  the information may need to be delivered to a group of smart  meters. In this case, the multicast message is used to deliver  the information. That is, the message is sent from one PoS to  multiple wireless nodes. In some of the application environments,  such as sensor networks, the groups are formed dynamically.  That is, new nodes can be added to the group, and some nodes  may need to be removed. Such groups are managed through  multicast signals. The protection for multicast messages and  group management signals becomes critical. In FY 2013, CSD  has worked with IEEE 802.21 to develop security solutions  for group management in Task Group D of IEEE 802.21. The  solutions include the mechanisms to distribute group keys and  for the protection of multicast messages. In FY 2014, CSD will  continue to contribute to the development of the IEEE 802.21  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201342  Amendment on group management.

HSPD-12 called for the creation of a new identity credential for  federal employees and contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical  specification for both the PIV identity credential and the PIV  system that produces, manages, and uses the credential. Within  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), this work is a  collaborative effort of the Information Access Division (IAD) and  CSD. CSD activities in FY 2013 directly supported the revision  and maintenance of the FIPS 201 standard. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2013 to revise the standard:  � Drafted and published the final release version of FIPS  201-2. FIPS 201-2 reflects the disposition of more than  1,000 comments received from over 40 organizations on  the first public comment draft, and over 500 comments  received from 36 organizations on the second public  comment draft. NIST coordinated with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), the United States  Access Board, Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  and other U.S. Government (USG) stakeholders before  incorporating changes in the final release version of  FIPS 201-2.  � Prepared and published a draft revision 4 of Special  Publication (SP) 800-73 (SP 800-73-4), Interfaces for  Personal Identity Verification. The update to the three- part SP details the new PIV Card capabilities introduced  in FIPS 201-2 including Virtual Contact Interface  (VCI), a secure channel protocol, an on-card biometric  comparison mechanism and enforcement a minimum  PIN length of six digits.  � Prepared and published a draft revision 4 of SP 800-78  (SP 800-78-4), Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes  for Personal Identity Verification. The document has  been modified to align with SP 800-73-4 (Draft), and  includes the addition of new algorithms and key sizes for  the secure messaging protocol and the addition of test  requirements with the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program (CAVP) validation.  � Started drafting an update to SP 800-79, Guidelines for  the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Card Issuers (PCIs), in order to incorporate changes  required by FIPS 201-2.  � Started drafting updates to SP 800-85A, PIV Card  Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines,  and SP 800-85B, PIV Data Model Test Guidelines, in  order to align these documents with FIPS 201-2,  SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  � To accommodate mobile devices, NIST started drafting  SP 800-157, Derived PIV Credentials. As intended by  FIPS 201-2, derived PIV credentials are part of the set of  PIV credentials that can be provisioned directly to mobile  devices to enable remote enterprise access from the  device.  In FY 2014, CSD will be focusing on updating the relevant  publications associated with FIPS 201-2, including developing  a new publication, SP 800-156, Representation of PIV Chain-of- Trust for Import and Export. CSD will also continue to provide  technical and strategic inputs to the PIV related initiatives.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/  Contacts:  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972 (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro Mr. Ketan Mehta  (301) 975 6414 (301) 975-8405  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov ketan.mehta@nist.gov  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv mailto:hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov mailto:salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov mailto:ketan.mehta@nist.gov  43  ª PIV Program Test Cards  To facilitate the development of applications and middleware  that support the PIV card, CSD developed a set of smart cards  for testing. The initial work of developing the test cards was  performed during FY 2011 and was completed during FY  2012. In late FY 2012, NIST began selling the test cards as  NIST Special Database 33 (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/ testcards.html).  Over the course of FY 2013, additional sets of test cards  were created as the existing inventory of cards were sold.  In addition, CSD has maintained a mailing list that has been  used by individuals who have purchased the test cards to ask  questions about the cards and to exchange advice on their use.  For further details on the PIV project, see the Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) and FIPS 201 Revision Efforts section.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html  Figure 9: PIV Test Card  Contact:  Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-3194  david.cooper@nist.gov  ªNIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP)  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components for conformance  to specifications in FIPS 201 and its companion documents.  The two PIV components that come under the scope of NPIVP  are PIV Smart Card Application and PIV Middleware. All of the  tests under NPIVP are handled by third-party laboratories that  are accredited as Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST)  Laboratories by the NIST NVLAP and are called accredited  NPIVP test facilities. As of September 2013, there were nine  such facilities.  In prior years, CSD published SP 800-85A, PIV Card  Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines, to  facilitate development of PIV Smart Card Application and PIV  Middleware that conform to interface specifications in SP  800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification. CSD also  developed an integrated toolkit called “PIV Interface Test  Runner” for conducting tests on both PIV Card Application and  PIV Middleware products, and provided the toolkit to accredited  NPIVP test facilities.  NPIVP validation utilized the following versions and documents  throughout FY 2013:  � SP 800-73-3, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification  � SP 800-85A-2, PIV Card Application and Middleware  Interface Test Guidelines  In FY 2013, two new PIV card application products were  validated for conformance to SP 800-73-3 and received  certificates, bringing the total number of NPIVP validated PIV  Card application products to 36. Three PIV Middleware products  were validated for conformance to SP 800-73-3 and received  certificates, for a total number of 20 NPIVP-validated PIV  Middleware products.  In addition, NPIVP is closely involved in ensuring that all  changes in PIV companion documents, such as SP 800- 73-3, SP 800-76-2, and SP 800-78-3, are fully reflected in  the conformance test document SP 800-85A-2 as well as  subsequently in the PIV Test Runner toolkit consequent on the  expected publication of FIPS 201-2.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp  Contacts:  Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  (301) 975-5013  (301) 975-6972  mouli@nist.gov  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Lorie, this image was used in last year’s annual report.

The foundational  technologies that facilitate the use of a computing infrastructure  for cloud computing services is virtualization. At the core of a  virtualized infrastructure is the virtualized host that provides  abstraction of the hardware (e.g., CPU, memory) enabling  multiple computing stacks (comprised of the operating  system, middleware, and applications) to be run on a single  physical machine.  The efficiency of such a dynamic and  distributed processing environment is counter-balanced by the  interoperability, portability, and security challenges inherent  to this computing environment. NIST is working in parallel on  several projects introduced below that aim to accelerate the  Federal Government’s secure adoption of cloud computing by  collaborating with standards bodies, public and private sector  in developing security, interoperability and portability standards  and guidance.  CSD Role in the NIST Cloud  Computing Program  During FY 2013, the NIST Cloud  Computing Team continued to promote the  development of publications, national and  international standards, and specifications  in support of the USG’s effective and secure  use of cloud computing as well as providing  technical guidance to USG agencies for  secure and effective cloud computing  adoption.. CSD supports many of the  technical standards activities supported  by the NIST Cloud Computing Program,  with a particular focus on cloud computing  security.  � Participated in the development of  a revised SP 500-291, NIST Cloud  Computing Standards Roadmap.  The document, initially published in  2011, was updated in July 2013, and  was incorporated into draft SP 500-293,  US Government (USG) Cloud Computing Technology  Roadmap.  � Participated in the update to the multi-part draft  document SP 500-293, US Government (USG) Cloud  Computing Technology Roadmap (Vol. I, II, and III)  that defines and prioritizes USG requirements for  interoperability, portability, and security for effective  cloud computing adoption. It is anticipated that final  versions of Volumes I and II of the SP 500-293 will be  released by the end of the first quarter, FY 2014.  � Led the development of the draft SP 500-299, NIST  Cloud Computing Security Reference Architecture (SRA).  It is anticipated that the final version of the document  will be released by the end of the second quarter, FY  2014. SP 500-299 defines a modular framework that  provides a formal model and a methodology for the  secure adoption of cloud computing by applying a Cloud- adapted Risk Management Framework. The SRA is a  security overlay to SP 500-292: NIST Cloud Computing  Reference Architecture.  � Provided technical support to several Federal Chief  Information Officer (CIO) Council committees, including  the Cloud Computing Executive Steering Committee,  Cloud Computing Advisory Council, the Information  Security and Identity Management Workgroup, and the  Web 2.0 working group.  CSD staff members contributed significantly to several NIST- hosted events:  � Sixth Cloud Computing Forum and Workshop: Cloud  Computing and Big Data Forum, held in January 2013  � Seventh Cloud Computing Forum and Workshop: The  Intersection of Cloud and Mobility Forum, initially  scheduled for October 1-3, 2013, currently rescheduled  Figure 10: NIST Security Reference Architecture Diagram  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf  45  due to USG shutdown  � First Cloud Forensic Science Workshop, initially  scheduled for October 3, 2013, also rescheduled due to  USG shutdown.  In support of and advancement of USG cloud computing  mandates, CSD staff members provided leadership for several  public work groups operating under the NIST Cloud Computing  Program. Through these working groups, CSD staff led the  development of technical guidelines and recommendations that  considered a close collaboration with public, private, academia  and other stakeholders.  CSD staff chaired or co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2013:  � Chair of the NIST Cloud Computing Security Working  Group focused the group on development of SP 500-299  (described above), and on key management research.  � Co-Chair, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science  Working Group, led development of Digital Forensics  Challenges in a cloud environment.  � Co-Chair, NIST Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap  Working Group, led development of SP 500291, USG  Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap (described above).  � Chair and Vice-Chair, INCITS CS1 (Cybersecurity)  − U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/ IEC international committee JTC1/SC27 (IT Security  Techniques) − that covers cloud computing taxonomy- related standards and cloud computing security  standards.  CSD staff members participate in various standards  development organizations, two of which are ISO/IEC JTC 1 Sub  Committee 38 – Distributed Application Platforms and Services  (SC 38) and ISO/IEC JTC 1 Sub Committee 27 – IT Security  Techniques (SC 27). In SC 38, CSD acts as the co-convener  for a collaborative ISO/ITU-T initiative on cloud computing  taxonomy that includes work on ISO/IEC 17788 – Information  Technology – Cloud computing – Overview and Vocabulary.  Notably, the genesis for this international body of work is the  widely accepted and used cloud computing definition found in  SP 800-145, NIST Definition of Cloud Computing.  ISO/IEC 17788 is closely coordinated with another standards  activity, ISO/IEC 17789 – Information technology – Cloud  Computing – Reference Architecture, which is based on the  widely used and accepted NIST publication, SP 500-292. Both  ISO/IEC 17788 and 17789 are in the final stages of international  balloting before final publication, which is anticipated in the  first quarter of calendar year 2014.  CSD staff members are also actively participating in cloud  computing security standards, primarily through SC 27, which  is responsible for cloud computing security standards. CSD  has provided technical contributions based on SP 500-299 and  continues to advocate for secure, non-proprietary solutions.  In FY 2013, the CSD members of the NIST cloud computing  team also presented the results of cloud computing research  and development, introduced the standards and specifications  under development, and provided status of the NIST Cloud  Computing Program in a variety of conferences and workshops.  Policy Machine – Leveraging Access Control for  Cloud Computing  Figure 11: Policy Machine operating environment  In FY 2013, CSD continued the research and development  of a virtualization-based, enterprise-wide controlled delivery  of data services for advanced cloud computing through Access  Control.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are developing a three-part PM standard, under the title  of “Next Generation Access Control” (NGAC), under three sub- projects:  � Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols and API  Definitions  � Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture  � Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Generic Operations & Abstract Data Structures  The Policy Machine’s architecture has been adopted by  the ANSI/INCITS and is now available as ANSI INCITS 499 –  Information technology – Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture (NGAC–FA).  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201346  Cryptographic Key Management Issues  in Cloud Infrastructures  Many of the security capabilities associated with exercise  of cloud service rely on cryptographic operations.  The key  management system (KMS) required to support cryptographic  operations for the above tasks can be complex, due to differences  in ownership and control of underlying infrastructures on  which the KMS and the protected resources are located. CSD  developed NISTIR 7956, Cryptographic Key Management Issues  & Challenges in Cloud Services to discuss these critical issues.  Virtualization Security & Leveraging  Virtualization for Security  CSD has been researching key areas in cloud and virtualization  security producing the following papers:  “Security Assurance Requirements for Hypervisor  Deployment Feature” published as part of the proceedings of  the 7th International Conference on Digital Society. In FY 2014,  CSD will consider feedback from public comments received and  publish a (yet unnumbered) Special Publication titled Secure  Management Practices for Protection of Hypervisors. In addition,  security assurance requirements and security recommendations  will be developed for components of virtualized infrastructure  other than the hypervisor, such as the guest O/S, VM-based  applications, and the virtual network..

Although these  devices are relatively small and inexpensive, they can be used  for voice calls, simple text messages, sending and receiving  emails, browsing the web, online banking and ecommerce,  social networking, and many functions once limited to laptop  and desktop computers. Smart phones and tablet devices have  specialized built-in hardware, such as photographic cameras,  video cameras, accelerometers, Global Positioning System  (GPS) receivers, and removable media readers. They also  employ a wide range of wireless interfaces, including infrared,  Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications  (NFC), and one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide  network connectivity across the globe. Naturally, just as  consumers and business people can realize productivity gains  from these technologies, so can government agencies.  http://www.nist.gov/itl/cloud http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/StandardsRoadmap http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/StandardsRoadmap http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudSecurity http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudSecurity http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudForensics http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudForensics mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:annie.sokol@nist.gov mailto:dbenigni@nist.gov mailto:salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:serban.gavrila@nist.gov mailto:mouli@nist.gov mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:mouli@nist.gov  47  Like any new technology, smart phones present new  capabilities, but also a number of new security and privacy  challenges. As the pace of the technology life cycles continues  to increase, current Information Assurance (IA) standards and  processes must be updated and new technologies to allow  government users to employ the latest technologies that  consumers can use without sacrificing privacy and security.  NIST is conducting research in new software assurance  methodologies for smart phone software (i.e., apps) and is  working with industry to bridge the security gaps present  with today’s smart phones. NIST has developed an online beta  Application Testing Portal (ATP) for Android that examines  app functionality with respect to agency security and privacy  guidelines. NIST is working closely with the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to transition this software  assurance technology to other agencies and making the ATP  software available to industry as open source.  Building on this expertise in mobile app software assurance,  NIST researchers are developing platform-independent  techniques for identifying mobile malware by analyzing mobile  app network behavior. NIST researchers are also developing  metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of mobile app security  test tools.

The primary motivations for the  development of IPv6 were to increase  the number of unique IP addresses  available for use and to handle the needs of new Internet  applications and devices. In addition, IPv6 was designed with  the following goals: increased ease of network management  and configuration; expandable IP headers; improved mobility  and security; and quality of service controls. IPv6 has been,  and continues to be, developed and defined by the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF).  FY 2012 was a significant year for the deployment of IPv6  in the United States Government. OMB’s Memo of September  10, 2010, Transition to IPv6, required all government agencies  to “upgrade public/external facing servers and services (e.g.,  web, email, Domain Name System (DNS), Internet Service  Provider (ISP) services) to operationally use native IPv6 by  the end of FY 2012.” NIST worked with the USGv6 Task Force  and with individual government agencies to achieve this goal.  NIST developed an online monitor to demonstrate which high- level government domains have met this goal with respect to  DNS services, email, web servers, and Domain Name System  Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In FY 2013, NIST and OMB  continued to use this monitor to measure USGv6 compliance  with OMB’s requirement.  FY 2014 will bring additional OMB IPv6 requirements.  Agencies will “upgrade internal client applications that  communicate with public Internet servers and supporting  enterprise networks to operationally use native IPv6 by the end  of FY 2014.” NIST is developing online diagnostic tools to help  agencies verify compliance to this requirement.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to provide  assurance on IPv6 product conformance and interoperability,  continues to operate. In FY 2014, NIST will continue to manage  and evolve the USGv6 Test Program.  The NIST program is a  collaboration between CSD and the Advanced Networking  Technology Division.  http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6  Contacts:  Ms. Sheila Frankel Mr. Douglas Montgomery  (301) 975-3297 (301) 975-3630  sheila.frankel@nist.gov dougm@nist.gov  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:stephen.quirolgico@nist.gov mailto:jeff.voas@nist.gov mailto:karygiannis@nist.gov http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6 mailto:sheila.frankel@nist.gov mailto:dougm@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201348  Access Control and Privilege Management  ªAccess Control and Privilege  Management Research  With the advance of current computing technologies and  the diverse environments in which these technologies are  used, security issues, such as situational awareness, trust  management, preservation of privacy in access control, and  privilege management systems, are becoming increasingly  complex. Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics is  needed.  In FY 2013, the following research was accomplished for this  project: 1) unified enforcement mechanism of data services  for use by a Policy Machine (PM) for enterprise computing  environment, 2) enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control  Policy Tool (ACPT), 3) researched a new fault-detection method  for access control rule using Simulated Logic Circuit algorithms,  4) researched formal ABAC models, and completed the  development of Special Publication 800-162, Guide to Attribute  Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations,  which provides information of function components as well as  enterprise consideration of ABAC.  CSD expects that this project will:  � Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared resources  and common trust management schemes  � Provide guidance in implementing access control models  and mechanisms for standalone or enterprise systems  � Increase the security and safety of static (connected)  distributed systems by applying the testing and  verification tool for the access control policies  � Assist system architects, security administrators, and  security managers whose expertise is related to access  control or privilege policy in managing their systems, and  in learning the limitations and practical approaches for  their applications  � Provide accurate and efficient fault detection and  correction technology for implementing access control  rules and policies  Figure 12: Access Control and Privilege Management  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3046  vhu@nist.gov david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-3337  kuhn@nist.gov  ª Conformance Verification for Access  Control Policies  Access control systems are among the most critical network  security components. Faulty policies, misconfigurations, or flaws  in software implementation can result in serious vulnerabilities.  The specification of access control policies is often a challenging  problem. Often a system’s privacy and security are compromised  due to the misconfiguration of access control policies instead  of the failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This  problem becomes increasingly severe as software systems  become more and more complex and are deployed to manage a  large amount of sensitive information and resources organized  into sophisticated structures. Identifying discrepancies between  policy specifications and their properties (intended function) is  crucial because correct implementation and enforcement of  policies by applications is based on the premise that the policy  specifications are correct. As a result, policy specifications must  undergo rigorous verification and validation through systematic  testing to ensure that the policy specifications truly encapsulate  the desires of the policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security properties  that access control should adhere to, access control models  are usually written to bridge the rather wide gap in abstraction  between policy and mechanism. Thus, an access control  model provides unambiguous and precise expression as  mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  49  well as reference for design and implementation of security  requirements. Techniques are required for verifying whether  an access control model is correctly expressed in the access  controls policies and whether the properties are satisfied in  the model. In practice, the same access control policies may  express multiple access control models or express a single  model in addition to extra access control constraints outside of  the model. Ensuring the conformance of access control models  and policies is a nontrivial and critical task.  Started in 2009, CSD developed a prototype system, Access  Control Policy Tool (ACPT), which allows a user to compose,  verify, test, and generate access control policies.  In FY 2013, ACPT was downloaded by 190 users and  organizations. CSD performed prototype testing, enhanced the  capability of ACPT by adding privilege inheritance algorithms,  applied user cases of Attribute Based, Multi-Level, and  Workflow access control models to test ACPT’s performance,  and compared to other formal method for performance and  usability. CSD also produced a new user manual that explains  new capabilities of ACPT. In addition, CSD published a research  paper related to ACPT.  In FY 2014, CSD will continue testing, enhance the capability  of ACPT by applying the tool for more complex access control  policy combinations, provide model profiles, and improve user  interfaces. CSD will also update ACPT based on user feedback  and suggestions.  Figure 13: Conformance Verification  This project is expected to:  � Provide generic paradigm and framework of access  control model/property conformance testing  � Provide templates for specifying access control rules in  popular access control models such as Attribute Based,  Multilevel, and Workflow models  � Provide tools or services for checking the security  and safety of access control implementation, policy  combination, and eXtensible Access Control Markup  Language (XACML) policy generation  � Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of combinatorial  testing for large-system (such as access control system)  testing  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt/  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3337  vhu@nist.gov kuhn@nist.gov  ªMetrics for Evaluation of Access Control  Systems (Real-Time Access Rule Fault  Detection)  Specifying correct behaviors of Access Control (AC) policies  is a challenging task, especially when an AC policy includes  a large number of rules. Identifying discrepancies between AC  policies and their intended functionalities is crucial because  correct policy behaviors are based on the premise that the  policies are correctly specified. Incorrect AC policies result in  faults that not only leak but also disable access to information,  and faults are especially difficult to detect without support of  formal embedded models such as Multi-Level Security (MLS)  and Chinese Wall.  Most research on AC model or policy verification techniques  are focused on one particular model, and almost all of the  research is in applied methods, which require the completed AC  policies as the input for verification or test processes to generate  fault reports. Even though correct verification is achieved and  counterexamples may be generated along with found faults,  those methods provide no information about the source of rule  faults that might allow conflicts in privilege assignment, leakage  of privileges, or conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in  finding the source of faults is increased especially when the AC  rules are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree  of complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault  might not be caused by one particular rule; for example, rule x  grants subject/attribute s access to object/attribute o, and rule  y denies the group subject/attribute g, which s is a member  of, access to object o. Such conflict can only be resolved by  removing either rule x or y, or the g membership of s from the  policy. But removing x or y affects other rules that depend on  them (e.g., a member of subject group g k is granted access  to object o), and removing s’s membership in g will disable  g’s legitimate access to other objects/attributes through the  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201350  membership. Thus, it requires manually analyzing each rule in  the policy in order to find the correct solution for the fault.  To address the issue, CSD researched the AC Rule Logic Circuit  Simulation (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the AC authors  to detect a fault when the fault-causing AC rule is added to the  policy, so the fixing can be implemented in real time before  adding other rules that further complicate the detecting effort.  Rather than checking by retracing the interrelations between  rules after the policy is completed, the policy author needs  only check the newly added rule against previous “correct”  ones. In ACRLCS, AC rules are represented in a Simulated  Logic Circuit (SLC). The use of simulation may restrict ACRLCS  implementation on a physical electronic circuit; however, the  concept can be implemented and computed through simulated  software.  In FY 2013, by using the Logic Circuit Simulation (LCS)  software, CSD researched the SLC for the simulations of rule  and inheritance assignments of AC privileges, formal AC model  implementations, and multiple policy combinations. The result  is published in the conference paper, Real-Time Access Control  Rule Fault Detection Using a Simulated Logic Circuit.  In FY 2014, CSD is planning to further research the  performance of the ACRLCS, and develop a basic reference  implementation of the algorithm. Goals for the project include:  � Promote the concept of detecting AC policy faults in real  time AC rule composing  � Provide an innovative method in specifying AC rules  formed by Boolean logic expressions operated on  variables of AC rules  � Provide techniques for preventing faults in enforcing  fundamental security properties including Cyclic  Inheritance, Privilege Escalation, and Separation of Duty  � Provide new methods for composing standard mandatory  AC models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  and MLS as well as some fundamental security  properties  Figure 14: Real-time Access Control - Circuit  Contact:  Dr. Vincent Hu  (301) 975-4975  vhu@nist.gov  ªAttribute Based Access Control  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is a logical access  control methodology where authorization to perform a set of  operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated  with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some  cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or  relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given  set of attributes. ABAC represents a point on the spectrum  of logical access control from simple access control lists to  more capable role-based access (RBAC), and finally to a highly  flexible method for providing access based on the evaluation of  attributes.  There has not been a comprehensive effort to formally  define or guide the implementation of ABAC within the Federal  Government. This research provides considerations for using  ABAC to improve information sharing within and among  organizations while maintaining control of that information. The  research serves a two-fold purpose; first, it aims to provide  federal agencies with a definition of ABAC and a description of  the functional components of ABAC. Second, it provides planning,  design, implementation, and operational considerations for  employing ABAC within a large enterprise with the goal of  improving information sharing while maintaining control of that  information.  In FY 2013, CSD completed the writing of SP 800-162,  Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition  and Considerations. SP 800-162 includes terminology and  basic understanding of ABAC; ABAC enterprise employment  considerations during the initiation, acquisition/development,  implementation/assessment, and operations and maintenance  phases; and example to demonstrate how ABAC is implemented  in a Web Information Portal. CSD also researched ABAC formal  models, the result will be presented in a NISTIR, which describes  a variety of characteristics and applications of ABAC formal  models.  NIST conducted an Attribute Based Access Control Workshop,  based on the SP 800-162, on July 17, 2013, in partnership  with NSA and the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE). About 100 individuals from government, industries,  and academia/research attended the event. The workshop  provided attendees an opportunity to identify, refine, and guide  the many interrelated considerations, challenges, and efforts  needed to develop ABAC guidance; CSD updated SP 800-162  from the suggestions collected at the workshop.  mailto:vhu@nist.gov  51  In FY 2014, CSD will continue research of ABAC formal models  as well as details and extended topics of ABAC capabilities,  such as Attribute Engineering/Management, Integration with  Identity Management, Federation, Situation Awareness (Real  Time or Contextual) Mechanism, Policy Management, and  Natural Language Policy translation to Digital Policy. The ABAC  project will pursue the following objectives:  � Provide readers the terminology and basic understanding  of ABAC  � Provide readers with an overview of the current state of  logical access control, a working definition of ABAC, and  an explanation of core and enterprise ABAC concepts  � Assist security policy makers in establishing a business  case for ABAC implementation, and acquiring an  interoperable set of capabilities  � Assist ABAC developers in developing the operational  requirements, and overall enterprise architecture  � Assist ABAC administrators in establishing or refining  business processes to support ABAC  � Promote adoption of ABAC for more secure and flexible  method for information sharing in standalone or  enterprise environment  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac/  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3046  vhu@nist.gov david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-3337  kuhn@nist.gov  Advanced Security Testing and Measurements  ª Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring  IT organizations operate a diverse set of computing assets  which access, route, store, and process information that is  critical to the operations of businesses and the missions of  government agencies. These IT environments are frequently  reconfigured, and are under constant threat of attack. The  wide variety of computing products, the speed of configuration  change, and the diversity of threats require organizations to  maintain situational awareness over their IT assets and to  utilize this information to make risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data  to be exchanged between business,  operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  � Identifying IT assets  � Providing awareness over the  operational state of computing  devices  � Enabling security reference data  to be collected from internal and  external sources  � Supporting analysis processes  that measure the effectiveness  of security controls and provide  visibility into security risks, enabling  risk-based decision making  Commercial solutions built using  security automation specifications enable  the collection and harmonization of vast  amounts of operational and security data  into coherent, comparable information  Figure 15: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201352  streams to achieve situational awareness that informs timely  and active management of diverse IT systems. Through the  creation of reference data and guidance, and the international  recognition of flexible, open standards, the NIST security  automation program works to improve the interoperability,  broad acceptance, and adoption of security automation  solutions to address current and future security challenges,  creating opportunities for innovation.  Specification, Standards, and Guidance Development  To support the overarching security automation vision, it is  necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance that informs  product development and implementation. Through close  work with partners in government, industry, and academia,  NIST continues to facilitate the definition and development of  security automation approaches that enable organizations to  understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2013, NIST worked to build on previous security  automation work by:  � Establishing working groups in standards development  organizations to promote international consensus around  standardized approaches  � Identifying and addressing gaps in the current  specifications  � Evolving existing approaches to achieve greater  scalability and impact  � Providing additional guidance on architectural, design,  and analysis concerns  � Development and maintenance of tools and reference  implementations  NIST is currently working with its partners in various standards  development organizations, including the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF), the Forum of Incident Response and Security  Teams (FIRST), and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), to  further mature and broaden adoption of security automation  specifications, reference data, and techniques. This area of  work is focused on evolving security automation specifications  to integrate with existing transport protocols to provide for  secure, interoperable exchange of security automation data.  Additional work is focused on evolving security metrics  and providing consensus guidance on security automation  approaches. Through the definition and adoption of security  automation standards and guidelines, IT vendors will be able  to provide standardized security solutions to their customers.  These solutions support continuous monitoring and automated,  dynamic network defense capabilities based on analysis of data  from operational and security data sources and the collective  action of security components.  Security automation work has been focused in two areas:  evolution and international adoption of the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) and development of a Continuous  Monitoring building block focused on secure software asset  management capabilities. The following sections detail this  work.  ª Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol  that provides an automated means to  collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability  checking, verifying the installation of  patches, checking security configuration  settings, verifying technical control  compliance, measuring security, and examining systems for  indicators of compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup  Language (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature  by which security software products communicate information  about software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects  of device state. SCAP enables security automation content, also  known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using standardized  formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This content can be  used by any tool that is conformant to the specifications, to  collect and evaluate the state of software installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software and  hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information security management and governance  programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently being used by the  U.S. Government, critical infrastructure companies, academia,  and other businesses, both domestically and internationally.  Currently, CSD is leveraging SCAP in multiple areas, both to  support its own mission and to enable other agencies and  private sector entities to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a  critical component of the SCAP Validation Program, the National  Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the National Checklist  Program (NCP).  In September 2012, NIST published SP 800-126 Revision 2,  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2, . That document describes  the 11 component specifications composing SCAP.  53  SCAP 1.2 Specifications  Specification Description  Languages  Extensible Configuration  Checklist Description  Format (XCCDF)  Used for authoring security  checklists/benchmarks and for  reporting results of evaluating  them  Open Vulnerability and  Assessment Language  (OVAL)  Used for representing system  configuration information,  assessing machine state, and  reporting assessment results  Open Checklist Interactive  Language (OCIL)  Used for representing checks  that collect information from  people or from existing data  stores populated by other data  collection methods  Reporting Formats  Asset Reporting Format  (ARF)  Used to express information  about assets and to define the  relationships between assets  and reports  Asset Identification Used to uniquely identify assets  based on known identifiers and  other asset information  Enumerations  Common Platform  Enumeration (CPE)  A nomenclature and dictionary  of hardware, operating systems,  and applications; a method  to identify applicability to  platforms  Common Configuration  Enumeration (CCE)  A nomenclature and  dictionary of software security  configurations  Common Vulnerabilities  and Exposures (CVE)  A nomenclature and dictionary  of security-related software  flaws  Measurement and Scoring Systems  Common Vulnerability  Scoring System (CVSS)  Used for measuring the relative  severity of software flaws  Common Configuration  Scoring System (CCSS)  Used for measuring the relative  severity of device security  (mis-)configuration issues  Content and Result Integrity  Trust Model for Security  Automation Data (TMSAD)  Guidance for using digital  signatures in a common trust  model applied to security  automation specifications  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, NIST has worked to improve  guidance around the SCAP specifications by promoting broader  international adoption of SCAP, encouraging the integration of  SCAP into other standards, and by adapting SCAP to address  specific gaps and challenges. The following work activities  were performed during FY 2013:  NIST released draft NISTIR 7946, CVSS Implementation  Guidance, which guides analysts scoring IT vulnerabilities using  the CVSS Version 2.0. That document is the result of applying the  CVSS specification to score over 50,000 vulnerabilities analyzed  by the NVD. The report reviews the CVSS base metrics and  provides guidance for difficult and/or unique scoring situations  and assists vulnerability analysts with scoring particular  types of vulnerabilities by identifying common keywords and  phrases that often appear in vulnerability alerts. The report  includes a collection of scored IT vulnerabilities from the NVD,  a justification for each score provided, and a description of the  NVD vulnerability scoring process.  NIST, in collaboration with industry partners in the IETF,  established the Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring  (SACM) working group, chartered in July 2013. The current  scope of work for SACM includes identifying and/or defining  the transport protocols and data formats needed to support  the collection and evaluation of device state against expected  values and standards for interacting with repositories of security  automation content. The initial focus of the SACM working group  is on identifying use cases, requirements, and architectural  models to inform decisions about existing specifications and  standards that can be referenced, required modifications or  extensions to existing specifications and standards, and any  gaps that need to be addressed. This working group provides  a venue for advancing appropriate SCAP specifications into  international standards and addressing identified gap areas.  For more information, please refer to:  http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/  Additionally, NIST collaborated with industry partners to revise  the ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 standard, Information technology --  Software asset management -- Part 2: Software identification  tag, which establishes a specification for tagging software  to support identification and management. This software  identification (SWID) data model provides a mechanism for  software publishers to provide authoritative identification,  categorization, software relationship (e.g., dependency,  bundling, and patch), file footprint details, and other software  metadata for software they publish. This information enhances  SCAP use cases by providing authoritative information for  creation of CPE names, targeting of checklists, and associating  software flaws to products based on a defect in a software  library or executable.  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201354  NIST also worked with government and industry partners  in the TCG to define a number of specifications related to  the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) protocols. The first such  publication is the TNC SCAP Messages for IF-M specification  that supports carrying SCAP content and results over the TNC  protocols. The second is the TNC Enterprise Compliance Profile  (ECP) and related specifications that support the exchange of  SWID data over the TNC protocols. The ECP enables collection  of SWID data from a device for use by external tools to provide  software inventory information. SCAP and SWID data collected  using these mechanisms may be optionally used for network  access control decision making, allowing device state to be  evaluated when devices connect and on an ongoing basis  thereafter.  For more information on these specifications, please visit:  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ scap_messages_for_ifm, and  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ endpoint_compliance_profile_specification.  Finally, NIST participated in two Forum of Incident Response  and Security Teams (FIRST) Special Interest Groups (SIG). The  CVSS SIG (CVSS-SIG) focused on defining CVSS Revision 3,  which is intended to implement improvements to the scoring  model based on community feedback. The CVSS-SIG plans to  release a draft of the revision in early FY 2014, with a completed  approved specification expected in the summer of 2014. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit:  http://www.first.org/global/sigs.  Through work with international SDOs, SCAP and related  security automation capabilities are expected to evolve and  expand in support of the growing need to define and measure  effective security controls, assess and monitor ongoing  aspects of information security, remediate noncompliance,  and successfully manage systems in accordance with the Risk  Management Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision 1,  Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  http://scap.nist.gov/  Contact:  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  ª Continuous Monitoring  In September 2010, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) released the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational  Awareness and Risk Scoring (CAESARS) Reference Architecture  Report. This report identifies commonality and strengths in  the custom approaches used by civilian agencies to provide  solutions that enable the continuous monitoring of IT systems.  This report identifies “essential functional components  of a security risk scoring system, independent of specific  technologies, products, or vendors.” It describes the use of  security automation specifications, such as the SCAP, to enable  continuous monitoring solutions.  In October 2010, the Federal Chief Information Officer  Council’s Information Security and Identity Management  Committee’s (ISIMC) subcommittee on Continuous Monitoring  and Risk Scoring saw the need to create a technical initiative  to expand upon the CAESARS architecture to better scale it to  large enterprises (e.g., the entire U.S. Government). A team of  researchers from the NSA Information Assurance Directorate  (IAD), the DHS Federal Network Security CAESARS team, and  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) worked together  to respond to this need. The draft CAESARS Framework  Extension (CAESARS-FE) described by Draft NISTIR 7756,  CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise Continuous  Monitoring Technical Reference Architecture, is the output of  this collaboration.  Draft NISTIR 7756 presents an enterprise continuous  monitoring (ConMon) technical reference architecture that  extends the framework provided by the DHS’s CAESARS  architecture. The primary goal of this effort is to enable enterprise  ConMon by supporting the development and deployment  of capabilities that support automated, enterprise-wide  ConMon functions. The concepts, workflows, and subsystems  presented in this document can be used by organizations  seeking to establish federated queries, orchestration of data  collection tasks, data analytics, and presentation and reporting  capabilities across a diverse portfolio of security and IT  products. CAESARS-FE supports IT operations and network  defense capabilities, with compliance reporting as a byproduct  of actual security monitoring and improvement. CAESARS-FE  enables organizations to design, develop, and deploy ConMon  capabilities by leveraging their existing security and IT tools  while minimizing custom tool integration efforts. CAESARS- FE defines the requisite functionality needed to ensure  the interoperability of vendor products while continuing to  encourage security tool vendor participation and innovation.  To advance the state of the art in continuous monitoring  capabilities and to further interoperability within commercially  available tools, CSD is working within the international  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.first.org/global/sigs http://scap.nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov  55  standards development community to establish working groups  and to author and comment on emerging technical standards in  this area. The CAESARS-FE reference architecture will evolve  as greater consensus is developed around interoperable,  standards-based approaches that enable continuous monitoring  of IT systems. In early FY 2014, CSD plans to release an  update to NISTIR 7756 that provides additional guidance for  development of ConMon architectures and solutions based on  ongoing standards activities and feedback.  The NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)  is also working to develop a series of ConMon building blocks  that demonstrate cybersecurity solutions that apply across  multiple industry sectors. The first building block, currently  under development, proposes a standardized approach to  software asset management, providing an organization with  an integrated view of software throughout its lifecycle. The  building block will support:  � Authorization and verification of software installation  media – Verifies that the media is from a trusted  software publisher and that the installation media has  not been tampered with  � Software execution whitelisting – Verifies that the  software is authorized to run and has not been tampered  with  � Publication of installed software inventory – A device  that securely communicates what software is installed to  an organization-wide database  � Software inventory-based network access control – A  device’s level of access to a network is determined by  what software is or is not present on the device and  whether its patches are up to date  The building block document, Continuous Monitoring Building  Block: Software Asset Management, can be viewed at http:// csrc.nist.gov/nccoe/Building-Blocks/conmon.html. In FY 2014,  the team will continue to develop this building block and to work  with vendors to develop a solutions demonstration. Through this  process, CSD provides publically available descriptions of the  practical steps needed to implement the technical approaches  defined by the building block.  Contact:  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  Security Automation Reference Data  Through the NVD and the National Checklist Program (NCP),  NIST is providing relevant and important reference data in the  areas of vulnerability and configuration management. SCAP,  and the programs that leverage it, are moving the information  assurance industry towards being able to standardize  communications, and the collection and storage of relevant data  in standardized formats, and provide automated means for the  assessment and remediation of systems for both vulnerabilities  and configuration compliance.  ªNational Vulnerability Database (NVD)  Security automation reference data is currently housed  within the NVD. The NVD is the U.S. Government repository  of security automation data based on security automation  specifications. This data provides a standards-based foundation  for the automation of software asset, vulnerability, and security  configuration management; security measurement; and  compliance activities. This data supports security automation  efforts based on the SCAP. The NVD includes databases of  security configuration checklists for the NCP, listings of publicly  known software flaws, product names, and impact metrics. A  formal validation program tests the ability of vendor products to  use some forms of security automation data based on a product’s  conformance in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software flaws  and security configuration reference data, also known as  SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD  (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  The NVD is the U.S. Government repository of standards- based vulnerability management reference data. The NVD  provides information regarding security vulnerabilities and  configuration settings, vulnerability impact metrics, technical  assessment methods, and references to remediation assistance  and IT product identification data. As of October 2013, the NVD  contained the following resources:  � Over 58,000 vulnerability advisories with an average of 8  new vulnerabilities added daily  � 52 SCAP-expressed checklists containing thousands  of low-level security configuration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to perform  automated evaluations of system state  � 173 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English prose  guidance and configuration scripts)  � 248 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT) alerts, 2,771 US-CERT vulnerability summaries,  and 8,140 SCAP machine-readable software flaw checks  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/nccoe/Building-Blocks/conmon.html http://csrc.nist.gov/nccoe/Building-Blocks/conmon.html mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov http://nvd.nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201356  � Product dictionary with over 79,000 operating system,  application, and hardware name entries  � 42,954 vulnerability advisories translated into Spanish  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored by  the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds and SCAP-expressed content from the NVD  website demonstrates increased adoption of SCAP.  NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment Card  Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit card  systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability severity  scores in measuring the risk to payment card servers worldwide  and for prioritizing vulnerability patching. PCI’s use of NVD  severity scores helps enhance credit card transaction security  and protects consumers’ personal information.  Throughout FY 2013, NVD continued to provide access to  vulnerability reference data and security checklists. CSD updated  the NVD to support the latest CPE Naming specification, CPE  2.3, and produces the official CPE dictionary in multiple formats.  NVD now hosts the list of configuration items, complementing  the configuration checklist data already maintained. NVD data  is substantially increasing the security of networks worldwide  and it is a fundamental component of CSD’s security automation  infrastructure. CSD plans to update and improve the NVD in  FY 2014 to include improvements in user navigation, addition  of references to the SP 800-53 Revision 4 security controls  content, and the ability to search, browse, and download  common configuration enumeration (CCE) list data.  http://nvd.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Harold Booth  (301) 975-8441  harold.booth@nist.gov  ª Computer Security Incident Coordination  Recognizing that even well-engineered and administered  computing systems are sometimes successfully attacked, it is  important to establish and maintain processes and procedures  to recover from attacks when defensive mechanisms are  breached. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61 Revision 2,  Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, provides guidance  on establishing and operating a Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT). A wide-ranging attack may affect  numerous organizations. When an attack has the potential to  affect computing systems in multiple organizations, coordination  among separate CSIRTs can make it possible to limit the  damage caused by an attack, speed recovery operations, and  maintain a higher level of operational security.  CSD is working with the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to develop guidance on Computer Security Incident  Coordination (CSIC). The goal of CSIC is to help diverse  collections of organizations to effectively collaborate in the  handling of computer security incidents. Effective collaboration  raises numerous issues on how and when to share information  between organizations, and in what form information should be  shared. Because different organizations may have substantially  different capabilities for responding to attacks, diagnosing  causes, and handling sensitive attack-related information,  guidance must provide a framework to help organizations  interoperate despite their organizational differences.  This initiative will develop a NIST SP that provides guidance  on how organizations can develop collaborative capabilities in  advance of incidents in order to be prepared to operate swiftly  and with coordination during incidents. The guidance will  cover data handling considerations, such as sensitivity, data  collection and retention practices, data standards, redaction,  and use of tools such as anonymization. The guidance will help  incident responders to understand when data can be shared,  when it should not be shared, and when sharing is essential.  A key element in the approach is the concept of an integrated,  functionally-composed incident response team. The objective  of a functionally-composed team is to enable each organization  to contribute most in technical areas where that organization  has higher relative levels of expertise and readiness, thus  speeding incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication,  and recovery.  In FY 2014, CSD plans to complete a Draft Special Publication  providing guidance for Computer Security Incident Coordination  and organize a workshop focused on the issues of incident  coordination.  Contacts:  Mr. Lee Badger Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3176 (301) 975-3390  lee.badger@nist.gov david.waltermire@nist.gov  ª Incident Handling Automation  In recent years, security threats to digital systems have  become more prevalent and more sophisticated. While some  security threats are generic in nature, others are targeted at  specific organizations, assets, and missions. Although computer  http://nvd.nist.gov mailto:harold.booth@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov  57  security defenses may forestall many threats, not all can be  prevented, and organizations must therefore develop incident  handling capabilities. Incident handling encompasses a variety  of tasks ranging from preparation prior to an incident, to timely  detection and analysis of an incident, to recovery and repair  from the effects of an incident, to post-incident learning and  improvement. These tasks need to be performed both internally  within specific organizations and externally via coordination  across teams of collaborating organizations.  In the past year, NIST worked with the Department of Homeland  Security’s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team  (US-CERT) to develop Revision 2 of NIST Special Publication  800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.  This  document provides guidance on developing incident handling  capabilities.  The document explains the nature of incidents  and incident handling processes, the structure and operation  of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT), and  provides guidance on handling an incident and coordinating  with other organizations.  SP 800-61 Revision 2 focuses primarily on manual (human)  processes for incident handling and the effective use of human  judgment, guided by applicable regulation and law, regarding  which incident-related information is significant and which  incident-related information may be shared.  The growing  volume of security threats, however, is driving the need for a  more agile incident-handling framework that can operate at  differing scales and speeds as required.  Working in concert with the DHS, NIST is expanding existing  incident handling guidance to enable coordinated information  sharing across disparate CSIRTs operating at differing scales  and speeds. This work will include the analysis of standardized  incident handling data models and the incorporation of these  data models, as appropriate, into both CSIRT information sharing  processes as well as incident/threat knowledge repositories.  This work will describe how mature CSIRTs may operate in a  diverse information-sharing network with both operational and  strategic CSIRTs, as well as industry knowledge repositories.  This may include selective use of security automation where  applicable.  In FY 2014, this work will develop Draft SP 800-150,  Coordinated Computer Security Incident Handling Guidance.

Vulnerabilities in IT products are discovered daily, and  many ready-to-use exploitation techniques are widely available  on the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a  wide variety of audiences, restrictive security configuration  controls are usually not enabled by default. As a result, many  out-of-the box IT products are immediately vulnerable. In  addition, identifying a reasonable set of security settings that  achieve balanced risk management is a complicated, arduous,  and time-consuming task, even for experienced system  administrators.  To facilitate development of security configuration checklists  for IT products and to make checklists more organized and  usable, NIST established the National Checklist Program  (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, Public Law 107-347, and also under the Cyber Security  Research and Development Act, which tasks NIST to “develop,  and revise as necessary, a checklist setting forth settings and  option selections that minimize the security risks associated  with each computer hardware or software system that is, or is  likely to become, widely used within the Federal Government.”  In February 2008, revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101  states, “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall  include the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official to  ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) mandated the use of SCAP-validated products for  continuous monitoring of Federal Desktop Core Configuration  (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives to encourage and make  simple agencies’ compliance with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  � Facilitate development and sharing of checklists by  providing a formal framework for checklist developers to  submit checklists to NIST  � Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform to  common operations environments  � Help developers and users by providing guidelines for  making checklists better documented and more usable  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov http://checklists.nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201358  � Encourage software vendors and other parties to develop  checklists  � Provide a managed process for the review, update, and  maintenance of checklists  � Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists  � Encourage the use of automation technologies (e.g.,  SCAP) for checklist application  There are 225 checklists posted on the website; 52 of the  checklists are SCAP-expressed and can be used with SCAP- validated products. In FY 2013, a total of 16 SCAP-expressed  checklists were contributed to the NCP from other federal  agencies and product vendors.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the NCP  website for automated security configuration patch assessment.  NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for Internet Explorer 9.0,  Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2010, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and other  products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist content,  NCP groups checklists into tiers, from Tier I to Tier IV. NCP  uses the tiers to rank checklists according to their automation  capability. Tier III and IV checklists include SCAP content and  have been validated by the SCAP content validation tool as  conforming to the requirements outlined in SP 800-126, The  Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP). Tier IV checklists are considered production- ready and have been validated by NIST or a NIST recognized  authoritative entity to ensure, to the maximum extent possible,  interoperability with SCAP-validated products.  Tier III checklists use SCAP content to document security  settings and should be compatible with SCAP-validated  products. Tier II checklists document recommended security  settings in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such as  a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration script.  Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain no machine- readable content. Users can browse the checklists based on  the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category, or authority,  and also through a keyword search that searches the checklist  name and summary for user specified terms. The search results  show the detailed checklist metadata and a link to any SCAP  content for the checklist, as well as links to any supporting  resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate submission and  maintenance processes. The manual interface consists of a  web application that guides the submitter through the data  entry process to ensure that all of the required information  is submitted. The submission is validated upon review, and a  report is returned to the submitting organization, verifying either  acceptance or rejection based on the criteria requirements.  For instance, Tier III and Tier IV checklists require validation  using the SCAP Content Validation Tool (this tool is available for  download via http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 2, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for  Checklist Users and Developers, which can be found at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  http://checklists.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  ª United States Government Configuration  Baseline (USGCB) / FDCC Baselines  The United States Government Configuration Baseline  (USGCB) initiative creates security configuration baselines for  information technology (IT) products widely deployed across the  federal agencies. The project evolved from the Federal Desktop  Core Configuration (FDCC) mandate originally described in a  March 2007 memorandum from the U.S. White House Office  of Management and Budget (Memorandum M-07-11). USGCB  helps to improve information security and reduce overall IT  operating costs by providing commonly accepted security  configurations for major operating systems.  Through the National Checklist Program described in SP  800-70 Revision 2, National Checklist Program for IT Products:  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers, a baseline  submitter may express interest in submitting a candidate for  use in the USGCB program.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB automation  content, including the creation of patch updates, assisting  USGCB users in continuously monitoring and assessing security  compliance of information systems. This ongoing monitoring  element supports the Risk Management Framework described in  SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life  Cycle Approach.  During FY 2013, a supplemental USGCB SCAP 1.0 content for  Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and 7 was released to correct an  issue with directory server performance caused by the existing  USGCB content.  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html http://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov  59  The USGCB Program will continue in FY 2014 to provide  ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and to consider  additional applicable platforms.

These configuration guidelines will assist organizations with  hardening OS X technologies and provide a basis for unified  controls and settings for OS X workstations and for mobile  system security configurations for federal agencies.  The configurations will be based on a collection of resources,  including the existing NIST OS X configuration guidance, the OS  X security configuration guide, the Department of Defense (DoD)  OS X Recommended Settings, and the Defense Information  Systems Agency (DISA) OS X Security Technical Implementation  Guide (STIG).  Our team is aggregating appropriately 400 initial  settings, determining which settings will be included in the  configuration baseline, and determining appropriate values for  each included setting.  As the desired configuration items are  established, our team is developing shell scripts that apply the  settings to an OS X 10.8 system. The settings are organized  into three key baselines, which are appropriate for different  environments:  � Enterprise baseline is appropriate for centrally managed,  networked systems.  � Small Office Home Office baseline is appropriate for  systems that are deployed remotely but need to connect  to enterprise networks.  � Special Security Limited Functionality baseline is  appropriate for systems where security requirements are  more stringent and where the implementation of security  safeguards is likely to reduce functionality.  SCAP, defined and discussed in other sections of this report,  is used to express configuration settings and check system  configuration compliance.  During FY 2013, CSD provided a block of initial settings  to Apple and these settings are being posted for the Apple  community on a periodic basis for public review, discussion,  correction and agreement.  Each setting will have a designated  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) number, which will  aid in long-term tracking of the setting.  Once these settings  are vetted and curated by Apple, these settings will be tested  and included in the configuration baselines.  In addition, CSD  is producing a draft guideline, Guide to Securing Apple OS X  10.8 Systems for IT Professionals.  This guidance, similar in  structure to the NIST SP 800-68, Windows XP Security Guide,  will provide detailed information about the security of Apple OS  X 10.8, and will provide security configuration guidelines for the  Apple OS X 10.8 operating system.  In FY 2014, CSD plans to complete the scripts for the  remaining initial settings and post them to the Apple community  for feedback. CSD will also continue the development of  the draft Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT  Professionals; this documentation will then be made available  for public comment.

Conformance testing is necessary because SCAP is a complex  specification consisting of eleven individual specifications  that work together to support various use cases. A single  error in product implementation could result in undetected  vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within agency and  industry networks.  In FY 2013, CSD updated the SCAP Validation Program to  support the testing of products against SCAP version 1.2. The  division published NISTIR 7511 Revision 3, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation Program  Test Requirements, which introduces a modular approach  with respect to the platforms that vendors may support. Public  validation test content was published , thus providing reference  materials that support conformance testing by industry and  end users.

The SCAP Validation Program resources web page was  introduced to provide the public with a centralized location for  all resources and information necessary to prepare products  for SCAP 1.2 validation. The resources provided include  documentation, a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ),  the SCAP test content, and tools for validating and processing  SCAP data streams. CSD updated the SCAP Content Validation  Tool (SCAPVal), used for validating that data streams adhere to  the SCAP specification, to include support for SCAP 1.2. The  update for SCAP 1.2 included open source SCAP reference  implementation tools that are used to process SCAP data  streams.  End users may use the SCAP Validation Program resources  page to learn more about the validation program and download  reference materials. The program currently has seven  independent laboratories accredited for SCAP 1.2 product  testing and several products are undergoing testing.  The SCAP Validation Program will expand in FY 2014 to  provide enhanced testing support and will focus on increased  test coverage by SCAP reference implementation tools.  Expansion plans also include improvements in automated  testing capabilities.  http://scap.nist.gov/validation/  Contact:  Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  ª Cryptographic Programs and Laboratory  Accreditation  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and  the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) were  developed by NIST to support the needs of the user community  for strong, independently tested, and commercially available  cryptographic algorithms and modules. Through these programs,  NIST works with private and governmental sectors and the  cryptographic community to achieve security, interoperability,  and assurance of correct implementation. The goal of these  programs is to support the use of validated algorithms, and  modules and to provide federal agencies with a security metric  to use in procuring cryptographic modules. The testing carried  out by independent third-party laboratories accredited by the  NIST National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP) and the validations performed by the CMVP and CAVP  programs provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and  the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or products  containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP Validated  Modules List and have confidence in the claimed level of  security and assurance of correct implementation.  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module testing  and validation are based on underlying published standards .  As federal agencies are required to use validated cryptographic  modules for the protection of sensitive non-classified  information, the validated modules and the validated algorithms  that the modules contain represent the culmination and delivery  of the division’s cryptography-based work to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate, collaborative  programs based on a partnership between NIST’s CSD and the  Communication Security Establishment Canada (CSEC).. The  CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms and modules used in  a wide variety of products, including secure Internet browsers,  secure radios, smart cards, space based communications,  munitions, security tokens, mobile phones, network and storage  devices, and products supporting Public Key Infrastructure  (PKI) and electronic commerce. A module may be a standalone  product, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card or  it could be a module used in several products, such as a toolkit.  As a result, a small number of modules may be incorporated  within hundreds of products. The CAVP validates cryptographic  algorithms that may be integrated in one or more cryptographic  modules.  The CAVP and CMVP validation programs provide documented  methodologies for conformance testing through defined sets  of security requirements. For CAVP, the validation system  documents are designed for each FIPS-approved and NIST- recommended cryptographic algorithm. See website for a  listing.  Security requirements for the CMVP are found in FIPS  140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules  and the associated test metrics and methods in Derived Test  Requirements for FIPS 140-2. The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2  reference the underlying cryptographic algorithm standards or  methods. The CMVP developed Derived Test Requirements for  FIPS 140-2 defines the test metrics and methods and ensures  repeatability of tests and equivalency in results across the  testing laboratories.  The CMVP reviews the cryptographic modules validation  requests and, as a byproduct of the review, is attentive to  emerging and/or changing technologies and the evolution  of operating environments and complex systems during the  module validation review activities. Likewise, the CAVP reviews  the cryptographic algorithm validation requests submitted by  the accredited laboratories. With these insights, the CAVP and  CMVP can perform research and development on evolving test  metrics and methods. Based on this research, the CAVP and  CMVP publish Implementation Guidance to assist vendors,  http://scap.nist.gov/validation mailto:melanie.cook@nist.gov  61  testing laboratories, and the user community. This guidance  provides clarity, consistency of interpretation, and insight for  successful conformance testing, validation, and revalidation.  Figure 17: FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Validated  Modules by Year and Level  The unique position of the validation programs gives the  CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during the validation  review activities and results in practical, timely, and up-to-date  guidance that is needed by the testing laboratories and vendors  to move their modules out to the user community in a timely  and cost-effective manner and with the assurance of third- party conformance testing. This knowledge and insight provide  a foundation for future standards development.  The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated improved quality and  security assurance of cryptographic modules. The latest set of  statistics, which are collected quarterly from each of the testing  laboratories, shows that 7% of the cryptographic algorithms  and 35% of the cryptographic modules brought in for voluntary  testing had security flaws that were corrected during testing.  To date, over 2,004 cryptographic module validation certificates  have been issued, representing over 4,811 modules that were  validated by the CMVP. These modules have been developed by  more than 425 domestic and international vendors.

These tests  exercise the mathematical formulas and the algorithmic  requirements detailed in the algorithm to assure that the  detailed specifications are implemented correctly and  completely. If the implementer deviates from or excludes any  part of these instructions or requirements, the validation test  will fail, indicating that the algorithm implementation does not  function properly or is incomplete.  CAVP-developed validation tests are performed by accredited  testing laboratories on a vendor’s algorithm implementation  using automated known-answer tests, which compare the result  from a cryptographic operation with a specific input against the  expected result. They provide a uniform way to assure that the  cryptographic algorithm implementation adheres to the detailed  specifications.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are not  limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests, and Multi- Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests are designed  to examine the individual components of the algorithm by  supplying known values to the variables and verifying the  expected result. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise  the entire IUT. This test is designed to detect the presence of  implementation flaws that are not detected with the controlled  input of the Known-Answer Tests. The types of implementation  flaws detected by this validation test include pointer problems,  insufficient allocation of space, improper error handling, and  incorrect behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test  (MMT) is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which require the chaining of  information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, CSD has expanded its publications  beyond only an algorithm’s specification into how an algorithm  should be used. Many of these requirements are outside the  scope of the algorithm boundary and therefore cannot be tested  at the algorithm level by the CAVP. Some of the requirements  are within the scope of the CMVP while others are outside the  scope of both the CAVP and the CMVP. In the case where the  requirement is outside the scope of the CAVP and the CMVP, the  fulfillment of the requirements is the responsibility of entities  using, installing, or configuring applications or protocols that  use the cryptographic algorithms. For example, depending on  the design of a cryptographic module, it may not be possible  for the module to determine whether a specific key is used for  multiple purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.

National body comments for the above four documents will  be addressed at the 47th SC 27 WG 3 meeting to be held in  Incheon, Korea, in October 2013.  CSD’s contributions to the development of these international  standards create a strong foundation for the adoption of and  migration from currently used national standards. In particular,  this adoption will promote the international harmonization for  the implementation and testing of cryptographic algorithms and  modules while accommodating individual country preferences  in the choice of approved security functions.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/  Contact:  Mr. Randall J. Easter  (301) 975-4641  randall.easter@nist.gov  ª Cryptographic System Validation  Current validation programs focus on providing a known  level of assurance for cryptographic algorithms and modules.  These are used within the context of a larger system to provide  cryptographic services as a method of protecting the data  within the system.  As information systems continue to become  more complex, the methods used to implement cryptographic  services have also increased in complexity.  Problems with  the use of cryptography are often introduced through the  interaction of cryptographic components with the operating  environment.  This program seeks to specify how cryptographic  components are used as part of a defined cryptographic system  to solve problems with a measureable level of assurance, and  to introduce automated methods of quantifying the level of  assurance.  This program will begin the research required to define a  reference cryptographic systems architecture and example  use cases where cryptographic systems are built from known  cryptographic components that cooperate through trust  relationships to provide a measureable level of assurance.  The  architecture should begin at the lowest level with a hardware  based root of trust, and each cryptographic component should  be added in successive layers to provide assurance in a  systematic way.  This should allow the development of tests that  would measure the correct implementation of cryptographic  components as part of a larger system.  This program will perform research and experimentation in  applicable technologies and techniques that will enable the  efficient testing of the cryptographic capabilities of each layer,  and continuous monitoring capabilities of each cryptographic  component, providing the necessary interfaces to establish  trust relationships with other cryptographic components.  Techniques could include such items as:  � Embedding SCAP like data elements and standard  interfaces to query those data elements during design  and implementation of cryptographic components that  would enable automated testing capabilities;  � Using cryptographic techniques to embed values into  the module that would increase the verifiability and  assurance that the module provides; and  � Using industry-based secure development techniques to  increase the level of trust inherent in software modules  starting with design and implementation.  Research into this area of cryptographic system validation  holds the promise of automating the validation of all  cryptographic components, providing a higher assurance  with less manual effort by using SCAP-based ideas to embed  data elements that instrument the test harnesses used to  validate cryptographic systems.  This would also provide the  instrumentation that could be leveraged to enable a greater  level of situational awareness and security measurement, and  potentially to enable continuous monitoring of cryptographic  systems.

System administrators need  objective metrics to guide and justify decision making as they  manage the security risk of enterprise networks. The objective  of this research is to develop a standard model for security  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201366  risk analysis of computer networks. A standard model will  enable us to answer questions such as “Are we more secure  now than yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a  standard model to measure network security will allow users,  vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and consistent  manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies and  measuring security based on how real attackers have penetrated  networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk analysis is based  on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack paths through a network,  providing a probabilistic metric of the overall system risk.  Through this metric, CSD analyzes trade-offs between security  costs and security benefits.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and zero  day attacks.  Handling zero day vulnerabilities is inherently  difficult due to their unpredictable nature.  In FY 2013, CSD  attempted to assess the risk of unknown attack patterns. CSD  developed a new model “k-zero day safety” for zero day attacks.  Existing algorithms for computing this metric are not scalable  as they assume that a complete zero day attack graph has  been generated.  CSD has proposed a set of polynomial time  algorithms for estimating k-zero day safety.  CSD has authored  a paper, “An Efficient Approach to Assessing the Risk of Zero- Day Vulnerabilities,” that received the Best Paper Award at the  tenth International Conference on Security and Cryptography  (SECRYPT 2013), in Reykjavik, Iceland.  In FY 2014, CSD plans to apply attack graphs to study the  effect of diversity for network defense. CSD also plans to  publish the results as a NIST report and as white papers in  conferences and journals.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-riskanalysis-enterprise- networks/  Contact:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  ªAlgorithms for Intrusion Measurement  Figure 22: Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement  The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM) project, newly  formed in FY 2013, furthers measurement science in the area  of algorithms used in the field of intrusion detection. The team  focuses on both new detection metrics and measurements of  scalability (more formally algorithmic complexity). This analysis  is applied to different phases of the detection lifecycle to include  pre-emptive vulnerability analysis, initial attack detection, alert  impact, alert aggregation/correlation, and compact log storage.  In performing this work, the AIM project seeks to enhance our  nation’s ability to defend itself from network-borne attacks.  Much of this scientific research is conducted in partnership  with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). ARL’s participation  helps focus the work on solving immediate critical problems  facing U.S. Government networks. However, research solutions  are made publicly available and are designed to be generally  applicable to as many environments as possible.  In its first year, the AIM project initiated research in each  stage of the detection lifecycle with a focus on graph theoretic  approaches; it has already obtained several major results.  For example, the project has advanced the state of the art  in network scan detection, discovering and then thwarting  circumvention attacks against a highly cited scan detection  algorithm. A paper describing this approach, “Limitations  to Threshold Random Walk Scan Detection and Mitigating  Enhancements,” was published at the First IEEE Conference on  Communications and Network Security. Additionally, the project  developed a hypergraph-based algorithm to use Hamming  distance to aggregate security alert logs more than an order  of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art, while  providing enhanced aggregation.  In FY 2014, the AIM project will continue its scan detection  work and publish its work on log aggregation. It will continue  emerging research on log file compression and alert impact  analysis. Newly initiated work will include investigation of  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-riskanalysis-enterprise-networks/  67  known-vulnerability based metrics for comparing the attack  resistance of different networks or a single network over time.

NIST  research has shown that most failures are triggered by one or  two parameters and progressively fewer by three, four, or more  parameters (see graph below), a relationship that is called the  Interaction Rule. These results have important implications for  testing. If all faults in a system can be triggered by a combination  of n or fewer parameters, then testing all n-way combinations  of parameters can provide very strong fault detection efficiency.  These methods are being applied to software and hardware  testing for reliability, safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on  empirical results and real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2013 included completion of a  two-year Cooperative Research and Development Agreement  (CRADA) with Lockheed Martin Corporation, showing  approximately 20% reduction in software test development  cost across a variety of projects; publication of the first  textbook on combinatorial testing; release of an advanced  tool for measuring combinatorial coverage of test sets (jointly  with Centro Nacional de Metrología, Mexico); cooperative  work with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility  analyzing combinatorial coverage measurement for IV&V of  space systems; lectures at conferences and research labs;  and leading (jointly with IBM personnel) the IEEE Second  International Conference on Combinatorial Testing, held with  the International Conference on Software Testing.  Technology transfer activities included publication of several  technical papers; participation in the Maryland Technology  Development Corporation (TEDCO) Technology Transfer  Workshop; presentation of results of the work with Lockheed  Martin; release of enhanced covering array, test prioritization,  and fault location tools; plus seminars and lectures at several  conferences, universities, and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2014 include a second phase of a project  with the NASA IV&V Facility to investigate integration of  combinatorial coverage measurement methods in NASA IV&V  practices; development of new methods and tools for very large  covering arrays (hundreds of variables); lectures at conferences  and research labs; and guiding development of a combinatorial  software test development environment by graduate students  at Carnegie Mellon University which will incorporate NIST  software.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/  Contacts:  Mr. Rick Kuhn Dr. Raghu Kacker  (301) 975-3337 (301) 975-2109  kuhn@nist.gov raghu.kacker@nist.gov  ªHardware Roots of Trust  Modern computing devices consist of various hardware,  firmware, and software components at multiple layers of  abstraction. Many security and protection mechanisms are  currently rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trustworthy. A vulnerability in any of  those components could compromise the trustworthiness of  the security mechanisms that rely upon those components.  Stronger security assurances may be possible by grounding  security mechanisms in roots of trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable hardware, firmware, and  software components that perform specific, critical security  functions. Because roots of trust are inherently trusted, they  must be secure by design. As such, many roots of trust are  implemented in hardware so that malware cannot tamper  with the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  A focus area for CSD’s roots of trust research in FY 2013 was  security for mobile devices. CSD worked with government and  industry partners on guidelines on hardware-rooted security  features in mobile devices. These guidelines focus on device Figure 23: Interaction Rule  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:peter.mell@nist.gov mailto:mark.badger@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts mailto:kuhn@nist.gov mailto:raghu.kacker@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201368  Cybersecurity Framework Policy Machine  Cloud Computing  C ry  pt og  ra ph  y  Standards  Security Practices Verification  Security Controls  Assets  Risk Management Framework  Biometrics  Sup ply  ch ain  ris k m  ana gem  ent  FIPS 140-2  Validated Products List  FISMA  Continuous Monitoring  Mobile Devices  Authorization  EO 13636  Roadmap integrity, isolation, and protected storage features that are  supported by roots of trust.

In FY 2014, CSD will release a revised draft of SP 800- 164, based on the feedback received during the public  comment period. In addition, CSD is working with the National  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the  adoption of stronger security technologies in mobile devices.  Using draft SP 800-164 as a basis for an NCCoE building block  activity, CSD and the NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating  system, management software vendors, and application  developers to study, demonstrate, and document how to use  hardware-backed security solutions.  In FY 2013, CSD continued its work to protect fundamental  system firmware, commonly known as Basic Input/Output  System (BIOS). CSD has been working with key members of the  computer industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the  security of BIOS.  CSD will continue its efforts to secure BIOS and other critical  firmware in FY 2014 and will finalize a Special Publication  covering BIOS protections for server-class systems. CSD will  also release an updated draft of SP 800-155, BIOS Integrity  Measurement Guidelines, which will include additional  guidelines for server-class systems and other boot firmware. In  order to encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,  CSD also plans to submit SP 800-147, BIOS Protection  Guidelines, to ISO for standardization.

The overall goal is to achieve  appropriate security assurance for multiple applications by  efficiently verifying the claimed identity of individuals seeking  physical access to federally controlled government facilities  and logical access to government information systems. The  standard contains the minimum requirements for a federal  personal identity verification system that meets the control  and security objectives of Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-12 (HSPD-12), including identity proofing, registration,  and issuance. The standard also provides detailed specifications  that will support technical interoperability among PIV systems  of federal departments and agencies. It describes the card  elements, system interfaces, and security controls required to  securely store, process, and retrieve identity credentials from  the card.

Digital signatures are used to  detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate  the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed  data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating  to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the  claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation, since the  signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time.

Current  mobile devices lack the hardware-based roots of trust that are  increasingly built into laptops and other types of hosts. This  document focuses on defining the fundamental security primitives  and capabilities needed to enable more secure mobile device  use. This document is intended to accelerate industry efforts  to implement these primitives and capabilities. The guidelines  in this document are intended to provide a baseline of security  technologies that can be implemented across a wide range  of mobile devices to help secure organization-issued mobile  devices as well as devices brought into an organization, such  as personally-owned devices used in enterprise environments  (e.g., Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)).

ABAC is a logical  access control methodology where authorization to perform  a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes  associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and,  in some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or  relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given  set of attributes. This document also provides considerations for  using ABAC to improve information sharing within organizations  and between organizations while maintaining control of that  information.

This system of  networks includes organizations, people, processes, products,  and services and the infrastructure supporting the system  development life cycle, including research and development  (R&D), design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration,  operations, and disposal/retirement of an organization’s ICT  products (i.e., hardware and software) and services.  Today’s ICT supply chains have increased complexity, diversity,  and scale, while Federal Government information systems have  been rapidly expanding in terms of capability and number, with  an increased reliance on outsourcing and commercially available  products. These trends have caused federal departments and  agencies to have a lack of visibility and understanding throughout  the supply chain of how the technology being acquired is  developed, integrated, and deployed, as well as the processes,  procedures, and practices used to assure the integrity, security,  resilience, and quality of the products and services. This lack of  visibility and understanding, in turn, has decreased the control  federal departments and agencies have with regard to the  decisions impacting the inherited risks traversing the supply  chain and the ability to effectively manage those risks.  SP 800-161 provides guidance to federal departments and  agencies on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply  chain risks at all levels in their organizations. SP 800-161  FY 2013 Computer Security Division Publications  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201378  integrates ICT Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) into  federal agency enterprise risk management activities by applying  a multi-tiered SCRM-specific approach, including supply chain  risk assessments and supply chain risk mitigation activities and  guidance.

To achieve these objectives, mobile  devices should be secured against a variety of threats. The  purpose of this publication is to help organizations centrally  manage the security of mobile devices. Laptops are out of the  scope of this publication, as are mobile devices with minimal  computing capability, such as basic cell phones. This publication  provides recommendations for selecting, implementing, and  using centralized management technologies, and it explains the  security concerns inherent in mobile device use and provides  recommendations for securing mobile devices throughout their  life cycles. The scope of this publication includes securing both  organization-provided and personally-owned (bring your own  device (BYOD)) mobile devices.

The DNS infrastructure is made  up of computing and communication entities called Name Servers  each of which contains information about a small portion of the  domain name space. The domain name data provided by DNS  is intended to be available to any computer located anywhere  in the Internet. This document provides deployment guidelines  for securing DNS within an enterprise. Because DNS data is  meant to be public, preserving the confidentiality of DNS data  is not a concern. The primary security goals for DNS are data  integrity and source authentication, which are needed to ensure  the authenticity of domain name information and maintain the  integrity of domain name information in transit. This document  provides extensive guidance on maintaining data integrity and  performing source authentication. DNS components are often  subjected to denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt  access to the resources whose domain names are handled  by the attacked DNS components. This document presents  guidelines for configuring DNS deployments to prevent many  denial-of-service attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in various  DNS components.

This document, SP 800-76, is a companion  document to FIPS 201. It describes technical acquisition and  formatting specifications for the PIV system, including the PIV  Card itself. It also establishes minimum accuracy specifications  for deployed biometric authentication processes. The approach  is to enumerate procedures and formats for collection and  preparation of fingerprint, iris, and facial data, and to restrict  values and practices included generically in published biometric  standards. The primary design objective behind these particular  specifications is to enable high performance and universal  interoperability. The introduction of iris and face specifications  into the current edition adds alternative modalities for biometric  authentication and extends coverage to persons for whom  fingerprinting is problematic. The addition of on-card comparison  offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card activation as well as  an additional authentication method.

FIPS 201  also specifies that this identity credential must be stored on a  smart card. This document, SP 800-73, contains the technical  specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and  use the PIV identity credentials. The specifications reflect the  design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The  goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge  interface, and application-programming interface. Moreover,  this document enumerates requirements where the international  integrated circuit card standards [ISO7816] include options  and branches. The specifications go further by constraining  implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards. Such  restrictions are designed to ease implementation, facilitate  interoperability, and ensure performance, in a manner tailored  for PIV applications.

The security and privacy  controls are customizable and implemented as part of an  organization-wide process that manages information security  and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security  and privacy requirements across the Federal Government and  critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive Orders,  policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/ business needs. The publication also describes how to develop  specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types  of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments  of operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses  security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of  81  security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance  perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented  security capability). Addressing both security functionality  and assurance helps to ensure that information technology  component products and the information systems built from  those products using sound system and security engineering  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

In addition to specifying  Record Types in traditional encoding, the standard includes  the specification of National Information Exchange Model  (NIEM) Extensible Markup Language (XML) encoding and an  associated schema. The Computer Security Division of NIST/ITL  developed a Conformance Test Architecture (CTA) and Test Suite  (CTS) called “BioCTS for AN-2011 NIEM XML” designed to test  implementations of AN-2011 NIEM XML encoded transactions.  Validating the XML files to a schema may indicate that the  contained data is formatted correctly and individual values are  within allowable ranges, assuming that the requirements for  FY 2013 Computer Security Division Publications  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201382  that data have been documented in the schema file. However,  schemas are not designed to test the internal consistency of  implementations (i.e., testing for a relationship between two  elements or structures within a transaction). These shortcomings  of XML schema files for use in conformance testing necessitate  that schemas be used only as a component of a complete  testing solution. This complete solution (the test tool) ensures  test coverage of requirements through a combination of schema  validation and conformance tests of the data in the XML files. This  document discusses the test software design including the XML  Data Structures used and Classes implemented. It addresses  the testing phases and the format of the test results; as well  as the user interface and key usability features implemented in  this version of the test tool. Details are provided on a modified  schema that was required to be used in the tool in order to fully  perform tests for all the requirements specified in the AN-2011  standard.

The publication considers  a core set of features in the three common cloud services:  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS),  and Software as a Service (SaaS). The report identifies a set of  security capabilities needed to exercise those features and the  cryptographic operations they entail. An analysis of the common  state of practice of the cryptographic operations that provide  those security capabilities reveals that the management of  cryptographic keys takes on an additional complexity in cloud  environments compared to enterprise IT environments due to:  (a) difference in ownership (between cloud Consumers and  cloud Providers) and (b) control of infrastructures on which both  the Key Management System (KMS) and protected resources  are located.

A new technique for combinational logic  optimization is described. The technique is a two-step  process. In the first step, the non-linearity of a circuit  { as measured by the number of non-linear gates it  contains { is reduced. The second step reduces the  number of gates in the linear components of the  already reduced circuit. The technique can be applied  to arbitrary combinational logic problems, and often  yields improvements even after optimization by  85  standard methods has been performed. In this paper  we show the results of our technique when applied to  the S-box of the Advanced Encryption Standard (FIPS  197, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), National  Institute of Standards and Technology, 2001).  We also show that in the second step, one is faced  with an NP-hard problem, the Shortest Linear Program  (SLP) problem, which is to minimize the number of  linear operations necessary to compute a set of linear  forms. In addition to showing that SLP is NP-hard, we  show that a special case of the corresponding decision  problem is Max SNP-Complete, implying limits to its  approximability.  Previous algorithms for minimizing the number of  gates in linear components produced cancellation- free straight-line programs, i.e., programs in which  there is no cancellation of variables in GF(2). We show  that such algorithms have approximation ratios of at  least 3/2 and therefore cannot be expected to yield  optimal solutions to non-trivial inputs. The straight-line  programs produced by our techniques are not always  cancellation-free. We have experimentally verified  that, for randomly chosen linear transformations, they  are significantly smaller than the circuits produced by  previous algorithms.  Q.H.

FIPS 180-4 specifies two new  secure cryptographic hash algorithms: SHA-512/224  and SHA-512/256; it also includes a method for  determining initial value(s) for any future SHA-512- based hash algorithm(s). FIPS 180-4 also removes a  requirement for the execution of the message length  encoding operation.  D. Ferraiolo, S. Gavrila, and W.

Although access control (AC) currently plays an  important role in securing data services, if properly  envisaged and designed, access control can serve a  more vital role in computing than one might expect.  The Policy Machine (PM), a framework for AC  developed at NIST, was designed with this goal in  mind. The PM has evolved beyond just a concept to a  prototype implementation and is now being directed  toward an open source project.  D. Maughan, W.D. Newhouse and T. Vagoun, “Introducing the  Federal Cybersecurity R&D Strategic Plan,” The Next Wave - The  National Security Agency’s Review of Emerging Technologies  19(4), 3-7 (2012).  In December 2011, the White House Office of  Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released the  Trustworthy Cyberspace: Strategic Plan for the Federal  Cybersecurity Research and Development Program  —a framework for a set of coordinated federal  strategic priorities and objectives for cybersecurity  research. The release of this strategic plan marked  an important milestone by the Federal Government’s  research community. It expresses an understanding  of key causes of cybersecurity deficiencies and  presents research themes with high potential to  significantly improve the security of cyber systems  and infrastructure. The strategic plan is a culmination  of many efforts within the Federal Government, most  notably by the Senior Steering Group for Cybersecurity  R&D (CSIA R&D SSG), the Cyber Security and  Information Assurance Interagency Working Group  (CSIA IWG) of the Federal Networking and IT R&D  (NITRD) Program, and by the Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering Interagency Working Group  (SCORE IWG).

We show that a character sum attached to a family  of 3-isogenies defined on the fibers of a certain  elliptic surface over Fp relates to the class number of  the quadratic imaginary number  field Q(\\sqrt{p}). In  this sense, this provides a higher-dimensional analog  of some recent class number formulas associated to  2-isogenies of elliptic curves.  J.A. Montenegro, M.J. Fischer, J. Lopez and R.C.

This work describes the design and implementation  of an auction system using secure multiparty  computation techniques. Our aim is to produce a  system that is practical under actual field constraints  on computation, memory, and communication. The  underlying protocol is privacy-preserving, that is, the  winning bid is determined without information about  the losing bids leaking to either the auctioneer or other  bidders. Practical implementation of the protocol is  feasible using circuit-based cryptographic proofs  along with additively homomorphic bit commitment.  Moreover, we propose the development of a Proof  FY 2013 Computer Security Division Publications  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201386  Certificate standard.

In this article, we study the quartic Diophantine  equation x^4+y^4-2z^4-2w^4=0. We find non-trivial  integer solutions. Furthermore, we show that when a  solution has been found, a series of other solutions can  be derived. We do so using two different techniques.  The first is a geometric method due to Richmond,  while the second involves elliptic curves.  W.D.

The paper discusses the current status of biometric  standards development activities, with a focus on  international standards developments. Published  standards, as well as standards under development  or planned for the near future, are addressed. The  work of Joint Technical Committee 1 of ISO and IEC  Subcommittee 37 - Biometrics who is responsible  for the development of a large portfolio of biometric  standards in support of interoperability and data  interchange is addressed. The work of two other  JTC 1 Subcommittees, SC 17 Cards and personal  identification and SC 27 - IT Security techniques  who are also developing biometric standards within  their scope of work is discussed. In many cases, the  development of biometric standards impacts other  standards developments including token-based,  security, and telecommunication standards. Specific  examples of this impact are provided. Standards  activities performed in standards development  bodies outside of ISO/IEC JTC 1 are also addressed.  They include the work of ISO Technical Committee  68 – Financial Services – SC 2 – Security, and the  International Telecommunication Union - Study Group  17- Security. Due to the large international impact  and adoption, the development of the ANSI/NIST- ITL standards led by the Information Technology  Laboratory of NIST is also addressed. Although a  detailed discussion on biometric standards adoption  is beyond the scope of this paper, a few examples  of global and national biometric standards adoption  for verification and identification applications are  discussed.

Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) are the  main building block of many classical stream ciphers;  however due to their inherent linearity, most of the  LFSR-based designs do not offer the desired security  levels. In the last decade, using Nonlinear Feedback  Shift Registers (NFSR) in stream ciphers became  very popular. However, the theory of NFSRs is not  well-understood, and there is no efficient method  that constructs a cryptographically strong feedback  function with maximum period and also, given a  feedback function it is hard to predict the period. In this  paper, we study the maximum-length NFSRs, focusing  on the nonlinearity of their feedback functions. First,  we provide some upper bounds on the nonlinearity of  the maximum-length feedback functions, and then we  study the feedback functions having nonlinearity 2 in  87  detail. We also show some techniques to improve the  nonlinearity of a given feedback function using cross- joining.  ª Conference Papers  M. Albanese, S. Jajodia, A. Singhal and L.

Computer systems are vulnerable to both known  and zero-day attacks. Although known attack patterns  can be easily modeled, thus enabling the development  of suitable hardening strategies, handling zero- day vulnerabilities is inherently difficult due to  their unpredictable nature. Previous research has  attempted to assess the risk associated with unknown  attack patterns, and a suitable metric to quantify such  risk, the k-zero-day safety metric, has been defined.  However, existing algorithms for computing this metric  are not scalable, and must assume that complete  zero-day attack graphs have been generated, which  may be infeasible in practice for large networks. In  this paper, we propose a set of polynomial algorithms  for estimating the k-zero-day safety of possibly large  networks efficiently, without pre-computing the entire  attack graph. We validate our approach through  experiments, and show that the proposed algorithms  are computationally efficient and accurate.  S. Banik, S. Maitra, S. Sarkar and M.

Due to the symmetric padding used in the stream  cipher Grain v1 and Grain-128, it is possible to  find Key-IV pairs that generate shifted keystreams  efficiently. Based on this observation, Lee et al.  presented a chosen IV related Key attack on Grain v1  and Grain-128 at ACISP 2008. Later, the designers  introduced Grain-128a having an asymmetric padding.  As a result, the existing idea of chosen IV related Key  attack does not work on this new design. In this paper,  we present a Key recovery attack on Grain-128a, in  a chosen IV related Key setting. We show that using  around γ·2^32 (γ is a experimentally determined  constant and it is sufficient to estimate it as 2^8)  related Keys and γ·2^64 chosen IVs, it is possible  to obtain 32·γ simple nonlinear equations and solve  them to recover the Secret Key in Grain-128a.

Cryptographic applications, such as hashing, block  ciphers and stream ciphers, make use of functions  which are simple by some criteria (such as circuit  implementations), yet hard to invert almost everywhere.  A necessary condition for the latter property is to be  “sufficiently distant” from linear, and cryptographers  have proposed several measures for this distance.  In this paper, we show that four common measures,  nonlinearity, algebraic degree, annihilator immunity,  and multiplicative complexity, are incomparable in the  sense that for each pair of measures, μ1, μ2, there  exist functions f1, f2 with μ1(f1) > _μ1(f2) but μ2(f1)  < _μ2(f2). We also present new connections between  two of these measures. Additionally, we give a lower  bound on the multiplicative complexity of collision- free functions.  R.

Berntzen and C-P Rückemann,  eds., Xpert Publishing Services, Wilmington, Delaware (2013)  120-125.  Virtualized hosts provide abstraction of the  hardware resources (e.g., CPU, Memory) enabling  multiple computing stacks to be run on a single  physical machine. The Hypervisor is the core software  that enables this virtualization and hence must be  configured to ensure security robustness for the  entire virtualization infrastructure. Among the various  combination of hypervisor types and hypervisor  hardware platforms, we have chosen a reference  architecture as the basis for our set of deployment  features. For each deployment feature, this paper  looks at the configuration options and analyzes the  security implications of the options/deployment  feature to derive a set of assurance requirements that  are (a) provided by each of the configuration options or  (b) are required for that deployment feature as a whole  regardless of configuration options.

A network security metric is desirable in evaluating  the effectiveness of security solutions in distributed  systems. Aggregating CVSS scores of individual  vulnerabilities provides a practical approach  to network security metric. However, existing  approaches to aggregating CVSS scores usually cause  useful semantics of individual scores to be lost in the  aggregated result. In this paper, we address this issue  through two novel approaches. First, instead of taking  each base score as an input, our approach drills down  to the underlying base metric level where dependency  relationships have well-defined semantics. Second,  our approach interprets and aggregates the base  metrics from three different aspects in order to  preserve corresponding semantics of the individual  scores. Finally, we confirm the advantages of our  approaches through simulation.  V. C. Hu and K.

Access control (AC) policies can be implemented  based on different AC models, which are fundamentally  composed by semantically independent AC rules in  expressions of privilege assignments described by  attributes of subjects/attributes, actions, objects/ attributes, and environment variables of the protected  systems. Incorrect implementations of AC policies  result in faults that not only leak but also disable access  of information, and faults in AC policies are difficult  to detect without support of verification or automatic  fault detection mechanisms. This research proposes  an automatic method through the construction of a  simulated logic circuit that simulates AC rules in AC  policies or models. The simulated logic circuit allows  real-time detection of policy faults including conflicts  of privilege assignments, leaks of information, and  conflicts of interest assignments. Such detection is  traditionally done by tools that perform verification  or testing after all the rules of the policy/model are  completed, and it provides no information about  the source of verification errors. The real-time fault  detecting capability proposed by this research allows  a rule fault to be detected and fixed immediately  before the next rule is added to the policy/model, thus  requiring no later verification and saving a significant  amount of fault fixing time.

In this manuscript, we present our efforts towards  a framework for exposing the functionality of a mobile  application through a combination of static and  dynamic program analysis that attempts to explore  all available execution paths including libraries. We  verified our approach by testing a large number of  Android applications with our program to exhibit its  functionality and viability. The framework allows  complete automation of the execution process so  that no user input is required. We also discuss how  our static analysis program can be used to inform  the execution of the dynamic analysis program. The  program can serve as an extensible basis to fulfill  other useful purposes such as symbolic execution,  program verification, interactive debugger, and other  approaches that require deep inspection of an Android  application.

Combinatorial testing applies factor covering arrays  to test all t-way combinations of input or configuration  state space. In some testing situations, it is not  practical to use covering arrays, but any set of tests  covers at least some portion of t-way combinations  up to t [less than or equal to] n. This report describes  measures of combinatorial coverage that can be used  in evaluating the degree of t-way coverage of any test  suite, regardless of whether it was initially constructed  for combinatorial coverage.

Attack graphs compute potential attack paths from  a system configuration and known vulnerabilities of  a system. Evidence graphs model intrusion evidence  and dependencies among them for forensic analysis.  In this paper, we show how to map evidence graphs to  attack graphs. This mapping is useful for application  89  of attack graphs and evidence graphs for forensic  analysis. In addition to helping to refine attack graphs  by comparing attack paths in both attack graphs and  evidence graphs, important probabilistic information  contained in evidence graphs can be used to compute  or refine potential attack success probabilities  contained in repositories like CVSS. Conversely, attack  graphs can be used to add missing evidence or remove  irrelevant evidence to build a complete evidence graph.  In particular, when attackers use anti-forensics tools  to destroy or distort evidence, attack graphs can help  investigators recover the attack scenarios and explain  the lack of evidence for missing steps. We illustrate  the mapping using a database attack as a case study.  C. Liu, A. Singhal and D.

Evidence Graphs model network intrusion evidence  and their dependencies, which helps network  forensics analysts collate and visualize dependencies.  In particular, probabilistic evidence graph provide  a way to link probabilities associated with different  attack paths with available evidence. Existing work in  evidence graphs assume that all evidence is available  as one graph. We show how to merge different evidence  graphs with or without the help of attack graphs. We  show this by providing algorithms and a case study  based on attacks on a fileserver and a database server  in a lab network environment. An integrated evidence  graphs that show all attacks launched toward a global  network are more useful for forensics analysts and  network administrators in searching for forensic  evidence and safeguarding networks respectively.

Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC)  has become one of a few options for security in  the quantum model of computing. Though a few  multivariate systems have resisted years of effort from  the cryptanalytic community, many such systems have  fallen to a surprisingly small pool of techniques. There  have been several recent attempts at formalizing more  robust security arguments in this venue with varying  degrees of applicability. We present an extension  of one such recent measure of security against  a differential adversary, which has the benefit of  being immediately applicable in a general setting on  unmodified multivariate schemes.

Lightweight cryptography aims to provide sufficient  security with low area/power/energy requirements  for constrained devices. In this paper, we focus  on the lightweight encryption algorithm specified  and approved in NRS 009-6-7:2002 by Electricity  Suppliers Liaison Committee to be used with tokens  in prepayment electricity dispensing systems in South  Africa. The algorithm is a 16-round SP network with  two 4-to-4 bit S-boxes and a 64-bit permutation. The  S-boxes and the permutation are kept secret and  provided only to the manufacturers of the system  under license conditions. We present related-key  slide attacks to recover the secret key and secret  components using four scenarios; (i) known S-box  and permutation with 2^48 time complexity using  2^16 + 1 chosen plaintexts; (ii) unknown S-box and  known permutation with 2^55 time complexity using  2^22.71 + 1 chosen plaintexts; (iii) known S-box and  unknown permutation with 2^48 time complexity  using 2^16 + 1 chosen plaintexts and 2^12.28  adaptively chosen plaintexts; and finally, (iv) unknown  S-box and permutation, with 2^48 time complexity  using 2^22.71 + 1 chosen plaintexts and 2^31.29  adaptively chosen plaintexts. We also extend these  attacks to recover the secret components in a chosen- key setting with practical complexities.  ªBooks and Book Sections  D.R. Khun, R.N. Kacker and Y. Lei.

NIST, along with other agencies, was  tasked with a key role and specific activities in support  of that effort, including the delivery of the NIST Cloud  Computing Technology Roadmap and the publication of  other Special Publications that address the reference  architecture, definitions, and security aspects of cloud  computing. In order to achieve adoption of cloud  computing for the Federal Government, it is necessary  to address the security and privacy concerns that  federal agencies have when migrating their services  to a cloud environment. To further exacerbate the  situation, there are few documented details that  directly address how to achieve some security aspects  in a cloud environment. The purpose of this document  is to provide an overview of the high-priority security  and privacy challenges perceived by federal agencies  as impediments to the adoption of cloud computing.  The document provides descriptions of the existing  mitigations to these security and privacy impediments.  If no mitigations are listed, then ongoing efforts that  could lead to mitigations are described. In the cases  where no ongoing efforts were identified, the document  makes recommendations for possible mitigation or  references existing best practices.  C. Paulsen and J.

Standards and Technology  (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems.  NIST standards and guidelines are developed in an open and transparent manner that enlists broad industry and academia expertise from around  the world.  While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by other organizations because they are effective and  accepted throughout the world.  The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues to be critical for the Nation.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, CSD continued to align its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative security  technologies and methodologies that enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational  research and applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography; identity and access management; cloud,  virtualization, and mobile technologies; and advanced security testing and measurement.  Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2013, the President issued Executive  Order 13636 that directed NIST to work collaboratively with industry to develop a voluntary framework - based on existing standards, guidelines, and  practices - to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity practices.  NIST held several workshops, meetings, webinars, and informal sessions to  gather feedback with the goals of generating content for the framework and discuss several topics that help inform and guide NIST in this effort.  In  August 2013, we produced a discussion draft of the preliminary framework.  Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving and expanding security automation  capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and technologies. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and  education programs also exemplify the importance of these partnerships by engaging with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium  businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.  Active engagement with the diverse federal community continues to be critical to our success.  This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened  collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common  foundation for information security across the federal government. Through this partnership, NIST released Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision  4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in April 2013. This guideline provides organizations with state-of- the-practice security controls to fundamentally strengthen their systems and the environments in which those systems operate. SP 800-53 Revision  4 and other NIST standards and guidelines contribute to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.  Late in FY 2013, news reports about leaked classified documents caused concern from the cryptographic community about the security of NIST  cryptographic standards and guidelines. Recognizing community concern regarding some specific standards, we reopened the public comment period  for three Special Publications to give the public a second opportunity to view and comment on the documents.  This initial step will be followed by a  review of our cryptographic development process and NIST cryptographic standards and guidelines in FY 2014.  For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government,  has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward  to furthering these relationships in FY 2014 as we lead the development and practical implementation of  scalable and sustainable information security standards and practices in areas such as cyber-physical and  industrial control systems, privacy engineering, security automation, and mobile technologies.

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, CTG continued to make an impact in  the field of cryptography, both within and outside the Federal  Government, by collaborating with national and international  agencies, academic and research organizations, and standards  bodies to develop interoperable security standards and  guidelines. In addition, CTG worked with industry partners to  promote the use of NIST-approved cryptographic methods.  Federal agency collaborators include the National Security  Agency (NSA), the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects  Activity (IARPA), the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA), the National Strategy for  Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), General Services  Administration (GSA), the United States Postal Service (USPS),  and the Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  CTG also works closely with foreign government agencies,  such as the Communications Security Establishment of  Canada and Australia’s Defense Signals Agency and Centrelink.  Additionally, CTG is active in national and international standards  bodies, including the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9  (financial industry standards), the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG). Industry collaborators include Intel,  Microsoft, and Cisco.  Academic collaborators include Carnegie Mellon University,  Yale University, University of Southern Denmark, the University  of Milan, Malaga University, and the University of Lisbon.  Research organizations include the Information-technology  Promotion Agency (IPA)/Cryptography Research and Evaluation  Committees (CRYPTREC) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry (METI) of Japan.  Group Manager (Acting):  Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975-6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  Security Components and Mechanisms Group  (SCMG)  Mission Statement: Research, develop, and standardize foundational security  mechanisms, protocols, and services.  Overview: The SCMG’s security research focuses on the development  and management of foundational building-block security  mechanisms and techniques that can be integrated into a  wide variety of mission-critical U.S. information systems. The  group’s work spans the spectrum from near-term hardening  and improvement to the design and analysis of next- generation, leap-ahead security capabilities. Computer security  depends fundamentally on the level of trust for computer  software and systems. This work, therefore, focuses strongly  on assurance building activities ranging from the analysis of  software configuration settings to advanced trust architectures  to testing tools that surface flaws in software modules. This  work also focuses significantly on increasing the applicability  and effectiveness of automated techniques, wherever feasible.  The SCMG conducts collaborative research with government,  industry, and academia. Outputs of this research consist of  prototype systems, software tools, demonstrations, NIST  Special Publications (SP), NIST Interagency or Internal Reports  (NISTIR), and conference and journal papers.  SCMG works on a variety of topics, such as specifications  for the automated exchange of security information between  systems, computer security incident handling guidelines,  formulation of high-assurance software configuration settings,  hardware roots of trust for mobile devices, secure Basic  Input Output System (BIOS) layers, combinatorial testing  techniques, conformity assessment of software implementing  biometric standards, and adoption of Internet Protocol Version  6 and Internet Protocol security extensions. SCMG collaborates  extensively with government, academia, and the private sector.  In FY 2013, collaborations have included Carnegie Mellon  University (test development environment), Johns Hopkins  Applied Physics Lab (practical application of combinatorial  coverage measurement tool), North Carolina State University  (access control policy testing), University of North Texas and  University of Maryland-Baltimore County (test prioritization  algorithms), University of Texas at Arlington (covering array  generation algorithm), Mexico’s Centro Nacional de Metrología  (constraints for testing coverage tool), National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA) (practical application for  combinatorial coverage measurement), U.S. Air Force Test and  Evaluation (a new event sequence testing method), the National  Security Agency (secure software tool chain competition  development), and the Department of Homeland Security  (incident coordination).  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  5  SCMG accomplishments include the Advanced Combinatorial  Testing System (ACTS) software and documentation, the NIST  BioCTS 2013 biometric conformance testing tool and test  assertions, and a security log analysis tool.  Group Manager:  Mr. Mark (Lee) Badger  (301) 975-3176  mark.badger@nist.gov  Secure Systems and Applications  Group (SSAG)  Mission Statement: Integrate and apply security technologies, standards, and  guidelines for computing platforms and information systems.  Overview: SSAG’s security research focuses on the identification of  emerging and high-priority technologies and on the development  of security solutions that will enhance the security of U.S.  critical information infrastructure. The group conducts research  and development on behalf of government and industry from  the earliest stages of technology development through proof- of-concept, reference and prototype implementations, and  demonstrations. SSAG works to transfer new technologies to  industry; to produce new standards and guidance for federal  agencies and industry; and to develop tests, test methodologies,  and assurance methods.  SSAG investigates topics such as mobile device security,  cloud computing and virtualization, identity management,  access control and authorization management, and software  assurance. SSAG research helps federal agencies meet  information security requirements that might not be fully  addressed by existing technology. The group collaborates  extensively with government, academia, and private sector  entities.  Example successes from this work include tools for access  control policy testing, new concepts in access control and  policy enforcement, methods for achieving comprehensive  policy enforcement and data interoperability across enterprise  data services, and test methods for mobile device (smart phone)  application security. For example, the SSAG Mobile Application  Testing Portal (ATP) went operational for military use (known in  the U.S. Army as PANTHR) and is in the process of transitioning  to other federal agencies as open source. In support of the  Federal Government’s cloud computing initiatives, SSAG led  the NIST Security Working Group that published the NIST Cloud  Computing - Security Reference Architecture. The SSAG also  completed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) 201-2, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, which was approved by the  Secretary of Commerce and published in September of 2013.  To improve access to new technologies, SSAG chaired,  edited, and participated in the development of a wide variety of  national and international security standards.  Group Manager:  Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-3046  david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Security Outreach and Integration Group (SOIG)  Mission Statement: Develop, integrate, and promote the mission-specific  application of information security standards, guidelines, best  practices, and technologies.  Overview: The U.S. economy, citizens, and government rely on  information technology (IT); so the protection of IT and  information infrastructure is critical. SOIG leverages broad  cybersecurity and risk management expertise to develop,  integrate, and promote security standards, guidelines, tools,  technologies, methodologies, tests, and measurements to  address cybersecurity needs in many areas of national and  international importance.  The SOIG collaborates with stakeholders to address  cybersecurity considerations in many diverse program areas,  including the Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT) supply chain, Smart Grid, Electronic Voting, Health  Information Technology, and Cyber Physical and Industrial  Control Systems. The group continues to increase its efforts to  research, develop, and align cybersecurity standards, practices,  and testing methods necessary to foster interoperable and  secure public safety communications. In our Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA) implementation program,  the group produces standards and guidelines to help federal  agencies build strong cybersecurity risk management programs.  In each of these program areas, the group extends outreach  to stakeholders across federal, state, and local governments;  industry; academia; small businesses; and the public. The SOIG  also leads several broad cybersecurity awareness, training,  education, and outreach efforts, including the National Initiative  for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the Small- and Medium- sized Business (SMB) outreach program, the Federal Computer  Security Managers’ Forum, and the Federal Information Systems  Security Educators’ Association (FISSEA).  Key to the group’s success is the ability to interact with a  broad constituency to ensure that SOIG’s program is consistent  with national objectives related to or impacted by information  Introduction to CSD’s Five Groups  mailto:mark.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 20136  security. Through open and transparent public engagement,  collaboration, and cooperation, the group works to address  critical cybersecurity challenges, enable greater U.S. industrial  competitiveness, and facilitate practical implementation of  scalable and sustainable information security standards and  practices.  Group Manager:  Mr. Kevin Stine  (301) 975-4483  kevin.stine@nist.gov  Security Testing, Validation, and Measurement  Group (STVMG)  Mission Statement: Advance information security testing, measurement science,  and conformance.  Overview: Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on cryptography  for the protection of information and communications used  in electronic commerce, critical infrastructure, and other  application areas. The STVMG supports testing and validation  of underlying cryptographic modules and cryptographic  algorithms in consideration of established standards. These  cryptographic modules and algorithms enable products and  systems to provide security services, such as confidentiality,  integrity, and authentication. Although cryptography provides  security, poor designs or weak algorithms can render a product  insecure and place highly sensitive information at risk. When  protecting sensitive data, Federal Government agencies require  a minimum level of assurance that cryptographic products meet  established security requirements and use only tested and  validated cryptographic modules.  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating  cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic  modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)- compliant products; developing test suites and test methods;  providing implementation guidance and technical support  to industry forums; and conducting education, training, and  outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent Cryptographic and Security Testing laboratories  that are accredited by the NIST National Voluntary Laboratory  Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Based on the independent  laboratory test report and test evidence, the Validation Program  then validates the implementation under test. NIST publishes,  through public websites, lists of validations awarded.

NIST Responsibilities Under Executive Order  13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity”  Recognizing that the national and economic security of the  United States depends on the reliable functioning of critical  infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order (EO)  13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in  February 2013. This Executive Order directed NIST to work  with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based  on existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure.  The Cybersecurity Framework will provide a prioritized,  flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective  approach, including information security measures and controls  to help owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other  interested entities to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity- related risk while protecting business confidentiality, individual  privacy, and civil liberties.  To enable technical innovation  and account for organizational differences, the Cybersecurity  Framework will not prescribe particular technological solutions  or specifications.  In FY 2013, NIST worked with a diverse stakeholder  community to develop the Framework through an open public  process. This process included:  � Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) in the Federal  Register in February 2013  � Conducting five open workshops to provide the public  with additional opportunities to provide input.  These  workshops were hosted at the Department of Commerce  in Washington, D.C. (April 2013), Carnegie Mellon  University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (May 2013), the  University of California, San Diego (July 2013), the  University of Texas at Dallas (September 2013), and the  North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina  (November 2013)  � Preparing a Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework for  official public review and comment  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to conduct stakeholder outreach  and will work collaboratively to further develop and issue the  Cybersecurity Framework. NIST will initiate a 45-day public  comment period on the Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework,  review and adjudicate all public comments received, and issue  a final Cybersecurity Framework (version 1.0) in February 2014  as specified in the Executive Order.  http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  Contacts:  Mr. Kevin Stine Mr. Adam Sedgewick  (301) 975-4483 (301) 367-4678  kevin.stine@nist.gov adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov mailto:adam.sedgewick@nist.gov  11  Contributions to National and International  Standards Development  Figure 1 (below) shows many of the national and international  Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) involved in  cybersecurity standardization. CSD participates in cybersecurity  standards activities in many of these organizations, either in  leadership positions or as editors and contributors. Many of  CSD’s publications have been the basis for both national and  international standards projects. This section discusses CSD  standards activities in conjunction with InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cyber Security 1 (CS1), where Dan Benigni serves  as Chair and U.S. Head of Delegation to subcommittee SC 27,  and Sal Francomacaro serves as CS1 Vice Chair.  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a  network of the national standards institutes of 148 countries,  with the representation of one member per country. The scope  of ISO covers standardization in all fields except electrical and  electronic engineering standards, which are the responsibility  of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).  The IEC prepares and publishes international standards for  all electrical, electronic, and related technologies, including  electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics, electroacoustics,  multimedia, telecommunication, and energy production and  distribution, as well as associated general disciplines such  as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility,  measurement and performance, dependability, design and  development, safety, and the environment.  Figure 1: Cybersecurity Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201312  Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was formed by ISO and  IEC to be responsible for international standardization in the  field of information technology. It develops, maintains, promotes,  and facilitates IT standards required by global markets, meeting  business and user requirements concerning:  � Design and development of IT systems and tools  � Performance and quality of IT products and systems  � Security of IT systems and information  � Portability of application programs  � Interoperability of IT products and systems  � Unified tools and environments  � Harmonized IT vocabulary  � User-friendly and ergonomically designed user interfaces  JTC 1 consists of a number of subcommittees (SCs) and  working groups that address specific technologies. SCs that  produce standards relating to IT security include:  � SC 06 − Telecommunications and Information Exchange  Between Systems  � SC 17 − Cards and Personal Identification  � SC 27 − IT Security Techniques  � SC 37 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST, Chair)  JTC 1 also has:  � Technical Committee 68 – Financial Services  � SC 2 − Operations and Procedures including Security  � SC 4 – Securities  � SC 6 − Financial Transaction Cards, Related Media, and  Operations  � SC 7 – Software and Systems Engineering  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  ANSI is a private, nonprofit organization (501(c)(3)) that  administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization  and conformity assessment system and facilitates the  development of American National Standards (ANS) by  accrediting the procedures of SDOs.  ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally,  advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international  and regional standards organizations, and encourages the  adoption of international standards as national standards where  they meet the needs of the user community. ANSI is the sole  U.S. representative and dues-paying member of the two major  non-treaty international standards organizations, ISO and, via  the United States National Committee (USNC), the IEC.  INCITS is accredited by ANSI and serves as the ANSI Technical  Advisory Group (TAG) for ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1.  INCITS is sponsored by the Information Technology Industry  (ITI) Council, a trade association representing the leading U.S.  providers of information technology products and services.  INCITS is organized into Technical Committees that focus  on the creation of standards for different technology areas.  Technical committees that focus on IT security and IT security- related technologies or that may require separate security  standards include:  � B10 – Identification Cards and Related Devices  � CS1 – Cyber Security (Dan Benigni, NIST, Chair; Sal  Francomacaro, NIST, Vice Chair; and Richard Kissel, NIST,  Principal voting member)  � E22 – Item Authentication  � M1 – Biometrics (Fernando Podio, NIST, Chair)  � T3 – Open Distributed Processing (ODP)  � T6 – Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology  � GIT1 – Governance of IT  � DAPS38 – Distributed Application Platforms and Services  As a technical committee of INCITS, CS1 develops United  States, national, ANSI-accredited standards in the area of  cybersecurity. Its scope encompasses:  � Management of information security and systems  � Management of third-party information security service  providers  � Intrusion detection  � Network security  � Cloud computing security  � Supply chain risk management  � Incident handling  � IT security evaluation and assurance  � Security assessment of operational systems  13  � Security requirements for cryptographic modules  � Protection profiles  � Role-based access control  � Security checklists  � Security metrics  � Cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques  and mechanisms, including confidentiality, entity  authentication, non-repudiation, key management, data  integrity, message authentication, hash functions, and  digital signatures  � Future service and applications standards supporting  the implementation of control objectives and controls as  defined in ISO 27001, in the areas of business continuity  and outsourcing  � Identity management, including identity management  framework, role-based access control, and single sign- on  � Privacy technologies, including privacy framework,  privacy reference architecture, privacy infrastructure,  anonymity and credentials, and specific privacy- enhancing technologies  The scope of CS1 explicitly excludes the areas of work on  cybersecurity standardization presently under way in INCITS  B10, M1, T3, T10, and T11, as well as other standard groups,  such as the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions  (ATIS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.  (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Travel  Industry Association of America (TIAA), and the Accredited  Standards Committee (ASC) X9. The CS1 scope of work includes  standardization in most of the same cybersecurity areas as are  covered in the NIST CSD.  As the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, CS1 contributes to  the SC 27 program of work on IT Security Techniques in terms of  U.S. comments and contributions on SC 27 standards projects;  votes on SC 27 standards documents at various stages of  development; and nominates U.S. experts to work on various SC  27 projects as editors, coeditors, or in other SC 27 leadership  positions. Currently, over a dozen CS1 members are serving  as SC 27 document editors or coeditors on various standards  projects, including CSD staff Randy Easter and Richard Kissel.  All input from CS1 is processed through INCITS to ANSI,  then to SC 27. CS1 also serves as a conduit for getting U.S.- based new work item proposals and U.S.-developed national  standards into the international SC 27 standards development  process. In its international efforts, CS1 responded to all calls  for U.S. contributions and/or voting positions on all international  security standards projects in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27 in a  consistent, efficient, and timely manner.  NIST contributes to many of CS1’s national and international  IT security standards efforts through its membership on CS1,  where Dan Benigni serves as the non-voting chair and Richard  Kissel as the NIST Principal voting member. Internationally,  there are over 100 published standards, and almost all have  been adopted as U.S. national standards. There are more than  80 current international standards projects. During FY 2013,  29 new standards were published in SC 27, and most of them  have been recommended by CS1 for adoption as U.S. national  standards.  CSD Contributions to Cybersecurity  Standardization in INCITS CS1  CSD’s cybersecurity research also plays a direct role in the  Cybersecurity Standardization efforts of CS1 at the national  level. Nationally during FY 2013:  � The NIST Policy Machine research and development has  resulted in three ongoing national standards projects  in CS1, each in the early stages of development. They  include:  • INCITS 499-2013, “Next Generation Access Control  –Functional Architecture (NGAC-FA)”, David Ferraiolo,  NIST, Editor, Published May 2013  • “Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC- GOADS)”, Project Number: 2195-D, Serban Gavrila,  NIST, Editor (Planned Publication FY 2014)  • “Next Generation Access Control-Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions (NGAC- IRPADS)”, Project Number: 2193-D  Within CS1, liaisons are maintained with nearly 20  organizations, including:  � ABA Federated Identity Management Legal (IdM Legal)  Task Force  � American Bar Association (ABA), section on Science and  Technology  � Cloud Security Alliance  � Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201314  � IEEE P1700 and P1619  � INCITS T11, M1, GIT1, DAPS38, and PL22  � Internet Security Alliance  � Kantara Initiative Identity Assurance Working Group  (IAWG)  � Open Group  � SC 7 TAG  � Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE)  � The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)  � Trusted Computing Group  Dan Benigni also serves as cybersecurity standards  coordinator in CSD.  Contact:  Mr. Daniel Benigni  (301) 975-3279  benigni@nist.gov  Identity Management Standards within INCITS  B10 and ISO JTC1/SC 17  CSD supports identity management standardization activities  through participation in national and international standards  bodies and organizations.  CSD actively participates in the  INCITS B10 committee, which is focused on interoperability of  Identification Cards and Related Devices. CSD staff serves as  Chair and Vice Chair of the B10.12 committee, which develops  interoperable standards for Integrated Circuit Cards with  Contacts. CSD staff also serves as the U.S. Head of delegation  to ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 17 Working Groups 4 and 11.  In addition to chairing the B10.12 committee, CSD provides  technical and editorial support in the development of national  and international standards. Specifically, CSD staff serves as  the technical editor of ANSI 504-1, Generic Identity Command  Set (GICS). GICS enables PIV, PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and  Common Access Card (CAC) card applications, and others, to  be built from a single platform. GICS defines an open platform  where identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and  used in an interoperable way between the credential issuers  and credential users. CSD staff also provides significant input  to standards of major interest to U.S. government agencies and  U.S. markets. CSD influences the development and revision of  ISO/IEC 7816 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit Cards),  ISO/IEC 24727 (Identification Cards, Integrated Circuit Card  Programming Interfaces), and ISO/IEC 24787 (Biometrics  “Match On Card” Comparison).  During FY 2013, INCITS 504 Parts 1, 2, and 4 were published  and ISO/IEC 7816 Part 4 was published with significant changes  added per NIST’s request. CSD provides contributions and  feedback on many other INCITS B10 identity management  standards projects.  During the FY 2014, the INCITS B10 committee, along with  the active collaboration of CSD staff, plans to publish Part  3 of INCITS 504 and contribute to the publication of several  standards of the ISO/IEC 7816 family (all relevant to FIPS 201  specifications). CSD staff will continue actively supporting  relevant ID management standard initiatives.  CSD’s investment in these activities is motivated by new  technical ideas that emerge from these standards. For example,  INCITS 504 is an ID platform that leverages the FIPS 201  infrastructure to support a larger number of government and  enterprise initiatives. In particular, INCITS 504 aims to support  initiatives such as the NSTIC. ISO/IEC 24727 aims to create  an interoperability framework that increases the resilience  and scalability of identity management solutions and fosters  domestic and international interoperability.

Previously, the  Joint Task Force developed common security guidance in the  critical areas of security controls for information systems and  organizations, security assessment procedures to demonstrate  security control effectiveness, security authorizations for risk  acceptance decisions, and continuous monitoring activities  to ensure that decision makers receive the most up-to-date  information on the security state of their information systems. In  addition, CSD worked with the General Services Administration  (GSA) Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP) to identify security assessment requirements, and  prototype a process for approving Third-Party Assessment  Organizations (3PAOs) that demonstrate capability in assessing  Cloud Service Providers (CSP) information systems for  conformance to NIST standards and guidelines.  In FY 2013, CSD worked on the following three initiatives:  1. Risk Management and Risk Assessment Guidelines:  Developed a comprehensive risk assessment guideline  examining the relationships among key risk factors,  including threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and likelihood.  Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 4, Security  and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems  and Organizations, provides a holistic approach  to information security and risk management. The  publication provides organizations with security controls  necessary to appropriately strengthen their information  systems and the environments in which those systems  operate − contributing to systems that are resilient in  the face of attacks and other threats. This “Build It Right”  strategy combines with a variety of security controls  for “Continuous Monitoring” to give organizations near  real-time information that is essential for senior leaders  making ongoing risk-based decisions affecting their  critical missions and business functions.  To take advantage of the expanded set of security and  privacy controls, and to give organizations greater  flexibility and agility in defending their information  systems, the revision introduces the concept of  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  1  GENERIC RISK MODEL WITH KEY RISK FACTORS  producing  initiates  exploits  causing  Threat Source  Threat  Predisposing Conditions  Event Vulnerability  with Risk  as a combination of Impact and Likelihood  with Severity In the context of  Inputs from Risk Framing Step  (Risk Management Strategy or Approach)  Influencing and Potentially Modifying  Key Risk Factors  with Characteristics  (e.g., Capability, Intent, and Targeting for Adversarial Threats)  with Sequence  of actions, activities,  or scenarios  with Likelihood of Initiation  with Likelihood of Success  with Degree  with Pervasiveness  with Effectiveness  Security Controls Planned / Implemented  ORGANIZATIONAL RISK To organizational operations (mission, functions,  image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

Overlays provide a structured approach to  help organizations tailor security control baselines  and develop specialized security plans for specific  missions/business functions, environments of operation,  and/or technologies. This specialization approach is  important as the number of threat-driven controls and  control enhancements in the catalog increases and  organizations develop risk management strategies to  address their specific protection needs within defined  risk tolerances.  2. Criteria and Guidelines for Recognizing Security  Assessment Provider Organizations: CSD updated  proficiency tests and technical requirements for  evaluating FedRAMP 3PAO providers’ capability to  conduct security assessment of cloud-based information  systems for compliance with FISMA in accordance  with FedRAMP and ISO/IEC 17020 Inspection Bodies  requirements. Additionally, CSD provided input to GSA  requirements (including orientation and training) for  private sector accreditation body of FedRAMP 3PAOs that  resulted in GSA FedRAMP Program Management Office  (PMO) selecting one 3PAO private sector accreditation  body.  3. FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private Sector  Organizations: CSD conducted cybersecurity outreach  briefings and provided support to state and local  governments as well as private sector organizations on  topics of interest, such as effective implementation of  the NIST Risk Management Framework. In addition, CSD  conducted outreach activities with academic institutions,  providing information on NIST’s security standards and  guidelines, and exploring new areas of cybersecurity  research and development.  In FY 2013, CSD completed the following outreach activities:  � Finalized SP 800-53, Revision 4  � Collaborated with the ITL Software and Systems Division  and the NIST Standards Coordination Office using the  International Standard ISO/IEC 17020:2008, Conformity  Assessment – Requirements for the operation of various  types of bodies performing inspection, in support of GSA  in establishing a process for qualifying 3PAOs to conduct  security assessments of CSPs information systems  consistent with GSA requirements based on NIST  standards and guidelines  � Developed a preliminary draft of SP 800-53A, Revision 4,  Guide for Assessing the Security and Privacy Controls in  Federal Information Systems and Organizations  � Developed a preliminary draft of SP 800-18, Revision  2, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations  In FY 2014, CSD intends to:  � Finalize SP 800-53A, Revision 4, Guide for Assessing  the Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information  Systems and Organizations  � Finalize SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide for Mapping Types  of Information and Information Systems to Security  Categories  � Finalize SP 800-18 Revision 2, Guide for Developing  Security Plans for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations  � Expand cybersecurity outreach to include additional  state, local, and tribal governments, as well as private  sector organizations and academic institutions  � Continue to support federal agencies in effective  implementation of the NIST Risk Management  Framework.  http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert  Contacts:  Dr. Ron Ross  Ms. Pat Toth  (301) 975-5390  (301) 975-5140  ron.ross@nist.gov  patricia.toth@nist.gov  Mr. Arnold Johnson  Ms. Kelley Dempsey  (301) 975-3247  (301) 975-2827  arnold.johnson@nist.gov  kelley.dempsey@nist.gov  Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-2489  peggy.himes@nist.gov  Biometric Standards and Associated Conformity  Assessment Testing Tools  The CSD staff responds to government, industry, and market  requirements for open systems standards by:  � Accelerating development of formal biometric standards  � Providing effective leadership and technical participation  in the development of these standards  � Developing Conformance Test Architectures (CTA)  and Conformance Test Suites (CTS) designed to test  implementations of biometric standards  � Supporting harmonization of biometric, tokens, and  security standards  http://csrc.nist.gov/sec-cert mailto:ron.ross@nist.gov mailto:patricia.toth@nist.gov mailto:arnold.johnson@nist.gov mailto:kelley.dempsey@nist.gov mailto:peggy.himes@nist.gov  17  � Promoting biometric standards adoption  � Promoting conformity assessment efforts  To achieve these project goals, CSD continues to work in close  partnership with government agencies, industry partners, and  academic institutions. CSD actively participates in a number of  biometric standards development projects, contributes to the  development of biometric standards, and leads national and  international biometric standards bodies. Nationally, CSD’s staff  leads the INCITS Technical Committee 1 (M1) – Biometrics;  international efforts include ISO JTC 1 and IEC Subcommittee  SC 37 - Biometrics - JTC 1/SC 37. CSD plans to continue this  work in FY 2014.  During FY 2013, the development of object-oriented CTAs and  CTSs to test implementations of biometric standards progressed  at an accelerated pace. CSD developed and publicly released  two fully functional object-oriented CTAs. One CTA supports  CTSs designed to test implementations of Extensible Markup  Language (XML) encoded biometric data interchange formats  and the other supports CTSs designed to test implementations  of ISO/IEC data formats developed by JTC 1/SC 37 as well as  PIV profiles of biometric standards. CSD released these test  tools as “BioCTS 2013 for ANSI/NIST 1-2011” and “BioCTS  2013 for ISO/IEC” respectively. As depicted in the figure, CTA/ CTSs’ key features include search capabilities of the Text Log  Outputs (very useful to debug errors in large implementations),  formatted test results, and test result basic statistics (on batch  of files or individual files).  In addition to previously designed CTSs (e.g., CTS for  ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011 [AN-2011] traditional encoding  transactions and ISO/IEC biometric data interchange format  implementations), BioCTS 2013 conformance test software  includes a CTS designed to test National Information Exchange  Model (NIEM) XML encoded AN-2011 implementations. The  functionality of this tool goes beyond the existing basic  XML testing techniques, such as schema validation. CSD’s  project team concluded that the XML schema validation was  insufficient to address full conformance testing of the AN- 2011 requirements. The team implemented over 1,200 test  assertions beyond the schema validation (validating an XML  file against an XSD file) for this standard, including those for  AN-2011 Record Types 1, 4, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 17. NISTIR 7957,  Conformance Test Architecture and Test Suite for ANSI/NIST-ITL  1-2011 NIEM XML Encoded Transactions (September 2013)  and a presentation delivered at the last Biometric Consortium  conference3 discussed these test tools and provided technical  implementation details.  BioCTS 2013 conformance test software also includes CTSs  to test PIV profiles (e.g., finger minutia and image data formats)  and to test implementations of the second-generation face  recognition data format developed by JTC 1/SC 37 (published  in 2011). The PIV profile of the SC 37 iris data format was  aligned with SP 800-76-2, Biometric Specifications for Personal  Identity Verification. The face recognition CTS was aligned with  the associated conformance testing methodology developed by  JTC 1/SC 37.  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Figure 3: Biometric Conformance Test Software by NIST/ITL CSD  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201318  These conformance-testing tools provide significant  functionality, usability, and performance. In addition to supplying  an installer version of the CTAs, which supports new and  existing CTSs with new graphical user interface enhancements,  the CSD project team extended the work to a command line  interface version for AN-2011 traditional encoding that runs  under Windows and Linux (with Mono). The test tools developed  support a Web-based environment. A prototype was developed,  tested, and demonstrated at the last Biometric Consortium  Conference.  Based on the detailed analysis of the biometric standards  (ISO/IEC and AN-2011) required to develop the associated  conformance test tools, the CSD team provided technical  contributions to the relevant standards bodies. In FY 2013,  these included:  � Over 200 test assertions for AN-2011 Record Type 18 –  DNA Data Record  � Technical contributions on the AN-2011 standard and the  published XML schema  � Technical contributions to JTC 1/SC 37 (via INCITS M1)  on SC 37 XML namespaces, data elements, schemas,  and related items; an XML-based data interchange  format framework and DNA data interchange format  In addition to ongoing participation and management  of biometric standards activities in INCITS M1 and JTC 1/ SC 37, in FY 2014, CSD plans to develop additional CTSs to  test implementations of selected international biometric  data interchange formats specified in XML encoding (under  development in JTC 1/SC 37). The CSD team also plans to  develop conformance test assertions for selected record types  of the 2013 version of the ANSI/NIST standard and plans  to develop the associated CTA/CTS for traditional and XML  encoded transactions. The latest version of the ANSI/NIST  standard now incorporates extended forensics-related data,  such as a dental supplement and additional record types, such  as voice data record. The team will continue researching and  developing additional test environments support, such as web  services and tools in the cloud. The research plan expands to  technical interfaces, such as Biometric Application Programming  Interface standards specified in Object Oriented Programming  and Biometric Information Assurance Services standards.  Outreach efforts in FY 2013 in support of biometric standards  development and conformity assessment efforts included:  � Contribution of the area editor for articles on biometric  standards for Springer’s second edition of the Biometrics  Encyclopedia (under development), where 25 papers  were reviewed and edited  � Keynote talks and presentations on biometric standards  and conformity assessment at national and international  conferences  � Related technical publications and participation in  conference program committees and paper reviews  NIST helped develop the program of the 2013 Biometric  Consortium Conference, which CSD’s Mr. Fernando Podio co- chaired.  Held September 17-19, 2013, in Tampa, Florida, this  year’s conference included nearly 1,600 attendees from 30  countries representing government, industry, and academia.  CSD supported a booth at the conference’s technical  exposition and presented material regarding the conformance  test tool development project. The conference program included  sessions on Federal Government programs, advances in  biometric technologies and standards, and Biometrics Identity  and Security (BIdS) research. NIST’s session highlighted  achievements and ongoing biometric research, testing, and  standards projects. Over 140 speakers participated in the  program.

CPS are  hybrid networked cyber and  engineered physical elements co-designed to create adaptive  and predictive systems that respond in real-time to enhance  performance with varying degrees of human interaction, and  are commonly used in the nation’s critical infrastructure.  Such systems control the electrical grid, provide clean water,  produce chemicals, and underlie transportation systems. CPS  capabilities continue to grow as a result of technological  advances, enabling future engines of growth, such as advanced  manufacturing, and advancements in safety initiatives, such as  autonomous vehicles.  Cybersecurity is an important crosscutting discipline that is  critical to safeguarding CPS and supporting communications  and information infrastructure. CPS presents unique challenges,  including the need for real-time response in support of  extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability. Despite  the ubiquity and criticality of CPS, additional thought is required  regarding the design of secure CPS. As a result, there have been  numerous successful attacks targeting CPS for the control of  critical infrastructure (e.g., Stuxnet, Duqu, Flame, Gauss).  In April 2013, CSD and the Cyber Security Research Alliance  (CSRA) co-hosted a 2-day workshop to explore emerging  research needs for cybersecurity in CPS with the diverse  cyber-physical community at large.  The workshop brought  together engineering and IT experts who have dealt with  security issues related to CPS. Representatives from industry,  academia, and government engaged in interactive discussions  during the workshop in the areas of supply chain, assurance,  threat information, identifying existing tools and practices to  secure CPS, security in acquisition and implementation, and  trustworthy operations. Attendees were invited to participate  in break-out sessions where the discussion topics were briefly  framed, allowing the attendees to explore the discussion topics  and to share their experiences with integrating security into  existing organizations (e.g., lessons learned and examples).  CSD, in conjunction with ITL’s Advanced Network  Technologies division, Information Access division, and NIST’s  Engineering Laboratory, collaborated to develop an initial NIST  notional reference architecture for CPS.  This notional reference  architecture was designed at such a level of abstraction that  it can be applied across the breadth of the CPS, yet provides  modularization and context for integration.  The notional  CPS reference architecture was driven from a community  need to provide a common lexicon and taxonomy, a common  architectural vision to help facilitate interoperability between  elements and systems, and promotes communication across  the breadth of CPS stakeholders.  CSD, in conjunction with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory, will  finalize the revision of SP 800-82 in FY 2014. CSD will continue  to participate in the International Society of Automation (ISA)  99 Committee, which develops and establishes standards,  recommended practices, technical reports, and related  information that define procedures for implementing  electronically secure industrial automation and control systems  and security practices, and for assessing electronic security  performance.  Leveraging the initial NIST notional reference  architecture as a starting point to address the lack of an  industry-wide consensus definition, reference architecture,  and taxonomy for CPS, CSD will work in collaboration with  NIST’s Engineering Laboratory and ITL’s Software and Systems  division, and Advanced Networking Technologies division to  lead a public-private working group of government, academia,  and industry stakeholders.  The working group will consist of 5  technical subgroups: 1) Definitions and Taxonomy, 2) Reference  Architecture, 3) Use Cases, 4) Cybersecurity and Privacy, and 5)  Timing.  CSD will lead the Cybersecurity and Privacy subgroup  focused on identifying strategies for cybersecurity and privacy  in CPS, and work collaboratively with the other subgroups to  ensure that cybersecurity is included as a design principle in  development.

CSD remained committed to the value of communicating its  R&D efforts to other federal colleagues and identifying the  opportunities to support R&D efforts throughout the Federal  Government.  In FY 2013, the CSIA Interagency Working Group (IWG) monthly  meetings provided an opportunity to learn and share about  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:tbrewer@nist.gov mailto:suzanne.lightman@nist.gov mailto:victoria.yan@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201320  ongoing research related to the themes and thrusts expressed  in the Strategic Plan for the Federal Cybersecurity Research and  Development. CSD briefed the working group regarding efforts  on Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity,” under which NIST has been directed to work  with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework for reducing  cyber risks to critical infrastructure.  CSD also described  work on the Advanced Network Technologies division’s High  Assurance Domain project, which exists to foster development  and deployment of new network security technologies to  increase trust in online communications.  CSD is also a regular participant in the coordination  activities of the federal Special Cyber Operations Research and  Engineering (SCORE) Committee.  SCORE enables technology  transfer through the sharing of NIST cybersecurity expertise  and output.

HAVA established the Election Assistance Commission  (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines Development Committee  (TGDC), chaired by the Director of NIST. HAVA directs NIST to  provide technical support to the EAC and TGDC in efforts related  to human factors, security, and laboratory accreditation. As part  of NIST’s efforts, CSD supports the activities of the EAC related  to voting equipment security.  In the past year, NIST supported the EAC by developing  responses to public comments on the Voluntary Voting System  Guidelines (VVSG) 1.1. The security guidelines were updated  in FY 2012 to improve the auditability of voting systems, to  provide greater software integrity protections, to expand and  improve access control requirements, and to help ensure  cryptographic security mechanisms are implemented properly.  In addition, CSD supported the efforts of the EAC and Federal  Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) of DoD to improve the voting  process for citizens under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens  Voting Act (UOCAVA) by leveraging electronic technologies. The  team worked with the TDCG’s UOCAVA Working Group to develop  a risk analysis on technologies used in current UOCAVA voting  processes, including vote-by-mail, online voter registration,  electronic ballot delivery, and online ballot marking.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to assist the EAC in developing  responses to public comments and providing updates to VVSG  1.1. Additionally, CSD will continue to support efforts for the  EAC and FVAP to improve the voting process for UOCAVA voters.  CSD will continue security research efforts to support future  standards development efforts, particularly in the areas of risks  to voting systems and innovative voting system architectures.  http://vote.nist.gov  Contacts:  Mr. Andrew Regenscheid Mr. Joshua Franklin  (301) 975-5155  (301) 975-8463  andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov  joshua.franklin@nist.gov  Health Information Technology Security  Health information technology (HIT) enables better patient  care through secure use and sharing of health information. It  leads to improvements in healthcare quality, reduced medical  errors, increased efficiencies in care delivery and administration,  and improved population  health. Central to reaching  these goals is the assurance  of the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of health  information. CSD works  with government, industry,  academia, and others to  provide security tools, technologies, and methodologies that  provide for the security and privacy of health information.  NIST continued its HIT security outreach efforts in FY 2013.  NIST and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (DHHS)  Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cohosted the sixth annual HIPAA  Security Rule conference, “Safeguarding Health Information:  Building Assurance through HIPAA Security,” in May 2013 at  mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov mailto:ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov http://vote.nist.gov mailto:andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov mailto:joshua.franklin@nist.gov  21  the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in  Washington, D.C. The conference offered important sessions  that focused on broad topics of interest to the healthcare  and health IT security community. Over 600 in-person and  virtual attendees from federal, state, and local governments,  academia, HIPAA-covered entities and business associates,  industry groups, and vendors heard from, and interacted with,  healthcare, security, and privacy experts on technologies and  methodologies for safeguarding health information and for  implementing the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.  Presentations covered a variety of current topics including:  � Updates on the OCR privacy, security, and breach  notification audit program  � Patient and provider identity management, HIPAA  requirements in cloud and mobile environments  � HIPAA rule changes affecting breach notification and  HIPAA security  � Cybersecurity Framework for improving critical  infrastructure cybersecurity  � Health IT activities at the National Cybersecurity Center  of Excellence  � Methods for managing insider threat  � Tools available to manage security settings on end-user  devices  The keynote address was delivered by Eric Dishman, Fellow  and General Manager of the Health Strategy & Solutions Group  at Intel.  In FY 2014, NIST plans to issue a  draft revision to Special Publication  (SP) 800-66, An Introductory  Resource Guide for Implementing  the HIPAA Security Rule. As part of  its continued outreach efforts, NIST  also plans to co-host the seventh  annual Safeguarding Health  Information conference with OCR.  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security/  Contact:  Mr. Kevin Stine  (301) 975-4483  kevin.stine@nist.gov  Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) for  Information and Communications Technology  (ICT)  Federal agency information systems are increasingly at risk  of both intentional and unintentional supply chain compromise.  The management of ICT supply chain risk includes ensuring the  integrity, security, and resilience of the supply chain and the  products and services it delivers (Figure 4). Today’s ICT supply  chains have increased complexity, diversity, and scale. Federal  Government information systems have rapidly expanded in  terms of capability and number, with an increased reliance on  outsourcing and commercially available products. These trends  have caused federal departments and agencies to have a lack  of visibility and understanding of how acquired technology is  developed, integrated, and deployed. Supply chain risks also  affect the processes, procedures, and practices used to assure  the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of products and  services. This lack of visibility and understanding, in turn,  has decreased federal departments’ and agencies’ control  regarding decisions affecting the inherited supply chain risks  and the ability to manage those risks.  Figure 4: The Four Elements of ICT SCRM  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/security mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201322  Figure 5: ICT Supply Chain Risk  The ICT SCRM project seeks to provide federal agencies with  a toolkit of standardized, repeatable, and practical resources  to strategically manage supply chain risk throughout the entire  lifecycle of systems, products, and services.  In October 2012, NIST held a workshop with industry,  academic, and government stakeholders to discuss:  � The fundamental underpinnings of ICT SCRM (terms,  definitions, characterizations)  � Current and needed commercially reasonable ICT  SCRM-related standards and practices (need, scope, and  development approach)  � Current and needed ICT SCRM tools, technology, and  techniques useful in securing the ICT supply chain  � Current and needed research and resources  NIST used input from the workshop and additional stakeholder  forums to begin developing an initial public draft of NIST SP  800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal  Information Systems and Organizations, which is scheduled to  be finalized in FY 2014.  This document provides guidance to  federal departments and agencies on identifying, assessing,  and mitigating ICT supply chain risks at all levels in their  organizations and utilizes and builds on existing guidance in  the unified information security framework.  Additionally in FY 2013, a grant was awarded to the University  of Maryland’s Supply Chain Management Center to support the  development and hosting of a web application with the following  capabilities:  � Enterprise Risk Assessments: A three-tier risk analysis  system based on the ICT SCRM Community Framework  Reference Architecture – A Strategic Assessment/  Organizational Readiness, Best Practices and Standards,  and a composite network vulnerability map of physical  and cyber hubs and nodes, with risk ratings  � Collaboration/Crowdsourcing Portal: User-documented  ICT SCRM use/abuse cases and real-time polling about  vulnerabilities and responses  � ICT SCRM Initiatives: A dynamic matrix of current  industry and public sector ICT SCRM best practices,  standards, and policy reform initiatives that can be  updated by appropriate individuals from across industry,  academia, and government  � ICT SCRM Digital Library: An online repository of policy  and academic documents related to ICT SCRM  In FY 2014, CSD will continue its work to develop and  publish draft NIST SP 800-161. It will research and develop  tools and guidance to help agencies more effectively manage  their ICT supply chain risk. Additionally, NIST will continue to  co-chair Working Group 2 of the White House’s Comprehensive  National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) 11, Develop a Multi- Pronged Approach for Global Supply Chain Risk Management,  and participate in national and international standards  activities related to supply chain risk management. Feedback  from organizations implementing ICT SCRM programs will  be evaluated, and best practices will be accumulated. NIST  will continue to engage stakeholders to identify needs and  opportunities for providing additional guidance regarding  identifying and implementing supply chain protections.  http://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/  ICT SCRM Team email: scrm-nist@nist.gov  Contacts:  Mr. Jon Boyens Ms. Celia Paulsen  Project Lead (301) 975-5549  (301) 975-5981 celia.paulsen@nist.gov  jon.boyens@nist.gov  http://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/ mailto:scrm-nist@nist.gov mailto:celia.paulsen@nist.gov mailto:jon.boyens@nist.gov  23  Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network  (NPSBN) Security  In February 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax  Relief and Job Creation Act. One portion of this legislation calls  for the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable public  safety broadband network based on Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be deployed and operated by  the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet). The planned  National Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) will “create  a much needed nationwide interoperable broadband network  that will help police, firefighters, emergency medical service  professionals and other public safety  officials stay safe and do their jobs.”  (h t tp : / /www.nt ia .doc .gov/ca tegor y / public-safety). NIST is directed to  establish a list of certified devices and  required components for interacting with  the nationwide network by public safety  officials, vendors, and other interested  parties. NIST is directed to conduct  research and development that supports  the acceleration and advancement of the  nationwide network.  In FY 2013, CSD supported the joint National Telecommuni-  cations and Information Administration (NTIA) and NIST  Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) program  (http://www.pscr.gov) efforts by developing and establishing  security-related activities to support the proposed NPSBN. CSD  presented details of the PSCR security-related activities at  PSRC’s Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference  in June 2013.  CSD provided comments and contributed text for the security- related aspects of the National Public Safety Telecommunications  Council (NPSTC) Public Safety Broadband High-Level Launch  Requirements, published in December 2012, that describe, in  increasing levels of detail, the technical requirements of the  NPSBN infrastructure, equipment, and communications.  CSD began participating in the standards development  process for LTE technology within the 3rd Generation Partnership  Project (3GPP) supporting public safety’s security requirements  related to Proximity Services (ProSe) and Group Communication  System Enablers (GCSE). In addition, CSD broadened its scope  within the IETF to include efforts related to public safety.  In FY 2014, CSD will continue supporting NPSTC’s efforts  related to NPSBN and to representing public safety in  international standardization efforts, such as IETF and 3GPP.  CSD will work to incorporate security capabilities into the  PSCR’s Public Safety Broadband Demonstration Network  located in Boulder, conduct research into identity management  technologies for mobile devices that can support the NPSBN,  and investigate ways to enhance the security of mobile  applications used by the public safety community. CSD  will continue to engage the public safety communications  community by participating in events such as PSRC’s Annual  Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Conference.

Key to the  successful deployment of the smart grid infrastructure is  the development of the cybersecurity strategy that includes  cybersecurity as a design consideration for new and emerging  systems, and an approach to adding cybersecurity into  existing systems. The electric grid is critical to the economic  and physical well-being of the nation, and emerging cyber  threats targeting power systems highlight the need to integrate  advanced security to protect critical assets.  In January 2013, the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP)  became a membership-supported organization. The SGIP  Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed the Smart  Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC).  All three of these groups  have been led by a NIST representative since their respective  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Im ag  e  So  ur ce  :  ht  tp ://  ww w.  ps cr.  go v/i  nd ex  .p hp  http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public http://www.pscr.gov mailto:sheila.frankel@nist.gov mailto:nelson.hastings@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201324  creations, originating with the Cybersecurity Coordination  Task Group (CSCTG), created by NIST in support of the Energy  Independence and Security Act of 2007. The SGIP SGCC includes  additional leadership by a management team, comprised of  three volunteer vice-chairs representing the Department of  Energy (DOE), an electric utility, and a smart grid vendor, and a  volunteer secretariat.  During the past year, members of the CSWG/SGCC worked to  revise NISTIR 7628, Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity, to  address changes in technologies and implementations since the  publication’s original release.  The revision updates and expands the  development strategy, cryptography and key management, privacy,  vulnerability classes, research and development topics, standards  review, and key power system use cases to reflect changes in the  smart grid environment since 2010.  The final version is expected to  be posted in FY 2014.  In addition to the revision of NISTIR 7628, the CSWG/ SGCC has focused on specific topics such as cybersecurity  risk management, security architecture, security testing and  certification, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) security,  the development of a User’s Guide for NISTIR 7628, and cloud  computing and privacy for the smart grid.  Work in these areas  is completed through SGCC subgroups, which are created and  disbanded in order to meet present needs.  The SGCC currently  consist of the following subgroups:  � The Architecture subgroup continues to refine the  smart grid cybersecurity architecture in coordination  with the SGIP Smart Grid Architecture Committee on the  European Union architecture harmonization effort.  � The Cloud Computing subgroup is addressing  the unique cybersecurity issues of using and managing  smart grid applications that utilize the cloud.  � The High-Level Requirements subgroup  maintains the high-level security requirements in NISTIR  7628 and develops analyses between NISTIR 7628 and  other documents, standards, and guidelines.  � The NISTIR 7628 User’s Guide subgroup is  developing a User’s Guide for utilities and other entities  involved in implementing smart grid systems can use  to apply the NISTIR 7628; including the identification,  risk assessment and selection of the applicable security  requirements needed to secure their smart grid systems.  � The Privacy subgroup identifies and describes  privacy risks and concerns within developed or emerging  interoperability standards for the smart grid, and then  determines the most appropriate and feasible practices  for mitigating the risks.  � The Standards subgroup assesses cybersecurity  requirements associated with SGIP-identified smart grid  standards and other documents for the SGIP Catalog of  Standards (CoS). The subgroup has reviewed over 75  documents to date.  An example of a SGCC deliverable in 2013 is the analysis  of cybersecurity regulations relevant to electricity subsector  stakeholders and of NIST security guidance.  The analysis  identifies the relationship, similarities, and differences among  NISTIR 7628, SP 800-53, and the draft North American Electric  Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection  Standards (CIP) v5, recognizing that each document has a  different scope and audience.  The SGCC also supports the SGIP Catalog of Standards (CoS),  a compendium of standards, practices, guidelines and other  technical documents considered relevant for the development  of a robust, secure, and interoperable smart grid.  Through the  ongoing efforts of the SGCC, these documents are reviewed for  cybersecurity, and recommendations are made for how to include  cybersecurity in future revisions and in the implementation  of the standards.  CSD supports the SGCC in assessing the  security of cryptographic methods used in these standards,  practices, guidelines, and other technical documents.  In many  cases, the standards bodies have taken the results of the  reviews and modified the standards or documents to address  our recommendations. The SGCC has worked closely with some  of the standards bodies to ensure that the recommendations  are interpreted correctly and that the mitigation strategies  selected meet the intent of the NISTIR 7628 high-level  security requirements. The result is cybersecurity “baked-in”  to the standards rather than “bolted-on” after the standard is  implemented.  In FY 2014, CSD will continue to support the SGCC in the  evaluation of the cryptographic methods used standards,  practices, guidelines, and other technical documents for  inclusion in the SGIP CoS.  Future activities include working with the SGIP Committees,  Domain Expert Working Groups, and Priority Action Plans to  integrate cybersecurity into their work efforts. The SGCC will  establish a new subgroup to produce a cybersecurity risk  25  management process case study to accompany the Department  of Energy Risk Management Process guideline. Members of  the committee will produce white papers on security defense  in depth and breadth, unique cloud computing considerations  for the smart grid, as well as a User’s Guide for NISTIR 7628.  Additionally, the SGIP SCCC will continue to collaborate with  industry, academia, other working groups, and government  agencies to address the cybersecurity needs for the smart grid.  In addition to the SGIP SGCC activities, CSD will also  coordinate with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory (EL) and Smart  Grid Program Office on the development of a Cybersecurity  Smart Grid Test Lab, part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility  now under construction. CSD will also collaborate with ITL’s  Software and Systems Division on cybersecurity research in  relation to the IEEE 1588, Precision Time Protocol, a standard  on time synchronization that is used for the electric grid and  other special-purpose industrial automation and measurement  networks.  http://www.sgip.org  Contacts:  Ms. Vicky Yan Pillitteri Ms. Tanya Brewer  (301) 975-8542 (301) 975-4534  victoria.yan@nist.gov tbrewer@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  qdang@nist.gov  Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, Education,  and Outreach  ªNational Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE)  NIST has served as the lead for the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) since 2010. NICE is responsive  to President Obama’s declaration that the “cyber threat is one  of the most serious economic and national security challenges  we face as a nation” and “America’s economic prosperity in the  21st century will depend on cybersecurity.”  The goal of NICE is to enhance the overall cybersecurity  posture of the United States by accelerating the availability of  educational and training resources designed to improve the  cyber behavior, skills, and knowledge of every segment of the  population, enabling a safer cyberspace for all. NICE addresses  this challenging goal by:  � Raising national awareness about risks in cyberspace  � Broadening the pool of individuals prepared to enter the  cybersecurity workforce  � Cultivating a globally competitive cybersecurity  workforce  This initiative comprises four component areas:  � National Cybersecurity Awareness  � Formal Cybersecurity Education  � Cybersecurity Workforce Structure  � Cybersecurity Workforce Training and Professional  Development  CSD is home to the NIST NICE Leadership Team (NNLT) that  focuses on the following activities:  � Developing planning documents and building consensus  on the strategy and implementation activities of NICE  � Facilitating cross-functional cooperation among NICE  component lead agencies  � Fostering communication between the component  lead agencies by coordinating meetings, facilitating  discussions, and disseminating information  � Promoting the initiative and its efforts by representing  NICE and speaking at cybersecurity events nationwide  � Planning and hosting an annual workshop to promote  and support the evolving issues in cybersecurity  education  � Coordinating with other federal initiatives and efforts  related to NICE  � Maintaining and updating the NICE website  In FY 2013, NIST stewarded the National Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework (NCWF), developed within NICE’s  Cybersecurity Workforce Training and Professional  Development Component, through government-wide review.  NIST also planned, organized and hosted the fourth annual NICE  Workshop, “Navigating the National Cybersecurity Education  Interstate Highway,” from September 17-19, 2013.  The  workshop highlighted cybersecurity awareness, education,  and training programs that can be adopted, copied,  used, or  built-on by small businesses, educational institutions, industry,  and government at the state, local, tribal and federal levels to  advance the strategic goals of NICE.  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://www.sgip.org mailto:victoria.yan@nist.gov mailto:tbrewer@nist.gov mailto:qdang@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201326  The NNLT attended more than 100 events, symposia, forums,  competitions, educational outreach meetings, and workshops  to promote the activities within NICE. The NNLT worked with  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the OPM Cross- Agency Priority Goal: “Closing Skills Gap” for IT/Cybersecurity  and on the OPM Special Cybersecurity Workforce Project focused  on reducing cybersecurity workforce skills gaps.  The project  will allow agencies to identify and address their needs for  cybersecurity skill sets to meet their missions.  In accomplishing  this project, agencies will also be updating their cybersecurity  positions with codes that revise the definitions of and taxonomy  used for cybersecurity work. In FY 2013, the NNLT supported  DHS in the launch of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Careers and Studies (NICCS), (http://niccs.us-cert.gov), an  online resource for cybersecurity career, education, and training  information.  NICCS leverages efforts of government, industry,  and academia to provide a comprehensive, single resource to  address the nation’s cybersecurity knowledge needs.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to promote the coordination  of existing and future cybersecurity education, training, and  awareness activities while planning the transition of NICE  leadership. NIST will also identify opportunities to extend and  integrate NICE activities to raise cybersecurity awareness in the  context of other sectors, and promote the NCWF as a resource  to be used to identify workforce gaps, lead bi-weekly NICE  component meetings, and continue to conduct broad outreach  on the NICE program.  http://www.nist.gov/nice/  Contacts:  Dr. Ernest McDuffie Mr. Bill Newhouse  NICE Project Lead NICE Program Lead  (301) 975-8897 (301) 975-2869  ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov william.newhouse@nist.gov  ª Computer Security Division Publications  During FY 2013, CSD continued its efforts to improve  the quality of information about its publications on various  NIST websites. CSD also explored new ways to make those  publications available to CSD’s customers, who access CSD’s  technical security publications in various ways: (1) directly from  the CSRC website, (2) through the NIST Publications Portal, via  Internet search or (3) direct links from digital content, or (4)  from external information providers. By the end of FY 2013, CSD  had more than 270 current publications in the NIST technical  series (FIPS, Special Publications (SPs) and NISTIRs).  Providing accurate metadata about publications improves  users’ abilities to locate the information they are seeking. In FY  2013, CSD cleaned up the NIST Publications Portal records and  PDF metadata for all of its NIST technical series publications  and for more than 100 journal articles and conference papers  co-authored by CSD staff in recent years. By improving  the metadata—such as title, authors, report numbers and  keywords—within the PDFs themselves, Internet searches  provide more informative results and make NIST’s security  publications easier to find. CSD continues to apply those  consistent metadata practices to all new publications.  Additionally, CSD expanded the dissemination of its  publications to the Association for Computing Machinery  (ACM) Digital Library (DL). ACM DL now has a “collection”  of NIST Computer Security Publications, which includes SP  800-series publications. CSD initiated an internal project to  test the feasibility of creating electronic book (e-book) editions  of its FIPS, SPs and NISTIRs, to supplement the PDF editions  currently available on CSRC. The aim is to provide a wider range  of options for CSD customers to view and use CSD’s technical  publications. The pilot project uses the EPUB file format, an open  standard for e-books from the International Digital Publication  Forum (IDPF). CSD intends to begin posting EPUB versions of  selected publications in FY 2014, which will especially benefit  users of mobile devices.  http://niccs.us-cert.gov http://www.nist.gov/nice mailto:ernest.mcduffie@nist.gov mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov  27  In FY 2014, CSD intends to explore more ways to improve  the consistency of its publications and associated metadata,  enhance users’ ability to browse and search publications on  CSRC, make more e-book editions available, and expand  publication availability on external sites.  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  Contact:  Mr. Jim Foti  (301) 975-8018  jfoti@nist.gov  ª Computer Security Resource Center  (CSRC)  The Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), CSD’s  website, is one of the most visited websites at NIST.

The Forum, which serves  more than 1,100 members, strives to provide an ongoing  opportunity for managers of federal information security  programs to exchange information security materials in a timely  manner, build upon the experiences of other programs, and  reduce possible duplication of effort. It provides a mechanism  for NIST to share information directly with federal agency  information security program managers in fulfillment of NIST’s  leadership mandate under FISMA. It assists NIST in establishing  and maintaining relationships with other individuals or  organizations that are actively addressing information security  issues within the Federal Government. NIST serves as the  Secretariat of the Forum, providing necessary administrative  and logistical support. Kevin Stine serves as the Chairperson.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is only open to Federal  Government employees who participate in the management of  their organization’s information system security program. There  are no membership dues. The Forum also holds bimonthly  meetings and an annual 2-day conference to discuss current  issues and developments of interest to those responsible for  protecting sensitive (unclassified) federal systems. Participation  in Forum meetings is open to Federal Government employees,  and their designated support contractors, who participate in  the management of their organization’s information security  program.  Topics of discussion at Forum meetings in FY 2013 included  briefings from various federal agencies on Preparing for  and Responding to Certification Authority Compromise and  Fraudulent Certificate Issuance; Software Assurance: Enabling  Security throughout the Software Development Lifecycle; Use  of Cybersecurity Function Code; Census Risk Management  Program Implementation; National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE); demonstration of Trusted Geolocation in  the Cloud; and Policy Machine: Enabling an Enterprise-wide,  Data Centric Computing Environment.  This year’s annual 2-day offsite meeting featured updates on  the computer security activities of the Government Accountability  Office (GAO), General Services Administration (GSA), Bureau of  the Fiscal Service, and NIST.  Recent administration guidance  directing federal agencies to reduce travel and conference  budgets significantly reduced attendance. Technical sessions  included briefings on evolving cybersecurity strategies, IT  security concerns during a consolidation (merger), supply chain  risk management activities, the National Vulnerability Database  (NVD), SP 800-53 Revision 4, continuous monitoring, industrial  control systems security, and EO 13636.  On August 8, 2013, a Cybersecurity and Risk Management  Training Workshop was held at the Department of Commerce  with over 500 registrants.  Attendees gained a greater  understanding of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and  its practical application.  Dr. Ron Ross discussed SP 800-53  Revision 4 and the fundamentals of continuous monitoring. Two  afternoon panels discussed case studies regarding RMF and  “ongoing authorization.”  The Forum plays a valuable role in helping NIST and other  federal agencies to develop and maintain a strong, proactive  stance in the identification and resolution of new strategic  and tactical IT security issues as they emerge. The number  of members on the email list has grown steadily and provides  a valuable resource for federal security program managers.

FISSEA  strives to elevate the general level of information systems  security knowledge for the Federal Government and the federal  workforce. It also seeks to assist the professional development  of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information systems security  professionals, professional trainers and educators, and  managers responsible for information systems security training  programs in federal agencies, as well as contractors of these  agencies and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security training  and education. There are no membership fees to join FISSEA; all  that is required is a willingness to share products, information,  and experiences. A working group meets monthly to administer  business activities  FISSEA maintains a website, a mailing list, and participates  in a social networking site as a means of communication for its  members. NIST assists FISSEA with its operations by providing  staff support for several of its activities and by being FISSEA’s  host agency.  FISSEA membership in 2013 spanned federal agencies,  industry, military, contractors, state governments, academia, the  press, and foreign organizations to reach over 1,395 members  in a total of ten countries. The 700 federal agency members  represent 89 agencies from the executive and legislative  branches of government.  The 26th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March 19-21,  2013, at NIST. Approximately 140 information systems security  professionals and trainers attended from federal agencies,  academia, as well as industry representatives from firms that  support federal information systems and security programs.  Recent government sequestration efforts prevented some from  receiving permission to attend, which had a noticeable effect  on attendance. NIST’s Pat Toth and Peggy Himes, as well as  Gretchen Morris, Susan Hansche, and other members of the  FISSEA Technical Working Group, were integral to the effort to  support the conference.  This year’s theme was, “Making Connections in Cybersecurity  and Information Security Education,” to solicit presentations  that reflect current projects, trends, and initiatives that provide  for future solutions in federal security programs. Attendees  gained new techniques for developing/conducting training,  cost-effective practices, workforce development, free resources  and contacts, as well as an update on NICE activities.  NIST ITL Computer Security Division Deputy Chief, Matthew  Scholl, welcomed attendees. Keynote presentations were  given by John J. Suess, VP of IT & CIO, University of Maryland,  Baltimore County; Bryant Tow, Vice President, InfraGard National  Members Alliance; and Lamont Hames, Chief Development  Officer, UNCF Special Programs Corporation. Mr. Hames  presented on Expanding the Role of Minorities in Cyber Security.  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, DOS, DOE, NSA and the  Library of Congress as well as private industry and academia.  Conference attendees had the opportunity to visit vendors,  receive a government best practice poster, and attend a  demonstration session, which provided an opportunity for  agencies to share about their specific awareness and training  programs.  Traditional FISSEA conference events included announcing  the winners of FISSEA contests and awarding prize drawings.  Susan Hansche, Avaya Gov/U.S. Department of State, presented  the FISSEA Educator of the Year plaque to Mr. J. Paul Wahnish,  Career Technical Education Foundation, Inc., for his work in  preparing the future workforce. The FISSEA Security Awareness,  Training & Education Contest includes five categories from  one of FISSEA’s three key areas of Awareness, Training, and  Education.  The winner is selected from each category and  awarded a certificate. The categories include: (1) awareness  poster, (2) motivational item (e.g., pens, stress relief items,  t-shirts), (3) awareness website, (4) awareness newsletter, and  (5) role-based training & education.  The winners of the 2013 FISSEA Awareness, Training, and  Education Contest are:  � Poster Winner: Alexis Benjamin – Department of State,  Office of Computer Security  � Website Winner: Sara Fitzgerald and Kimberly Conway –  Food & Drug Administration (FDA)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/forum mailto:kevin.stine@nist.gov mailto:peggy.himes@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201330  � Motivational Item Winner: Jennie Blizzard, Shannon  Jones, and Shirley Clement – Federal Reserve Bank  � Newsletter Winner: Deborah Coleman – Department of  Education, Office of the Chief Information Officer  � Role-Based Training Winner: DISA, SAIC, and Carney, Inc.

During Pecha Kucha (Lightning Round) speakers had 6 minutes  40 seconds to present a limited number of slides (20 slides at  most), and only 20 seconds per slide. The presentation method  is challenging for the speaker and enjoyable for audience  members. There were four participants and their fast-paced  talks proved to be lively and entertaining.  Attendee networking is a valuable benefit of attending  the FISSEA conference. The conference continues to be a  valuable forum in which individuals from government, industry,  and academia who are involved with information systems/ cybersecurity workforce development (awareness, training,  education, certification, and professionalization) learn of  ongoing and planned training and education programs and  initiatives.  It provides NIST the opportunity to provide assistance  to departments and agencies as they work to meet their FISMA  responsibilities.  The 2014 FISSEA conference is planned for March 18-20,  2014, at NIST.  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea  fisseamembership@nist.gov  Contacts:  Ms. Patricia Toth Ms. Peggy Himes  (301) 975-5140 (301) 975-2489  patricia.toth@nist.gov peggy.himes@nist.gov  ª Information Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (ISPAB)  The ISPAB was originally created by the Computer Security  Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) as the Computer System Security  and Privacy Advisory Board, and amended by Public Law  107-347, The E-Government Act of 2002, Title III, The Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.  The  statutory objectives of the Board include identifying emerging  managerial, technical, administrative, and physical safeguard  issues relative to information security and privacy.  In drafting the Computer Security Act of 1987, which  created this Advisory Board, the Congress saw a need for an  independent, non-federally dominated group of computer  security experts to offer its advice to senior government officials  on emerging computer security areas.  The Board members,  with their individual and collective skills, responsibilities, and  experiences fulfill this requirement.  No other similar group of  experts meets regularly to review information security issues  involved in unclassified Federal Government computer systems  and networks.  Also, Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002  reaffirmed the need for this Board by giving it additional  responsibilities.  The ISPAB’s statutory purpose is to advise the Secretary of  Commerce, the Director of the NIST, and the Director of the  OMB on information security and privacy related issues. Title III  of the E-Government Act of 2002 also mandated the Board to  thoroughly review all of the proposed information technology  standards and guidelines developed under Section 20 of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C.  278g-3) as amended.  The charter (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/ documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf) defines that the  Board’s membership should consist of 12 members and  a Chairperson. The Secretary of Commerce appoints the  Chairperson, and the Board members are selected for their  preeminence in the information technology industry or related  disciplines. The term of office for each board member is four  years.  The Board is comprised of members from a broad range of  interested parties.  There are three main categories and each  category has four members.  Category 1 includes members  from outside the Federal Government eminent in the information  technology industry, at least one of whom is representative of  small or medium-sized companies in such industries.  Category 2  also includes members from outside the Federal Government and  not employed by or representative of a producer of information  but are eminent in the field of information technology, or related  disciplines.  Category 3 includes experienced information  system managers from the Federal Government, including  http://csrc.nist.gov/fissea mailto:fisseamembership@nist.gov mailto:patricia.toth@nist.gov mailto:peggy.himes@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/ispab_charter-2012-2014.pdf  31  those with experience in information security and privacy,  at least one of whom should be from the National Security  Agency.  Federal members bring a detailed understanding of  the federal processing environment; industry brings concerns  and experiences regarding product development and market  formation, while private computer security experts are able to  bring their experiences of commercial cost-effective security  measures into Board discussion.  In October 2012, Matt Thomlinson agreed to assume the  responsibilities of Chairperson from Dan Chenok.  The Board  expressed its gratitude to Dan Chenok for his leadership and  contributions to ISPAB both as a member and Chair since 2005.  Presently, ISPAB has nine members and a Chairperson.  The  ISPAB Board members are:  � Matthew Thomlinson, (Chair), Microsoft  � Daniel Chenok (Chair – Retired from the Board in October  2012), IBM Center for The Business of Government  � Julie Boughn, Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Innovation, Department of Human Health and Services,  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (DHHS/CMS)  � Christopher Boyer, AT&T  � John Centafont, National Security Agency (NSA)  � Kevin Fu, The University of Michigan  � Gregory Garcia, Garcia Cyber Partners  � Brian Gouker, NSA - U.S. Army War College  � Toby Levin, Retired  � Edward Roback, U.S. Department of Treasury  � Phyllis Schneck, (Retired from the Board in September  2013), McAfee, Inc.  � Gale Stone, Social Security Administration  � Peter Weinberger, Google, Inc.

The President signed the EO and also approved the  presidential directive to improve the security and resilience of  critical infrastructure in both the cyber and physical realms.  Dr. Patrick Gallagher, Under Secretary of Commerce for  Standards and Technology and NIST Director, provided the  opening remarks on the EO.  A group of distinguished panelists  presented more information:  � Andy Ozment, Senior Director of Cybersecurity, Executive  Office of the President  � Samara Moore, Cyber Director for Critical Infrastructure,  Executive Office of the President  � Adam Sedgewick, Senior Information Technology Policy  Advisor, National Institute of Standards and Technology  � Bruce McConnell, Senior Counselor for Cybersecurity,  Department of Homeland Security  � Ari Schwartz, Internet Policy Advisor, National Institute of  Standards and Technology  � Jenny Menna, Director, Stakeholder Engagement and  Cyber Infrastructure Resilience Division, Department of  Homeland Security  ISPAB meeting agendas are established based on the Board’s  list of emerging issues developed from previous meetings. The  meeting agenda topics also include non-work list items that  are of immediate security and privacy concerns to the Board.  During FY 2013, the Board provided guidance on many issues  relating to security and privacy such as:  � Security and Privacy Controls  � Digital and Mobile Security  � FISMA as privacy appendix on SP 800-53, metrics,  FISMA review, reduction of reporting  � A130 Appendix A  � GAO Reports: Security and Privacy  � Medical Device Security  � Cybersecurity – Education, Training, Awareness  � Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals  � Cloud Computing and Security Challenges  � Exploring the Future of Privacy for Federal IT  � IT System Performance  � Supply Chain and Risk Management  � SEC Security Breach Notification  The presenters at every Board meeting were leaders and  experts from private industries, academia, federal agency CIOs,  IGs and CISOs.

A computer  failure or system breach  could jeopardize the  company’s reputation and may result in significant damage  and recovery cost or going out of business. The small business  owner who recognizes the threat of computer crime and takes  steps to deter inappropriate activities is less likely to become  a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports that  over 27 million U.S. companies - more than 99 percent of all  U.S. businesses - are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer (http:// www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12.pdf). While the  threats to individual SMBs may not be significantly different  from those facing larger organizations, a SMB frequently has  fewer resources available to protect systems, detect attacks,  or respond to security issues. A vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the nation’s  information infrastructure and economic base.  To help address information security risk, these businesses  require assistance with identification of security mechanisms  and with practical, cost-effective training. Training helps SMB’s  use their limited resources most effectively to address relevant  and serious threats. In response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) co-sponsor a series  of cyber security training workshops for small businesses.  These workshops provide an overview of cyber security  threats, vulnerabilities, and corresponding protective tools and  techniques, with a special emphasis on information that small  business personnel can apply directly.  In FY 2013, the SMB outreach team provided 15 workshops  in 15 cities: Toledo, Ohio; Burlington, Vermont; Portland, Maine;  Providence, Rhode Island; Lexington, Kentucky; Louisville,  Kentucky; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit,  Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport,  Louisiana; Alexandria, Louisiana; Ruston, Louisiana; and  Monroe, Louisiana.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, CSD is planning  locations for small business cyber security workshops in FY  2014.  http://sbc.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Richard Kissel  (301) 975-5017  richard.kissel@nist.gov  Cryptographic Technology  ª Cryptographic Standards Program  Hash Algorithms and the Secure Hash Algorithm  (SHA-3) Standard (Draft FIPS 202)  In response to vulnerabilities discovered in 2005 in the  NIST-approved, government hash algorithm standard, SHA-1,  NIST opened a public competition in 2007 to develop a new  cryptographic hash algorithm, SHA-3, to augment the hash  algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard.  After 64 entries, 3 rounds of the competition, and 5 years of  intensive analysis, provided mostly by the world cryptographic  community, NIST announced the selection of KeccaK as the  winning algorithm on October 2, 2012, and summarized its  decision in NISTIRs after each round.  After the competition had ended, NIST invited the winning  team to NIST in February 2013, and hosted a 2-day workshop to  discuss the KeccaK features and options for standardization as  the new SHA-3 hash standard. CSD developed a standardization  plan and shared with the KeccaK designers and subsequently  with the cryptographic community at the 2013 RSA Conference,  the 2013 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded  Systems (CHES), and at the IETF 86 and 87 Workshops. In  addition, this standardization plan was posted at the NIST hash  website for public comment.  A draft of the SHA-3 Permutation-based Hash Standard (Draft  FIPS 202) is being finalized, and NIST is preparing a Federal  Register Notice to announce this draft standard. NIST expects  to release the draft standard during FY 2014 and plans a 60-day  public comment period. After the comment period closes, NIST  will analyze the comments, make changes to the document, as  appropriate, and propose the draft standard to the Secretary  of Commerce for approval as a FIPS. In addition to publishing  FIPS 202 in FY 2014, NIST is also considering standardizing a  generic “tree hashing” mode and other KeccaK features. NIST  plans to host a workshop in FY 2014 to discuss these options.  Information about the SHA-3 competition and  the SHA-3 standardization effort is available at  http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition.

A hash algorithm processes a  message, which can be very large, and produces a condensed  representation, called a message digest. A cryptographic hash  algorithm is a fundamental component of many cryptographic  functions, such as digital signature algorithms, key derivation  functions, keyed-hash message authentication codes, and  random number generators. Cryptographic hash algorithms  are frequently used in Internet protocols and other security  applications.  FIPS 180-4 specifies seven hash algorithms: SHA-1, SHA-224,  SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.  Their security properties in different cryptographic applications  are discussed in SP 800-107, Revision 1, Recommendation for  Applications Using Approved Hash Algorithms.  CSD authored an article, “Changes in Federal Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4, Secure Hash Standard,”  which was published in the January 2013 issue of the journal  Cryptologia. The article describes the rationale behind the  standardization of the SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 hash  algorithms in FIPS 180-4 and the performance advantage of  these two hash algorithms over the SHA-224 and SHA-256 hash  algorithms. This article was written to help the adoption of the  two new hash algorithms in security protocols and applications  to improve performance.

TLS is a widely used cryptographic protocol  that provides communication security for a variety of network  applications, such as email, e-commerce, and healthcare.  The first version of SP 800-52, published in 2005, was  withdrawn in March 2013. A draft of SP 800-52 Revision 1  was issued for public review and comment in September  2013. The revision is a substantially different document than  the original and includes recommendations providing higher  levels of security, both for TLS and aspects of the Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI) that TLS relies on. New recommendations  include the support of TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2, guidance on  certificate profiles and validation methods, TLS extensions, and  support for a greater variety of cryptographic algorithms.  The final version of SP 800-52 Revision 1 will be published  in FY 2014.

For example, random numbers are  used to generate the keys needed for encryption and digital  signature applications.  In the late 1990s, a project to develop more rigorous  requirements and specifications for random number generation  (RNG) was initiated in coordination with the American National  Standards Institute’s (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee  (ASC) X9. The resulting standard (X9.82) contains four parts:  Part 1 provides general information; Part 2, which is nearing  completion, will provide requirements for entropy sources;  Part 3 provides specifications for deterministic random bit  generator (DRBG) mechanisms; and Part 4 provides guidance  on constructing random bit generators (RBGs) from entropy  sources and DRBG mechanisms.  In March 2007, NIST published SP 800-90, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random  Bit Generators, which contained the DRBG mechanisms in  Part 3 of ANS X9.82, plus an additional DRBG mechanism. This  recommendation was revised as SP 800-90A, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators, in January 2012 to include additional capabilities  identified during the development of Part 4 of ANS X9.82.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B, Recommendation for  the Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation and SP  800-90C, Recommendation for Random Bit Generator (RBG)  Constructions) are under development and are available for  public comment. SP 800-90B addresses the development  and testing of entropy sources, including descriptions of the  validation tests for NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program to validate candidate entropy sources. SP 800-90C  provides basic guidance on the construction of RBGs from  entropy sources and DRBG mechanisms.  CSD held a workshop in December 2012 to discuss the drafts  of SP 800-90B and C, after which NIST began the adjudication  of the comments received during the public comment period  and the workshop.  mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  35  In September 2013, articles from major news organizations  based on leaked classified documents raised public concern  that one of the DRBGs specified in SP 800-90A, the Dual_EC_ DRBG, could contain a backdoor. This could allow attackers to  successfully predict the secret cryptographic keys that form the  foundation for the assurances provided by security products.  Taking these concerns seriously, NIST assured the community  of its commitment to producing strong cryptographic standards,  and took immediate steps to examine and remediate the issue.  Shortly after these concerns were raised, CSD published  an ITL Bulletin that provided a high-level discussion of the  issues, reopened the SP 800-90 series of publications for  public comment, and recommended that the Dual_EC_DRBG no  longer be used, pending the resolution of the comments.  Since  that time, NIST has released a revised draft of SP 800-90A that  removes the questioned algorithm and addresses other issues  that were identified in the public comment process.  NIST  intends to finalize the revised SP800-90A publication in FY14.

The guidelines are available at http://csrc.nist. gov/publications.  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment  Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, specifies  approved methods for key establishment using Diffie-Hellman  and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV) schemes. This document was  first published in 2006 and was revised in May 2013 to provide  further clarification and additional methods for key derivation.  SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment  Schemes Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, was first  published in August 2009. It is under revision to provide further  clarification and additional methods for key derivation; these  changes are consistent with those made in SP 800-56A. The  revision of SP 800-56B will be available for public comment in  FY 2014.  SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management, Part 3:  Application-Specific Key Management Guidance, was first  published in 2009. A revision of this document has been under  development. The revision will include an additional section on  the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and the removal of the Transport  Layer Security (TLS) section, which is now being addressed in SP  800-52, Revision 1, Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration,  and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations. The  revised SP 800-57, Part 3 will be available for public comment  in FY 2014.  SP 800-130, A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key  Management Systems, was completed in August 2013 and  provides guidance on a Cryptographic Key Management System  (CKMS) framework.  SP 800-152, A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key  Management Systems (CKMS), is under development. This  document is intended to provide refinements of the framework  requirements in SP 800-130 that are appropriate for use in a  CKMS employed by the Federal Government, plus guidance on  its implementation, procurement, installation, configuration,  and operation. This document will be available for public  comment in early FY 2014.  A new publication will provide guidance on the security  strength of a cryptographic key that is used to protect data  (i.e., a data-protection key), given the manner in which the key  was generated and handled prior to its use to protect the target  data. This document, SP 800-158, Key Management: Obtaining  a Targeted Security Strength, involves a considerable amount  of new research, since it is an area that has not been fully  addressed to date. This publication will be available for public  comment in FY 2014.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/key_mgmt/  Contacts:  Ms. Elaine Barker Dr. Dustin Moody  (301) 975-2911 (301) 975-8136  elaine.barker@nist.gov dustin.moody@nist.gov  Dr. Lily Chen Mr. Ray Perlner  (301) 975-6974 (301) 975-3357  lily.chen@nist.gov ray.perlner@nist.gov  Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-3610  quynh.dang@nist.gov  Digital Signatures  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), specifies  three techniques for the generation and verification of digital  signatures that can be used for the protection of data: the Digital  Signature Algorithm (DSA), the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature  Algorithm (ECDSA), and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:john.kelsey@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/publications http://csrc.nist.gov/publications http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/key_mgmt mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov mailto:ray.perlner@nist.gov mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201336  algorithm.

A block cipher transforms some  fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”) into seemingly random  data of the same length. The transformation is determined by  the choice of some secret data called the “key.” The key can  also be used to recover the original block of data.  A method of using the block cipher to protect one or more  blocks of data is called a block cipher mode of operation.  The approved modes are specified in the SP 800-38 series.  Each approved mode provides data confidentiality and/or  authenticity/integrity.  In December 2012, NIST approved block cipher modes for  key wrapping (i.e., the protection of the confidentiality and  integrity of cryptographic keys). In particular, SP 800-38F,  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods  for Key Wrapping, identifies existing methods that are approved  for key wrapping, and also specifies three deterministic  authenticated-encryption modes: the AES Key Wrap (KW) mode,  the AES Key Wrap with Padding (KWP) mode, and one TDEA  mode, called TKW.  Block cipher modes can also provide format-preserving  encryption (FPE). A format can be a sequence of decimal digits,  such as a credit card number or a social security number;  formats can also be defined for other sets of characters besides  decimal digits. FPE is expected to be very useful because this  property facilitates the retrofitting of encryption to existing  applications.  NIST proposed the approval of three block cipher modes for  FPE in Draft SP 800-38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption,  which was released for a 60-day period of public comment  in July 2013. This publication specifies three schemes for  FPE:  FF1, FF2, and FF3. These schemes were submitted for  NIST’s consideration in recent years under the names FFX- base, VAES3, and BPS; the original submission documents  are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/ modes_development.html, in the FFX and BPS entries under  the heading “Encryption Modes.”  Contact:  Dr. Morris Dworkin  (301) 975-2354  morris.dworkin@nist.gov  ª Cryptographic Research  Post-Quantum Cryptography  In FY 2013, NIST researchers Stephen Jordan, Yi-Kai Liu,  Dustin Moody, Ray Perlner, and Daniel Smith-Tone internally  presented status reports in the areas of quantum computation,  coding-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and  multivariate cryptography, which included detailed surveys of  the respective fields, as well as security overviews and specific  results. The project members also created evaluation criteria to  compare proposed post quantum cryptosystems with the end  goal of standardization.  NIST also engaged the international cryptographic community  with presentations and publications.

The prototype uses two independent, commercially available  sources of randomness, each with an independent hardware  entropy source.  The Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability, autonomy,  and consistency. Unpredictability means that users cannot  algorithmically predict bits before they are made available  by the source. Autonomy means that the source is resistant  to attempts by outside parties to alter the distribution of the  random bits. Consistency means that a set of users can access  the source in such a way that they are confident that they all  receive the same random string.  The Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits every  60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and signed by  NIST and includes the hash of the previous value to chain the  sequence of values together. This prevents anyone, even the  Beacon itself, from retroactively changing an output packet  without being detected. The Beacon keeps all output packets  and makes them available online at https://beacon.nist.gov/ home.  Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution. In the  digital age, algorithmic random number generators have largely  replaced those tables. The NIST Randomness Beacon expands  the use of public randomness to multiple scenarios in which  the latter methods cannot be used. The extra functionalities  stem mainly from three features. First, the Beacon-generated  numbers cannot be predicted before they are published.  Second, the public, time-bound, and authenticated nature of  the Beacon allows a user application to prove to anybody that  it used truly random numbers not known before a certain point  in time. Third, this proof can be presented offline and at any  point in the future. For example, the proof could be mailed to a  trusted third party, encrypted, and signed by an application, to  be opened if needed and authorized.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned applications of the Beacon, NIST is working on  developing a source of verifiably random sequences. Given that  it is impossible to construct such sequences in any classical  physical context, CSD is collaborating with the NIST Physical  Measurement Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum source.  The aim is to use quantum effects to generate sequences  that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even if an attacker  has access to the random source. For more information on this  collaboration,  see http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_ numbers_bell_test.cfm.  As the bits posted by the Beacon are public, these are not  to be used as secret values, such as cryptographic keys or  seeds for random number generators used in the construction  of cryptographic keys. NIST encourages the community-at- large to research and publish novel ways in which this tool  can be used. Some examples of applications are unpredictable  sampling, new authentication mechanisms, and secure multi- party computation. More details are available at http://beacon. nist.gov.

There are  many technical challenges in doing this, as it is typically hard  to separate private data from general data (e.g., to convert a  third-party-signed date-of-birth certificate into a certificate  that a person is of voting age). Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof  techniques and their variants can be used to accomplish this  for a large class of assertions. These techniques allow one party  to prove to another party that a given statement is true, without  conveying any additional information apart from the fact that  the statement is indeed true. Although many such ZK protocols  are practical, adoption by industry is slow. CSD is following the  progress of emerging technologies, such as fully homomorphic  encryption (FHE). FHE could potentially solve a large class of  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:pqc@nist.gov mailto:dustin.moody@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov mailto:ray.perlner@nist.gov mailto:daniel.smith@nist.gov mailto:yi-kai.liu@nist.gov https://beacon.nist.gov/home https://beacon.nist.gov/home http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm http://beacon.nist.gov http://beacon.nist.gov mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201338  problems, by allowing computation on encrypted data without  decryption. CSD has also shown that the NIST Randomness  Beacon (discussed in the previous section) can be used as a  primitive in secure multi-party computation, such as sealed-bid  online auctions in which losing bids are never opened.  Team members continue to be in close collaboration with  the NSTIC program and the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange  (FCCX) project. In this context, CTG has served as evaluators  and in technical support roles. Information about NSTIC and  FCCX is available at http://www.nist.gov/nstic/.  Current communication security standards are primarily  designed for two-party communication. Future protocols,  such as those for identification, commercial transactions,  and social media, will necessitate standards for three-party  communications (e.g., two parties involved in a commercial  transaction and a third party that serves as an enabler of some  aspects of the transaction). This is particularly important if  standards are to provide privacy protection. NIST has developed  some basic protocols for this purpose. One such protocol allows  for privacy-preserving identification with the aid of a mediator.  In this protocol, the issuer of an assertion, such as “John Smith  is an employee of the Department of Commerce,” does not need  to know who the consumer of the assertion is, yet it can encrypt  the assertion with a key only known to that consumer (i.e., the  mediator does not get to see the unencrypted assertion).  Contact:  Dr. René Peralta  (301) 975-8702  rene.peralta@nist.gov  Cryptography for Constrained Environments  Pervasive computing is an emerging technical area in which  many highly constrained devices (e.g., limited resources, such  as program space and RAM) are interconnected, typically  communicating wirelessly with one another, and working in  concert to accomplish some task. These systems apply to a  wide variety of fields. Sample application areas include sensor  networks, medical devices, distributed control systems, and the  Smart Grid. Security can be very important in each of these  areas. For example, an unauthorized party should not be able  to take control of an insulin pump or the brakes on a car. There  are also privacy concerns, particularly in the area of Health IT.  Because the majority of the current cryptographic algorithms  were designed for desktop/server environments, many of these  algorithms cannot operate under these constraints, or if they  can be made to operate in these constrained environments,  their performance is typically not acceptable. A particular  problem is the use of asymmetric (public key) algorithms. These  algorithms tend to be much more computational and resource- intensive and are not easily accommodated in such constrained  environments.  As a result, CSD is currently focusing on studying the use  of the NIST-approved symmetric-key algorithms in constrained  environments. Symmetric-key algorithms can perform  encryption for confidentiality, and can generate message  authentication codes (MAC) for authenticity and integrity.  NIST has implemented the Advanced Encryption Standard  (AES) to provide both confidentiality and the AES-based  message authentication code, CMAC mode, for authentication.  Additionally, CTG has implemented the 256-bit version of the  Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256) to provide a Hash-based  Message Authentication Code (HMAC) for authentication.  The emerging KeccaK algorithm has also been implemented  – both the original 1600-bit permutation that won the hash  competition (see the SHA-3 report above) and the reduced  800-bit permutation. It has been demonstrated that the KeccaK  algorithm allows a more efficient construction for computing  MACs than SHA-256, which requires the HMAC construction.  CTG has also investigated other, non-NIST-approved algorithms  for constrained environments.  CTG will continue to analyze the resource requirements and  performance characteristics of these algorithms, and study  their use as building blocks to perform other cryptographic  functions beyond encryption.

The performance advantages of dedicated  stream ciphers make them more attractive than block ciphers  in stream-cipher-type modes (e.g., AES counter mode) for  some niche software and hardware applications. In 2004,  the European Network of Excellence for Cryptology (ECRYPT)  announced the ECRYPT Stream Cipher (eSTREAM) project with  the goal of identifying new stream ciphers that offer some  performance advantages over AES. The eSTREAM portfolio,  published in 2012, includes: 1) four algorithms for software  applications: HC-128, Rabbit, Salsa20/12 and Sosemanuk, and  http://www.nist.gov/nstic mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov mailto:lawrence.bassham@nist.gov  39  2) three algorithms for hardware applications: Grain, Trivium  and Mickey.  The primary focus of the project is to study the eSTREAM  candidates and other commonly used stream ciphers for  possible standardization. During FY 2013, three internal talks  were given: “Stream Ciphers for Constrained Environments,”  “Authenticated Encryption In Stream Ciphers,” and “Stream  Ciphers For Software Applications.” NIST researchers Meltem  Sönmez Turan and Santanu Sarkar were two of the co-authors  of “A Chosen IV Related Key Attack on Grain-128,” published  at the 18th Australasian Conference on Information Security  and Privacy, ACISP 2013. Dr. Turan also published “Related-Key  Slide Attacks On Block Ciphers With Secret Components” at the  Second International Lightweight Cryptography for Security and  Privacy workshop, LightSec 2013.  After comparing the security and performance of stream  ciphers to block ciphers designed for constrained environments,  CTG observed that the gate array requirements for block and  stream ciphers are comparable, but stream ciphers have  a better throughput/area performance characteristic. CTG  currently believes that well-designed lightweight block ciphers  may be more suitable than stream ciphers for constrained  environments. This determination is based upon the following  factors: 1) the maturity of literature on block ciphers; 2) the  availability of better tools to analyze the security of block  ciphers; 3) reduced round attacks on the stream cipher finalists;  and 4) lack of flexible key sizes for stream ciphers.  In FY 2014, NIST will continue to study the security and  performance of software-oriented stream ciphers and block  ciphers designed for constrained environments.

A variety of metrics is relevant  to designing “good” circuits. In particular, minimizing the size  and maximizing the throughput of a circuit closely translate into  the combinatorial problem of designing circuits with few gates  and short depth. The project team has shown that solving this  design problem, even approximately, is “MAX-SNP Complete.”  In practice, this means that it is necessary to settle for heuristics  that design “good” circuits, as opposed to provably optimal  circuits. It also means that many basic questions are likely to  remain unanswered for the foreseeable future, even if quantum  computers are ever built. For example, it is unlikely that the  minimum number of gates necessary to implement the AES can  be found. In the 12 years since the approval of AES, successive  improvements have roughly cut the gate count in half. The  standard reference for the smallest published circuit for AES  is from a study funded by the National Security Agency. CTG  improved on this work significantly by designing combinatorial  circuits that are smaller (meaning that they are likely to use  less energy) and others that are of lower depth (meaning that  they are likely to be faster). The general technique was issued a  patent held jointly between NIST and the University of Southern  Denmark.  CTG is also researching circuit-based security metrics for  cryptographic functions. For a function to be secure (one- way), it must be the case that any circuit that implements it  is sufficiently complex. In particular, a function is insecure if  it can be implemented by a circuit containing too few Boolean  AND gates. This security metric, namely the number of AND  gates necessary and sufficient to implement a function, is  referred to as its multiplicative complexity. When comparing  two cryptographic functions, all other things being equal,  the one with higher multiplicative complexity is preferable.  Unfortunately, determining multiplicative complexity is  extremely hard. Mathematicians attempted this in the 1970s,  but the effort had been largely abandoned by the 1980s. CTG  has been able to compute tight bounds for the multiplicative  complexity of an important class of functions (the symmetric  functions). This theory seems to have wide applicability and  it points to exciting directions for both theoretical and applied  research in security and cryptography.  A partial list of results includes:  � The construction of the smallest known circuits for  multiplication in several small finite fields.  � The construction of the smallest known circuits for  binary multiplication (i.e., multiplication of polynomials  of degree n over the Galois Field with two elements).  � The construction of optimal circuits – with respect to  multiplicative complexity – for all predicates on four  bits. There are 65,536 such predicates. Surprisingly, the  multiplicative complexity of all these functions turned  out to be at most three.  � Circuits with small multiplicative complexity can be  used to design more efficient multiparty computation  protocols. Such circuits are useful for protocols that  use either partially homomorphic schemes or fully  homomorphic schemes. Some of the published circuits  are being used as benchmarking tools in those areas.

This standard is  applicable to all federal agencies that use cryptography-based  security systems to protect sensitive information in computer  and telecommunication systems (including voice systems),  as defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology  Management Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106, and the  Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, Public  Law 107-347. The standard must be used in designing and  implementing cryptographic modules that federal departments  and agencies operate, or that are operated for them under  contract.  The current version of the standard is FIPS 140-2. Draft  FIPS 140-3, a revision proposed to supersede FIPS 140-2, has  been developed. The draft revision of the standard adds new  security requirements for cryptographic modules to reflect the  latest advances in technology and security and to mirror other  new or updated standards published by NIST in the areas of  cryptography and key management. Additionally, software and  firmware requirements are addressed in a new topic area while  another new area specifying requirements to protect against  noninvasive attacks is also provided.  The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of  security, intended to cover a wide range of potential applications  and environments.  The security requirements cover areas  related to the secure design, implementation and operation of  a cryptographic module.  These areas include cryptographic  module specification; cryptographic module physical ports and  logical interfaces; roles, authentication, and services; software  security; operating environment; physical security; physical  security – non-invasive attacks; sensitive security parameter  management; self-tests; life-cycle assurance; and mitigation of  other attacks.  The draft of FIPS 140-3 has had two rounds of public review.  The resolutions to the public comments received on the second  draft of FIPS 140-3 include: 1) a description of the assumed threat  models (e.g., attacker’s level of experience, expectations from  the cryptographic module) for each of the four security levels;  2) an insertion of missing definitions for terms and acronyms;  3) changes to the Trusted Channel requirements; 4) the removal  of the Trusted Role; 5) the inclusion of an identity-based  authentication mechanism that would be allowed at Security  Level (SL) 2; 6) the addition of a self-initiated cryptographic  output capability and remote control capability; 7) the inclusion  of additional integrity-technique requirements for the software  components of a cryptographic module; 8) a restructure of the  annexes and enhancement of the requirements for the allowed  operator-authentication mechanisms; 9) an update of the list  of the noninvasive attacks covered by the standard; and 10) an  update of the requirements for the allowed modifiable operating  environments.  During the process of addressing the public comments  received on the second draft, CSD determined that additional  feedback was required from the public to resolve gaps and  inconsistencies among the comments received for particular  sections of the second draft of FIPS 140-3. As a result, CSD  requested additional public comments in August 2012 on  several clearly identified sections.  During FY 2013, CSD discussed and addressed all comments  received on the identified issues and prepared the updated draft  FIPS 140-3 for a final internal review. The completion of the  internal review and submission for approval by the Secretary of  Commerce are expected in FY 2014.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3/  Contact:  Dr. Michaela Iorga  (301) 975-8431  michaela.iorga@nist.gov  Authentication  To support the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Memorandum M-04-04, E-Authentication Guidance for Federal  Agencies, NIST developed SP 800-63, Electronic Authentication  Guideline. Its subsequent revision, SP 800-63-1 (published  at the end of FY 2012) significantly expanded the range of  included technologies, such as Security Assertion Markup  Language (SAML) assertions. The OMB memorandum defines  four levels of authentication in terms of assurance about the  validity of an asserted identity. This recommendation covers  remote authentication of users (such as employees, contractors,  mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/FIPS140_3 mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov  41  or private individuals) interacting with government IT systems  over open networks. It defines technical requirements for each  of four levels of assurance in the areas of identity proofing,  registration, tokens, management processes, authentication  protocols and related assertions.  As more electronic service delivery systems that require  authentication and identity management became available,  large-scale enrollment and registration issues became a  significant problem for agencies, particularly for health care.  Enrollment and identity proofing result in much of the up-front  cost to agencies of implementing online service delivery and  can be a barrier to user adoption. SP 800-63-2, a revision  with changes largely limited to identity proofing and credential  issuance, was published at the end of FY 2013 and is available  at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-63-2 is intended to facilitate more efficient and  convenient user enrollment and identity proofing, mainly by  exploiting the identity proofing already done for professional  licensing, registration, or certification (e.g., for doctors, nurses,  lawyers, professional engineers). SP 800-63-2 also reduces the  number of cases where postal mailings are required to confirm  addresses, saving expense and making registration easier and  more immediate for users.  In FY 2014, NIST expects its authentication work to be  driven by the needs of the ongoing rapid expansion of online  service delivery, as experience accumulates and technology  progresses.  Efforts to develop accreditation programs for  e-authentication have revealed problem areas in the text of  the specifications, while the rapidly growing and evolving use  of mobile devices with Internet access and new capabilities  present both challenges and opportunities. Practical business  models for large-scale registration and credential issuance  seem to indicate that separate organizations should do both,  and NIST has been urged to make a clearer delineation of  these activities in a future revision of SP 800-63. Unattended  biometric authentication is considered problematic for remote  authentication in SP 800-63-2, but the relatively high quality  and online video/audio capabilities of the current mobile  devices, as well as the fingerprint readers in some mobile  phones, all deserve fresh consideration. Level 4 identity  proofing currently requires an in-person appearance, which is  often both expensive for agencies and inconvenient and time  consuming for registrants, particularly in rural or remote areas.  A comment received during the public review of SP 800-63-2  urged allowing the use of secure kiosks with high-quality video,  document scanners and biometric readers that would be linked  to a human registration operator in a registration center, as  a viable solution. While this was judged to be too complex to  evaluate in the schedule for SP 800-63-2, the idea is intriguing  and deserves a detailed consideration.  NIST, therefore, plans to actively consider another incremental  revision to SP 800-63-2 in response to the issues noted above  and other issues that can be dealt with in time to assist in the  intense ongoing efforts to expand online services.

In such a heterogeneous network, a mobile device may switch  its between different wireless technologies. The procedure  of conducting such a switch is called a “handover.” Inter- technology handover has brought many challenges to existing  security solutions, such as the delays caused by access  authentication for each handover. CSD has conducted intensive  research in the security for media-independent handover (MIH)  and has worked closely with the working group of IEEE 802.21  on security solutions for MIH services. The services specified  in IEEE 802.21 include information service, event service, and  command service. The security mechanisms were developed  by Task Group A of IEEE 802.21 and specified in Amendment  2 of IEEE 802.21, which provide MIH message protection and  accommodate proactive authentications.  However, the protection mechanisms specified in Amendment  2 of IEEE 802.21 are only applied to unicast messages; that  is, the mechanisms protect messages between a point of  service (PoS) and a mobile node. When the services provided  by the pervasive heterogeneous networks are extended to  other applications, such as Smart Grid applications, the MIH  needs to be processed for a group of wireless nodes, such as  smart meters, for the reliability of the services. For example,  the information may need to be delivered to a group of smart  meters. In this case, the multicast message is used to deliver  the information. That is, the message is sent from one PoS to  multiple wireless nodes. In some of the application environments,  such as sensor networks, the groups are formed dynamically.  That is, new nodes can be added to the group, and some nodes  may need to be removed. Such groups are managed through  multicast signals. The protection for multicast messages and  group management signals becomes critical. In FY 2013, CSD  has worked with IEEE 802.21 to develop security solutions  for group management in Task Group D of IEEE 802.21. The  solutions include the mechanisms to distribute group keys and  for the protection of multicast messages. In FY 2014, CSD will  continue to contribute to the development of the IEEE 802.21  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201342  Amendment on group management.

HSPD-12 called for the creation of a new identity credential for  federal employees and contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical  specification for both the PIV identity credential and the PIV  system that produces, manages, and uses the credential. Within  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), this work is a  collaborative effort of the Information Access Division (IAD) and  CSD. CSD activities in FY 2013 directly supported the revision  and maintenance of the FIPS 201 standard. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2013 to revise the standard:  � Drafted and published the final release version of FIPS  201-2. FIPS 201-2 reflects the disposition of more than  1,000 comments received from over 40 organizations on  the first public comment draft, and over 500 comments  received from 36 organizations on the second public  comment draft. NIST coordinated with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), the United States  Access Board, Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  and other U.S. Government (USG) stakeholders before  incorporating changes in the final release version of  FIPS 201-2.  � Prepared and published a draft revision 4 of Special  Publication (SP) 800-73 (SP 800-73-4), Interfaces for  Personal Identity Verification. The update to the three- part SP details the new PIV Card capabilities introduced  in FIPS 201-2 including Virtual Contact Interface  (VCI), a secure channel protocol, an on-card biometric  comparison mechanism and enforcement a minimum  PIN length of six digits.  � Prepared and published a draft revision 4 of SP 800-78  (SP 800-78-4), Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes  for Personal Identity Verification. The document has  been modified to align with SP 800-73-4 (Draft), and  includes the addition of new algorithms and key sizes for  the secure messaging protocol and the addition of test  requirements with the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program (CAVP) validation.  � Started drafting an update to SP 800-79, Guidelines for  the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Card Issuers (PCIs), in order to incorporate changes  required by FIPS 201-2.  � Started drafting updates to SP 800-85A, PIV Card  Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines,  and SP 800-85B, PIV Data Model Test Guidelines, in  order to align these documents with FIPS 201-2,  SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  � To accommodate mobile devices, NIST started drafting  SP 800-157, Derived PIV Credentials. As intended by  FIPS 201-2, derived PIV credentials are part of the set of  PIV credentials that can be provisioned directly to mobile  devices to enable remote enterprise access from the  device.  In FY 2014, CSD will be focusing on updating the relevant  publications associated with FIPS 201-2, including developing  a new publication, SP 800-156, Representation of PIV Chain-of- Trust for Import and Export. CSD will also continue to provide  technical and strategic inputs to the PIV related initiatives.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/  Contacts:  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972 (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov david.cooper@nist.gov  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro Mr. Ketan Mehta  (301) 975 6414 (301) 975-8405  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov ketan.mehta@nist.gov  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv mailto:hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov mailto:salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov mailto:ketan.mehta@nist.gov  43  ª PIV Program Test Cards  To facilitate the development of applications and middleware  that support the PIV card, CSD developed a set of smart cards  for testing. The initial work of developing the test cards was  performed during FY 2011 and was completed during FY  2012. In late FY 2012, NIST began selling the test cards as  NIST Special Database 33 (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/ testcards.html).  Over the course of FY 2013, additional sets of test cards  were created as the existing inventory of cards were sold.  In addition, CSD has maintained a mailing list that has been  used by individuals who have purchased the test cards to ask  questions about the cards and to exchange advice on their use.  For further details on the PIV project, see the Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) and FIPS 201 Revision Efforts section.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/testcards.html  Figure 9: PIV Test Card  Contact:  Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-3194  david.cooper@nist.gov  ªNIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP)  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity Verification  Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components for conformance  to specifications in FIPS 201 and its companion documents.  The two PIV components that come under the scope of NPIVP  are PIV Smart Card Application and PIV Middleware. All of the  tests under NPIVP are handled by third-party laboratories that  are accredited as Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST)  Laboratories by the NIST NVLAP and are called accredited  NPIVP test facilities. As of September 2013, there were nine  such facilities.  In prior years, CSD published SP 800-85A, PIV Card  Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines, to  facilitate development of PIV Smart Card Application and PIV  Middleware that conform to interface specifications in SP  800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification. CSD also  developed an integrated toolkit called “PIV Interface Test  Runner” for conducting tests on both PIV Card Application and  PIV Middleware products, and provided the toolkit to accredited  NPIVP test facilities.  NPIVP validation utilized the following versions and documents  throughout FY 2013:  � SP 800-73-3, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification  � SP 800-85A-2, PIV Card Application and Middleware  Interface Test Guidelines  In FY 2013, two new PIV card application products were  validated for conformance to SP 800-73-3 and received  certificates, bringing the total number of NPIVP validated PIV  Card application products to 36. Three PIV Middleware products  were validated for conformance to SP 800-73-3 and received  certificates, for a total number of 20 NPIVP-validated PIV  Middleware products.  In addition, NPIVP is closely involved in ensuring that all  changes in PIV companion documents, such as SP 800- 73-3, SP 800-76-2, and SP 800-78-3, are fully reflected in  the conformance test document SP 800-85A-2 as well as  subsequently in the PIV Test Runner toolkit consequent on the  expected publication of FIPS 201-2.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp  Contacts:  Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  (301) 975-5013  (301) 975-6972  mouli@nist.gov  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Lorie, this image was used in last year’s annual report.

The foundational  technologies that facilitate the use of a computing infrastructure  for cloud computing services is virtualization. At the core of a  virtualized infrastructure is the virtualized host that provides  abstraction of the hardware (e.g., CPU, memory) enabling  multiple computing stacks (comprised of the operating  system, middleware, and applications) to be run on a single  physical machine.  The efficiency of such a dynamic and  distributed processing environment is counter-balanced by the  interoperability, portability, and security challenges inherent  to this computing environment. NIST is working in parallel on  several projects introduced below that aim to accelerate the  Federal Government’s secure adoption of cloud computing by  collaborating with standards bodies, public and private sector  in developing security, interoperability and portability standards  and guidance.  CSD Role in the NIST Cloud  Computing Program  During FY 2013, the NIST Cloud  Computing Team continued to promote the  development of publications, national and  international standards, and specifications  in support of the USG’s effective and secure  use of cloud computing as well as providing  technical guidance to USG agencies for  secure and effective cloud computing  adoption.. CSD supports many of the  technical standards activities supported  by the NIST Cloud Computing Program,  with a particular focus on cloud computing  security.  � Participated in the development of  a revised SP 500-291, NIST Cloud  Computing Standards Roadmap.  The document, initially published in  2011, was updated in July 2013, and  was incorporated into draft SP 500-293,  US Government (USG) Cloud Computing Technology  Roadmap.  � Participated in the update to the multi-part draft  document SP 500-293, US Government (USG) Cloud  Computing Technology Roadmap (Vol. I, II, and III)  that defines and prioritizes USG requirements for  interoperability, portability, and security for effective  cloud computing adoption. It is anticipated that final  versions of Volumes I and II of the SP 500-293 will be  released by the end of the first quarter, FY 2014.  � Led the development of the draft SP 500-299, NIST  Cloud Computing Security Reference Architecture (SRA).  It is anticipated that the final version of the document  will be released by the end of the second quarter, FY  2014. SP 500-299 defines a modular framework that  provides a formal model and a methodology for the  secure adoption of cloud computing by applying a Cloud- adapted Risk Management Framework. The SRA is a  security overlay to SP 500-292: NIST Cloud Computing  Reference Architecture.  � Provided technical support to several Federal Chief  Information Officer (CIO) Council committees, including  the Cloud Computing Executive Steering Committee,  Cloud Computing Advisory Council, the Information  Security and Identity Management Workgroup, and the  Web 2.0 working group.  CSD staff members contributed significantly to several NIST- hosted events:  � Sixth Cloud Computing Forum and Workshop: Cloud  Computing and Big Data Forum, held in January 2013  � Seventh Cloud Computing Forum and Workshop: The  Intersection of Cloud and Mobility Forum, initially  scheduled for October 1-3, 2013, currently rescheduled  Figure 10: NIST Security Reference Architecture Diagram  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf  45  due to USG shutdown  � First Cloud Forensic Science Workshop, initially  scheduled for October 3, 2013, also rescheduled due to  USG shutdown.  In support of and advancement of USG cloud computing  mandates, CSD staff members provided leadership for several  public work groups operating under the NIST Cloud Computing  Program. Through these working groups, CSD staff led the  development of technical guidelines and recommendations that  considered a close collaboration with public, private, academia  and other stakeholders.  CSD staff chaired or co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2013:  � Chair of the NIST Cloud Computing Security Working  Group focused the group on development of SP 500-299  (described above), and on key management research.  � Co-Chair, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science  Working Group, led development of Digital Forensics  Challenges in a cloud environment.  � Co-Chair, NIST Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap  Working Group, led development of SP 500291, USG  Cloud Computing Standards Roadmap (described above).  � Chair and Vice-Chair, INCITS CS1 (Cybersecurity)  − U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/ IEC international committee JTC1/SC27 (IT Security  Techniques) − that covers cloud computing taxonomy- related standards and cloud computing security  standards.  CSD staff members participate in various standards  development organizations, two of which are ISO/IEC JTC 1 Sub  Committee 38 – Distributed Application Platforms and Services  (SC 38) and ISO/IEC JTC 1 Sub Committee 27 – IT Security  Techniques (SC 27). In SC 38, CSD acts as the co-convener  for a collaborative ISO/ITU-T initiative on cloud computing  taxonomy that includes work on ISO/IEC 17788 – Information  Technology – Cloud computing – Overview and Vocabulary.  Notably, the genesis for this international body of work is the  widely accepted and used cloud computing definition found in  SP 800-145, NIST Definition of Cloud Computing.  ISO/IEC 17788 is closely coordinated with another standards  activity, ISO/IEC 17789 – Information technology – Cloud  Computing – Reference Architecture, which is based on the  widely used and accepted NIST publication, SP 500-292. Both  ISO/IEC 17788 and 17789 are in the final stages of international  balloting before final publication, which is anticipated in the  first quarter of calendar year 2014.  CSD staff members are also actively participating in cloud  computing security standards, primarily through SC 27, which  is responsible for cloud computing security standards. CSD  has provided technical contributions based on SP 500-299 and  continues to advocate for secure, non-proprietary solutions.  In FY 2013, the CSD members of the NIST cloud computing  team also presented the results of cloud computing research  and development, introduced the standards and specifications  under development, and provided status of the NIST Cloud  Computing Program in a variety of conferences and workshops.  Policy Machine – Leveraging Access Control for  Cloud Computing  Figure 11: Policy Machine operating environment  In FY 2013, CSD continued the research and development  of a virtualization-based, enterprise-wide controlled delivery  of data services for advanced cloud computing through Access  Control.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are developing a three-part PM standard, under the title  of “Next Generation Access Control” (NGAC), under three sub- projects:  � Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols and API  Definitions  � Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture  � Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Generic Operations & Abstract Data Structures  The Policy Machine’s architecture has been adopted by  the ANSI/INCITS and is now available as ANSI INCITS 499 –  Information technology – Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture (NGAC–FA).  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201346  Cryptographic Key Management Issues  in Cloud Infrastructures  Many of the security capabilities associated with exercise  of cloud service rely on cryptographic operations.  The key  management system (KMS) required to support cryptographic  operations for the above tasks can be complex, due to differences  in ownership and control of underlying infrastructures on  which the KMS and the protected resources are located. CSD  developed NISTIR 7956, Cryptographic Key Management Issues  & Challenges in Cloud Services to discuss these critical issues.  Virtualization Security & Leveraging  Virtualization for Security  CSD has been researching key areas in cloud and virtualization  security producing the following papers:  “Security Assurance Requirements for Hypervisor  Deployment Feature” published as part of the proceedings of  the 7th International Conference on Digital Society. In FY 2014,  CSD will consider feedback from public comments received and  publish a (yet unnumbered) Special Publication titled Secure  Management Practices for Protection of Hypervisors. In addition,  security assurance requirements and security recommendations  will be developed for components of virtualized infrastructure  other than the hypervisor, such as the guest O/S, VM-based  applications, and the virtual network..

Although these  devices are relatively small and inexpensive, they can be used  for voice calls, simple text messages, sending and receiving  emails, browsing the web, online banking and ecommerce,  social networking, and many functions once limited to laptop  and desktop computers. Smart phones and tablet devices have  specialized built-in hardware, such as photographic cameras,  video cameras, accelerometers, Global Positioning System  (GPS) receivers, and removable media readers. They also  employ a wide range of wireless interfaces, including infrared,  Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, Near Field Communications  (NFC), and one or more types of cellular interfaces that provide  network connectivity across the globe. Naturally, just as  consumers and business people can realize productivity gains  from these technologies, so can government agencies.  http://www.nist.gov/itl/cloud http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/StandardsRoadmap http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/StandardsRoadmap http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudSecurity http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudSecurity http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudForensics http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/CloudForensics mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:annie.sokol@nist.gov mailto:dbenigni@nist.gov mailto:salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:serban.gavrila@nist.gov mailto:mouli@nist.gov mailto:michaela.iorga@nist.gov mailto:mouli@nist.gov  47  Like any new technology, smart phones present new  capabilities, but also a number of new security and privacy  challenges. As the pace of the technology life cycles continues  to increase, current Information Assurance (IA) standards and  processes must be updated and new technologies to allow  government users to employ the latest technologies that  consumers can use without sacrificing privacy and security.  NIST is conducting research in new software assurance  methodologies for smart phone software (i.e., apps) and is  working with industry to bridge the security gaps present  with today’s smart phones. NIST has developed an online beta  Application Testing Portal (ATP) for Android that examines  app functionality with respect to agency security and privacy  guidelines. NIST is working closely with the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to transition this software  assurance technology to other agencies and making the ATP  software available to industry as open source.  Building on this expertise in mobile app software assurance,  NIST researchers are developing platform-independent  techniques for identifying mobile malware by analyzing mobile  app network behavior. NIST researchers are also developing  metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of mobile app security  test tools.

The primary motivations for the  development of IPv6 were to increase  the number of unique IP addresses  available for use and to handle the needs of new Internet  applications and devices. In addition, IPv6 was designed with  the following goals: increased ease of network management  and configuration; expandable IP headers; improved mobility  and security; and quality of service controls. IPv6 has been,  and continues to be, developed and defined by the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF).  FY 2012 was a significant year for the deployment of IPv6  in the United States Government. OMB’s Memo of September  10, 2010, Transition to IPv6, required all government agencies  to “upgrade public/external facing servers and services (e.g.,  web, email, Domain Name System (DNS), Internet Service  Provider (ISP) services) to operationally use native IPv6 by  the end of FY 2012.” NIST worked with the USGv6 Task Force  and with individual government agencies to achieve this goal.  NIST developed an online monitor to demonstrate which high- level government domains have met this goal with respect to  DNS services, email, web servers, and Domain Name System  Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In FY 2013, NIST and OMB  continued to use this monitor to measure USGv6 compliance  with OMB’s requirement.  FY 2014 will bring additional OMB IPv6 requirements.  Agencies will “upgrade internal client applications that  communicate with public Internet servers and supporting  enterprise networks to operationally use native IPv6 by the end  of FY 2014.” NIST is developing online diagnostic tools to help  agencies verify compliance to this requirement.  The NIST IPv6 Test Program, whose goal is to provide  assurance on IPv6 product conformance and interoperability,  continues to operate. In FY 2014, NIST will continue to manage  and evolve the USGv6 Test Program.  The NIST program is a  collaboration between CSD and the Advanced Networking  Technology Division.  http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6  Contacts:  Ms. Sheila Frankel Mr. Douglas Montgomery  (301) 975-3297 (301) 975-3630  sheila.frankel@nist.gov dougm@nist.gov  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:stephen.quirolgico@nist.gov mailto:jeff.voas@nist.gov mailto:karygiannis@nist.gov http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6 mailto:sheila.frankel@nist.gov mailto:dougm@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201348  Access Control and Privilege Management  ªAccess Control and Privilege  Management Research  With the advance of current computing technologies and  the diverse environments in which these technologies are  used, security issues, such as situational awareness, trust  management, preservation of privacy in access control, and  privilege management systems, are becoming increasingly  complex. Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics is  needed.  In FY 2013, the following research was accomplished for this  project: 1) unified enforcement mechanism of data services  for use by a Policy Machine (PM) for enterprise computing  environment, 2) enhanced the capabilities of the Access Control  Policy Tool (ACPT), 3) researched a new fault-detection method  for access control rule using Simulated Logic Circuit algorithms,  4) researched formal ABAC models, and completed the  development of Special Publication 800-162, Guide to Attribute  Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations,  which provides information of function components as well as  enterprise consideration of ABAC.  CSD expects that this project will:  � Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared resources  and common trust management schemes  � Provide guidance in implementing access control models  and mechanisms for standalone or enterprise systems  � Increase the security and safety of static (connected)  distributed systems by applying the testing and  verification tool for the access control policies  � Assist system architects, security administrators, and  security managers whose expertise is related to access  control or privilege policy in managing their systems, and  in learning the limitations and practical approaches for  their applications  � Provide accurate and efficient fault detection and  correction technology for implementing access control  rules and policies  Figure 12: Access Control and Privilege Management  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3046  vhu@nist.gov david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-3337  kuhn@nist.gov  ª Conformance Verification for Access  Control Policies  Access control systems are among the most critical network  security components. Faulty policies, misconfigurations, or flaws  in software implementation can result in serious vulnerabilities.  The specification of access control policies is often a challenging  problem. Often a system’s privacy and security are compromised  due to the misconfiguration of access control policies instead  of the failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This  problem becomes increasingly severe as software systems  become more and more complex and are deployed to manage a  large amount of sensitive information and resources organized  into sophisticated structures. Identifying discrepancies between  policy specifications and their properties (intended function) is  crucial because correct implementation and enforcement of  policies by applications is based on the premise that the policy  specifications are correct. As a result, policy specifications must  undergo rigorous verification and validation through systematic  testing to ensure that the policy specifications truly encapsulate  the desires of the policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security properties  that access control should adhere to, access control models  are usually written to bridge the rather wide gap in abstraction  between policy and mechanism. Thus, an access control  model provides unambiguous and precise expression as  mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  49  well as reference for design and implementation of security  requirements. Techniques are required for verifying whether  an access control model is correctly expressed in the access  controls policies and whether the properties are satisfied in  the model. In practice, the same access control policies may  express multiple access control models or express a single  model in addition to extra access control constraints outside of  the model. Ensuring the conformance of access control models  and policies is a nontrivial and critical task.  Started in 2009, CSD developed a prototype system, Access  Control Policy Tool (ACPT), which allows a user to compose,  verify, test, and generate access control policies.  In FY 2013, ACPT was downloaded by 190 users and  organizations. CSD performed prototype testing, enhanced the  capability of ACPT by adding privilege inheritance algorithms,  applied user cases of Attribute Based, Multi-Level, and  Workflow access control models to test ACPT’s performance,  and compared to other formal method for performance and  usability. CSD also produced a new user manual that explains  new capabilities of ACPT. In addition, CSD published a research  paper related to ACPT.  In FY 2014, CSD will continue testing, enhance the capability  of ACPT by applying the tool for more complex access control  policy combinations, provide model profiles, and improve user  interfaces. CSD will also update ACPT based on user feedback  and suggestions.  Figure 13: Conformance Verification  This project is expected to:  � Provide generic paradigm and framework of access  control model/property conformance testing  � Provide templates for specifying access control rules in  popular access control models such as Attribute Based,  Multilevel, and Workflow models  � Provide tools or services for checking the security  and safety of access control implementation, policy  combination, and eXtensible Access Control Markup  Language (XACML) policy generation  � Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of combinatorial  testing for large-system (such as access control system)  testing  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt/  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3337  vhu@nist.gov kuhn@nist.gov  ªMetrics for Evaluation of Access Control  Systems (Real-Time Access Rule Fault  Detection)  Specifying correct behaviors of Access Control (AC) policies  is a challenging task, especially when an AC policy includes  a large number of rules. Identifying discrepancies between AC  policies and their intended functionalities is crucial because  correct policy behaviors are based on the premise that the  policies are correctly specified. Incorrect AC policies result in  faults that not only leak but also disable access to information,  and faults are especially difficult to detect without support of  formal embedded models such as Multi-Level Security (MLS)  and Chinese Wall.  Most research on AC model or policy verification techniques  are focused on one particular model, and almost all of the  research is in applied methods, which require the completed AC  policies as the input for verification or test processes to generate  fault reports. Even though correct verification is achieved and  counterexamples may be generated along with found faults,  those methods provide no information about the source of rule  faults that might allow conflicts in privilege assignment, leakage  of privileges, or conflict of interest permissions. The difficulty in  finding the source of faults is increased especially when the AC  rules are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree  of complexity. The complexity is due to the fact that a fault  might not be caused by one particular rule; for example, rule x  grants subject/attribute s access to object/attribute o, and rule  y denies the group subject/attribute g, which s is a member  of, access to object o. Such conflict can only be resolved by  removing either rule x or y, or the g membership of s from the  policy. But removing x or y affects other rules that depend on  them (e.g., a member of subject group g k is granted access  to object o), and removing s’s membership in g will disable  g’s legitimate access to other objects/attributes through the  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201350  membership. Thus, it requires manually analyzing each rule in  the policy in order to find the correct solution for the fault.  To address the issue, CSD researched the AC Rule Logic Circuit  Simulation (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the AC authors  to detect a fault when the fault-causing AC rule is added to the  policy, so the fixing can be implemented in real time before  adding other rules that further complicate the detecting effort.  Rather than checking by retracing the interrelations between  rules after the policy is completed, the policy author needs  only check the newly added rule against previous “correct”  ones. In ACRLCS, AC rules are represented in a Simulated  Logic Circuit (SLC). The use of simulation may restrict ACRLCS  implementation on a physical electronic circuit; however, the  concept can be implemented and computed through simulated  software.  In FY 2013, by using the Logic Circuit Simulation (LCS)  software, CSD researched the SLC for the simulations of rule  and inheritance assignments of AC privileges, formal AC model  implementations, and multiple policy combinations. The result  is published in the conference paper, Real-Time Access Control  Rule Fault Detection Using a Simulated Logic Circuit.  In FY 2014, CSD is planning to further research the  performance of the ACRLCS, and develop a basic reference  implementation of the algorithm. Goals for the project include:  � Promote the concept of detecting AC policy faults in real  time AC rule composing  � Provide an innovative method in specifying AC rules  formed by Boolean logic expressions operated on  variables of AC rules  � Provide techniques for preventing faults in enforcing  fundamental security properties including Cyclic  Inheritance, Privilege Escalation, and Separation of Duty  � Provide new methods for composing standard mandatory  AC models such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  and MLS as well as some fundamental security  properties  Figure 14: Real-time Access Control - Circuit  Contact:  Dr. Vincent Hu  (301) 975-4975  vhu@nist.gov  ªAttribute Based Access Control  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is a logical access  control methodology where authorization to perform a set of  operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated  with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some  cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or  relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given  set of attributes. ABAC represents a point on the spectrum  of logical access control from simple access control lists to  more capable role-based access (RBAC), and finally to a highly  flexible method for providing access based on the evaluation of  attributes.  There has not been a comprehensive effort to formally  define or guide the implementation of ABAC within the Federal  Government. This research provides considerations for using  ABAC to improve information sharing within and among  organizations while maintaining control of that information. The  research serves a two-fold purpose; first, it aims to provide  federal agencies with a definition of ABAC and a description of  the functional components of ABAC. Second, it provides planning,  design, implementation, and operational considerations for  employing ABAC within a large enterprise with the goal of  improving information sharing while maintaining control of that  information.  In FY 2013, CSD completed the writing of SP 800-162,  Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition  and Considerations. SP 800-162 includes terminology and  basic understanding of ABAC; ABAC enterprise employment  considerations during the initiation, acquisition/development,  implementation/assessment, and operations and maintenance  phases; and example to demonstrate how ABAC is implemented  in a Web Information Portal. CSD also researched ABAC formal  models, the result will be presented in a NISTIR, which describes  a variety of characteristics and applications of ABAC formal  models.  NIST conducted an Attribute Based Access Control Workshop,  based on the SP 800-162, on July 17, 2013, in partnership  with NSA and the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE). About 100 individuals from government, industries,  and academia/research attended the event. The workshop  provided attendees an opportunity to identify, refine, and guide  the many interrelated considerations, challenges, and efforts  needed to develop ABAC guidance; CSD updated SP 800-162  from the suggestions collected at the workshop.  mailto:vhu@nist.gov  51  In FY 2014, CSD will continue research of ABAC formal models  as well as details and extended topics of ABAC capabilities,  such as Attribute Engineering/Management, Integration with  Identity Management, Federation, Situation Awareness (Real  Time or Contextual) Mechanism, Policy Management, and  Natural Language Policy translation to Digital Policy. The ABAC  project will pursue the following objectives:  � Provide readers the terminology and basic understanding  of ABAC  � Provide readers with an overview of the current state of  logical access control, a working definition of ABAC, and  an explanation of core and enterprise ABAC concepts  � Assist security policy makers in establishing a business  case for ABAC implementation, and acquiring an  interoperable set of capabilities  � Assist ABAC developers in developing the operational  requirements, and overall enterprise architecture  � Assist ABAC administrators in establishing or refining  business processes to support ABAC  � Promote adoption of ABAC for more secure and flexible  method for information sharing in standalone or  enterprise environment  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac/  Contacts:  Dr. Vincent Hu Mr. David Ferraiolo  (301) 975-4975 (301) 975-3046  vhu@nist.gov david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  Mr. Rick Kuhn  (301) 975-3337  kuhn@nist.gov  Advanced Security Testing and Measurements  ª Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring  IT organizations operate a diverse set of computing assets  which access, route, store, and process information that is  critical to the operations of businesses and the missions of  government agencies. These IT environments are frequently  reconfigured, and are under constant threat of attack. The  wide variety of computing products, the speed of configuration  change, and the diversity of threats require organizations to  maintain situational awareness over their IT assets and to  utilize this information to make risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data  to be exchanged between business,  operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  � Identifying IT assets  � Providing awareness over the  operational state of computing  devices  � Enabling security reference data  to be collected from internal and  external sources  � Supporting analysis processes  that measure the effectiveness  of security controls and provide  visibility into security risks, enabling  risk-based decision making  Commercial solutions built using  security automation specifications enable  the collection and harmonization of vast  amounts of operational and security data  into coherent, comparable information  Figure 15: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201352  streams to achieve situational awareness that informs timely  and active management of diverse IT systems. Through the  creation of reference data and guidance, and the international  recognition of flexible, open standards, the NIST security  automation program works to improve the interoperability,  broad acceptance, and adoption of security automation  solutions to address current and future security challenges,  creating opportunities for innovation.  Specification, Standards, and Guidance Development  To support the overarching security automation vision, it is  necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance that informs  product development and implementation. Through close  work with partners in government, industry, and academia,  NIST continues to facilitate the definition and development of  security automation approaches that enable organizations to  understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2013, NIST worked to build on previous security  automation work by:  � Establishing working groups in standards development  organizations to promote international consensus around  standardized approaches  � Identifying and addressing gaps in the current  specifications  � Evolving existing approaches to achieve greater  scalability and impact  � Providing additional guidance on architectural, design,  and analysis concerns  � Development and maintenance of tools and reference  implementations  NIST is currently working with its partners in various standards  development organizations, including the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF), the Forum of Incident Response and Security  Teams (FIRST), and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), to  further mature and broaden adoption of security automation  specifications, reference data, and techniques. This area of  work is focused on evolving security automation specifications  to integrate with existing transport protocols to provide for  secure, interoperable exchange of security automation data.  Additional work is focused on evolving security metrics  and providing consensus guidance on security automation  approaches. Through the definition and adoption of security  automation standards and guidelines, IT vendors will be able  to provide standardized security solutions to their customers.  These solutions support continuous monitoring and automated,  dynamic network defense capabilities based on analysis of data  from operational and security data sources and the collective  action of security components.  Security automation work has been focused in two areas:  evolution and international adoption of the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) and development of a Continuous  Monitoring building block focused on secure software asset  management capabilities. The following sections detail this  work.  ª Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol  that provides an automated means to  collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability  checking, verifying the installation of  patches, checking security configuration  settings, verifying technical control  compliance, measuring security, and examining systems for  indicators of compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup  Language (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature  by which security software products communicate information  about software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects  of device state. SCAP enables security automation content, also  known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using standardized  formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This content can be  used by any tool that is conformant to the specifications, to  collect and evaluate the state of software installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software and  hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information security management and governance  programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently being used by the  U.S. Government, critical infrastructure companies, academia,  and other businesses, both domestically and internationally.  Currently, CSD is leveraging SCAP in multiple areas, both to  support its own mission and to enable other agencies and  private sector entities to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a  critical component of the SCAP Validation Program, the National  Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the National Checklist  Program (NCP).  In September 2012, NIST published SP 800-126 Revision 2,  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2, . That document describes  the 11 component specifications composing SCAP.  53  SCAP 1.2 Specifications  Specification Description  Languages  Extensible Configuration  Checklist Description  Format (XCCDF)  Used for authoring security  checklists/benchmarks and for  reporting results of evaluating  them  Open Vulnerability and  Assessment Language  (OVAL)  Used for representing system  configuration information,  assessing machine state, and  reporting assessment results  Open Checklist Interactive  Language (OCIL)  Used for representing checks  that collect information from  people or from existing data  stores populated by other data  collection methods  Reporting Formats  Asset Reporting Format  (ARF)  Used to express information  about assets and to define the  relationships between assets  and reports  Asset Identification Used to uniquely identify assets  based on known identifiers and  other asset information  Enumerations  Common Platform  Enumeration (CPE)  A nomenclature and dictionary  of hardware, operating systems,  and applications; a method  to identify applicability to  platforms  Common Configuration  Enumeration (CCE)  A nomenclature and  dictionary of software security  configurations  Common Vulnerabilities  and Exposures (CVE)  A nomenclature and dictionary  of security-related software  flaws  Measurement and Scoring Systems  Common Vulnerability  Scoring System (CVSS)  Used for measuring the relative  severity of software flaws  Common Configuration  Scoring System (CCSS)  Used for measuring the relative  severity of device security  (mis-)configuration issues  Content and Result Integrity  Trust Model for Security  Automation Data (TMSAD)  Guidance for using digital  signatures in a common trust  model applied to security  automation specifications  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, NIST has worked to improve  guidance around the SCAP specifications by promoting broader  international adoption of SCAP, encouraging the integration of  SCAP into other standards, and by adapting SCAP to address  specific gaps and challenges. The following work activities  were performed during FY 2013:  NIST released draft NISTIR 7946, CVSS Implementation  Guidance, which guides analysts scoring IT vulnerabilities using  the CVSS Version 2.0. That document is the result of applying the  CVSS specification to score over 50,000 vulnerabilities analyzed  by the NVD. The report reviews the CVSS base metrics and  provides guidance for difficult and/or unique scoring situations  and assists vulnerability analysts with scoring particular  types of vulnerabilities by identifying common keywords and  phrases that often appear in vulnerability alerts. The report  includes a collection of scored IT vulnerabilities from the NVD,  a justification for each score provided, and a description of the  NVD vulnerability scoring process.  NIST, in collaboration with industry partners in the IETF,  established the Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring  (SACM) working group, chartered in July 2013. The current  scope of work for SACM includes identifying and/or defining  the transport protocols and data formats needed to support  the collection and evaluation of device state against expected  values and standards for interacting with repositories of security  automation content. The initial focus of the SACM working group  is on identifying use cases, requirements, and architectural  models to inform decisions about existing specifications and  standards that can be referenced, required modifications or  extensions to existing specifications and standards, and any  gaps that need to be addressed. This working group provides  a venue for advancing appropriate SCAP specifications into  international standards and addressing identified gap areas.  For more information, please refer to:  http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/  Additionally, NIST collaborated with industry partners to revise  the ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 standard, Information technology --  Software asset management -- Part 2: Software identification  tag, which establishes a specification for tagging software  to support identification and management. This software  identification (SWID) data model provides a mechanism for  software publishers to provide authoritative identification,  categorization, software relationship (e.g., dependency,  bundling, and patch), file footprint details, and other software  metadata for software they publish. This information enhances  SCAP use cases by providing authoritative information for  creation of CPE names, targeting of checklists, and associating  software flaws to products based on a defect in a software  library or executable.  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201354  NIST also worked with government and industry partners  in the TCG to define a number of specifications related to  the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) protocols. The first such  publication is the TNC SCAP Messages for IF-M specification  that supports carrying SCAP content and results over the TNC  protocols. The second is the TNC Enterprise Compliance Profile  (ECP) and related specifications that support the exchange of  SWID data over the TNC protocols. The ECP enables collection  of SWID data from a device for use by external tools to provide  software inventory information. SCAP and SWID data collected  using these mechanisms may be optionally used for network  access control decision making, allowing device state to be  evaluated when devices connect and on an ongoing basis  thereafter.  For more information on these specifications, please visit:  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ scap_messages_for_ifm, and  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_ endpoint_compliance_profile_specification.  Finally, NIST participated in two Forum of Incident Response  and Security Teams (FIRST) Special Interest Groups (SIG). The  CVSS SIG (CVSS-SIG) focused on defining CVSS Revision 3,  which is intended to implement improvements to the scoring  model based on community feedback. The CVSS-SIG plans to  release a draft of the revision in early FY 2014, with a completed  approved specification expected in the summer of 2014. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit:  http://www.first.org/global/sigs.  Through work with international SDOs, SCAP and related  security automation capabilities are expected to evolve and  expand in support of the growing need to define and measure  effective security controls, assess and monitor ongoing  aspects of information security, remediate noncompliance,  and successfully manage systems in accordance with the Risk  Management Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision 1,  Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  http://scap.nist.gov/  Contact:  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  ª Continuous Monitoring  In September 2010, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) released the Continuous Asset Evaluation, Situational  Awareness and Risk Scoring (CAESARS) Reference Architecture  Report. This report identifies commonality and strengths in  the custom approaches used by civilian agencies to provide  solutions that enable the continuous monitoring of IT systems.  This report identifies “essential functional components  of a security risk scoring system, independent of specific  technologies, products, or vendors.” It describes the use of  security automation specifications, such as the SCAP, to enable  continuous monitoring solutions.  In October 2010, the Federal Chief Information Officer  Council’s Information Security and Identity Management  Committee’s (ISIMC) subcommittee on Continuous Monitoring  and Risk Scoring saw the need to create a technical initiative  to expand upon the CAESARS architecture to better scale it to  large enterprises (e.g., the entire U.S. Government). A team of  researchers from the NSA Information Assurance Directorate  (IAD), the DHS Federal Network Security CAESARS team, and  NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) worked together  to respond to this need. The draft CAESARS Framework  Extension (CAESARS-FE) described by Draft NISTIR 7756,  CAESARS Framework Extension: An Enterprise Continuous  Monitoring Technical Reference Architecture, is the output of  this collaboration.  Draft NISTIR 7756 presents an enterprise continuous  monitoring (ConMon) technical reference architecture that  extends the framework provided by the DHS’s CAESARS  architecture. The primary goal of this effort is to enable enterprise  ConMon by supporting the development and deployment  of capabilities that support automated, enterprise-wide  ConMon functions. The concepts, workflows, and subsystems  presented in this document can be used by organizations  seeking to establish federated queries, orchestration of data  collection tasks, data analytics, and presentation and reporting  capabilities across a diverse portfolio of security and IT  products. CAESARS-FE supports IT operations and network  defense capabilities, with compliance reporting as a byproduct  of actual security monitoring and improvement. CAESARS-FE  enables organizations to design, develop, and deploy ConMon  capabilities by leveraging their existing security and IT tools  while minimizing custom tool integration efforts. CAESARS- FE defines the requisite functionality needed to ensure  the interoperability of vendor products while continuing to  encourage security tool vendor participation and innovation.  To advance the state of the art in continuous monitoring  capabilities and to further interoperability within commercially  available tools, CSD is working within the international  http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_scap_messages_for_ifm http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.first.org/global/sigs http://scap.nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov  55  standards development community to establish working groups  and to author and comment on emerging technical standards in  this area. The CAESARS-FE reference architecture will evolve  as greater consensus is developed around interoperable,  standards-based approaches that enable continuous monitoring  of IT systems. In early FY 2014, CSD plans to release an  update to NISTIR 7756 that provides additional guidance for  development of ConMon architectures and solutions based on  ongoing standards activities and feedback.  The NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)  is also working to develop a series of ConMon building blocks  that demonstrate cybersecurity solutions that apply across  multiple industry sectors. The first building block, currently  under development, proposes a standardized approach to  software asset management, providing an organization with  an integrated view of software throughout its lifecycle. The  building block will support:  � Authorization and verification of software installation  media – Verifies that the media is from a trusted  software publisher and that the installation media has  not been tampered with  � Software execution whitelisting – Verifies that the  software is authorized to run and has not been tampered  with  � Publication of installed software inventory – A device  that securely communicates what software is installed to  an organization-wide database  � Software inventory-based network access control – A  device’s level of access to a network is determined by  what software is or is not present on the device and  whether its patches are up to date  The building block document, Continuous Monitoring Building  Block: Software Asset Management, can be viewed at http:// csrc.nist.gov/nccoe/Building-Blocks/conmon.html. In FY 2014,  the team will continue to develop this building block and to work  with vendors to develop a solutions demonstration. Through this  process, CSD provides publically available descriptions of the  practical steps needed to implement the technical approaches  defined by the building block.  Contact:  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  Security Automation Reference Data  Through the NVD and the National Checklist Program (NCP),  NIST is providing relevant and important reference data in the  areas of vulnerability and configuration management. SCAP,  and the programs that leverage it, are moving the information  assurance industry towards being able to standardize  communications, and the collection and storage of relevant data  in standardized formats, and provide automated means for the  assessment and remediation of systems for both vulnerabilities  and configuration compliance.  ªNational Vulnerability Database (NVD)  Security automation reference data is currently housed  within the NVD. The NVD is the U.S. Government repository  of security automation data based on security automation  specifications. This data provides a standards-based foundation  for the automation of software asset, vulnerability, and security  configuration management; security measurement; and  compliance activities. This data supports security automation  efforts based on the SCAP. The NVD includes databases of  security configuration checklists for the NCP, listings of publicly  known software flaws, product names, and impact metrics. A  formal validation program tests the ability of vendor products to  use some forms of security automation data based on a product’s  conformance in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software flaws  and security configuration reference data, also known as  SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD  (http://nvd.nist.gov/).  The NVD is the U.S. Government repository of standards- based vulnerability management reference data. The NVD  provides information regarding security vulnerabilities and  configuration settings, vulnerability impact metrics, technical  assessment methods, and references to remediation assistance  and IT product identification data. As of October 2013, the NVD  contained the following resources:  � Over 58,000 vulnerability advisories with an average of 8  new vulnerabilities added daily  � 52 SCAP-expressed checklists containing thousands  of low-level security configuration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to perform  automated evaluations of system state  � 173 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English prose  guidance and configuration scripts)  � 248 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US- CERT) alerts, 2,771 US-CERT vulnerability summaries,  and 8,140 SCAP machine-readable software flaw checks  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/nccoe/Building-Blocks/conmon.html http://csrc.nist.gov/nccoe/Building-Blocks/conmon.html mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov http://nvd.nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201356  � Product dictionary with over 79,000 operating system,  application, and hardware name entries  � 42,954 vulnerability advisories translated into Spanish  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored by  the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds and SCAP-expressed content from the NVD  website demonstrates increased adoption of SCAP.  NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment Card  Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit card  systems. PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability severity  scores in measuring the risk to payment card servers worldwide  and for prioritizing vulnerability patching. PCI’s use of NVD  severity scores helps enhance credit card transaction security  and protects consumers’ personal information.  Throughout FY 2013, NVD continued to provide access to  vulnerability reference data and security checklists. CSD updated  the NVD to support the latest CPE Naming specification, CPE  2.3, and produces the official CPE dictionary in multiple formats.  NVD now hosts the list of configuration items, complementing  the configuration checklist data already maintained. NVD data  is substantially increasing the security of networks worldwide  and it is a fundamental component of CSD’s security automation  infrastructure. CSD plans to update and improve the NVD in  FY 2014 to include improvements in user navigation, addition  of references to the SP 800-53 Revision 4 security controls  content, and the ability to search, browse, and download  common configuration enumeration (CCE) list data.  http://nvd.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Harold Booth  (301) 975-8441  harold.booth@nist.gov  ª Computer Security Incident Coordination  Recognizing that even well-engineered and administered  computing systems are sometimes successfully attacked, it is  important to establish and maintain processes and procedures  to recover from attacks when defensive mechanisms are  breached. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61 Revision 2,  Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, provides guidance  on establishing and operating a Computer Security Incident  Response Team (CSIRT). A wide-ranging attack may affect  numerous organizations. When an attack has the potential to  affect computing systems in multiple organizations, coordination  among separate CSIRTs can make it possible to limit the  damage caused by an attack, speed recovery operations, and  maintain a higher level of operational security.  CSD is working with the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to develop guidance on Computer Security Incident  Coordination (CSIC). The goal of CSIC is to help diverse  collections of organizations to effectively collaborate in the  handling of computer security incidents. Effective collaboration  raises numerous issues on how and when to share information  between organizations, and in what form information should be  shared. Because different organizations may have substantially  different capabilities for responding to attacks, diagnosing  causes, and handling sensitive attack-related information,  guidance must provide a framework to help organizations  interoperate despite their organizational differences.  This initiative will develop a NIST SP that provides guidance  on how organizations can develop collaborative capabilities in  advance of incidents in order to be prepared to operate swiftly  and with coordination during incidents. The guidance will  cover data handling considerations, such as sensitivity, data  collection and retention practices, data standards, redaction,  and use of tools such as anonymization. The guidance will help  incident responders to understand when data can be shared,  when it should not be shared, and when sharing is essential.  A key element in the approach is the concept of an integrated,  functionally-composed incident response team. The objective  of a functionally-composed team is to enable each organization  to contribute most in technical areas where that organization  has higher relative levels of expertise and readiness, thus  speeding incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication,  and recovery.  In FY 2014, CSD plans to complete a Draft Special Publication  providing guidance for Computer Security Incident Coordination  and organize a workshop focused on the issues of incident  coordination.

While some  security threats are generic in nature, others are targeted at  specific organizations, assets, and missions. Although computer  http://nvd.nist.gov mailto:harold.booth@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov  57  security defenses may forestall many threats, not all can be  prevented, and organizations must therefore develop incident  handling capabilities. Incident handling encompasses a variety  of tasks ranging from preparation prior to an incident, to timely  detection and analysis of an incident, to recovery and repair  from the effects of an incident, to post-incident learning and  improvement. These tasks need to be performed both internally  within specific organizations and externally via coordination  across teams of collaborating organizations.  In the past year, NIST worked with the Department of Homeland  Security’s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team  (US-CERT) to develop Revision 2 of NIST Special Publication  800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.  This  document provides guidance on developing incident handling  capabilities.  The document explains the nature of incidents  and incident handling processes, the structure and operation  of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT), and  provides guidance on handling an incident and coordinating  with other organizations.  SP 800-61 Revision 2 focuses primarily on manual (human)  processes for incident handling and the effective use of human  judgment, guided by applicable regulation and law, regarding  which incident-related information is significant and which  incident-related information may be shared.  The growing  volume of security threats, however, is driving the need for a  more agile incident-handling framework that can operate at  differing scales and speeds as required.  Working in concert with the DHS, NIST is expanding existing  incident handling guidance to enable coordinated information  sharing across disparate CSIRTs operating at differing scales  and speeds. This work will include the analysis of standardized  incident handling data models and the incorporation of these  data models, as appropriate, into both CSIRT information sharing  processes as well as incident/threat knowledge repositories.  This work will describe how mature CSIRTs may operate in a  diverse information-sharing network with both operational and  strategic CSIRTs, as well as industry knowledge repositories.  This may include selective use of security automation where  applicable.  In FY 2014, this work will develop Draft SP 800-150,  Coordinated Computer Security Incident Handling Guidance.

Vulnerabilities in IT products are discovered daily, and  many ready-to-use exploitation techniques are widely available  on the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a  wide variety of audiences, restrictive security configuration  controls are usually not enabled by default. As a result, many  out-of-the box IT products are immediately vulnerable. In  addition, identifying a reasonable set of security settings that  achieve balanced risk management is a complicated, arduous,  and time-consuming task, even for experienced system  administrators.  To facilitate development of security configuration checklists  for IT products and to make checklists more organized and  usable, NIST established the National Checklist Program  (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, Public Law 107-347, and also under the Cyber Security  Research and Development Act, which tasks NIST to “develop,  and revise as necessary, a checklist setting forth settings and  option selections that minimize the security risks associated  with each computer hardware or software system that is, or is  likely to become, widely used within the Federal Government.”  In February 2008, revised Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101  states, “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall  include the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official to  ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) mandated the use of SCAP-validated products for  continuous monitoring of Federal Desktop Core Configuration  (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives to encourage and make  simple agencies’ compliance with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  � Facilitate development and sharing of checklists by  providing a formal framework for checklist developers to  submit checklists to NIST  � Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform to  common operations environments  � Help developers and users by providing guidelines for  making checklists better documented and more usable  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov http://checklists.nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201358  � Encourage software vendors and other parties to develop  checklists  � Provide a managed process for the review, update, and  maintenance of checklists  � Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists  � Encourage the use of automation technologies (e.g.,  SCAP) for checklist application  There are 225 checklists posted on the website; 52 of the  checklists are SCAP-expressed and can be used with SCAP- validated products. In FY 2013, a total of 16 SCAP-expressed  checklists were contributed to the NCP from other federal  agencies and product vendors.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the NCP  website for automated security configuration patch assessment.  NCP currently hosts SCAP checklists for Internet Explorer 9.0,  Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2010, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and other  products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist content,  NCP groups checklists into tiers, from Tier I to Tier IV. NCP  uses the tiers to rank checklists according to their automation  capability. Tier III and IV checklists include SCAP content and  have been validated by the SCAP content validation tool as  conforming to the requirements outlined in SP 800-126, The  Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP). Tier IV checklists are considered production- ready and have been validated by NIST or a NIST recognized  authoritative entity to ensure, to the maximum extent possible,  interoperability with SCAP-validated products.  Tier III checklists use SCAP content to document security  settings and should be compatible with SCAP-validated  products. Tier II checklists document recommended security  settings in a machine-readable, nonstandard format, such as  a proprietary format or a product-specific configuration script.  Tier I checklists are prose-based and contain no machine- readable content. Users can browse the checklists based on  the checklist tier, IT product, IT product category, or authority,  and also through a keyword search that searches the checklist  name and summary for user specified terms. The search results  show the detailed checklist metadata and a link to any SCAP  content for the checklist, as well as links to any supporting  resources associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate submission and  maintenance processes. The manual interface consists of a  web application that guides the submitter through the data  entry process to ensure that all of the required information  is submitted. The submission is validated upon review, and a  report is returned to the submitting organization, verifying either  acceptance or rejection based on the criteria requirements.  For instance, Tier III and Tier IV checklists require validation  using the SCAP Content Validation Tool (this tool is available for  download via http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 2, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for  Checklist Users and Developers, which can be found at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  http://checklists.nist.gov  Contact:  Mr. Stephen Quinn  (301) 975-6967  stephen.quinn@nist.gov  ª United States Government Configuration  Baseline (USGCB) / FDCC Baselines  The United States Government Configuration Baseline  (USGCB) initiative creates security configuration baselines for  information technology (IT) products widely deployed across the  federal agencies. The project evolved from the Federal Desktop  Core Configuration (FDCC) mandate originally described in a  March 2007 memorandum from the U.S. White House Office  of Management and Budget (Memorandum M-07-11). USGCB  helps to improve information security and reduce overall IT  operating costs by providing commonly accepted security  configurations for major operating systems.  Through the National Checklist Program described in SP  800-70 Revision 2, National Checklist Program for IT Products:  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers, a baseline  submitter may express interest in submitting a candidate for  use in the USGCB program.  CSD provides ongoing support for the USGCB automation  content, including the creation of patch updates, assisting  USGCB users in continuously monitoring and assessing security  compliance of information systems. This ongoing monitoring  element supports the Risk Management Framework described in  SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life  Cycle Approach.  During FY 2013, a supplemental USGCB SCAP 1.0 content for  Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and 7 was released to correct an  issue with directory server performance caused by the existing  USGCB content.  http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#tools http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html http://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov  59  The USGCB Program will continue in FY 2014 to provide  ongoing maintenance of the baseline artifacts and to consider  additional applicable platforms.

These configuration guidelines will assist organizations with  hardening OS X technologies and provide a basis for unified  controls and settings for OS X workstations and for mobile  system security configurations for federal agencies.  The configurations will be based on a collection of resources,  including the existing NIST OS X configuration guidance, the OS  X security configuration guide, the Department of Defense (DoD)  OS X Recommended Settings, and the Defense Information  Systems Agency (DISA) OS X Security Technical Implementation  Guide (STIG).  Our team is aggregating appropriately 400 initial  settings, determining which settings will be included in the  configuration baseline, and determining appropriate values for  each included setting.  As the desired configuration items are  established, our team is developing shell scripts that apply the  settings to an OS X 10.8 system. The settings are organized  into three key baselines, which are appropriate for different  environments:  � Enterprise baseline is appropriate for centrally managed,  networked systems.  � Small Office Home Office baseline is appropriate for  systems that are deployed remotely but need to connect  to enterprise networks.  � Special Security Limited Functionality baseline is  appropriate for systems where security requirements are  more stringent and where the implementation of security  safeguards is likely to reduce functionality.  SCAP, defined and discussed in other sections of this report,  is used to express configuration settings and check system  configuration compliance.  During FY 2013, CSD provided a block of initial settings  to Apple and these settings are being posted for the Apple  community on a periodic basis for public review, discussion,  correction and agreement.  Each setting will have a designated  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) number, which will  aid in long-term tracking of the setting.  Once these settings  are vetted and curated by Apple, these settings will be tested  and included in the configuration baselines.  In addition, CSD  is producing a draft guideline, Guide to Securing Apple OS X  10.8 Systems for IT Professionals.  This guidance, similar in  structure to the NIST SP 800-68, Windows XP Security Guide,  will provide detailed information about the security of Apple OS  X 10.8, and will provide security configuration guidelines for the  Apple OS X 10.8 operating system.  In FY 2014, CSD plans to complete the scripts for the  remaining initial settings and post them to the Apple community  for feedback. CSD will also continue the development of  the draft Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.8 Systems for IT  Professionals; this documentation will then be made available  for public comment.

Conformance testing is necessary because SCAP is a complex  specification consisting of eleven individual specifications  that work together to support various use cases. A single  error in product implementation could result in undetected  vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance within agency and  industry networks.  In FY 2013, CSD updated the SCAP Validation Program to  support the testing of products against SCAP version 1.2. The  division published NISTIR 7511 Revision 3, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation Program  Test Requirements, which introduces a modular approach  with respect to the platforms that vendors may support. Public  validation test content was published , thus providing reference  materials that support conformance testing by industry and  end users. The SCAP 1.2 public test content provides vendors  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:kathy.ton-nu@nist.gov mailto:lawrence.keys@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201360  with the materials required for quality assurance testing prior  to entering formal SCAP testing by an NVLAP accredited SCAP  lab. The SCAP Validation Program resources web page was  introduced to provide the public with a centralized location for  all resources and information necessary to prepare products  for SCAP 1.2 validation. The resources provided include  documentation, a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ),  the SCAP test content, and tools for validating and processing  SCAP data streams. CSD updated the SCAP Content Validation  Tool (SCAPVal), used for validating that data streams adhere to  the SCAP specification, to include support for SCAP 1.2. The  update for SCAP 1.2 included open source SCAP reference  implementation tools that are used to process SCAP data  streams.  End users may use the SCAP Validation Program resources  page to learn more about the validation program and download  reference materials. The program currently has seven  independent laboratories accredited for SCAP 1.2 product  testing and several products are undergoing testing.  The SCAP Validation Program will expand in FY 2014 to  provide enhanced testing support and will focus on increased  test coverage by SCAP reference implementation tools.  Expansion plans also include improvements in automated  testing capabilities.  http://scap.nist.gov/validation/  Contact:  Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  ª Cryptographic Programs and Laboratory  Accreditation  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and  the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) were  developed by NIST to support the needs of the user community  for strong, independently tested, and commercially available  cryptographic algorithms and modules. Through these programs,  NIST works with private and governmental sectors and the  cryptographic community to achieve security, interoperability,  and assurance of correct implementation. The goal of these  programs is to support the use of validated algorithms, and  modules and to provide federal agencies with a security metric  to use in procuring cryptographic modules. The testing carried  out by independent third-party laboratories accredited by the  NIST National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP) and the validations performed by the CMVP and CAVP  programs provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and  the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or products  containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP Validated  Modules List and have confidence in the claimed level of  security and assurance of correct implementation.  Cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic module testing  and validation are based on underlying published standards .  As federal agencies are required to use validated cryptographic  modules for the protection of sensitive non-classified  information, the validated modules and the validated algorithms  that the modules contain represent the culmination and delivery  of the division’s cryptography-based work to the end user.  The CAVP and the CMVP are separate, collaborative  programs based on a partnership between NIST’s CSD and the  Communication Security Establishment Canada (CSEC).. The  CAVP and the CMVP validate algorithms and modules used in  a wide variety of products, including secure Internet browsers,  secure radios, smart cards, space based communications,  munitions, security tokens, mobile phones, network and storage  devices, and products supporting Public Key Infrastructure  (PKI) and electronic commerce. A module may be a standalone  product, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card or  it could be a module used in several products, such as a toolkit.  As a result, a small number of modules may be incorporated  within hundreds of products. The CAVP validates cryptographic  algorithms that may be integrated in one or more cryptographic  modules.  The CAVP and CMVP validation programs provide documented  methodologies for conformance testing through defined sets  of security requirements. For CAVP, the validation system  documents are designed for each FIPS-approved and NIST- recommended cryptographic algorithm. See website for a  listing.  Security requirements for the CMVP are found in FIPS  140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules  and the associated test metrics and methods in Derived Test  Requirements for FIPS 140-2. The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2  reference the underlying cryptographic algorithm standards or  methods. The CMVP developed Derived Test Requirements for  FIPS 140-2 defines the test metrics and methods and ensures  repeatability of tests and equivalency in results across the  testing laboratories.  The CMVP reviews the cryptographic modules validation  requests and, as a byproduct of the review, is attentive to  emerging and/or changing technologies and the evolution  of operating environments and complex systems during the  module validation review activities. Likewise, the CAVP reviews  the cryptographic algorithm validation requests submitted by  the accredited laboratories. With these insights, the CAVP and  CMVP can perform research and development on evolving test  metrics and methods. Based on this research, the CAVP and  CMVP publish Implementation Guidance to assist vendors,  http://scap.nist.gov/validation mailto:melanie.cook@nist.gov  61  testing laboratories, and the user community. This guidance  provides clarity, consistency of interpretation, and insight for  successful conformance testing, validation, and revalidation.  Figure 17: FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 Validated  Modules by Year and Level  The unique position of the validation programs gives the  CMVP the opportunity to acquire insight during the validation  review activities and results in practical, timely, and up-to-date  guidance that is needed by the testing laboratories and vendors  to move their modules out to the user community in a timely  and cost-effective manner and with the assurance of third- party conformance testing. This knowledge and insight provide  a foundation for future standards development.  The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated improved quality and  security assurance of cryptographic modules. The latest set of  statistics, which are collected quarterly from each of the testing  laboratories, shows that 7% of the cryptographic algorithms  and 35% of the cryptographic modules brought in for voluntary  testing had security flaws that were corrected during testing.  To date, over 2,004 cryptographic module validation certificates  have been issued, representing over 4,811 modules that were  validated by the CMVP. These modules have been developed by  more than 425 domestic and international vendors.

These tests  exercise the mathematical formulas and the algorithmic  requirements detailed in the algorithm to assure that the  detailed specifications are implemented correctly and  completely. If the implementer deviates from or excludes any  part of these instructions or requirements, the validation test  will fail, indicating that the algorithm implementation does not  function properly or is incomplete.  CAVP-developed validation tests are performed by accredited  testing laboratories on a vendor’s algorithm implementation  using automated known-answer tests, which compare the result  from a cryptographic operation with a specific input against the  expected result. They provide a uniform way to assure that the  cryptographic algorithm implementation adheres to the detailed  specifications.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are not  limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests, and Multi- Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests are designed  to examine the individual components of the algorithm by  supplying known values to the variables and verifying the  expected result. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise  the entire IUT. This test is designed to detect the presence of  implementation flaws that are not detected with the controlled  input of the Known-Answer Tests. The types of implementation  flaws detected by this validation test include pointer problems,  insufficient allocation of space, improper error handling, and  incorrect behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test  (MMT) is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which require the chaining of  information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, CSD has expanded its publications  beyond only an algorithm’s specification into how an algorithm  should be used. Many of these requirements are outside the  scope of the algorithm boundary and therefore cannot be tested  at the algorithm level by the CAVP. Some of the requirements  are within the scope of the CMVP while others are outside the  scope of both the CAVP and the CMVP. In the case where the  requirement is outside the scope of the CAVP and the CMVP, the  fulfillment of the requirements is the responsibility of entities  using, installing, or configuring applications or protocols that  use the cryptographic algorithms. For example, depending on  the design of a cryptographic module, it may not be possible  for the module to determine whether a specific key is used for  multiple purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.

Work is nearing completion on the Technical Report  document, ISO/IEC 30104 “Physical Security Attacks, Mitigation  Techniques and Security Requirements.” A final draft of ISO/ IEC 30104 was completed in December 2013 and circulated for  national body comment.  Work is progressing on ISO/IEC 17825 “Testing methods  for the mitigation of non-invasive attack classes against  cryptographic modules.” The first committee draft of ISO/IEC  17825 was completed in December 2013 and circulated for  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp mailto:sharon.keller@nist.gov mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov  65  national body comment.  Work is progressing on a new standard document, ISO/IEC  18367 “Cryptographic algorithms and security mechanisms  conformance testing.” The third working draft of ISO/IEC 18367  was completed in December 2013 and circulated for national  body comment.  National body comments for the above four documents will  be addressed at the 47th SC 27 WG 3 meeting to be held in  Incheon, Korea, in October 2013.  CSD’s contributions to the development of these international  standards create a strong foundation for the adoption of and  migration from currently used national standards. In particular,  this adoption will promote the international harmonization for  the implementation and testing of cryptographic algorithms and  modules while accommodating individual country preferences  in the choice of approved security functions.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/  Contact:  Mr. Randall J. Easter  (301) 975-4641  randall.easter@nist.gov  ª Cryptographic System Validation  Current validation programs focus on providing a known  level of assurance for cryptographic algorithms and modules.  These are used within the context of a larger system to provide  cryptographic services as a method of protecting the data  within the system.  As information systems continue to become  more complex, the methods used to implement cryptographic  services have also increased in complexity.  Problems with  the use of cryptography are often introduced through the  interaction of cryptographic components with the operating  environment.  This program seeks to specify how cryptographic  components are used as part of a defined cryptographic system  to solve problems with a measureable level of assurance, and  to introduce automated methods of quantifying the level of  assurance.  This program will begin the research required to define a  reference cryptographic systems architecture and example  use cases where cryptographic systems are built from known  cryptographic components that cooperate through trust  relationships to provide a measureable level of assurance.  The  architecture should begin at the lowest level with a hardware  based root of trust, and each cryptographic component should  be added in successive layers to provide assurance in a  systematic way.  This should allow the development of tests that  would measure the correct implementation of cryptographic  components as part of a larger system.  This program will perform research and experimentation in  applicable technologies and techniques that will enable the  efficient testing of the cryptographic capabilities of each layer,  and continuous monitoring capabilities of each cryptographic  component, providing the necessary interfaces to establish  trust relationships with other cryptographic components.  Techniques could include such items as:  � Embedding SCAP like data elements and standard  interfaces to query those data elements during design  and implementation of cryptographic components that  would enable automated testing capabilities;  � Using cryptographic techniques to embed values into  the module that would increase the verifiability and  assurance that the module provides; and  � Using industry-based secure development techniques to  increase the level of trust inherent in software modules  starting with design and implementation.  Research into this area of cryptographic system validation  holds the promise of automating the validation of all  cryptographic components, providing a higher assurance  with less manual effort by using SCAP-based ideas to embed  data elements that instrument the test harnesses used to  validate cryptographic systems.  This would also provide the  instrumentation that could be leveraged to enable a greater  level of situational awareness and security measurement, and  potentially to enable continuous monitoring of cryptographic  systems.

Vulnerabilities  are regularly discovered in software applications, which are  exploited to stage cyber attacks. System administrators need  objective metrics to guide and justify decision making as they  manage the security risk of enterprise networks. The objective  of this research is to develop a standard model for security  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201366  risk analysis of computer networks. A standard model will  enable us to answer questions such as “Are we more secure  now than yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network  configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a  standard model to measure network security will allow users,  vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and consistent  manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies and  measuring security based on how real attackers have penetrated  networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk analysis is based  on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack paths through a network,  providing a probabilistic metric of the overall system risk.  Through this metric, CSD analyzes trade-offs between security  costs and security benefits.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and zero  day attacks.  Handling zero day vulnerabilities is inherently  difficult due to their unpredictable nature.  In FY 2013, CSD  attempted to assess the risk of unknown attack patterns. CSD  developed a new model “k-zero day safety” for zero day attacks.  Existing algorithms for computing this metric are not scalable  as they assume that a complete zero day attack graph has  been generated.  CSD has proposed a set of polynomial time  algorithms for estimating k-zero day safety.  CSD has authored  a paper, “An Efficient Approach to Assessing the Risk of Zero- Day Vulnerabilities,” that received the Best Paper Award at the  tenth International Conference on Security and Cryptography  (SECRYPT 2013), in Reykjavik, Iceland.  In FY 2014, CSD plans to apply attack graphs to study the  effect of diversity for network defense. CSD also plans to  publish the results as a NIST report and as white papers in  conferences and journals.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-riskanalysis-enterprise- networks/  Contact:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  ªAlgorithms for Intrusion Measurement  Figure 22: Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement  The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM) project, newly  formed in FY 2013, furthers measurement science in the area  of algorithms used in the field of intrusion detection. The team  focuses on both new detection metrics and measurements of  scalability (more formally algorithmic complexity). This analysis  is applied to different phases of the detection lifecycle to include  pre-emptive vulnerability analysis, initial attack detection, alert  impact, alert aggregation/correlation, and compact log storage.  In performing this work, the AIM project seeks to enhance our  nation’s ability to defend itself from network-borne attacks.  Much of this scientific research is conducted in partnership  with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). ARL’s participation  helps focus the work on solving immediate critical problems  facing U.S. Government networks. However, research solutions  are made publicly available and are designed to be generally  applicable to as many environments as possible.  In its first year, the AIM project initiated research in each  stage of the detection lifecycle with a focus on graph theoretic  approaches; it has already obtained several major results.  For example, the project has advanced the state of the art  in network scan detection, discovering and then thwarting  circumvention attacks against a highly cited scan detection  algorithm. A paper describing this approach, “Limitations  to Threshold Random Walk Scan Detection and Mitigating  Enhancements,” was published at the First IEEE Conference on  Communications and Network Security. Additionally, the project  developed a hypergraph-based algorithm to use Hamming  distance to aggregate security alert logs more than an order  of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art, while  providing enhanced aggregation.  In FY 2014, the AIM project will continue its scan detection  work and publish its work on log aggregation. It will continue  emerging research on log file compression and alert impact  analysis. Newly initiated work will include investigation of  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/security-riskanalysis-enterprise-networks/  67  known-vulnerability based metrics for comparing the attack  resistance of different networks or a single network over time.

NIST  research has shown that most failures are triggered by one or  two parameters and progressively fewer by three, four, or more  parameters (see graph below), a relationship that is called the  Interaction Rule. These results have important implications for  testing. If all faults in a system can be triggered by a combination  of n or fewer parameters, then testing all n-way combinations  of parameters can provide very strong fault detection efficiency.  These methods are being applied to software and hardware  testing for reliability, safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on  empirical results and real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2013 included completion of a  two-year Cooperative Research and Development Agreement  (CRADA) with Lockheed Martin Corporation, showing  approximately 20% reduction in software test development  cost across a variety of projects; publication of the first  textbook on combinatorial testing; release of an advanced  tool for measuring combinatorial coverage of test sets (jointly  with Centro Nacional de Metrología, Mexico); cooperative  work with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility  analyzing combinatorial coverage measurement for IV&V of  space systems; lectures at conferences and research labs;  and leading (jointly with IBM personnel) the IEEE Second  International Conference on Combinatorial Testing, held with  the International Conference on Software Testing.  Technology transfer activities included publication of several  technical papers; participation in the Maryland Technology  Development Corporation (TEDCO) Technology Transfer  Workshop; presentation of results of the work with Lockheed  Martin; release of enhanced covering array, test prioritization,  and fault location tools; plus seminars and lectures at several  conferences, universities, and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2014 include a second phase of a project  with the NASA IV&V Facility to investigate integration of  combinatorial coverage measurement methods in NASA IV&V  practices; development of new methods and tools for very large  covering arrays (hundreds of variables); lectures at conferences  and research labs; and guiding development of a combinatorial  software test development environment by graduate students  at Carnegie Mellon University which will incorporate NIST  software.  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts/  Contacts:  Mr. Rick Kuhn Dr. Raghu Kacker  (301) 975-3337 (301) 975-2109  kuhn@nist.gov raghu.kacker@nist.gov  ªHardware Roots of Trust  Modern computing devices consist of various hardware,  firmware, and software components at multiple layers of  abstraction. Many security and protection mechanisms are  currently rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trustworthy. A vulnerability in any of  those components could compromise the trustworthiness of  the security mechanisms that rely upon those components.  Stronger security assurances may be possible by grounding  security mechanisms in roots of trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable hardware, firmware, and  software components that perform specific, critical security  functions. Because roots of trust are inherently trusted, they  must be secure by design. As such, many roots of trust are  implemented in hardware so that malware cannot tamper  with the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  A focus area for CSD’s roots of trust research in FY 2013 was  security for mobile devices. CSD worked with government and  industry partners on guidelines on hardware-rooted security  features in mobile devices. These guidelines focus on device Figure 23: Interaction Rule  Program and Project Achievements for FY 2013  mailto:peter.mell@nist.gov mailto:mark.badger@nist.gov http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acts mailto:kuhn@nist.gov mailto:raghu.kacker@nist.gov  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201368  Cybersecurity Framework Policy Machine  Cloud Computing  C ry  pt og  ra ph  y  Standards  Security Practices Verification  Security Controls  Assets  Risk Management Framework  Biometrics  Sup ply  ch ain  ris k m  ana gem  ent  FIPS 140-2  Validated Products List  FISMA  Continuous Monitoring  Mobile Devices  Authorization  EO 13636  Roadmap integrity, isolation, and protected storage features that are  supported by roots of trust. Draft SP 800-164, Guidelines on  Hardware-Rooted Security in Mobile Devices, was released for  public comment in October 2012.  In FY 2014, CSD will release a revised draft of SP 800- 164, based on the feedback received during the public  comment period. In addition, CSD is working with the National  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the  adoption of stronger security technologies in mobile devices.  Using draft SP 800-164 as a basis for an NCCoE building block  activity, CSD and the NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating  system, management software vendors, and application  developers to study, demonstrate, and document how to use  hardware-backed security solutions.  In FY 2013, CSD continued its work to protect fundamental  system firmware, commonly known as Basic Input/Output  System (BIOS). CSD has been working with key members of the  computer industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the  security of BIOS.  CSD will continue its efforts to secure BIOS and other critical  firmware in FY 2014 and will finalize a Special Publication  covering BIOS protections for server-class systems. CSD will  also release an updated draft of SP 800-155, BIOS Integrity  Measurement Guidelines, which will include additional  guidelines for server-class systems and other boot firmware. In  order to encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,  CSD also plans to submit SP 800-147, BIOS Protection  Guidelines, to ISO for standardization.

The overall goal is to achieve  appropriate security assurance for multiple applications by  efficiently verifying the claimed identity of individuals seeking  physical access to federally controlled government facilities  and logical access to government information systems. The  standard contains the minimum requirements for a federal  personal identity verification system that meets the control  and security objectives of Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-12 (HSPD-12), including identity proofing, registration,  and issuance. The standard also provides detailed specifications  that will support technical interoperability among PIV systems  of federal departments and agencies. It describes the card  elements, system interfaces, and security controls required to  securely store, process, and retrieve identity credentials from  the card.

Digital signatures are used to  detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate  the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed  data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating  to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the  claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation, since the  signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time.

The primary  goal of the Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of  NIST s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), is to provide  standards and technology that protects information systems  against threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability  of information and services. During FY 2013, CSD successfully  responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in fulfilling  that mission. Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and  engagement in many national priority initiatives, high-quality,  cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms were developed  and applied that improved information security across the  Federal Government and the greater information security  community.

Current  mobile devices lack the hardware-based roots of trust that are  increasingly built into laptops and other types of hosts. This  document focuses on defining the fundamental security primitives  and capabilities needed to enable more secure mobile device  use. This document is intended to accelerate industry efforts  to implement these primitives and capabilities. The guidelines  in this document are intended to provide a baseline of security  technologies that can be implemented across a wide range  of mobile devices to help secure organization-issued mobile  devices as well as devices brought into an organization, such  as personally-owned devices used in enterprise environments  (e.g., Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)).

This system of  networks includes organizations, people, processes, products,  and services and the infrastructure supporting the system  development life cycle, including research and development  (R&D), design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration,  operations, and disposal/retirement of an organization’s ICT  products (i.e., hardware and software) and services.  Today’s ICT supply chains have increased complexity, diversity,  and scale, while Federal Government information systems have  been rapidly expanding in terms of capability and number, with  an increased reliance on outsourcing and commercially available  products. These trends have caused federal departments and  agencies to have a lack of visibility and understanding throughout  the supply chain of how the technology being acquired is  developed, integrated, and deployed, as well as the processes,  procedures, and practices used to assure the integrity, security,  resilience, and quality of the products and services. This lack of  visibility and understanding, in turn, has decreased the control  federal departments and agencies have with regard to the  decisions impacting the inherited risks traversing the supply  chain and the ability to effectively manage those risks.  SP 800-161 provides guidance to federal departments and  agencies on identifying, assessing, and mitigating ICT supply  chain risks at all levels in their organizations.

To achieve these objectives, mobile  devices should be secured against a variety of threats. The  purpose of this publication is to help organizations centrally  manage the security of mobile devices. Laptops are out of the  scope of this publication, as are mobile devices with minimal  computing capability, such as basic cell phones. This publication  provides recommendations for selecting, implementing, and  using centralized management technologies, and it explains the  security concerns inherent in mobile device use and provides  recommendations for securing mobile devices throughout their  life cycles. The scope of this publication includes securing both  organization-provided and personally-owned (bring your own  device (BYOD)) mobile devices.

The DNS infrastructure is made  up of computing and communication entities called Name Servers  each of which contains information about a small portion of the  domain name space. The domain name data provided by DNS  is intended to be available to any computer located anywhere  in the Internet. This document provides deployment guidelines  for securing DNS within an enterprise. Because DNS data is  meant to be public, preserving the confidentiality of DNS data  is not a concern. The primary security goals for DNS are data  integrity and source authentication, which are needed to ensure  the authenticity of domain name information and maintain the  integrity of domain name information in transit. This document  provides extensive guidance on maintaining data integrity and  performing source authentication. DNS components are often  subjected to denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt  access to the resources whose domain names are handled  by the attacked DNS components. This document presents  guidelines for configuring DNS deployments to prevent many  denial-of-service attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in various  DNS components.

FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal  Employees and Contractors, was developed to define procedures  and specifications for issuance and use of an interoperable  FY 2013 Computer Security Division Publications  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201380  identity credential. This document, SP 800-76, is a companion  document to FIPS 201. It describes technical acquisition and  formatting specifications for the PIV system, including the PIV  Card itself. It also establishes minimum accuracy specifications  for deployed biometric authentication processes. The approach  is to enumerate procedures and formats for collection and  preparation of fingerprint, iris, and facial data, and to restrict  values and practices included generically in published biometric  standards. The primary design objective behind these particular  specifications is to enable high performance and universal  interoperability. The introduction of iris and face specifications  into the current edition adds alternative modalities for biometric  authentication and extends coverage to persons for whom  fingerprinting is problematic. The addition of on-card comparison  offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card activation as well as  an additional authentication method.

FIPS 201  also specifies that this identity credential must be stored on a  smart card. This document, SP 800-73, contains the technical  specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and  use the PIV identity credentials. The specifications reflect the  design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The  goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge  interface, and application-programming interface. Moreover,  this document enumerates requirements where the international  integrated circuit card standards [ISO7816] include options  and branches. The specifications go further by constraining  implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards. Such  restrictions are designed to ease implementation, facilitate  interoperability, and ensure performance, in a manner tailored  for PIV applications.

The security and privacy  controls are customizable and implemented as part of an  organization-wide process that manages information security  and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security  and privacy requirements across the Federal Government and  critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive Orders,  policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/ business needs. The publication also describes how to develop  specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types  of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments  of operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses  security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of  81  security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance  perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented  security capability). Addressing both security functionality  and assurance helps to ensure that information technology  component products and the information systems built from  those products using sound system and security engineering  principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

Validating the XML files to a schema may indicate that the  contained data is formatted correctly and individual values are  within allowable ranges, assuming that the requirements for  FY 2013 Computer Security Division Publications  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201382  that data have been documented in the schema file. However,  schemas are not designed to test the internal consistency of  implementations (i.e., testing for a relationship between two  elements or structures within a transaction). These shortcomings  of XML schema files for use in conformance testing necessitate  that schemas be used only as a component of a complete  testing solution. This complete solution (the test tool) ensures  test coverage of requirements through a combination of schema  validation and conformance tests of the data in the XML files. This  document discusses the test software design including the XML  Data Structures used and Classes implemented. It addresses  the testing phases and the format of the test results; as well  as the user interface and key usability features implemented in  this version of the test tool. Details are provided on a modified  schema that was required to be used in the tool in order to fully  perform tests for all the requirements specified in the AN-2011  standard.

The publication considers  a core set of features in the three common cloud services:  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS),  and Software as a Service (SaaS). The report identifies a set of  security capabilities needed to exercise those features and the  cryptographic operations they entail. An analysis of the common  state of practice of the cryptographic operations that provide  those security capabilities reveals that the management of  cryptographic keys takes on an additional complexity in cloud  environments compared to enterprise IT environments due to:  (a) difference in ownership (between cloud Consumers and  cloud Providers) and (b) control of infrastructures on which both  the Key Management System (KMS) and protected resources  are located.

As a result of these  requests, this glossary of common security terms was extracted  from FIPS, the SP 800 series, NISTIRs, and the Committee for  National Security Systems Instruction 4009 (CNSSI-4009). This  glossary includes most of the terms in the NIST publications.  It also contains nearly all of the terms and definitions from  CNSSI-4009. This glossary provides a central resource of terms  and definitions most commonly used in NIST information security  publications and in CNSS information assurance publications.  For a given term, all definitions from NIST documents are not  included − especially not from the older NIST publications.  Since draft documents are not stable, those terms/definitions  are not referenced. Each entry in the glossary points to one  or more source NIST publications, and/or CNSSI-4009, and/or  supplemental sources where appropriate. The NIST publications  referenced are the most recent versions of those publications  (as of the date of this document).

Boyar, P. Matthews and R.C. Peralta, “Logic Minimization  Techniques with Applications to Cryptology,” Journal of  Cryptology 26(2), 280-312 (April 2013). doi:10.1007/s00145- 012-9124-7.  A new technique for combinational logic  optimization is described. The technique is a two-step  process. In the first step, the non-linearity of a circuit  { as measured by the number of non-linear gates it  contains { is reduced. The second step reduces the  number of gates in the linear components of the  already reduced circuit. The technique can be applied  to arbitrary combinational logic problems, and often  yields improvements even after optimization by  85  standard methods has been performed. In this paper  we show the results of our technique when applied to  the S-box of the Advanced Encryption Standard (FIPS  197, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), National  Institute of Standards and Technology, 2001).  We also show that in the second step, one is faced  with an NP-hard problem, the Shortest Linear Program  (SLP) problem, which is to minimize the number of  linear operations necessary to compute a set of linear  forms. In addition to showing that SLP is NP-hard, we  show that a special case of the corresponding decision  problem is Max SNP-Complete, implying limits to its  approximability.  Previous algorithms for minimizing the number of  gates in linear components produced cancellation- free straight-line programs, i.e., programs in which  there is no cancellation of variables in GF(2). We show  that such algorithms have approximation ratios of at  least 3/2 and therefore cannot be expected to yield  optimal solutions to non-trivial inputs. The straight-line  programs produced by our techniques are not always  cancellation-free. We have experimentally verified  that, for randomly chosen linear transformations, they  are significantly smaller than the circuits produced by  previous algorithms.  Q.H.

This paper describes the changes between FIPS  180-3 and FIPS 180-4. FIPS 180-4 specifies two new  secure cryptographic hash algorithms: SHA-512/224  and SHA-512/256; it also includes a method for  determining initial value(s) for any future SHA-512- based hash algorithm(s). FIPS 180-4 also removes a  requirement for the execution of the message length  encoding operation.  D. Ferraiolo, S. Gavrila, and W. Jansen, “Enabling an Enterprise- wide, Data-centric Operating Environment,” Computer (IEEE)  46(4), 94-96 (April 2013). doi:10.1109/MC.2013.130.  Although access control (AC) currently plays an  important role in securing data services, if properly  envisaged and designed, access control can serve a  more vital role in computing than one might expect.  The Policy Machine (PM), a framework for AC  developed at NIST, was designed with this goal in  mind. The PM has evolved beyond just a concept to a  prototype implementation and is now being directed  toward an open source project.  D. Maughan, W.D. Newhouse and T. Vagoun, “Introducing the  Federal Cybersecurity R&D Strategic Plan,” The Next Wave - The  National Security Agency’s Review of Emerging Technologies  19(4), 3-7 (2012).  In December 2011, the White House Office of  Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released the  Trustworthy Cyberspace: Strategic Plan for the Federal  Cybersecurity Research and Development Program  —a framework for a set of coordinated federal  strategic priorities and objectives for cybersecurity  research. The release of this strategic plan marked  an important milestone by the Federal Government’s  research community. It expresses an understanding  of key causes of cybersecurity deficiencies and  presents research themes with high potential to  significantly improve the security of cyber systems  and infrastructure. The strategic plan is a culmination  of many efforts within the Federal Government, most  notably by the Senior Steering Group for Cybersecurity  R&D (CSIA R&D SSG), the Cyber Security and  Information Assurance Interagency Working Group  (CSIA IWG) of the Federal Networking and IT R&D  (NITRD) Program, and by the Special Cyber Operations  Research and Engineering Interagency Working Group  (SCORE IWG).

We show that a character sum attached to a family  of 3-isogenies defined on the fibers of a certain  elliptic surface over Fp relates to the class number of  the quadratic imaginary number  field Q(\\sqrt{p}). In  this sense, this provides a higher-dimensional analog  of some recent class number formulas associated to  2-isogenies of elliptic curves.  J.A. Montenegro, M.J. Fischer, J. Lopez and R.C.

This work describes the design and implementation  of an auction system using secure multiparty  computation techniques. Our aim is to produce a  system that is practical under actual field constraints  on computation, memory, and communication. The  underlying protocol is privacy-preserving, that is, the  winning bid is determined without information about  the losing bids leaking to either the auctioneer or other  bidders. Practical implementation of the protocol is  feasible using circuit-based cryptographic proofs  along with additively homomorphic bit commitment.  Moreover, we propose the development of a Proof  FY 2013 Computer Security Division Publications  Computer Security Division Annual Report - 201386  Certificate standard.

Zargar, “On Integer Solutions of x^4+y^4- 2z^4-2w^4=0,” Notes on Number Theory and Discrete  Mathematics 19(1), 37-43 (2013).  In this article, we study the quartic Diophantine  equation x^4+y^4-2z^4-2w^4=0. We find non-trivial  integer solutions. Furthermore, we show that when a  solution has been found, a series of other solutions can  be derived. We do so using two different techniques.  The first is a geometric method due to Richmond,  while the second involves elliptic curves.  W.D.

The paper discusses the current status of biometric  standards development activities, with a focus on  international standards developments. Published  standards, as well as standards under development  or planned for the near future, are addressed. The  work of Joint Technical Committee 1 of ISO and IEC  Subcommittee 37 - Biometrics who is responsible  for the development of a large portfolio of biometric  standards in support of interoperability and data  interchange is addressed. The work of two other  JTC 1 Subcommittees, SC 17 Cards and personal  identification and SC 27 - IT Security techniques  who are also developing biometric standards within  their scope of work is discussed. In many cases, the  development of biometric standards impacts other  standards developments including token-based,  security, and telecommunication standards. Specific  examples of this impact are provided. Standards  activities performed in standards development  bodies outside of ISO/IEC JTC 1 are also addressed.  They include the work of ISO Technical Committee  68 – Financial Services – SC 2 – Security, and the  International Telecommunication Union - Study Group  17- Security. Due to the large international impact  and adoption, the development of the ANSI/NIST- ITL standards led by the Information Technology  Laboratory of NIST is also addressed. Although a  detailed discussion on biometric standards adoption  is beyond the scope of this paper, a few examples  of global and national biometric standards adoption  for verification and identification applications are  discussed.

Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) are the  main building block of many classical stream ciphers;  however due to their inherent linearity, most of the  LFSR-based designs do not offer the desired security  levels. In the last decade, using Nonlinear Feedback  Shift Registers (NFSR) in stream ciphers became  very popular. However, the theory of NFSRs is not  well-understood, and there is no efficient method  that constructs a cryptographically strong feedback  function with maximum period and also, given a  feedback function it is hard to predict the period. In this  paper, we study the maximum-length NFSRs, focusing  on the nonlinearity of their feedback functions. First,  we provide some upper bounds on the nonlinearity of  the maximum-length feedback functions, and then we  study the feedback functions having nonlinearity 2 in  87  detail. We also show some techniques to improve the  nonlinearity of a given feedback function using cross- joining.  ª Conference Papers  M. Albanese, S. Jajodia, A. Singhal and L.

Computer systems are vulnerable to both known  and zero-day attacks. Although known attack patterns  can be easily modeled, thus enabling the development  of suitable hardening strategies, handling zero- day vulnerabilities is inherently difficult due to  their unpredictable nature. Previous research has  attempted to assess the risk associated with unknown  attack patterns, and a suitable metric to quantify such  risk, the k-zero-day safety metric, has been defined.  However, existing algorithms for computing this metric  are not scalable, and must assume that complete  zero-day attack graphs have been generated, which  may be infeasible in practice for large networks. In  this paper, we propose a set of polynomial algorithms  for estimating the k-zero-day safety of possibly large  networks efficiently, without pre-computing the entire  attack graph. We validate our approach through  experiments, and show that the proposed algorithms  are computationally efficient and accurate.  S. Banik, S. Maitra, S. Sarkar and M.

Due to the symmetric padding used in the stream  cipher Grain v1 and Grain-128, it is possible to  find Key-IV pairs that generate shifted keystreams  efficiently. Based on this observation, Lee et al.  presented a chosen IV related Key attack on Grain v1  and Grain-128 at ACISP 2008. Later, the designers  introduced Grain-128a having an asymmetric padding.  As a result, the existing idea of chosen IV related Key  attack does not work on this new design. In this paper,  we present a Key recovery attack on Grain-128a, in  a chosen IV related Key setting. We show that using  around γ·2^32 (γ is a experimentally determined  constant and it is sufficient to estimate it as 2^8)  related Keys and γ·2^64 chosen IVs, it is possible  to obtain 32·γ simple nonlinear equations and solve  them to recover the Secret Key in Grain-128a.

Cryptographic applications, such as hashing, block  ciphers and stream ciphers, make use of functions  which are simple by some criteria (such as circuit  implementations), yet hard to invert almost everywhere.  A necessary condition for the latter property is to be  “sufficiently distant” from linear, and cryptographers  have proposed several measures for this distance.  In this paper, we show that four common measures,  nonlinearity, algebraic degree, annihilator immunity,  and multiplicative complexity, are incomparable in the  sense that for each pair of measures, μ1, μ2, there  exist functions f1, f2 with μ1(f1) > _μ1(f2) but μ2(f1)  < _μ2(f2). We also present new connections between  two of these measures. Additionally, we give a lower  bound on the multiplicative complexity of collision- free functions.  R. Chandramouli, “Security Assurance Requirements for  Hypervisor Deployment Features,” Seventh International  Conference on Digital Society (ICDS 2013), Nice, France,  February 24-March 1, 2013, L. Berntzen and C-P Rückemann,  eds., Xpert Publishing Services, Wilmington, Delaware (2013)  120-125.  Virtualized hosts provide abstraction of the  hardware resources (e.g., CPU, Memory) enabling  multiple computing stacks to be run on a single  physical machine. The Hypervisor is the core software  that enables this virtualization and hence must be  configured to ensure security robustness for the  entire virtualization infrastructure. Among the various  combination of hypervisor types and hypervisor  hardware platforms, we have chosen a reference  architecture as the basis for our set of deployment  features. For each deployment feature, this paper  looks at the configuration options and analyzes the  security implications of the options/deployment  feature to derive a set of assurance requirements that  are (a) provided by each of the configuration options or  (b) are required for that deployment feature as a whole  regardless of configuration options.

A network security metric is desirable in evaluating  the effectiveness of security solutions in distributed  systems. Aggregating CVSS scores of individual  vulnerabilities provides a practical approach  to network security metric. However, existing  approaches to aggregating CVSS scores usually cause  useful semantics of individual scores to be lost in the  aggregated result. In this paper, we address this issue  through two novel approaches. First, instead of taking  each base score as an input, our approach drills down  to the underlying base metric level where dependency  relationships have well-defined semantics. Second,  our approach interprets and aggregates the base  metrics from three different aspects in order to  preserve corresponding semantics of the individual  scores. Finally, we confirm the advantages of our  approaches through simulation.  V. C. Hu and K.

Access control (AC) policies can be implemented  based on different AC models, which are fundamentally  composed by semantically independent AC rules in  expressions of privilege assignments described by  attributes of subjects/attributes, actions, objects/ attributes, and environment variables of the protected  systems. Incorrect implementations of AC policies  result in faults that not only leak but also disable access  of information, and faults in AC policies are difficult  to detect without support of verification or automatic  fault detection mechanisms. This research proposes  an automatic method through the construction of a  simulated logic circuit that simulates AC rules in AC  policies or models. The simulated logic circuit allows  real-time detection of policy faults including conflicts  of privilege assignments, leaks of information, and  conflicts of interest assignments. Such detection is  traditionally done by tools that perform verification  or testing after all the rules of the policy/model are  completed, and it provides no information about  the source of verification errors. The real-time fault  detecting capability proposed by this research allows  a rule fault to be detected and fixed immediately  before the next rule is added to the policy/model, thus  requiring no later verification and saving a significant  amount of fault fixing time.

In this manuscript, we present our efforts towards  a framework for exposing the functionality of a mobile  application through a combination of static and  dynamic program analysis that attempts to explore  all available execution paths including libraries. We  verified our approach by testing a large number of  Android applications with our program to exhibit its  functionality and viability. The framework allows  complete automation of the execution process so  that no user input is required. We also discuss how  our static analysis program can be used to inform  the execution of the dynamic analysis program. The  program can serve as an extensible basis to fulfill  other useful purposes such as symbolic execution,  program verification, interactive debugger, and other  approaches that require deep inspection of an Android  application.

Combinatorial testing applies factor covering arrays  to test all t-way combinations of input or configuration  state space. In some testing situations, it is not  practical to use covering arrays, but any set of tests  covers at least some portion of t-way combinations  up to t [less than or equal to] n. This report describes  measures of combinatorial coverage that can be used  in evaluating the degree of t-way coverage of any test  suite, regardless of whether it was initially constructed  for combinatorial coverage.

Attack graphs compute potential attack paths from  a system configuration and known vulnerabilities of  a system. Evidence graphs model intrusion evidence  and dependencies among them for forensic analysis.  In this paper, we show how to map evidence graphs to  attack graphs. This mapping is useful for application  89  of attack graphs and evidence graphs for forensic  analysis. In addition to helping to refine attack graphs  by comparing attack paths in both attack graphs and  evidence graphs, important probabilistic information  contained in evidence graphs can be used to compute  or refine potential attack success probabilities  contained in repositories like CVSS. Conversely, attack  graphs can be used to add missing evidence or remove  irrelevant evidence to build a complete evidence graph.  In particular, when attackers use anti-forensics tools  to destroy or distort evidence, attack graphs can help  investigators recover the attack scenarios and explain  the lack of evidence for missing steps. We illustrate  the mapping using a database attack as a case study.  C. Liu, A. Singhal and D.

Evidence Graphs model network intrusion evidence  and their dependencies, which helps network  forensics analysts collate and visualize dependencies.  In particular, probabilistic evidence graph provide  a way to link probabilities associated with different  attack paths with available evidence. Existing work in  evidence graphs assume that all evidence is available  as one graph. We show how to merge different evidence  graphs with or without the help of attack graphs. We  show this by providing algorithms and a case study  based on attacks on a fileserver and a database server  in a lab network environment. An integrated evidence  graphs that show all attacks launched toward a global  network are more useful for forensics analysts and  network administrators in searching for forensic  evidence and safeguarding networks respectively.

Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC)  has become one of a few options for security in  the quantum model of computing. Though a few  multivariate systems have resisted years of effort from  the cryptanalytic community, many such systems have  fallen to a surprisingly small pool of techniques. There  have been several recent attempts at formalizing more  robust security arguments in this venue with varying  degrees of applicability. We present an extension  of one such recent measure of security against  a differential adversary, which has the benefit of  being immediately applicable in a general setting on  unmodified multivariate schemes.

Lightweight cryptography aims to provide sufficient  security with low area/power/energy requirements  for constrained devices. In this paper, we focus  on the lightweight encryption algorithm specified  and approved in NRS 009-6-7:2002 by Electricity  Suppliers Liaison Committee to be used with tokens  in prepayment electricity dispensing systems in South  Africa. The algorithm is a 16-round SP network with  two 4-to-4 bit S-boxes and a 64-bit permutation. The  S-boxes and the permutation are kept secret and  provided only to the manufacturers of the system  under license conditions. We present related-key  slide attacks to recover the secret key and secret  components using four scenarios; (i) known S-box  and permutation with 2^48 time complexity using  2^16 + 1 chosen plaintexts; (ii) unknown S-box and  known permutation with 2^55 time complexity using  2^22.71 + 1 chosen plaintexts; (iii) known S-box and  unknown permutation with 2^48 time complexity  using 2^16 + 1 chosen plaintexts and 2^12.28  adaptively chosen plaintexts; and finally, (iv) unknown  S-box and permutation, with 2^48 time complexity  using 2^22.71 + 1 chosen plaintexts and 2^31.29  adaptively chosen plaintexts. We also extend these  attacks to recover the secret components in a chosen- key setting with practical complexities.  ªBooks and Book Sections  D.R. Khun, R.N. Kacker and Y. Lei.

Detailed explanations and examples clarify  how and why to use various techniques. Sections on  cost and practical considerations describe tradeoffs  and limitations that may impact resources or funding.  While the authors introduce some of the theory and  mathematics of combinatorial methods, readers can  use the methods without in-depth knowledge of the  underlying mathematics.  Accessible to undergraduate students and  researchers in computer science and engineering,  this book illustrates the practical application of  combinatorial methods in software testing.

Iorga], “Challenging Security Requirements for US Government  Cloud Computing Adoption,” National Institute of Standards  and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, November 27, 2012,  61 pp.  The Federal Cloud Strategy, February 8, 2010,  outlines a federal cloud computing program that  identifies program objectives aimed at accelerating  the adoption of cloud computing across the Federal  Government. NIST, along with other agencies, was  tasked with a key role and specific activities in support  of that effort, including the delivery of the NIST Cloud  Computing Technology Roadmap and the publication of  other Special Publications that address the reference  architecture, definitions, and security aspects of cloud  computing. In order to achieve adoption of cloud  computing for the Federal Government, it is necessary  to address the security and privacy concerns that  federal agencies have when migrating their services  to a cloud environment. To further exacerbate the  situation, there are few documented details that  directly address how to achieve some security aspects  in a cloud environment. The purpose of this document  is to provide an overview of the high-priority security  and privacy challenges perceived by federal agencies  as impediments to the adoption of cloud computing.  The document provides descriptions of the existing  mitigations to these security and privacy impediments.  If no mitigations are listed, then ongoing efforts that  could lead to mitigations are described.

ANNUAL  ACTIVITY  REPORT 2016  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 32  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT THE ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENT BY THE MANAGEMENT BOARD  OF ENISA OF THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT FOR  THE YEAR 2016 OF THE AUTHORISING OFFICER OF ENISA  According to Article 47 of the Financial Regulation applicable to ENISA,  1. The authorising officer shall report to the Management Board on the performance of  his duties in the form of an annual activity report […]. The consolidated annual activity  report shall indicate the results of the operations by reference to the objectives set,  the risks associated with the operations, the use made of the resources provided and  the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control systems, including an overall  assessment of the costs and benefits of controls.  The consolidated annual report shall be submitted to the Management Board  for assessment.  2. No later than 1 July each year the consolidated annual activity report together with  its assessment shall be sent by the Management Board to the Court of Auditors, to the  Commission, to the European Parliament and to the Council.  The Management Board received a copy of the 2016 Annual Activity Report produced  by the Executive Director of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 19 June 2017.  After the Executive Board scrutiny, the assessment by the Management Board of the  consolidated annual activity report (hereinafter AAR) is as follows:  The AAR presents key results in the implementation of the ENISA Work programme  2016 and leads to conclusion that the Agency completed all deliverables agreed  with the Management Board both within time and within budget. 64 activities  have been reported as completed in 2016. Among those activities, the support to  implement key EU policy areas should be highlighted, notably the NIS directive1,  the General Data Protection regulation (GDPR)2, eIDAS regulation3 and the Payment  Services directive 2 (PSD2)4.  A relevant set of published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and events are listed  as part of the result achieved by the Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's  results exceeded the targets established in the Work Programme 2016.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, OJ L  194, 19.7.2016, pp. 1-30, available at: ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj 2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of  such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance),  OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, pp. 1-88, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj 3 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive  1999/93/EC, OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, pp. 73-114, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj 4 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on  payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU  and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 337,  23.12.2015, pp. 35-127, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj  Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work Programme 2016 in this regard and  ENISA’s work is well aligned with the overall European Union agenda for digital single  market. A coherent link is provided between activities planned in the Work Programme  2016 and the actual achievements reached in the reporting period.  The AAR also describes ENISA’s management of resources and the budget execution of  the EU subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were committed at a rate 100%. This  section also reports on results of job screening benchmarking exercise. The support  function is 20,24% of the total statuary staff count, which is below the maximum value  (25%) accepted for the decentralized small size agencies.  The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2014 Discharge, and control results. The  Agency has followed up on recommendations of Internal Audit Service as well as of  the Court of Auditors. In 2016 no new recommendations were issued.  This section  also notes the main categories of deviation that led to exceptions reported in the  Register of Exceptions and mentions that there is one exception registered with high  materiality (above 60.000,00 euros). This case is related to a posteriori commitment.  A human error on a handover provided by a previous staff member created a delay in  concluding the budgetary commitment.  The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate management of risks, high level of  transparency, data protection, business continuity, as well as efforts were undertaken  to improve overall efficiency in all activities.  The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration of assurance of the Executive  Director as well as additional information on human and financial resources,  draft annual accounts and financial reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the achievements of ENISA in 2016.  In the view of the Management Board, the overall performance and quality of  the outputs was high. The Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA  could increase the output in spite of high staff turnover and under condition of  limited budgetary resources. The Management Board expresses its appreciation  to the Executive Director and his staff for their commitment and achievements  throughout the year.  In light of the above assessment, the Management Board requests the Management  Board Secretariat to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to the European  Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, the Permanent Representations of  the Member States and the Court of Auditors.

I am pleased to report that, consistently with previous years, we have successfully  completed our 2016 annual Work Programme, delivering all 64 reports on time and  within budget. These reports cover a wide spectrum of NIS areas ranging from traditional  activities such as incident reporting and baseline security controls to emerging areas  such as smart hospitals, cars and airports, embedded systems and cyber insurance. The  Agency also produced a number of practical studies supporting the implementation of  key EU policy areas, notably the NIS directive, the general data protection regulation  (GDPR), eIDAS and the payment services directive 2 (PSD2). All ENISA reports are  structured in such a way as to bring the key issues to the foreground and to make  concrete proposals on what needs to happen in order to strengthen our European  common approach to cybersecurity.  The Agency continues to deliver operational, financial, legal and compliance requirements  at similar efficiency levels as previous years. During 2016 the Agency began to put in place  a quality management system (QMS), a 3-year project, supported by a quality policy, as  well as large set of standard operation procedures and work instructions (WINs) that aim at  the standardisation of the internal procedures, optimisation of processes, risk mitigation,  and increase in efficiencies. The QMS aims for a constant performance improvement of  the best possible use of the available appropriations for delivering the best results for EU  citizens. In May 2016, the Agency carried out a reorganisation. We consider our colleagues  to be the best asset of ENISA, and bearing this in mind the Agency will continue to promote  the value of the people that contribute to the success of our work.  ENISA has coordinated another successful pan-European exercise, building on the  achievements of past years and once again raising the bar in terms of both objectives and  internal collaboration requirements. The 2016 exercise was a simulation of an EU-wide  crisis triggered by cyber-attacks designed to test EU- and national-level cooperation and  to improve technical and operational capabilities. This was the first exercise to be spread  over 6 months and to incorporate a 2-day intensive operations exercise. The exercise  benefited from exclusive on-site media coverage and was broadcast in 16 EU languages.  ENISA hosted several other successful events including two separate meetings of the  ENISA Industry Group, the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) and a briefing session at the  premises of the European Parliament on cryptography to MEPs. In the scope of the Work  Programme we also hosted a range of high-level technical workshops in important areas.  We have worked in close collaboration with others to support the EU Cybersecurity  challenge, helping the EU to motivate and develop new talent, and the European  Cyber Security Month (ECSM), the EU advocacy campaign promoting awareness on  cybersecurity. Many other successful projects can be seen in this report.  The Agency’s media outreach has improved and we are better prepared to meet  the challenges for the renewal of the mandate in the next few years as the critical  relevance of the Agency is attested by the daily cybersecurity challenges that the EU  faces. During 2016, a new enhanced website with improved functionality, new content  and dedicated sections was launched that allows the Agency to be closer to a larger  number of stakeholders. We have further strengthened our relations with many different  stakeholders and assisted them in making significant improvements to the state of  cybersecurity throughout the EU.  We continue to receive and respond to requests from the Member States and EU  institutions. During 2016, we closed 23 such requests. Most of these requests were in the  area of training, but we also received requests to assist the Commission regarding policy  implementation and also regarding specific cyber vulnerabilities.  The above illustrates the capacity of ENISA staff to work together and deliver on time  and in budget. I believe that our efforts are appreciated by all our stakeholders, which  includes the EU Member States, the European Commission, the European Parliament,  industry and ultimately the EU citizens.  Nowadays the need to optimise the available budget of the European Union as well as  the need to do more with fewer resources is a reality across all the European Union  organisations and bodies. ENISA is not an exception; the Agency continues to pursue  efficiency and effectiveness.  I profit from this opportunity to thank all staff and stakeholders for their contributions  and efforts during 2016, and look forward to delivering our new projects and studies in  the following year and reinforce our support to keep EU cyberspace safe and prepared  for the economic development aimed by all EU citizens.  Udo Helmbrecht Executive Director, ENISA  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1110  ENISA IN BRIEF  The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) was established in 2004  by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European  Parliament and the Council. Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security  extends ENISA’s mandate until 19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and  information security or cybersecurity in Europe.  ENISA supports the EU and the Member States  in enhancing and strengthening their capability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond  to network and information security problems  and incidents. ENISA’s vision is to secure and  enable Europe’s information society and to use its  unique competencies to help to drive the cyber  landscape in Europe.  The Agency works closely together with members of  both the public and private sector, to deliver advice  and guidelines that are based on solid operational  experience. ENISA also supports the development  of European Union (EU) policy and law on matters  relating to network and information security (NIS),  thereby contributing to economic growth in the EU’s  internal market.  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the  ENISA regulation, inputs from the Member States and  relevant communities, including the private sector:  Develop and maintain a high level of expertise of  EU actors, taking into account evolutions in NIS;  Assist the Member States and the EU institutions  and bodies in enhancing capacity building  throughout the EU;  Assist the Member States and the EU institutions  and bodies in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory  requirement of NIS;  Enhance cooperation both between the Member  States of the EU and between related NIS  communities.  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS. HIGHLIGHTS  OF THE YEAR  The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) contributes to  the policy goal of a high level of network and  information security (NIS) within the European  Union. The mission of ENISA is to secure Europe’s  information society, which translates into providing  expertise, supporting policy and creating know-how  to secure over 500 million citizens using every day  ICT to work, live and communicate.  INTRODUCTION  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1312  INTRODUCTION  As a centre of excellence and expertise in the field of  NIS, ENISA has used its expertise to:  advise its stakeholders on trends in the digital  world that affect security;  suggest good practices in various areas in relation  to information, services and systems security;  support the development and implementation of  policy requirements in the area of security and  data protection;  collaborate with stakeholders and contribute to  the NIS capacity and communities’ building.  The Work Programme (WP) of 2016 has resulted in  64 deliverables (which include also workshops and  similar activities) that have been produced in full.  The highlights of 2016 include new best practices  and recommendations for cybersecurity of smart  cars, smart hospitals, smart airports and blockchain.  The Agency kicked off the process of supporting the  Member States in their task of delivering against the  NIS directive, continued ongoing activities such as  Article 13a reporting, computer security incidents  response teams (CSIRT) training and held the biggest  EU cybersecurity exercise ever, Cyber Europe  2016. The Agency supported the EU Cybersecurity  Challenge event, which brought together teams  of students and school pupils from the different  Member States to compete against each other in  a series of technical challenges and, as in previous  years, we played a significant role in supporting the  EU Cyber Security Month (ECSM).  In line with its Work Programme, ENISA released a  number of reports on different aspects of NIS. These  include an updated Threat Landscape, guidelines,  and best practice recommendations regarding  privacy enhancing technologies. Additionally,  ENISA reports focused on issues, including but  not limited to, security and privacy in mobile  environments, standardisation including aspects of  the eIDAS regulation as well as the emerging area  of certification of products. Finally, ENISA compiled  a data breach severity assessment tool in close  collaboration with several Member State DPAs. The  aim of this tool has been to make available a coherent  framework to assess data breach severity across EU  MS. Requests under Article 14 of ENISA Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013 continued unabated as a method  for stakeholders to request assistance, culminating in  15 new requests.  As in previous years, the Agency organised a number  of high profile events throughout the year, such  as the High Level Event, two editions of the ENISA  industry event, the Annual Privacy Forum and the  European Cyber Security Challenge. ENISA also  hosted 14 important thematic workshops and  sessions, gathering experts in the field to discuss  cybersecurity topics.  Most relevant key performance  indicators  In 2016, the Agency delivered against its annual Work  Programme and all deliverables met or exceeded  the key performance indicators set (see Section I for  more details). Notable achievements are mentioned  hereunder along with examples of how the Agency  reached its goals. It should be noted that in March  2016 the ENISA WP2016 was amended to address the  changes in ENISA activities generated by the adoption  of the NIS directive. Key achievements include:  In 2016, ENISA published groundbreaking  reports regarding cybersecurity of smart cars,  smart airports and hospitals, helping asset  owners and all relevant actors in securing  citizens and infrastructures from cyber-attacks  and incidents. (Impact indicator in WPK1.1. NIS  Threat Analysis.)  With the adoption of the NIS directive, ENISA  has cooperated with all EU Member States and  the Commission to define the scope, the actions  related to ENISA and the next steps. More  specifically ENISA has assisted the Commission  and MS in the establishment of the Cooperation  Group envisaged in the NIS directive. The  Agency, as a member of this group, has provided  ideas to the Commission and MS about its  governance structure, its objectives and themes  to focus on as well as its working relationship  with the CSIRT Network. (Impact indicator in  WPK3.2.A. Assist EU MS and Commission in the  implementation of the NIS directive)  ENISA has continued to collect and analyse  national reports on large-scale telecom  security incidents in accordance with Article  13a of the framework directive on electronic  communications. The Agency, has analysed the  national reports, compared them with previous  years, identified new trends and developed  good practices and lessons learned. The Annual  Incidents Report 2016, including the analysis on  the incidents reported, was published around  September 2016. ENISA together with the Article  13a WG provided feedback to the EC on security  aspects regarding the new telecom code. The  feedback was well received, as some of the  observations are included in the new regulation  proposal. (Impact indicator in WPK3.2.C. Assistance  in the implementation of mandatory incident- reporting schemes)  ENISA organised a workshop on National Cyber  Security Strategies together with the Slovakian  Presidency of the EC in November, bringing  together stakeholders from more than 15 Member  States.  Moreover, the updated good practice  guide was published in November 2016 following  validation phase with all relevant stakeholders and  the ENISA NCSS experts group. (Impact indicator in  WPK2.1.B. Assistance in the area of cybersecurity  strategies)  More than 60 participants in the second Trust  Services Forum, including stakeholders from  Supervisory Bodies, Conformity Assessment  Bodies and Trust Service providers.  ENISA organised the fourth pan-European cyber  exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016). CE2016 was  a large-scale distributed technical and operational  exercise started in April 2016, offering the  opportunity to cybersecurity professionals across  Europe to analyse complex, innovative and realistic  cybersecurity incidents. CE2016 overall in the  6-month period engaged over 1 000 participants.  The 2016 edition of the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) resulted in a successful advocacy  campaign with 32 countries taking part, some 455  activities from public and private stakeholders and  an outreach in social media topping the previous  year’s statistics including 429 articles published in  October referring to ECSM. Included within these  results are the 465 courses now registered in 28  countries for the NIS Education map.  ENISA organised the first European Cyber Security  Challenge where 100 of the best young security  talents from 10 different nations fought for the  title in the final of the European Cyber Security  Challenge in Düsseldorf, Germany.  More than 80 participants in the Annual Privacy  Forum (APF) 16: (researchers, policymakers  and industry participants) (Impact indicator in  WPK3.2.B. Assistance in the implementation of NIS  measures of EU data protection regulation.)  ENISA produced a set of deliverables supporting  the implementation of the eIDAS regulation  seeking to shed more light in the service delivery  of trust services.  ENISA compiled a data breach severity assessment  tool in close collaboration with several Member  State DPAs. The aim of this tool has been to make  available a coherent framework to assess data  breach severity across EU MS.  The Agency analysed important aspects of use  privacy protection in a mobile environment.  The emerging area of product certification  received particular attention throughout 2016,  as ENISA supported Commission initiatives and it  coordinated private and public stakeholders in an  effort to shape the field with a view to supporting  future policy.  Finally, reports on incident reporting in the energy  sector and on cyber-hygiene guidance have been  produced, reviewing the prevailing situation across  the EU.  Key conclusions on the effectiveness  of the internal control systems and  financial management  ENISA has consolidated internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to en- sure that policy and operational objectives are achieved  within the applicable legal and financial framework.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory and the Agency  consistently meets its goals in full.  The Agency has put in place an organisational  structure and a set of internal controls that are suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives,  in accordance with the standards and suitable to  mitigate risks associated with the environment in  which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency  adopted a set of 16 internal control standards laying  down the minimum requirements with which its  internal control systems need to comply. Previously  developed internal procedures were grouped  together, prioritised and implemented in the daily  workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2016, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on  the recommendations raised by the auditing bodies  (European Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit  Service of the European Commission). It has been  reported that with reference to 2014, the Agency  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1514  INTRODUCTION  achieved compliance with the internal control  standards; for more details, please refer to Sections 3  to 6 and to the annexes of this report.  Information for the stakeholders  2016 will be remembered as the year of the biggest  DDoS attack, the biggest data breach but also as the  year of the NIS directive:  In autumn 2016 a series of massive (distributed  denial-of-service) DDoS attacks occurred. They  were mainly propagated through compromised  internet of things (IoT) devices. ‘Mirai’, a type of  malware that originally targets IoT devices, was  used to orchestrate massive DDoS. In November  2016, another incident related to a variant of the  Mirai malware took place. An upgraded variant of  the malware targeted customers’ home routers of  Germany’s telecommunication company Deutsche  Telekom. A large number of home routers were hit  by the outage.  During 2016 a series of major and massive data  breaches emerged exposing hundreds of millions  of user emails and passwords (in hashed or  plaintext form). It is understood that the data  were originally sold on the black market, but soon  a lot of them became public. Interestingly, all  these data breaches are dated a few years back,  but they were only disclosed recently, remaining  within private circles for years. Following these  data breaches a wide range of attacks on well- known websites occurred because of users  reusing their passwords.  The directive on security of network and  information systems (the NIS directive) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July  2016. The directive entered into force in August  2016. ENISA’s Executive Director Prof. Dr Udo  Helmbrecht said: ‘The NIS directive is one of  the components for the delivery of digital  single market. Its success lies with the full  engagement of all the stakeholders identified in  the directive, including digital service providers.  Cybersecurity challenges can be only addressed  by working together.’  As underlined by the latest ENISA Threat Landscape,  2016 was characterised by ‘the efficiency of cyber- crime monetisation’. Undoubtedly, optimisation  of cybercrime turnover was the trend observed in  2016. And, as with many of the negative aspects in  cyberspace, this trend is here to stay. On the other  side, this is another confirmation of the necessity  of an agency like ENISA. Positive developments  can be reached only by strengthening the Agency  and putting more resources on the fight against  cyber-attacks. Only an agency with a clear and  comprehensive mandate and adequate resources  can contribute to better face all the cybersecurity  challenges that are arising and augment its  outreach to the benefit of different stakeholders  and asset owners across Europe.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 17  This Annual Activity Report (AAR) for 2016 follows the  structure of the ENISA Work Programme (WP) 2016  to assist reader understanding of what was achieved.  The WP 2016 was aligned with the strategic objectives  featured in the strategy and the multiannual planning  of the Agency. The strategic objectives (SO) of the WP  2016 were as follows:  SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of  expertise of EU actors taking into account evolutions  in network and information security (NIS).  SO2: To assist the Member States and the  Commission in enhancing capacity building  throughout the EU.  SO3: To assist the Member States and the  Commission in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory  requirements of network and information security.  SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the  Member States of the EU and between related  NIS communities.  In the following sections, the results of WP 2016  implementation are presented for each of the  abovementioned objectives. After the description of  the concrete results for each strategic objective, the  achievements against indicators and the detailed  results for each deliverable are presented in tables.  It should be noted that the ENISA WP2016 was  amended in March 2016 to address the changes in  ENISA activities generated by the adoption of the NIS  directive. This activity report follows the structure of  the amended WP2016.  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO1 — DEVELOP  AND MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF NIS  EXPERTISE OF EU ACTORS  SO1 aims to develop and maintain a high level of  expertise of EU actors, taking into account evolutions  in network and information security (NIS). In  2016, this SO covered the Threat Landscape and  risk assessment, including new technologies and  specific areas such as smart cars, smart airports and  smart hospitals as well as information sharing and  good practices and recommendations for critical  information infrastructure protection (CIIP).  List of work packages and short description  WPK 1.1 — Improving the expertise related to  critical information infrastructures In this work package (WPK) ENISA developed good  practices on emerging smart critical infrastructures  and services. This work provided smart critical  information infrastructure and service providers and  developers with good security and resilience practices  to be used when designing, developing and deploying  such services in order to minimise the exposure  of such networks and services to all relevant cyber  threat categories.  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF WORK  PROGRAMME 2016I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1918  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  WPK 1.2 — NIS Threats Landscape analysis Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern  IT systems in any context requires recognising  and adapting to changes in the evolving threat  environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to  predict all future threats (security practices have often  been dramatically changed as a result of so called  ‘black swan’ events, which are notoriously difficult  to predict), it is possible to predict the evolution of  certain threats with a reasonable degree of accuracy  based on past data.  ENISA supported its stakeholders by compiling  existing data on threat evolution and tailoring  this data to the needs of specific stakeholder  communities. The approach covered threats across  all sectors, whilst identifying specificities particular to  particular communities in line with the goals of the  WP. This is a more scalable approach than carrying  out threat analysis directly.  WPK 1.3 — Research and development, innovation Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe  in the field of NIS, and this area is extensively  supported by European-funded programmes,  research is usually not focused on the aspects  where NIS policies need available technologies  to move forward on their implementation. ENISA  aims in this WPK to contribute to the various  consultations launched by the Commission in the  area of NIS. Such consultations may be conducted  in the context of setting the research priorities for  future calls for proposals or in the context policy  initiatives launched or about to be launched by  the Commission. Furthermore, during 2016 ENISA  prepared a set of recommendations on aligning  research programmes with policy in the area of NIS.  1.1.1 WPK 1.1: Improving the expertise  related to critical information  infrastructures  In this WPK ENISA developed good practices on  emerging smart critical infrastructures and services  using the concept of the internet of things (IoT) to  deliver new, innovative business models and services.  The reports provide smart critical information  infrastructure and service providers and developers  with good security and resilience practices when  designing, developing and deploying such services  in order to minimise the exposure of such network  and services to all relevant cyber threat categories.  This builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of  smart cities (WP 2015), smart grids (WP 2012-2015)  and intelligent transportation systems (WP 2015).  The main areas of work of this WPK are as follows.  ENISA defines smart cars as systems providing  connected, added-value features in order to  enhance car users experience or improve car  safety. It encompasses use cases such as telematics,  connected infotainment or intra-vehicular  communication. The 2016 report on cybersecurity  of smart cars listed the sensitive assets present in  smart cars, as well as the corresponding threats,  risks, attack scenarios, mitigation factors and  possible security measures to implement. Smart  cars subject matter experts were contacted to reflect  the needs of Europe’s automotive cybersecurity  stakeholders. The results are further aligned with  the C-ITS Platform run by DG Mobility and Transport,  to synergise efforts and the input from the ENISA  Cars and Roads SECurity (CaRSEC) Expert Group to  finalise the results. The goal is to secure smart cars  today for safer autonomous cars tomorrow.  The notion of smart hospitals is introduced when  internet of things (IoT) components are supporting  core functions of a hospital. Due to the great  number of significant assets at stake (patient  life, sensitive personal information and financial  resources) information security is a key issue  for smart hospitals. ENISA identified the assets  comprising the smart infrastructure inside the  hospital walls, threats faced by smart hospitals  as well as security measures set to address them.  Based on attack scenarios, the Agency identified  good practices and finally recommendations for  both healthcare operators as well as IoT devices  manufacturers and vendors.  Smart airports are those airports making use of  integrated internet of things (IoT) components to  bring added-value services. By integrating smart  components, airports are exposed to a larger  attack surface and new attack vectors. In response  to the new emerging threats faced by smart  airports, this 2016 ‘Securing Smart Airports’ report  provides a guide for airport decision-makers  (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of Operations)  and airport information security professionals, but  also relevant national authorities and agencies  that are in charge of cybersecurity for airports.  Based on an in-depth examination of existing  knowledge as well as validation interviews with  subject matter experts, this report highlights  the key assets of smart airports. Built on  this, a detailed analysis and threats mapping  was conducted with a particular focus on the  vulnerabilities of smart components.  For each area, ENISA identified all relevant public  and private stakeholders, engaged them in working  groups and jointly took stock of and analysed the  current situation in terms of cybersecurity and  resilience, placing emphasis on communication  security. The Agency also identified EU and national- funded projects in the area of IoT and M2M  communication, liaised with them, analysed their  findings and deliverables, and further engaged them  in corresponding expert groups. Special emphasis  was given to the resilience and robustness of such  smart critical information infrastructure and services.  Based on the consultation with stakeholders and  desktop analysis and research, ENISA developed  good practices and propose baseline security  requirements targeted at EU and national  policymakers, operators and manufacturers.  1.1.2 WPK 1.2: Network and information  security threats landscape analysis  The main goal of this work package was to develop the  current cyber threat landscape by the collection and  collation of publicity available information. The resulting  report includes current threats, as well as threat trends  in NIS, information about different attack vectors,  classification schemes for cyber threats (i.e. taxonomies)  and emerging technologies. This information will allow  the interested readers to achieve a more complete  coverage of the threat analysis life cycle.  In addition, as in previous years, in-depth studies on  two emerging technologies for risk assessment and  threat analysis were performed: ‘Hardware Threat  Landscape and Good Practice Guide’ and ‘Ad hoc and  sensor networking for M2M Communications Threat  Landscape and Good Practice Guide’. These reports  identified related network assets and the security  threats, challenges and risks arising from these  assets for each technology and identified security  mechanisms and good practices for each applicable  environment. Finally, based in the collated information,  technical, policy and organisational recommendations  for proactively enhancing the security for each  emerging technology were provided.  In this WPK ENISA  developed good  practices on emerging  smart critical  infrastructures  and services using  the concept of the  internet of things  (IoT) to deliver new,  innovative business  models and services.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 2120  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.1.3 WPK 1.3: Research and  development, innovation  In 2016, ENISA’s Crypto Challenge (which we named  Crypt a Bite) was launched. The pilot study aimed to  capture the interest of young students for information  security and cryptography. We especially aimed at  students with an interest in maths and logic. In order  to catch the attention of the ‘non-geek’, we decided on  a gamification of the contest. The pilot was successful  in the sense that a large fraction of registered users  did participate in the actual competition. Further, it  is possible to attract students with a viral campaign;  however, we also learned that a longer, more  coordinated advertisement phase is needed to reach  more students. For the pilot more than 700 users  registered and performed the training challenges of  phase I of which 94 participated at the final round. The  full report is published under the name Crypt a Bite —  ENISA’s Crypto Challenge.  Another aspect of this WPK for 2016 was the  preparation of a set of recommendations on aligning  research programmes with policy in the specialised  area of NIS. The specialised field of Network and  Information Security (NIS) is supported extensively by  EU-funded research programmes, but is not always  focused on the aspects where emerging policy and  legislative initiatives need available technologies to  move forward on their implementation. The scope  of this report was to summarise achievements that  have significantly promoted specific pillars of NIS,  identify specific outcomes that promoted and support  emerging policy and legislative initiatives, namely  eIDAS, GDPR, and provide recommendations on  the cPPP and the formulation of forthcoming work  programmes. During the preparation of this report,  selected stakeholders from academia, research, public  authorities and research and technology organisations  were contacted to provide their subject matter  experience and expertise.  Finally, in order to support the R & D in this area,  ENISA prepared a study on the security aspects of  virtualisation. The recent and widespread adoption  of virtualisation technologies has changed the  traditional view of ICT, as virtualisation can provide a  dramatic increase in the efficiency and effectiveness  of complex organisations and communities.  However, virtualised environments are increasingly  becoming targets of cyber-attacks: More and more  elaborate and specialised attacks are currently  devised to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses  at the virtualisation layer. The report prepared by  ENISA provides an analysis of the current status  of security of virtualisation, by presenting current  technologies affected, risks, efforts, gaps, and the  impact the latter have on environments based on  virtualisation technologies. The final objective of the  ‘Study on security aspects of virtualisation’ report is to  provide the basis to understand the main issues and  challenges related to the security in virtualisation, and  provide a look at common best practices to implement  a secure virtualised environment.  SO1 — To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of European Union actors, taking  into account evolutions in network and information security  WPKs, impact indicators Achieved results  WPK 1.1.: Improving the expertise related to critical information infrastructures  By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use  ENISA’s recommendations on smart cars.  Over the year, several authorities were involved in  the study and the activities of the ENISA Cars SECurity  (CaRSEC) Expert Group.  We have received valuable input and feedback from  French Ministry of Interior — Gendarmerie Nationale,  German Federal Office for Information Security,  Joint Research Center, ANSSI — French Network and  Information Security Agency and Kuratorium Sicheres  Östereich.  By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use  ENISA’s recommendations on smart health devices,  services and infrastructures.  ENISA has built this study based on healthcare  organisations (hospitals) from across the EU, namely  with representatives from Oulu University hospital,  Finland; Hospital Clinico San Carlos Madrid, Spain; HUG  Geneva Hospitals, Switzerland; Association of Hospitals  in Vienna, Austria; NHS Digital UK; National Oncology  Hospital of Sofia, Bulgaria; Jena University Hospital,  Sweden; Munich Municipal Hospital, Germany.  By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use  ENISA’s recommendations on smart airports.  The study involved several major airports across Europe  and related entities such as European Commission,  European Aviation Safety Agency, Eurocontrol, SESAR  Joint Undertaking and ACI Europe.  WPK 1.2: Network and information security Threats Landscape analysis  In 2016 at least 15 companies and five Member States  participate in the ENISA stakeholder groups established  to perform the work.  More than 15 companies and more than 5 Member  States contributed in the threat analysis/landscape  process as well as the validation of the work.  By 2017 produced results are referenced by at least 500  stakeholders in the area of threat/risk assessment.  ENISA Threat Landscape results have been reused within  multiple stakeholders, both within and outside EU. In  various discussions, blogs and presentations, references  to ENISA Threat Landscape 2016 have also been found  widely referenced in different social networks. During the first week of dissemination, the ENISA Threat  Landscape 2016 was disseminated via social media  with the following rates: ca. 200 views and 70 likes in  LinkedIn, ca. 2 000 impressions in Twitter ca. 15 re- tweets and ca. 50 engagements. This response from the  community is considered successful. Additional analytics  will be obtained after a sufficient time window.  By 2017 produced results are downloaded by at least 10  000 individuals.  Various ENISA Threat Landscape reports (ENISA Threat  Landscape and Thematic Landscapes) were downloaded  for more than 20 000 individuals in 2016. These numbers  are referring to 2015 deliverables disseminated in  2016. For the time being and after ca. one week of  dissemination, the uptake of ENISA 2017 deliverables  counts ca. 2 500 downloads.  WPK 1.3: NIS Threats Analysis  At least 10 experts from the community to participate in  the validation of the results of the studies.  More than 10 experts from academia, universities and  research and technology organisations participated in  the validation and review of the results of the studies.  At least five independent high-level experts from the  cryptography field to participate in the quality review  and the panel for the cryptographic challenges.  Our contractor created a panel with experts  knowledgeable in cryptography and experienced in the  creation of similar challenges.  At least 50 individuals/teams participate in the  cryptographic challenges.  About 700 in round I and 94 in round II participated in  the cryptographic challenge  At least six research experts and networking experts  from industry to contribute to the study on security  aspects of virtualisation.  More than six research and networking experts  contributed and reviewed to the study.  1.1.4 General results. Achievement of impact indicators for Objective 1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 2322  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.2 KEY RESULTS IN THE IMPLEMEN- TATION OF SO2 — ASSISTANCE IN  ENHANCING CAPACITY BUILDING  THROUGHOUT THE EU  SO2 aims at providing assistance to MS and EU  institutions and bodies, as well as the private sector  by supporting NIS enhancement of capacity building  through the EU. ENISA worked together with Member  States and EU institutions to assist them in capacity  building across the EU. In particular, the Agency  worked together with all relevant stakeholders to  ensure that the approach adopted has been coherent  across all EU stakeholders involved.  List of work packages and short description  WPK 2.1 — Assist Member States’  capacity building One of the main goals of this work package (WPK) has  been to develop and improve activities related to the  operational security support programme. In 2016,  ENISA built upon its work in the operational security  area, and updated the impact assessment related  to this area to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ via a  dialogue with relevant stakeholders.  Another main goal of this WPK has been to support  the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders,  such as the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to  develop and extend the necessary capabilities in  order to meet the ever-growing challenges to secure  their networks and data.  WPK 2.2 — Support EU institutions’ capacity building In this WPK ENISA aims at stepping up in its dialogue  with EU institutions and support them in reinforcing  their NIS capacity building. The Agency provided  its key stakeholders with timely and high-quality  responses to NIS developments.  WPK 2.3 — Assist private sector capacity building One of the main obstacles for the implementation  of wide and effective cybersecurity programmes  in organisations has been the lack of a common  language among managers and technical staff, which  makes it difficult for the latter to transmit the current  security scenario to the former. ENISA reviewed cyber  hygiene practices across the Member States for the  purpose of helping increase cybersecurity awareness  and promote a culture of cybersecurity within  organisations and Member States.  The agency collected information on prominent  experiences across various MS by focusing on the  theme of cyber-hygiene and associated guides that are  currently in use in various MS.  WPK 2.3 — Assist in improving the general  awareness ENISA delivered against its long-standing goal of the  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign  that dates back to 2010 and it expanded its outreach  with numerous activities in the Member States,  reaching directly or indirectly a large number of  European citizens. By coordinating the ECSM, ENISA  seeks to contribute to the efficient management  of MS capability in awareness raising on network  and information security and on the exchange of  good practices among its key stakeholders as it has  consistently done over time.  Additionally, ENISA promoted capacity building in  the security community by launching a competition  named the ‘ENISA cyber challenge’. Its goal was to  increase the interest in NIS by promoting excellence in  the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback  on the areas of interest for the communities.  1.2.1 WPK 2.1: Assist Member States’  capacity building  1.2.1.1 WPK 2.1.A: Assistance in the area of  operational security and NIS operational training  Objectives:  Facilitate voluntary information sharing techniques  to enhance quality of collection;  Extend mutual interactions with stakeholders in  MS-wide area for incident response collaboration;  Build upon successful work in the area of ‘training  methodologies and impact assessment’;  Update training material for operational  communities (e.g. CSIRTs);  Develop new sets of training for NIS;  Further develop and apply ENISA  recommendations for baseline capabilities;  Provide technical training for MS and EU bodies.  22  ENISA worked together  with Member States  and EU institutions to  assist them in capacity  building across the EU.

Mapping of deliverables into papers/publications/activities  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 25  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  24  One of the main goals of this WPK was to perform  sustainable research, development and improvement of  activities related to the multiannual development for  the operational security support programme.  In 2016, ENISA updated the training methodologies  and ‘baseline capabilities’ report. The goal was to  concisely identify ‘lessons learned’ via a dialogue with  relevant stakeholders, and to reflect constantly on  developing CSIRT activities for the coming years.  Another main goal of this WPK is to help the EU Member  States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU  institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop and  extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the  ever-growing challenges to secure their networks.  Most of the activities in this WPK target maintaining  and extending the collection of good practice  guidelines in various areas of operational- capability building. In addition, ENISA continues to  offer support to the Member States by providing  them with means to enhance their national and  governmental CSIRT capabilities.  Emphasis in this WPK was put on supporting  operational bodies and communities (namely CSIRTs,  but other communities where appropriate) via  concrete advice (such as good practice material) and  concrete actions (such as CSIRT training).  In 2016, ENISA updated and expanded its  comprehensive set of training and exercises,  consisting of material that can be used by both  students and trainers. The new training material  provides a step-by-step guide on how to address/ respond to incidents/issues as an incident handler  and investigator. The material is technical and aims  to provide a guided training both to incident handlers  and investigators, while providing lifelike conditions.  New topics in the training material cover aspects of  forensic analysis and incident response. The updated  training material provides new table top exercises in the  areas of incident handling management, including the  setting up of CSIRTs.  1.2.1.2 WPK 2.1.B: Assistance in the area of  cybersecurity strategies  ENISA published its first National Cyber Security  Strategy Good Practice Guide in 2012. Since then,  EU Member States and EFTA countries have made  great progress in developing and implementing their  strategies. The new updated guide includes up-to- date information on the different steps, objectives  and good practices for the implementation of NCSS  and analyses the status of NCSS in the European  Union and EFTA area. The aim is to support EU  Member States in their efforts to develop and update  their NCSS. Therefore, the target audience of this  guide are public officials and policymakers. The guide  also provides useful insights for the stakeholders  involved in the lifecycle of the strategy, such as  private, civil and industry stakeholders.  This guide places a special emphasis on the  evaluation and maintaining phase. Suggestions for  possible and indicative key performance indicators  (KPIs) for objectives of the strategy are described.  In addition, the guide presents the status of  implementation of NCSS among EU Member States  and identifies gaps.  ENISA acts as a facilitator in this process by bringing  together MS and the private sector with varying  degrees of experience to discuss and exchange good  practices, share lessons learned and identify challenges  and possible solutions.  In 2016, ENISA updated  and expanded its  comprehensive set of  training and exercises,  consisting of material  that can be used by both  students and trainers.

Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.2.1.3 WPK 2.1.C: Assistance in the area of privacy  and trust  ENISA supported Member States in their own decision- making process, by providing advice and referencing to  the appropriate ENISA studies in the area of privacy  and trust. While this was a task-on-demand, the  Agency provided appropriate tools that facilitate  Member State implementation of the provisions set  out in the trust services regulation and in the general  data protection regulation. Supervisory bodies of the  MS were involved in this line of work.  Specifically, in the area of personal data breaches,  ENISA compiled a data breach severity assessment  tool in close collaboration with several Member State  DPAs. The aim of this tool has been to make available  a coherent framework to assess data breach severity  across EU MS.  In addition to this work, defined by the ENISA Work  Programme, ENISA supported the Commission in the  preparation of the draft ePrivacy regulation.  1.2.2 WPK 2.2: Support European Union  institutions’ capacity building  1.2.2.1 WPK 2.2.A: Information notes on NIS:  production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  The main goal of this work package was to provide  information on NIS issues and developments  that reached a certain level of public attention  to ENISA’s key stakeholders, in a timely manner.  Through info notes, the Agency was able to timely  respond to NIS occurrences beyond its annual  work packages, closely following the rapid updates  and significant developments in the field of cyber  security. Each of the different types of notes focused  on highlighting facts and shortcomings behind  NIS issues, often providing recommendations for  addressing those shortcomings in the long term.  One of the essential aims of info notes was to provide  an independent, unbiased and ‘calm’ opinion to the  Agency’s stakeholders. In addition to previous years’  dissemination of info notes to ENISA’s key stakeholders,  info notes were also published online at ENISA’s  website, rendering them publicly available to any  interested party.  2.2.2.2 WPK 2.2.B: Reinforcement of the NIS of  Union institutions, bodies and agencies  In this WPK ENISA aimed to enhance the dialogue  among European institutions and support them  in reinforcing their NIS. In 2016, concrete actions  occurred.  ENISA has identified and liaised with all relevant  stakeholders within European institutions and  bodies. In cooperation with all relevant European  institutions and bodies, the Agency took stock of and  initiated an analysis of existing regulations, policies,  procedures and practices of many EU institutions  related to their NIS.  Through stocktaking and analysis, ENISA identified  overlaps and gaps between all these regulations  and policies. These findings were discussed with all  relevant stakeholders from EU MS in the context of  the NIS Directive Cooperation Group. This might pave  the way for a permanent strategic dialogue among all  European institutions and bodies on the future of NIS  policy in the EU.  This dialogue resulted in important recommendations  that will allow the simplification of policies, reduction  of overlaps, identification of synergies, creation of  awareness about NIS challenges and even proposals  for new actions to address identified gaps. This will  help European institutions and bodies to better focus  their efforts and properly use their resources to meet  the needs of EU MS and the private sector.  Considering the sensitiveness of the information that  ENISA might be provided with by European institutions,  deliverables were restricted in distribution.  Building on this work, ENISA will address, in future  work programmes, the setting up of a European  institution NIS contingency plan, the organisation of  dedicated EU institution cyber incidents exercises, and  the launch of awareness-raising initiatives.  1.2.3 WPK 2.3: Assist private sector  capacity building  ENISA has reviewed best practices in Member  States on how to reach out to the private sector  to create increased cybersecurity awareness and  skills. Additional ways to promote a culture of  cybersecurity have been analysed. In 2016, the  agency focused on studying and analysing cyber  hygiene guides across selected Member States that  have such instruments and policies in place and it  came up with a set of recommendations for issuers of  such guides and their users.  1.2.4 WPK 2.4: Assist in improving  general awareness  The growing need for IT security professionals is  widely acknowledged worldwide. To help solve this  shortage of skill, many countries launched national  cyber security competitions addressed towards  students, university graduates or even non-ICT  professionals with a clear aim: find new and young  cyber talent and encourage young people to pursue a  career in cyber security.  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)  leverages these competitions by adding a pan- European layer. Top cyber talents from each  participating country meet to network and collaborate  and finally compete against each. Contestants are  challenged in solving security-related tasks from  domains such as web security, mobile security, crypto  puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics and in the  process collect points for solving them.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that  brings together young talent from across Europe to  have fun and compete in cyber security.  The final stage of ECSC was held in Düsseldorf,  Germany between 7 and 9 November 2016. Ten  countries attended the event: Austria, Estonia,  Germany, Greece, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Romania,  Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The  participants were expected to discover vulnerabilities  in web applications, binaries and document files,  solve crypto puzzles and hack hardware systems.  However, technical skills were just one part of the  challenge. As time and resources were limited,  teamwork skills were also extremely important. The  competition ended with a presentation by each team.  Between the contestants, coaches and judges, more  than 130 people actively took part in the event. The  competition was also accompanied by a conference  with industry representatives and a job fair.  From its side, the 2016 edition of the European  Cyber Security Month (ECSM) resulted in a successful  advocacy campaign with 32 countries taking  part, some 455 activities from public and private  stakeholders and an outreach in social media topping  the previous year’s statistics including 429 articles  published in October referring to ECSM. Included within  these results are the 465 courses now registered in 28  countries for the NIS Education map.  European Cyber Security Challenge 2016  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 2928  PART I.

In 2017, information and feedback from different EU  institutions were used for the creation, and as reference,  on different info notes. In the same way on-demand  topics info notes were created.  In 2017 improved mechanism for producing and  distributing of info notes.  In 2017 info notes will be contextualised according  to ENISA’s Threat Landscape and their content will  be updated as deemed necessary in order to provide  a more coherent representation of NIS occurrences  amongst the two work packages.  At least two EU bodies and five public stakeholders will  receive the timely information on NIS incidents and  significant developments in the field.  In 2016, info notes are published on the ENISA website  and are publicly available for all interested stakeholders  and announced on relevant channels.  1.2.5 General results. Achievement of impact indicators for Objective 2  SO2 — To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity building  throughout the EU  WPKs, impact indicators Achieved results  WPK 2.2.A: Information notes on NIS: production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  ENISA’s expertise regarding the MS NIS capacity  development is also to be offered to EU institutions,  agencies and bodies (hereinafter: ‘EU institutions’), in  cooperation with CERT-EU.  ENISA, drawing from its expertise in the area of National  Cyber  Security Strategies (NCSS), NISD, and CIIP, took  stock of sectorial initiatives developed by EU institutions,  mostly the Commission.  The Commission (DG CNECT) actively participated  in the study and provided additional comments and  suggestions, and as a result helped in validating the  content of it. The end result is also presented in the first  official meeting of the NISD Cooperation group.  Enhanced knowledge of EU institutions regulations,  policies, procedures related to their NIS.  The stocktaking also allowed EU institutions to better  understand the complex ecosystem, identify possible  overlaps and gaps. Through this, they developed better  knowledge and expertise on EU institutions regulations,  policies and procedures.  Identification of well-functioning practices that could be  disseminated to all or relevant EU institutions, as well as  information concerning critical weaknesses that should  be addressed.  The report identified several good practices widely used  in several sectorial EU initiatives. Examples include  PPPs, regulatory provisions (e.g. baseline requirements,  incident reporting), information sharing, national  NCSS. Such examples also provided better insights and  knowledge benefiting EU institutions but also ENISA.  Identification of future actions that ENISA could initiate  in order to further reinforce the NIS of EU institutions.  The key conclusion was the necessity to analyse all these  initiatives and identify possible synergies and gaps. In  addition, it is important to agree how the EU institutions  develop their NIS policies in terms of sectors. Such discus- sion has started within the Cooperation Group of the NISD.  WPK 2.3: Assist private sector capacity building  At least five MS and five private sector stakeholders  contribute to the production of the guidelines for  MS to reach the private sector through cybersecurity  awareness dissemination activities.  The stock taking activity of cyber hygiene practices across  the EU resulted in identifying three MS who actively reach  the private sector via guidelines that they produce.  At least 15 private sector stakeholders coming from  different MS, sectors of activity and size participate in  the elaboration of the recommendations for ICT security  staff on improving management level cybersecurity  awareness.  A review of cyber hygiene practices was carried out across  the EU and specifically to establish the understanding  of the private sector’s engagement with national cyber  hygiene programmes. 15 private sector stakeholders were  interviewed for the purpose of the review.  WPK 2.4: Assist in improving general awareness  At least 50 individuals from MS participate in the ENISA  cyber challenge.  More than 130 people, from 10 EU MS, actively took part  in ECSC2016  Representatives from the EU-28 MS and five partner  countries participate in ECSM and the release of general  NIS messages for citizens.  Over 100 participants from EU representatives and partner  countries participated in the ECSM kick-off event in Brus- sels and general NIS messages for citizens were released  in a coordinated press release. Activities from all 28 MS  were registered on the ECSM portal including 5 partner  countries, releasing general NIS messages for citizens.  At least five international stakeholders collaborate, for  better coordination, in the ECSM.  Stakeholders from across Europe participated in the  ECSM coordinators conference calls and the meeting in  Brussels for better coordination of the campaign. Interna- tional stakeholders included European Banking Federa- tion, Europol EC3, Confederation of European Computer  User Associations, ECDL Foundation and ITU Council.  At least 10 experts from the community participate in  reviewing the contents of the citizens’ portal.  The content of the ECSM portal was reviewed by ENISA  experts and external experts for its NIS messages and  usability. Content from the citizens’ portal was reviewed  by over 15 experts from 15 different MS.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3130  PART I.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3332  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.3 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO3 — ASSISTANCE  IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING  THE NIS-RELATED POLICIES  SO3 provides the framework for ENISA to assist the  EU MS and the EU institutions in developing and  implementing the policies necessary to meet the  legal and regulatory requirements of network and  information security (NIS).  List of work packages and short description  WPK 3.1 — Supporting EU policy development The key objective of this work package (WPK) was for  ENISA to proactively contribute to the development  of existing or new EU policy initiatives (before they  are launched) and assists the Commission, Member  States and the private sector in the implementation of  existing policies in this area.  ENISA achieved this objective by engaging with public  and private stakeholders and leveraging its existing  knowledge and expertise in the area of secure  infrastructure and services.  Another key objective of this WPK was cybersecurity  standardisation. From its initial set up, ENISA has  tracked the development of standards in the area  of NIS, maintaining close contacts and collaboration  with international standardisation organisations.  This approach enables ENISA to keep its activities  up-to-date with the latest developments as  well as informing its stakeholders on new NIS  standardisation activities and to flag opportunities  and/or risks as they develop.  In line with the more proactive role given to the  Agency in the latest mandate, ENISA supported this  area, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, by  developing recommendations for improving NIS  in EU standardisation policy, providing guidelines  of the possible frameworks that can be adopted  in order to achieve a harmonised scheme across  MS, as well as setting recommendations for the  stakeholders involved. Importantly ENISA contributes  to standardisation by reviewing standardisation gaps  and providing due justification for action by SDOs  and stakeholders alike. Finally, ENISA contributes to the  coordination of standards by joining key coordination  groups and meetings for the purpose of providing the  regulatory cybersecurity view to this important area of  the EU policy framework.  WPK 3.2 — Supporting EU policy implementation This WPK covered activities linked to the  implementation of EU directives and regulations (i.e.  activities linked to electronic identification and trust  services (eIDAS) regulation, ePrivacy directive, general  data protection regulation and the NIS directive) where  ENISA has been assigned a role and responsibilities  and where NIS is one of the main goals or means to  achieve suitable implementation.  ENISA has cooperated with all EU Member States  and the Commission to define the scope and the  implementation priorities of the NIS directive, the  actions related to ENISA and the sectors and/or  services affected. As a result of this, the Agency then  identified all relevant public and private stakeholders  (e.g. competent authorities, manufacturers and  operators) and engaged them in a structured  dialogue on the key objectives of the NIS directive and  how it can be best implemented within each sector  and/or service.  ENISA has been a recognised contributor to policy  in privacy and trust and the Agency has extensively  contributed to support the implementation of the  personal data protection regulatory framework  in many of its key technological aspects. ENISA  continued supporting the implementation of  EC Regulation 611/2013 by providing assistance  regarding technical protective measures (appropriate  cryptographic protective measures) as the  abovementioned regulation requests ENISA to do.  ENISA continued collecting and analysing annual  national reports of security breaches from national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) in accordance with  Article 13a of the framework directive on electronic  communications. The Agency, in cooperation with  experts from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. ENISA’s  e-communications reference group) analysed the  national reports, compared them with previous years,  identified new trends and developed good practices  and lessons learned.  Another WPK area has been related to aspects  of the implementation of the Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market. Trust services are a key enabler for  increasing citizens’ confidence in online services,  and given their nature, they require a high level  of security to ensure their integrity and reliability.  ENISA has contributed extensively to the area of  securing trust services in the past by providing best  practices for providers, recommendations on audit  schemes, standardisation guidance, security-breach  reporting and recommendations, etc. Building on  the work of 2015, in 2016 ENISA focused on the  key areas of interest for stakeholders’ including  guidelines on initiation and supervision of trust  service providers (TSPs), update on relevant  technical standards and security recommendations  for relying parties of trust services.  1.3.1 WPK 3.1: Supporting European Union  policy development  1.2.1.1 WPK 3.1.A: Contribution to EU policy linked  to secure infrastructures and services  In this WPK, ENISA engaged with public and private  stakeholders and developed state-of-the-art  recommendations and good practices in secure  infrastructure and services with the objective of  proactively contributing to the development of  existing or new EU policy initiatives (before they are  launched) and assist the Commission, Member States  and the private sector in the implementation of  existing policies in this area.  ENISA achieved this objective by engaging with public  and private stakeholders, by deploying existing  expert groups, e.g. the European SCADA and control  systems information Exchange (EuroSCSIE) and the  EICS — ENISA ICS Security Stakeholder Group and by  leveraging its existing knowledge and expertise in the  area of secure infrastructure and services. One of the  key vehicles to deliver this are the ENISA dedicated,  area-specific, expert groups that develop useful  insight, validate good practices and issue practical  recommendations. Whenever necessary ENISA liaised  with standards bodies to provide its technical opinion  on future standards in the areas below.  The main areas covered in this WPK are as follows.  EU cloud computing strategy and partnership ENISA organised the fourth edition of Secure Cloud  conference; a series of very successful events  that take place in Europe on Cloud Security with  stakeholders from all across the Globe. During this  conference, the ENISA Cloud Security and Resilience  Experts Group met and discussed the provisions  of the NIS directive for DSPs. Supporting the  requirements of this group, ENISA published a small  paper on ‘Exploring Cloud incidents’.  EU smart grids and ICS-SCADA strategy ENISA assisted the Commission, the Member States  and the private sector in the implementation of the  EU’s smart grid strategy and ICS-SCADA actions.  The agency, building on this existing knowledge  and expertise, provided sound technical advice,  recommendations and information on good practices  in the area of minimum security measures for smart  grids and ICS-SCADA, communication network  dependencies, attacks and incident-reporting  mechanisms for national critical industries. ENISA  engaged with all relevant stakeholders, provided  contributions to the Commission on policy initiatives  (e.g. EU CSS, DG Energy’s expert group 2 (EG2) and  Energy expert cybersecurity platform (EECSP), CEN/ Cenelec’s M490, EuroSCSIE and distributed energy  security knowledge (EE-Densek and Energy ISAC), and  made sure that these efforts properly aligned with  the EU’s overall smart grid policy.  Policy discussions on the certification of  components and systems ENISA cooperated with the Commission, Member  States and the private sector in order to foster EU  policy discussion regarding a European framework  for the certification of components and systems. The  agency supported the discussion on the evolution of  the existing initiatives. Through this, ENISA was able  to provide suggestions to key decision-makers on the  way MS and the EU should address this issue.  EU policy on NIS matters of the finance sector ENISA continues its efforts in the area of the finance  sector. The Agency assisted the European Banking  Authority and the European Central Bank in the  definition and implementation of the Payment  Services Directive 2. ENISA organised two workshops  with its Expert Group on Finance (EGFI) and discussed  technical and policy implementation issues.  ENISA achieved  this objective by  engaging with  public and private  stakeholders and  leveraging its  existing knowledge  and expertise in  the area of secure  infrastructure and  services.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3534  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.3.1.2 WPK 3.1.B: Policy development and standards  The new ENISA mandate gives the Agency a more  proactive role in the area of standardisation. The task  assigned to ENISA by the new regulation is to support  standardisation by facilitating the establishment and  take-up of European and international standards  for risk management and for the security of  electronic products, networks and services. A key  element towards the objective of improved security  standardisation is to facilitate close collaboration  between policymakers, standardisation organisations  and industry. ENISA facilitated the cooperation  of stakeholders by engaging policymakers,  standardisation organisations and industry, with the  aim of putting forward common strategies to enhance  NIS in EU standardisation policy.  Since 2012 ENISA has specifically participated in the  creation and further work of the ETSI CEN-Cenelec  Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG). In 2016  ENISA collaborated in the activities of the CSCG and  worked on developing synergies between the CSCG  and its WP.  In 2016 the Agency provided recommendations  for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy and  guidelines on the possible frameworks that can be  adopted in order to achieve a harmonised scheme  across MS.  1.3.1.3 WPK 3.1.C: Towards a digital single market  for NIS and related IT products and services  In 2016, ENISA ran a study to assess the current NIS  market in the EU from an economic and technical  point of view under the light of the DSM Strategy and  its future demands for protection. It focused on the  European market, even where NIS offerings are from  non-EU providers. The report provided an overview of  the current characteristics that make EU products and  services successful or non-successful in the market.  This report helped ENISA to advise the Commission  and Member States to better identify where efforts  should be placed in order to further support  European NIS and related ICT industries and services  in order to achieve and improve the adequate level of  diversity and trust in the EU.  The report proposed guidelines (lessons learned and  good practices) and recommendations to strengthen  the supply of NIS products and services from EU  suppliers, in the context of the DSM.  1.3.2 WPK 3.2. Supporting European  Union policy implementation  1.3.2.1 WPK 3.2.A: Assist EU MS and Commission in  the implementation of the NIS directive  This work package aimed to help EU MS, the  private sector and the Commission to implement  the NIS directive.  More specifically ENISA has assisted the Commission  and MS in the establishment of the Cooperation  Group envisaged in the NIS directive. The Agency, as  a member of this group, has provided ideas to the  Commission and MS about its governance structure,  its objectives and themes to focus on as well as its  working relationship to the CSIRT Network.  Digital service providers (DSPs) ENISA has assisted the Commission and MS in the  development of the implementing acts envisaged  in the NIS directive on incident reporting schemes  imposed on digital service providers (DSPs).  More specifically ENISA took stock of similar  provisions, processes, laws and regulations  (obligatory or voluntary) in MS and analysed them  in order to identify commonalities. Also the Agency  collected best practices from the private sector as  regards incident reporting and security measures.  Emphasis has been placed on the identification of the  parameters determining the impact of an incident  which will trigger the notification. In this respect, a  full-fledged technical proposal on how to address  the incident reporting requirements was developed  by ENISA. The work done in this area represents a  preliminary guideline on how incident notification  provisions for DSPs could be effectively implemented  across the EU. Based on valuable input from Member  States and companies directly impacted by the  directive, the guideline proposed arises from their  good practices in matters such as identifying types of  incidents, parameters and thresholds and results in  an outline technical proposal that can tentatively be  applied across EU.  At the same time, this guideline serves as a  technical input to the foregoing process of  adopting the implementing act that will further  specify details regarding the incident notification  provisions of the NISD.  Operators of essential services (OES) Moreover, the underlying work in the area of  operators of essential services (OES) has already  started from 2016.  In this respect ENISA started collecting well  established approaches different MS use to identify  their operators of essential services. The Agency  analysed the different approaches in use and tried  to identify commonalities that could constitute a  basis for a harmonised approach. This work was  not concluded in 2016 but will continue in 2017 and  2018. During this period ENISA will continue helping  MS to develop more knowledge and expertise on  this topic and will contribute in the discussions  towards an aligned EU approach, if possible.  This would allow operators of essential services  operating across several MS to be treated in a  seamless and consistent way.  In this effort ENISA has leveraged its existing  knowledge and expertise in stakeholder engagement  with the public and/or the private sector.  1.3.2.2 WPK 3.2.B: Assistance in the  implementation of NIS measures of EU data  protection regulation  ENISA has been a recognised contributor to policy  in privacy and trust and the Agency has contributed  extensively to the implementation of the personal  data protection regulatory framework in many of  its key technological aspects. As a core activity in  supporting the protection of personal information,  ENISA provided recommendations on technological  measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and  authenticity of personal data. In 2016, ENISA shifted  the focus on supporting personal data controllers  and processors on calculating the risk related to  personal data processing and selecting appropriate  technological and organisation security measures.  In addition, ENISA also conducted a study on  personal data clouds (‘PDCs’), identified the different  architectures and component of PDCs and discussed  their privacy and security challenges.  Furthermore, ENISA ensured continuity for the  activities where the Agency has achieved high  expertise in the area of privacy, as well as introducing  some emerging new topics, which have become  relevant for the privacy community. The Agency  carried on with its work on privacy enhancing  technologies (PETs), their evolution, newest ideas and  most up-to-date features of PETs, their building blocks  and a maturity assessment tool. Following previous  work in the field of privacy engineering, in 2016 ENISA  defined the ‘PETs control matrix’, an assessment  framework and tool for the systematic presentation  and evaluation of online and mobile privacy tools for  end users.  The defined framework relies on a set of  assessment criteria, which can be broken down into  specific parameters and assessment points, acting as  indicators of certain properties and features of the  tools.  In 2016, ENISA hosted the fourth edition of the  Annual Privacy Forum (APF). In light of the general  data protection regulation and the European digital  agenda, DG CNECT, EDPS, ENISA and, Goethe  University Frankfurt organised APF 2016 (http:// privacyforum.eu). APF 2016 was held on 7 and 8  September at Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main,  Germany. The event encouraged dialogue with  keynote speakers, panel discussions, and provided  room for exchange of ideas in between scientific  sessions. The objective of the Agency for 2016, as  in previous years, was to address the topics which  are of current interest for the privacy community,  in order to reach the maximum number of relevant  participants, representing different stakeholder  communities across Member States.  Regarding new activities, ENISA undertook a study to  support SME’s on how to adopt security measures  for the protection of personal data, following a risk- based approach. In particular, the objectives of the  study were to facilitate SMEs in understanding the  context of the personal data processing operation  and subsequently assess the associated security  risks. Based on that the study also proposes possible  organisational and technical security measures  for the protection of personal data, which are  appropriate to the risk presented and in accordance  to the provisions of GDPR.  Finally, during 2016 ENISA supported the European  Commission (DG CNECT) in the upcoming revision of  the Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy directive). ENISA  acted as technical advisor of the EC on the topics  below by producing respective working papers:  1.  Effectiveness and efficiency of security rules  in the electronic communications sector; this  includes an assessment of relevance and added  value of specific security rules in the electronic  communications sector; (Article 4), taking into  account the revised relevant provisions of GDPR;  2.  Assessment of the option to enlarge the scope of  security rules to encompass other critical actors in  the electronic communications value-chain, such as  component manufacturers, software providers, etc.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3736  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.3.2.3 WPK 3.2.C: Assistance in the  implementation of mandatory incident-reporting  schemes  This work package focused on assisting regulatory  authorities in the implementation of EU regulations  related to mandatory incident reporting. It is based  on the successful work done in this area over the  years in the area of Article 13a.  The main tasks of this work package were to support  the following:  NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article  13a (security-breach notification).  NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article  19 of the new regulation on eIDAS.  ENISA has continued to collect and analyse  national reports on security incidents in  accordance with Article 13a of the framework  directive on electronic communications. The  Agency has analysed the national reports,  compared them with previous years, identified  new trends and developed good practices and  lessons learned. The Annual Incidents Report 2016,  including the analysis on the incidents reported,  was published around September 2016.  The CIRAS incident reporting platform was also  improved to fit to the new requirements of the  NRAs, in terms of new services and threats being  added, together with an overall improvement of  the reporting process and the user interface.  ENISA has cooperated with electronic  communications providers and MS competent  authorities (e.g. NRAs) to address security issues in  an integrated and holistic manner. In that respect  the Agency, in cooperation with the Commission,  have continued their efforts towards achieving  an EU level harmonised reporting scheme for the  e-communication providers.  ENISA together with the Article 13a WG provided  feedback to the EC on security aspects regarding the  new telecom code. The feedback was well received  as some of the observations are included in the new  regulation proposal.  Also, in the area of security measures for  e-communication providers, the Agency has  developed a line of work with the objective of  identifying concrete security measures deployed  in the telecom sector, that draws on experience  gathered in terms of security measures.  ENISA has continued its efforts to develop common  guidelines for a cost-effective mandatory security  breach notification scheme implementing Article  19 of the eIDAS regulation. The Agency, building  on the Forum of European Supervisory Authorities  for Electronic Signatures (FESA) and other related  public stakeholder groups, has brought together  most of the EU stakeholders to discuss the scope of  the scheme, the services affected, the impact of the  incidents reported (e.g. parameters and thresholds),  the reporting attributes, the reporting modalities, the  reporting tools and others.  In this respect, ENISA has developed a security  incident reporting framework for TSPs (trusted  service providers) covering Article 19 of the European  eIDAS regulation, with the objective of supporting  efficient and harmonised incident notification  schemes across the European Union. The Agency  has also developed a tool (CIRAS-T) which enables  supervisory bodies to submit their national reports  to ENISA and the Commission.  1.3.2.4 WPK 3.2.D: Support for policy  implementation in the area of electronic  identification and trust services  The main objective of this WPK was to continue  to support the large-scale adoption of secure  electronic identification means and trust services  across Europe. Trust services are a key enabler for  increasing citizens’ confidence in online services,  and given their nature, they require a high level of  security to ensure their integrity and reliability. ENISA  has contributed extensively to the area of securing  trust services in the past by providing best practices  for providers, recommendations on audit schemes,  standardisation guidance, security-breach reporting  recommendations, etc.  From the policy perspective, a milestone in this area  was achieved with the adoption of Regulation (EU)  No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market. ENISA aims to support the  implementation of the regulation by further focusing  on the security aspects related to trust services  providers.  In order to identify key aspects and gaps in this  area, in 2015 ENISA launched, in collaboration with  the EC, a forum that brings together communities,  namely: trust service providers from the EU trusted  lists, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory  authorities. The forum has proven to be a useful tool  for identifying gaps and areas where further work is  needed, and its activities continued in 2016. The 2016  edition took place on 24 May in Brussels with a broad  participation of stakeholders.  ENISA continued working on the implementation  and update of the guidelines for security incidents  notification to supervisory bodies by trust service  providers (facilitating the application of the obligation  stemming from Article 19 of the regulation). For this  reason, ENISA has launched the Article 19 expert  group that brings together the representatives from  national competent authorities responsible for the  implementation of the eIDAS Article 19 security  measures and incident notification requirements.  ENISA continued supporting the EC in the assessment  of the candidate standards that might be listed  in implementing acts that may be adopted by the  EC. This activity aimed to develop a concise set  of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for  voluntary use of all stakeholders, including trust  service providers, supervisory bodies and conformity  assessment bodies. The objective was to provide  guidelines to meet requirements originating from  specific provisions of the eIDAS regulation.  The study on security recommendations for relying  parties of trust services, resulted in a series of five  documents which aim to assist parties wishing to use  qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps,  eDelivery or website authentication certificates  to understand the subject correctly as well as  the potential benefits, amongst others, by giving  examples of possible application. This series of  documents also targets giving those parties some  advice on how to correctly deploy and use the related  qualified trust services.

List of work packages and short description  WPK 4.1 — Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises In the context of this work package (WKP), ENISA  further enhanced its methodology, seminars, training  and technical capabilities on the organisation and  management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises. The  Agency continued enhancing its internal capabilities  for managing complex, distributed exercises, by  building on its previous efforts. ENISA explored new  opportunities that will enhance the overall realism of  cyber exercises.  In 2016, ENISA organised the fourth pan-European  cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016). This  exercise builds on the experience gained in previous  exercise and takes into account previously identified  recommendations and findings.  Furthermore, ENISA continued supporting Member  States towards the development of a sound and  implementable European cyber crisis cooperation  framework and procedures.  WPK 4.2 — NIS community building The key goal of this WPK is to build upon the good  experience ENISA has in supporting different  operational communities (CSIRT network, law  enforcement communities, European financial  institutes — information sharing and analysis  centre (FI-ISAC), A-ISAC, etc.) to enhance mutually  satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA developed and provided guidance based on  good practice in the area of operational community  efforts (operational cooperation, information  exchange, etc.). Where possible, synergies with other  ENISA collaboration- and community-supporting  efforts were extended and, where needed, developed.  The Agency continued its work and support of the  Transits training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning by doing’ approach.  ENISA continued to support the collaboration  between CSIRT and law enforcement communities,  based on the recent policy and technical  developments in this area in Member States.  1.4.1 WPK 4.1 Support for EU cooperation  initiatives through initiatives amongst  NIS-related communities in the context  of the EU CSS  In 2016 ENISA further enhanced capacity on the  organisation and management of large-scale cyber  crisis exercises, while also organised a number  complex, distributed exercises with enhanced realism.  Exercise Organisation In 2016, the Agency organised together with the MS  the fourth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe  2016 (CE2016). CE2016 was a large-scale distributed  technical and operational exercise started in April  2016, offering the opportunity to cybersecurity  professionals across Europe to analyse complex,  innovative and realistic cybersecurity incidents.  On 13 and 14 October, ICT and IT security industry  experts together with cybersecurity authorities, were  called upon to mitigate the apex of this 6-month  long cyber crisis, to ensure business continuity and,  ultimately, to safeguard the European ICT market.  The Cyber Europe motto is ‘stronger together’: Indeed  cooperation at all levels is key to the successful  mitigation of major, borderless cyber incidents.  CE2016 overall in the 6-month period engaged over  1 000 participants.  EuroSOPEx 2016 was another exercise organised by  the Agency during this year. EuroSOPEx is a distributed  table-top exercise for the national and governmental  CSIRTs that trains on multinational cooperation  procedures. The exercise was organised in four  sessions in June and engaged over 50 participants.  Finally, ENISA supported the exercise Multilayer  2016 (ML16) organised the European External Action  Service (EEAS). In particular, after a formal request  (c.f. Article 14 of the Agency’s regulation) from EEAS  developed the cybersecurity sub-scenarios of this  joint civil–military exercise and provided support  during the execution of the exercise, in relation with  the cybersecurity scenarios.  Enhanced capacity to support and organise  cyber exercises In 2016 ENISA further enhanced its methodology,  seminars, training and technical capabilities on  the organisation and management of cyber crisis  exercises. The Agency developed capabilities for  managing complex, distributed exercises with  enhanced realism.  In the context of this effort ENISA expanded and  improved its cyber exercise platform (CEP). CEP is  a set of interconnected infrastructures supporting  exercise management as well as the exercise play/ reality through a virtual universe. The former includes  capabilities such as exercise planning, scenario  management, injection, visualisation, control,  monitoring and evaluation. The latter includes virtual  universe of several simulated online web services,  such as social media, websites, video streaming  services and network infrastructures.  As a result of an agreement reached in 2016, ENISA  is also assisting the European Defence Agency  (EDA) in the organisation of cyber exercises for their  community.  Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises activities  overview In 2016 ENISA, in close cooperation with the EU  Member States and institutions, drafted a proposal  for a pan-European roadmap for cyber exercises. This  roadmap will guide the exercise developments in the  coming years.  ENISA continued supporting the EU Member  States towards the development of sound and  implementable European cyber crisis cooperation  framework and procedures. The Agency will continue  exploring requirements for developing infrastructures  for cooperation, e.g. secure communications channels  or directories. In this context, ENISA supported the  effort to review and revise the EU Cyber Standard  Operational Procedures (EU-CSOPs). These EU- CSOPs were put under test both in EuroSOPEx and  Cyber Europe 2016. Related to this set of activities,  in 2016 the European Commission announced in the  Communication COM(2016)/410 — ‘Strengthening  Europe’s Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a  Competitive and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry’  the development in 2017 of a ‘blueprint’ that will  ensure the synergies and coherence for the crisis  cooperation during significant cyber incidents.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 4544  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.4.2 WPK 4.2. Support for EU  cooperation initiatives amongst NIS- related communities in the context of  the EU CSS  Objectives:  Support incident-response community building  and information exchange.  Contributing to the existing communities’ efforts in  the incident response field.  Enable continuous trust and collaboration building  for communities through regular events.  Information provided to key stakeholders on NIS  policy developments.  The key goal of this WPK was to build upon the  good experience ENISA has acquired in supporting  different operational communities (CSIRT, law  enforcement communities, European FI-ISAC, A-ISAC,  CSIRT network provided for by the NIS directive, etc.)  to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA developed and provided guidance based on  good practice in the area of operational community  efforts (operational cooperation, information exchange,  etc.). Where possible, synergies with other ENISA  collaboration- and community-supporting efforts will  be extended and, where needed, developed.  The Agency continued its work and support of the  TRANSITS training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach.  ENISA also continued to support the collaboration  between CSIRT and law enforcement communities,  based on the recent policy and technical  developments in this area in Member States.  This work included close collaboration with other  institutions, which are active in this field, namely  the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the collaboration  agreement between ENISA and EC3 were further  developed. For example, in the area of encouraging  a more practical and regular flow of information  between CSIRTs and law enforcement communities,  the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise,  elaboration of general situational reports,  reports resulting from strategic analyses and  best practice and strengthening capacity building  through training and awareness raising in order  to safeguard NIS at EU level. To support better  coordination and in order to avoid overlaps with  ENISA activities, the agency will stay engaged in the  EC3 programme board. The very well established,  commonly organised ENISA-EC3 workshop was  held in October that gathered 33 teams from 30  countries from the EU and EFTA countries.  Following its successful mechanism for building  the European national and governmental CSIRT  community trust and collaboration, ENISA organised  its traditional workshop to support the national and  governmental CSIRT community grow. (11th CSIRTs in  Europe workshop).  In its Article 8b, the NIS directive established the  CSIRTs network ‘in order to contribute to developing  confidence and trust between the Member States  and to promote swift and effective operational  cooperation’. It is ‘composed of representatives of the  Member States’ CSIRTs and CERT-EU’.  The CSIRTs Network provides a forum where Member  States’ National CSIRTs can cooperate, exchange  information and also build trust. Member States  CSIRTs are able to improve the handling of cross- border incidents, and even discuss how to respond in  a coordinated manner to specific incidents.  ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network  and actively support the cooperation among the  CSIRTs. In 2016 the Agency organised the informal  meeting of the CSIRTs Network adjacent to its 11th  CSIRTs in Europe workshop.

In 2016, ENISA supported existing communities like  FIRST, TF-CSIRT and the FI-ISAC, by promoting their  activities, being present in their meetings, and taking  part in their governance structure (TF-CSIRT Steering  Committee, FIRST Conference Program Committee).  D2: Annual ENISA national and governmental CSIRT  workshop (Q4, 2016).  The annual technical workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs was held in Riga on 11/05/2016.  The event gathered representatives from more than 30  CSIRTs from the EU and EFTA countries (https://www. enisa.europa.eu/events/11th-csirt-enisa-workshop/11th- csirt-workshop).  D3: Annual ENISA/EC3 cybercrime workshop (Q4, 2016). The annual ENISA/EC3 cybercrime workshop for CSIRTs  and LEAs was held in The Hague on 08/11/2016. The  event gathered over 80 CSIRT and LEA representatives  from the EU and EFTA countries (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/events/5th-enisa-ec3-workshop)  D4: Supporting European network of MS CSIRTs. ENISA participated in the inaugural informal meeting of  the CSIRTs Network held in The Hague, and organised  two further informal meetings on 10/05/2016 (Riga,  Latvia) and 09/11/2016 (The Hague, The Netherlands).  The Agency worked with the different Presidency teams  to elaborate the Terms of Reference and the Work Plan  for the CSIRTs Network.  D5: Review on new operational communities’  development (A-ISAC, etc.) (Q4, 2016).  ENISA published a new report ‘Cyber Security  Information Sharing in the Energy Sector’ that addresses  the development of CSIRTs, ISACs, as well as relevant  initiatives on information sharing on cyber security  incidents in the energy sector by focusing on the  subsectors identified in the NIS directive (European  Parliament and Council, 2016) — namely electricity, oil  and gas — complemented by the nuclear and alternative  fuels subsectors. The report is available at https://www. enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-in- the-energy-sector  1.4.4 Specific results. Mapping of deliverables into papers/publications/activities 1.5 HORIZONTAL ACTIVITIES AND KEY  RESULTS  1.5.1 Management Board, Executive  Board and Permanent Stakeholders  Group secretariat  During 2016, ENISA continued to support its formal  bodies, the Management Board (MB) and the  Permanent Stakeholder Group (PSG) as well as the  Executive Board (EB) in their functions by providing  secretariat functions.  For the MB, one ordinary meeting was organised  during October 2016, to adopt decisions on budgetary  and administrative matters as well as to discuss the  approach and timeline of the preparation of Draft  Programming Document 2018-2020. In June 2016  the MB held its extraordinary meeting to elect the  Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson. Mr Jean- Baptiste Demaison (France) has been appointed as  Chairperson of ENISA’s MB. Jean-Baptiste Demaison’s  mandate became effective starting of 18 October  2016. Mr Krzysztof Silicki (Poland) has been also  appointed as the Deputy Chairperson of ENISA’s MB  with immediate effect.  In March 2016, the MB adopted the amended  Work Programme 2016, which reflects the tasks  addressed to ENISA in the NIS directive; the amended  WP includes more activities addressed to the  implementation of adopted NIS directive. In 2016, the  MB decided to discontinue the MB Ad Hoc Group and  instead held three MB informal meetings.  In 2016 the existing electronic newsletter was  converted into a broader publication to reach other  stakeholders, however the MB Portal is maintained  for the exclusive benefit of the MB.  For the PSG, one formal meeting was organised in the  course of the year to keep ENISA close to the industry,  academia and all other society sectors that are  represented in the Group and gather advice to the  ENISA Executive Director on drawing up a proposal  for the Agency’s Work Programme.  Four of the EB formal meetings were organised  during 2016; once per quarter (Q).  1.5.2 National Liaison Officer Network  Since 2014, ENISA has initiated a number of activities  with the aim of strengthening cooperation within the  national liaison officers’ (NLO) network. In 2016, ENISA  built upon these efforts and improved its cooperation  with the NLO network, the first point of contact for  ENISA in the MS. The agency maintained and shared  with the NLO network information on all relevant  ENISA project activities. Information was sent to the  members of the NLO network at regular intervals  on ENISA project-related tenders, vacancy notices,  and events organised by ENISA or which the Agency  contributed to (for example co-organiser, etc.) and a  NLO meeting was organised to discuss improvements  of the collaboration.  1.5.3 European Union relations  As in previous years, the Agency carried out the EU  relations work with the statutory stakeholders: the  Commission, the EU Parliament, the Council (working  groups) and MS. Several meeting took place, at the  highest level these were managed by the ED so that  the level of participation is appropriate. A similar  approach was taken for speaking engagements.  1.5.4 Stakeholders communication and  dissemination activities  In 2016, ENISA continued to improve its focus on its  key activities and to provide regular information to  the press and media regarding these activities. In  order to achieve this, constant contact with the media  was maintained and trust relations established to  assure adequate information of the EU citizens about  ENISA’s work and activities.  The Agency continued to develop various tools and  channels such as info graphics, the ENISA website,  social media, social networking and videos with  continuous improvement of outreach. This resulted  in an increase in numbers of press releases, website  news item, wider media coverage, social media  followers and interactions and overall communication  with different stakeholders.  1.5.5 Quality management system  During 2016, the Agency started to put in place a  quality management system. A quality management  manual as well as standard operation procedures  (SOPs) and work instructions (WINs) were drafted  bases on ISO 9001 standards (the Agency does not  have as objective to be certified). All these documents  are in the phase of revision by the management and  will be implemented in 2017.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 4948  PART I.

The primary goal of the QC is to im  prove performance across the agency while reducing  operational costs and enhancing stakeholders  satisfaction. The methodology is based on the plan- do-check-act (PDCA) cycle.  1.5.6 Article 14 requests  Article 14 of ENISA regulation provides a mechanism  that allows the MS or EU institutions to make direct  requests to ENISA for carrying out particular activities.  This mechanism has become increasingly accepted  in the last few years and it has grown in significance.  In Work Programme 2016, under SO2, both WPKs  WPK2.1 Assist MS capacity building and WPK2.2  Support EU institutions include deliverables dedicated  to assistance/on-request support for EU MS and  institutions. The table on the left provides a summary  of Article 14 requests and their status at the end of  2016. It should be noted that some of these requests  foresee activities during 2017.  1.5.7 Data Protection Officer  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO)  during 2016 included information and advice for  the Agency on its obligations pursuant to Regulation  45/2001/EC. Activities included the requirements for  data security, information of data subjects and their  requests in exercising their rights under Regulation  45/2001/EC, as well as the requirements for prior  check or prior consultation with EDPS.  1.6 KEY RESULTS FOR MANAGEMENT AND  ADMINISTRATION ACTIVITIES  The ED is responsible for the overall management of  the Agency. During 2016, the ED decided to set up  an Executive Director’s Office (EDO) to support his  activities. The tasks covered by EDO include policy  advice, legal advice, Management Board Secretariat  and coordination of the Work Programme. In 2016,  EDO continued to support the Management Board  (MB) and the Executive Board in their functions by  providing secretariat assistance.  In order to gain in efficiency and effectiveness,  the Administration and support department (ASD)  became the Stakeholder Relations and Administrative  Support Department (SRAD) during 2016.  The SRAD is responsible for ensuring that the  management of the Agency is in line with the  regulatory framework established by the competent  EU institutions, the MB and the ED. The regulatory  framework is composed of the financial regulation  and the staff regulations and their respective  implementing rules, as well as administrative  procedures, the internal control framework and  other control mechanisms put in place to ensure  compliance with the rules.  The SRAD monitors the Agency control and risk  framework. Constant upgrading of the internal  systems and revision of the operating standards set  the ground for continuous optimisation of the internal  processes and procedures. Benchmarking with other  organisations, as well as the recommendations of the  European Court of Auditors (CoA) and the Internal  Audit Service (IAS) are used as internal performance  indicators and relevant possibilities of improvement  are considered. Furthermore, the SRAD department  is the main contact point as regards administrative  matters, with external stakeholders, including Hellenic  authorities, etc.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5150  PART I.

However, to avoid duplication,  information regarding Management Board is already  located in section 2.5.1 Management Board,  Executive Board and Permanent Stakeholders  Group secretariat. Furthermore, details regarding  major developments are described in section  1.2 Highlights of the year and in particular, in  section 1.2.3 Information for the stakeholders, as  well as in section 2.6 Key results for management  and administration activities.  2.1 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  2.1.1 Budget execution of EU subsidy  (C1 funds)  The excellent budget execution can be translated into  the following figures, the expenditure appropriations  of ENISA Budget 2016 of EUR 10 984 847, were  committed at a rate of 98.55 % on 31 December 2016.  The remaining amount is a not automatic carry over  committed in 2017 for refurbishment project.  ENISA did not cancel any appropriations of the  year (C1) appropriations by the end of the year  (cancellation rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven capacity of the Agency to efficiently use  the entrusted funds, in order to implement its  annual Work Programme as well as manage its  administrative expenditure and investments.  The respective payment rate on expenditure  appropriations was 90.00 % in 2016. This payment  rate is high and demonstrates that the capacity of  the Agency to finalise its annual activities as well as  execute the relevant payments within the year of  reference was maintained. The procurement planning  which was moved forward to the end of the preceding  year (2015) and enabled the launch of projects related  to the Work Programme in early 2016, contributed  significantly to the improvement of the payment rate  of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.2 Amending budgets/budgetary  transfers  The following table summarises the effect of the  Budget transfers No 1 to 8, approved by the Executive  Director (ED) of ENISA, and the Amending Budget (AB)  1/2016, approved by the Management Board, on the  initial Budget 2016:  PART II MANAGEMENT II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 53  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5554 ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 55  PART II.

During 2016, 11 staff left the Agency, nine vacancy  notices were published and 11 staff were recruited/  took up new duties within the Agency. ENISA still  experiences significant challenges in attracting  and retaining suitably qualified staff to support the  activities of the Agency. This is a challenge due to  several factors, mainly the types of post that are  being offered (CA posts) that are not financially  competitive for the IT NIS job market, and moreover  the low salary coefficient which contributes even  more to a non-competitive package offer, especially  for CA positions.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members  in Athens, where no European Schools are based,  several service level agreements have been  concluded with each of the private schools being used  by the children of the staff. Several children of staff  members in ENISA Heraklion attended the European  School in Heraklion in 2016, which offers education at  the following levels: nursery, primary and secondary  education. ENISA has a service level agreement with  DG Human Resources and Security for the provision  of these services.  In 2016, ENISA adopted by analogy four implementing  rules, namely:  C (2015) 5320 on Unpaid Leave and  Leave on personal ground, C (2015) 1509 on the  Use and Employment of TA’s 2(f), C (2015) 9650 on  Reclassification of Temporary Agents and C (2015)  9561 on Reclassification of Contract Agents.  Additionally, in accordance with Article 110 of  the SR, the Agency received the agreement of  its Management Board to derogate from four  implementing rules as sent by the European  Commission: C (2016) 3828 on the implementation  of the Learning and Development Strategy, C (2016)  3288 on Middle Management, C (2016) 3214 on  the function of Advisor and C (2015) 9151 on the  implementation of telework. The Agency is waiting for  the Agencies’ Models to be adopted in order to adopt  them or to decide to draft its own rules (ex novo  decision).  The organisational chart, establishment plan and  statistics for ENISA staff is attached in Annex A.1.  2.2.2 Results of screening  Following European Commission methodology, the  Agency performed the ‘job screening’ benchmarking  exercise for 2016. The result of the exercise, which is  a snapshot of the staffing situation at end December  2016, appears in Annex A.4. It is relevant to mention  that the ‘Overhead’, support functions, is only 20.24  % of the total statutory staff count, which is below  the maximum value accepted for the Agencies that  is estimated at 25 %. This is only possible due to very  efficient resources management.  2.1.3 Carry forward of commitment  appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations), which were not  consumed by payments at the end of 2016, were  carried forward (automatic carry forward) to 2017  (C8 appropriations).  The appropriations corresponding to the EU subsidy  (C1 appropriations), which were not committed by the  The funds carried forward to 2017 (C8 appropriations) are detailed below:  Title  Total C1 ap- propriations  carried forward  to 2017  Carried Over (C1  2016 to C3 2017)  EU subsidy  Carried Forward  (R0 2016 to R0  2017) Subsidy  from Hellenic  Authorities  Title 1 — Staff 380 610.17 0.00 0.00 380 610.17  Title 2 — Administration 300 018.38 159 000.00 51 364.89 510 383.27  Title 3 — Operations 287 569.77 0.00 0.00 287 569.77  Total 968 198.32 159 000.00 51 364.89 1 178 563.21  end of 2016, were carried over (non-automatic carry  over to C3 appropriations in 2017).

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5756 ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 57  PART II. Management  2.3 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2.3.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multiannual  character of programmes as well as the nature of the  payments concerned.  In line with Internal Control Standard 8 (ICS 8  Processes and Procedures), the Agency has done the  ex post control report for the financial year 2015.  The recommendations issued on the report were  addressed during the year.  The ex post controls of the financial year 2015 were  quite extensive. A total of 267 financial transactions  were sampled and controlled, representing 13.17  % of all financial transactions of the Agency and  representing 76.43 % of the 2015 Agency’s budget.  As a result, one recommendation was issued which  regards a delay of payments which did not generate  any interest to be paid.  Moreover, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is  in charge of the annual audit of the Agency, which  is concluded by the publication of an annual report  according to the provisions of Article 287(1) of TFEU.  For several consecutive years, the ECA reports have  confirmed the improvement in the Agency’s overall  internal controls environment and performance.  2.4 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  ENTRUSTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND  ENTITIES  The Agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  2.5 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT RESULTS  AND FOLLOW UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS  2.5.1 Internal Audit Services (IAS)  The Agency has no open recommendations with the  Internal Audit Service in 2016. In September, the IAS  performed the Agency Risk assessment. The report  shows the next three topics for auditing: Stakeholders  involvement in the deliverables, Human Resources  and IT. The Agency shall take immediate actions  regarding the construction of a quality management  system as well as in implementation of its risk  management policy.  2.5.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  The annual report of ECA on the accounts of ENISA  for 2015 does not contain recommendations.  2.5.3 Follow up of audits plans, audits  and recommendations  The Agency will focus on the quality management  system as well as on the implementation of the risk  management policy.  2.6 FOLLOW UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 28  April 2016, the Executive Director of the Agency was  granted a discharge in respect of the implementation  of the Agency’s budget for the financial year 2014.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 28  April 2016, the closure of the accounts of the Agency  for the financial year 2014 was approved.  2.6.1 Follow up of the 2013 discharge  The Agency did not have any comment made  by the Court.  2.6.2 2014 discharge  2.6.2.1 Budget and financial management  The Discharge authority noted that budget  monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014  resulted in a high budget implementation rate of  100 % and that the payment appropriations execution  rate was 85.61 %.  2.6.2.2 Commitments and carryovers  The Discharge authority noted that, according to  the Court’s report, the total amount of committed  appropriations carried over to 2015 amounted  to EUR 1 332 421 (15 % of total appropriations).  It took note of the fact that the carry-overs were  EUR 612 981 (49 %) for Title II (administrative  expenditure), representing a decrease of 10 %  compared to 2013 and acknowledged the fact  that those carry-overs related to investments in IT  infrastructure ordered as planned near the year- end for the Agency’s two offices.  The Discharge authority observed that an amount of  EUR 717 927 was carried forward from the financial  year 2013; notes that EUR 49 460 (6.89 %) of the 2013  carry-forwards were cancelled.  2.6.2.3 Transfers  The Discharge authority noted with satisfaction that,  according to the Agency’s Annual Report, as well as  the Court’s audit findings, the level and nature of  transfers in 2014 remained within the limits of the  financial rules.  2.6.2.4 Recruitment procedures  The Discharge authority noted that from the Agency’s  Annual Activity Report that, at the end of 2014, 62  statutory staff were employed; notes, furthermore,  that during 2014, three staff left the Agency,  10 vacancy notices were published and seven staff  were recruited.  The Discharge authority observed that the Agency  experiences challenges in attracting and holding  suitably qualified staff to support its activities, mainly  due to the location of its office in Crete, where  international education is a challenging factor. It  acknowledged the fact that the Agency concluded  a service level agreement with each of the private  schools being used by the children of the staff in  the Athens office, as no European schools are based  there. The Discharge authority furthermore noted  that a new mandate and service agreement was  concluded between the Commission and the Agency  which provides the detail of the funding for European  schools used by the children of Agency staff.  The Discharge authority noted according to  the Agency’s Annual Activity Report, the Agency  conducted a job-screening exercise using the  common methodology adopted for the Agencies  for the first time in 2014. The Discharge authority  furthermore noted that, according to that exercise,  68 % of the Agency’s staff were in the operational  functions category, 22 % were in the administrative  support and coordination category and 10 % were  employed in relation to neutral functions.  2.6.2.5 Internal Audit  The Discharge authority took note of the fact  that at the beginning of 2014, the Agency had 25  open recommendations from previous reports of  the Commission’s Internal Audit Service (‘IAS’). It  acknowledged the fact that 24 recommendations  were closed during 2014 as confirmed by the IAS in  its ‘on-the-spot’ visit to the Agency in November 2014.  The Discharge authority noted that one remaining  open recommendation was closed in 2015, after the  tool for e-workflows had been implemented.  In order to achieve the  best control possible,  the Agency has focused  intensively on the  verification of results  before transactions  are initiated (‘ex ante  verification’).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5958 ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 59  PART II. Management  2.6.2.6 Other comments  The Discharge authority acknowledged the fact that  the Agency adopted internal policies in order to  improve cost-effectiveness and the environmental  friendliness of its facilities. It noted that an important  step towards satisfying both requirements was the  adoption of a ‘paperless’ platform serving as workflow  and storage of internal documents. It also noted  with satisfaction that the Agency has practically  eliminated all paper-based workflows, including  financial transactions and human resources files and  documents, and has replaced them with electronic  documents and workflows in an effort to achieve  a paperless office environment. The Discharge  authority acknowledged the fact that this tool was  successfully introduced in January 2015.  The Discharge authority stated that the annual  reports of the Agency could play an important  role in compliance regarding transparency,  accountability and integrity and called on the  Agency to include a standard chapter on those  components in its annual report.  The Discharge authority acknowledged the fact that,  as a follow up from the 2013 discharge of the Agency,  according to the lease agreement between the Greek  authorities, the Agency and the landlord, rent for the  offices in Athens is paid by the Greek authorities.  The authority is concerned about the constant  late payment of rent, which continued in 2014 and  2015 and which presents significant reputational,  financial and business-continuity risks for the Agency.  Furthermore, it noted with concern that in 2015, the  payment of the instalment for the first 6 months of  the year was made on 27 August 2015 and only after  the Agency received a warning that litigation would  be launched by the landlord of the Athens office.  The Discharge authority urges the Commission, the  Agency and the Greek authorities to find a solution  for this issue in order to reduce significantly the risks  to which the Agency is exposed.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6160  3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT  The Agency was using the risk assessment done by  the Internal Audit Service in 2012. In September 2016,  the Internal Audit Service produced the new risk  assessment of the Agency.  Regarding the specific whistleblowing policy, the  latter was submitted to the European Data Protection  Supervisor for comments.  3.2 COMPLIANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF  INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control  standards, based on international good practice,  that aim to ensure the achievement of policy and  operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational  structure and the internal control systems suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives,  in accordance with the standards and having due  regard to the risks associated with the environment  in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency  adopted a set of 16 internal control standards laying  down the minimum requirements with which its  internal control systems need to comply. Previously  developed internal procedures were grouped  together, prioritised and implemented in the daily  workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on  the recommendations raised by the auditing bodies  (ECA and IAS). During 2015, the Agency achieved  compliance with the internal control standards  listed below.  3.2.1 Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in  the ENISA regulation. Mission statements for  departments and units were established based on the  evolution of the organisation in 2016. The roles and  tasks of each department and unit are clearly defined.  3.2.2 Ethical and organisational values  (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place — including  updates and yearly reminders — to ensure that all  staff are aware of relevant ethical and organisational  values (e.g. ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of  interest, fraud prevention, reporting of irregularities).  PART III ASSESSMENT OF THE  EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMSIII  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 61  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6362  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Specific training is organised by the Agency for its  staff every year in order to reinforce professional  behaviour, compliance with the expected behaviour,  ethics and integrity, and in order to prevent  workplace harassment.  3.2.3 Staff allocation and mobility (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary, management aligns  organisational structures and staff allocations with  priorities and workload.  3.2.4 Staff evaluation and development  (ICS 4)  In the context of the Career Development Report  (CDR) process, discussions are held individually with  all staff to establish their annual objectives. Staff  performance is evaluated according to standards set  by the Agency. An annual training plan is developed at  Agency level based on needs deriving from the policy  of the Agency. As part of the CDR process, every year  each staff member completes an individual training  plan. Management ensures that at a minimum  every staff member attends the compulsory training  courses defined in the annual training plan.  3.2.5 Objectives and performance  indicators (ICS 5)  The Work Programme (WP) for 2017, part of the  Programming document (PD) 2017-2019, of the  Agency was developed by the Agency services,  with continuous input and guidance from its two  governing bodies, the Management Board and the  Permanent Stakeholders Group. The PD clearly sets  out how the planned activities at each management  level contribute to the achievement of objectives,  taking into account the resources allocated and the  risks identified. The PD objectives are established on  SMART (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant,  Time-bound) criteria and updated or changed during  the year in order to address significant changes in  priorities and activities.  The role of the Executive Board is to assist preparing  decisions to be adopted by the Management Board  on administrative and budgetary matters only.  The Agency has based the measurement of its  performance on key performance indicators (KPIs)  that are applied to all areas of activity. KPIs are  more qualitative for the Agency’s operational goals,  whereas they are more quantitative for the Agency’s  administrative goals. The effectiveness of key controls  is assessed using relevant KPIs, including self- assessments that have been carried out in the form  of progress reports and follow-up actions that seek to  re-align divergences from the Work Programme.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed again to optimise the  budget execution for five consecutive years. The  commitment rate of budget appropriations available  for the year 2016 (C1) reached 99 %.  3.2.6 Risk management process (ICS 6)  The Agency did not have any open recommendation  for 2016. The IAS performed a risk assessment of  the Agency in September 2016. The report shows  the three next topics for auditing: Stakeholders  involvement in the deliverables, Human Resources  and IT. The Agency shall take immediate actions  regarding the construction of a Quality Management  System as well as in implementation of its Risk  Management policy.  3.2.7 Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned  and communicated by means of the Executive  Director’s Decisions (EDD). It conforms to  regulatory requirements and is appropriate to the  level of importance of the decisions to be taken as  well as the risks involved. All delegated, authorising  officers have received and acknowledged the  Charter of the role and responsibility of the  Authorising Officer (by Delegation) as well as the  individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date. The Agency records  derogations granted to allow staff to remain in sensitive  functions beyond 5 years along with documentation of  the risk analysis and the controls for mitigation.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been  taken in order to avoid potential conflict of interest  situations. However, due to the small size of the  Agency, the mobility of staff in sensitive functions is  very limited and takes into account service needs and  available resources. Proper back-ups are designated  in order to ensure business continuity and adequate  segregation of duties.  3.2.8 Processes and procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen the  processes and procedures internal control standard.  The Agency created a policy on financial circuits.  The roles and responsibilities of financial actors are  described in this policy as well as existing workflows  (see comment on ‘Paperless’ application in ICS 11).  A Code of Professional Conduct for ex ante  financial verification was developed. The document  emphasises the role and responsibilities of the  Financial Verifying Agent.  The Agency proceeded in 2016 with the full 2015 ex  post control exercise, and, it will deliver the 2016 ex  post control report in the first semester of 2017.  Importantly in 2016, a quality management system  was introduced, strengthening the performance  management of the Agency.  3.2.9 Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The management team, which comprises  the Executive Director and the heads of departments  and units, meets monthly and sets priorities for the  actions to be taken in order to achieve the short-  and medium-term objectives of the Agency. A list  of action items is compiled. It contains all agreed  actions as allocated to specific departments or units.  The list is published on a dedicated intranet page  and regularly reviewed by the management team.  Besides the monthly management team meeting,  a heads of units meeting is organised every week.  Management supervision covers both legality and  regularity aspects (i.e. set-up and compliance with  applicable rules) and operational performance (i.e.  achievement of PD objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in  order to address accepted ECA and IAS audit  recommendations and monitors the implementation  of these action plans throughout the year.  3.2.10 Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational  activities and financial transactions — are in place to  ensure the continuity of all services during ‘business- as-usual’ interruptions (such as sick leave, staff  mobility, migration to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been  developed and implemented. An Agency-wide BCP,  designed to cover crisis response and recovery  arrangements with respect to major disruptions,  has been developed and fully implemented. The  BCP’s Agency identified the functions, services  and infrastructure that need to be restored within  certain time limits and the resources necessary for  this purpose. Electronic and hardcopy versions of  both BCPs are stored in secure and easily accessible  locations, which are known to relevant staff.  3.2.11 Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related  procedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory  security measures; (2) provisions on document  management; and (3) rules on the protection of  personal data. Information security policy specific  to data categorisation and labelling is in place. As  regards the exchange of information classified  at the level RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, an  administrative arrangement between the Security  Directorate of the European Commission and the  Agency was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets out  the conditions according to which documents need  to be registered, filed and saved using the Agency’s  registration and filing systems. A special, intranet- based tool was developed to capture the information  needed to register and retrieve documents. In  addition, an incoming and outgoing mail procedure  was developed.  As regards the financial and administrative workflows,  ENISA adopted in January 2015 a SharePoint-based  application, ‘Paperless’, which routes documents  to staff involved in preparation, review and  approval of all kinds of work-related documents  and transactions. All financial and administrative  Management at all  levels supervises the  activities for which  they are responsible  and tracks the main  issues identified.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6564  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  workflows are well documented and all supporting  documents are uploaded and stored in ‘Paperless’  including changes and comments of workflow actors.  Approved workflows are permanently stored and an  appropriate audit trail is produced.  3.2.12 Information and communication  (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices  are in place for sharing information and monitoring  activities. These include regular Management  Team meetings during which issues relevant to  performance, audit results and financial information  are discussed, and actions are decided upon and  assigned. Regular financial reporting is available to  all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All engagements in new  projects are discussed during the implementation  of the Annual Work Programme and decisions are  documented and communicated.  An External Communication Strategy is in place.  ICT security policies are in place for main systems  and sub-systems, and described in procedures and  policies. Internal communication is also supported  through use of the intranet and through weekly staff  meetings within units. External communication and  dissemination procedures must be further developed  and communicated to staff accordingly.  The weekly staff meeting is used as platform of  communication between all departments. Every  week, staff members can share their work with the  rest of the Agency.  3.2.13 Accounting and financial  reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are  documented in the Internal Control Manual of  the Agency. The preparation, implementation,  monitoring and reporting on budget  implementation is centralised in the Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Section, within  the Stakeholders Relations and Administration  Department. The European Commission’s budget  and accounting management system, ABAC, is  the main tool used for financial management. It  is compliant with applicable financial regulatory  frameworks. The ABAC Assets module is used for  the management of ENISA’s inventory. Financial  management information produced by the Agency,  including financial information provided in the  Annual Activity Report, complies with applicable  financial and accounting rules.  3.2.14 Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to  measure the performance and assess the impact of  the Agency’s projects as provided for in its annual Work  Programmes. The General Report and the Annual  Activity Report are the tools used by the Agency to  report on performance and impact. The feedback of  relevant stakeholders is taken into account.  3.2.15 Assessment of internal control  systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the  compliance of annual activities and performance  with the internal control systems in place, as part of  preparation of the Annual Activity Report.  3.2.16 Internal audit capability (ICS 16)  The Head of the Stakeholders Relations and  Administration Department assumes the Internal  Control Coordination (ICC) function. He is responsible  for implementing internal control systems in the  Agency and liaising with the IAS of the European  Commission. As the Agency lacks human resources,  the role of Internal Audit Capability (IAC) cannot be  performed. Since 2005, the Agency has relied on the  IAS to carry out internal audits. The IAS plays a key  role in auditing bodies of the European Union.  Internal Control tasks performed in ENISA include 100  % of ex ante verifications, annual ex post controls,  hierarchical controls and outsourced engagements,  coordinated by the ICC. The role of ICC was reinforced  in order to comply with all the recommendations  issued by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the Agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness:  staff that have the required knowledge and skills;  systems and procedures designed and  implemented to manage the key risks effectively;  and  no instances of ineffective controls that have  exposed the Agency to substantial risk.  All finance and  accounting procedures  are documented in the  Internal Control Manual  of the Agency.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of the  continuous improvement of management procedures.  It includes taking into account any control weaknesses  reported and exceptions recorded.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6766  4.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The risk framework is used as a common means  of classifying and communicating risk across the  Agency. It provides a common understanding and  language regarding ‘risk’, as well as a structure for the  assessment, reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk  framework defines the categories, sub-categories and  business risks applicable at the organisational level,  for ENISA as a whole. It includes:  risk categories and sub-categories;  risks specific to each category (business risks);  risk definition.  Assessment by management: The Agency’s operations are channelled through  the following activity areas that belong to  administrative functions:  Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in  line with the SPD in terms of operational and  administrative activities;  Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be in-sourced  by the Agency. External agents are appointed  either through a procurement procedure or  through a call for expressions of interest for  funding related to the co-organisation of events.  Alternatively, in the case of working group  members, they may be chosen by means of a  selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its  administrative activities, the Agency has carried out  the activities presented in the table below:  4.2 EXCEPTIONS  In 2016, the Agency recorded 18 exceptions. Only  one is with high materiality (> 60 000). This case is  related to an a posteriori commitment. A human  error on a handover provided by a previous staff  member created a delay in concluding the budgetary  commitment.  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors.  The results are contained in the reports listed. These  reports result from a systematic analysis of the  evidence available. This approach provides sufficient  guarantees as to the completeness and reliability of  the information reported, and results in complete  coverage of the budget delegated to the Executive  Director of ENISA.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 67  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6968  PART IV.

ANNUAL  ACTIVITY  REPORT 2016  EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 32  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT THE ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENT BY THE MANAGEMENT BOARD  OF ENISA OF THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT FOR  THE YEAR 2016 OF THE AUTHORISING OFFICER OF ENISA  According to Article 47 of the Financial Regulation applicable to ENISA,  1. The authorising officer shall report to the Management Board on the performance of  his duties in the form of an annual activity report […]. The consolidated annual activity  report shall indicate the results of the operations by reference to the objectives set,  the risks associated with the operations, the use made of the resources provided and  the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control systems, including an overall  assessment of the costs and benefits of controls.  The consolidated annual report shall be submitted to the Management Board  for assessment.  2. No later than 1 July each year the consolidated annual activity report together with  its assessment shall be sent by the Management Board to the Court of Auditors, to the  Commission, to the European Parliament and to the Council.  The Management Board received a copy of the 2016 Annual Activity Report produced  by the Executive Director of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 19 June 2017.  After the Executive Board scrutiny, the assessment by the Management Board of the  consolidated annual activity report (hereinafter AAR) is as follows:  The AAR presents key results in the implementation of the ENISA Work programme  2016 and leads to conclusion that the Agency completed all deliverables agreed  with the Management Board both within time and within budget. 64 activities  have been reported as completed in 2016. Among those activities, the support to  implement key EU policy areas should be highlighted, notably the NIS directive1,  the General Data Protection regulation (GDPR)2, eIDAS regulation3 and the Payment  Services directive 2 (PSD2)4.  A relevant set of published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and events are listed  as part of the result achieved by the Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's  results exceeded the targets established in the Work Programme 2016.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union, OJ L  194, 19.7.2016, pp. 1-30, available at: ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj 2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of  such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance),  OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, pp. 1-88, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj 3 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive  1999/93/EC, OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, pp. 73-114, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj 4 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on  payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU  and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 337,  23.12.2015, pp. 35-127, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/2366/oj  Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work Programme 2016 in this regard and  ENISA’s work is well aligned with the overall European Union agenda for digital single  market. A coherent link is provided between activities planned in the Work Programme  2016 and the actual achievements reached in the reporting period.  The AAR also describes ENISA’s management of resources and the budget execution of  the EU subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were committed at a rate 100%. This  section also reports on results of job screening benchmarking exercise. The support  function is 20,24% of the total statuary staff count, which is below the maximum value  (25%) accepted for the decentralized small size agencies.  The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2014 Discharge, and control results. The  Agency has followed up on recommendations of Internal Audit Service as well as of  the Court of Auditors. In 2016 no new recommendations were issued.  This section  also notes the main categories of deviation that led to exceptions reported in the  Register of Exceptions and mentions that there is one exception registered with high  materiality (above 60.000,00 euros). This case is related to a posteriori commitment.  A human error on a handover provided by a previous staff member created a delay in  concluding the budgetary commitment.  The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate management of risks, high level of  transparency, data protection, business continuity, as well as efforts were undertaken  to improve overall efficiency in all activities.  The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration of assurance of the Executive  Director as well as additional information on human and financial resources,  draft annual accounts and financial reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the achievements of ENISA in 2016.  In the view of the Management Board, the overall performance and quality of  the outputs was high. The Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA  could increase the output in spite of high staff turnover and under condition of  limited budgetary resources. The Management Board expresses its appreciation  to the Executive Director and his staff for their commitment and achievements  throughout the year.  In light of the above assessment, the Management Board requests the Management  Board Secretariat to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to the European  Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, the Permanent Representations of  the Member States and the Court of Auditors.

I am pleased to report that, consistently with previous years, we have successfully  completed our 2016 annual Work Programme, delivering all 64 reports on time and  within budget. These reports cover a wide spectrum of NIS areas ranging from traditional  activities such as incident reporting and baseline security controls to emerging areas  such as smart hospitals, cars and airports, embedded systems and cyber insurance. The  Agency also produced a number of practical studies supporting the implementation of  key EU policy areas, notably the NIS directive, the general data protection regulation  (GDPR), eIDAS and the payment services directive 2 (PSD2). All ENISA reports are  structured in such a way as to bring the key issues to the foreground and to make  concrete proposals on what needs to happen in order to strengthen our European  common approach to cybersecurity.  The Agency continues to deliver operational, financial, legal and compliance requirements  at similar efficiency levels as previous years. During 2016 the Agency began to put in place  a quality management system (QMS), a 3-year project, supported by a quality policy, as  well as large set of standard operation procedures and work instructions (WINs) that aim at  the standardisation of the internal procedures, optimisation of processes, risk mitigation,  and increase in efficiencies. The QMS aims for a constant performance improvement of  the best possible use of the available appropriations for delivering the best results for EU  citizens. In May 2016, the Agency carried out a reorganisation. We consider our colleagues  to be the best asset of ENISA, and bearing this in mind the Agency will continue to promote  the value of the people that contribute to the success of our work.  ENISA has coordinated another successful pan-European exercise, building on the  achievements of past years and once again raising the bar in terms of both objectives and  internal collaboration requirements. The 2016 exercise was a simulation of an EU-wide  crisis triggered by cyber-attacks designed to test EU- and national-level cooperation and  to improve technical and operational capabilities. This was the first exercise to be spread  over 6 months and to incorporate a 2-day intensive operations exercise. The exercise  benefited from exclusive on-site media coverage and was broadcast in 16 EU languages.  ENISA hosted several other successful events including two separate meetings of the  ENISA Industry Group, the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) and a briefing session at the  premises of the European Parliament on cryptography to MEPs. In the scope of the Work  Programme we also hosted a range of high-level technical workshops in important areas.  We have worked in close collaboration with others to support the EU Cybersecurity  challenge, helping the EU to motivate and develop new talent, and the European  Cyber Security Month (ECSM), the EU advocacy campaign promoting awareness on  cybersecurity. Many other successful projects can be seen in this report.  The Agency’s media outreach has improved and we are better prepared to meet  the challenges for the renewal of the mandate in the next few years as the critical  relevance of the Agency is attested by the daily cybersecurity challenges that the EU  faces. During 2016, a new enhanced website with improved functionality, new content  and dedicated sections was launched that allows the Agency to be closer to a larger  number of stakeholders. We have further strengthened our relations with many different  stakeholders and assisted them in making significant improvements to the state of  cybersecurity throughout the EU.  We continue to receive and respond to requests from the Member States and EU  institutions. During 2016, we closed 23 such requests. Most of these requests were in the  area of training, but we also received requests to assist the Commission regarding policy  implementation and also regarding specific cyber vulnerabilities.  The above illustrates the capacity of ENISA staff to work together and deliver on time  and in budget. I believe that our efforts are appreciated by all our stakeholders, which  includes the EU Member States, the European Commission, the European Parliament,  industry and ultimately the EU citizens.  Nowadays the need to optimise the available budget of the European Union as well as  the need to do more with fewer resources is a reality across all the European Union  organisations and bodies. ENISA is not an exception; the Agency continues to pursue  efficiency and effectiveness.  I profit from this opportunity to thank all staff and stakeholders for their contributions  and efforts during 2016, and look forward to delivering our new projects and studies in  the following year and reinforce our support to keep EU cyberspace safe and prepared  for the economic development aimed by all EU citizens.  Udo Helmbrecht Executive Director, ENISA  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1110  ENISA IN BRIEF  The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) was established in 2004  by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European  Parliament and the Council. Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security  extends ENISA’s mandate until 19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and  information security or cybersecurity in Europe.  ENISA supports the EU and the Member States  in enhancing and strengthening their capability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond  to network and information security problems  and incidents. ENISA’s vision is to secure and  enable Europe’s information society and to use its  unique competencies to help to drive the cyber  landscape in Europe.  The Agency works closely together with members of  both the public and private sector, to deliver advice  and guidelines that are based on solid operational  experience. ENISA also supports the development  of European Union (EU) policy and law on matters  relating to network and information security (NIS),  thereby contributing to economic growth in the EU’s  internal market.  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the  ENISA regulation, inputs from the Member States and  relevant communities, including the private sector:  Develop and maintain a high level of expertise of  EU actors, taking into account evolutions in NIS;  Assist the Member States and the EU institutions  and bodies in enhancing capacity building  throughout the EU;  Assist the Member States and the EU institutions  and bodies in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory  requirement of NIS;  Enhance cooperation both between the Member  States of the EU and between related NIS  communities.  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS. HIGHLIGHTS  OF THE YEAR  The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) contributes to  the policy goal of a high level of network and  information security (NIS) within the European  Union. The mission of ENISA is to secure Europe’s  information society, which translates into providing  expertise, supporting policy and creating know-how  to secure over 500 million citizens using every day  ICT to work, live and communicate.  INTRODUCTION  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1312  INTRODUCTION  As a centre of excellence and expertise in the field of  NIS, ENISA has used its expertise to:  advise its stakeholders on trends in the digital  world that affect security;  suggest good practices in various areas in relation  to information, services and systems security;  support the development and implementation of  policy requirements in the area of security and  data protection;  collaborate with stakeholders and contribute to  the NIS capacity and communities’ building.  The Work Programme (WP) of 2016 has resulted in  64 deliverables (which include also workshops and  similar activities) that have been produced in full.  The highlights of 2016 include new best practices  and recommendations for cybersecurity of smart  cars, smart hospitals, smart airports and blockchain.  The Agency kicked off the process of supporting the  Member States in their task of delivering against the  NIS directive, continued ongoing activities such as  Article 13a reporting, computer security incidents  response teams (CSIRT) training and held the biggest  EU cybersecurity exercise ever, Cyber Europe  2016. The Agency supported the EU Cybersecurity  Challenge event, which brought together teams  of students and school pupils from the different  Member States to compete against each other in  a series of technical challenges and, as in previous  years, we played a significant role in supporting the  EU Cyber Security Month (ECSM).  In line with its Work Programme, ENISA released a  number of reports on different aspects of NIS. These  include an updated Threat Landscape, guidelines,  and best practice recommendations regarding  privacy enhancing technologies. Additionally,  ENISA reports focused on issues, including but  not limited to, security and privacy in mobile  environments, standardisation including aspects of  the eIDAS regulation as well as the emerging area  of certification of products. Finally, ENISA compiled  a data breach severity assessment tool in close  collaboration with several Member State DPAs. The  aim of this tool has been to make available a coherent  framework to assess data breach severity across EU  MS. Requests under Article 14 of ENISA Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013 continued unabated as a method  for stakeholders to request assistance, culminating in  15 new requests.  As in previous years, the Agency organised a number  of high profile events throughout the year, such  as the High Level Event, two editions of the ENISA  industry event, the Annual Privacy Forum and the  European Cyber Security Challenge. ENISA also  hosted 14 important thematic workshops and  sessions, gathering experts in the field to discuss  cybersecurity topics.  Most relevant key performance  indicators  In 2016, the Agency delivered against its annual Work  Programme and all deliverables met or exceeded  the key performance indicators set (see Section I for  more details). Notable achievements are mentioned  hereunder along with examples of how the Agency  reached its goals. It should be noted that in March  2016 the ENISA WP2016 was amended to address the  changes in ENISA activities generated by the adoption  of the NIS directive. Key achievements include:  In 2016, ENISA published groundbreaking  reports regarding cybersecurity of smart cars,  smart airports and hospitals, helping asset  owners and all relevant actors in securing  citizens and infrastructures from cyber-attacks  and incidents. (Impact indicator in WPK1.1. NIS  Threat Analysis.)  With the adoption of the NIS directive, ENISA  has cooperated with all EU Member States and  the Commission to define the scope, the actions  related to ENISA and the next steps. More  specifically ENISA has assisted the Commission  and MS in the establishment of the Cooperation  Group envisaged in the NIS directive. The  Agency, as a member of this group, has provided  ideas to the Commission and MS about its  governance structure, its objectives and themes  to focus on as well as its working relationship  with the CSIRT Network. (Impact indicator in  WPK3.2.A. Assist EU MS and Commission in the  implementation of the NIS directive)  ENISA has continued to collect and analyse  national reports on large-scale telecom  security incidents in accordance with Article  13a of the framework directive on electronic  communications. The Agency, has analysed the  national reports, compared them with previous  years, identified new trends and developed  good practices and lessons learned. The Annual  Incidents Report 2016, including the analysis on  the incidents reported, was published around  September 2016. ENISA together with the Article  13a WG provided feedback to the EC on security  aspects regarding the new telecom code. The  feedback was well received, as some of the  observations are included in the new regulation  proposal. (Impact indicator in WPK3.2.C. Assistance  in the implementation of mandatory incident- reporting schemes)  ENISA organised a workshop on National Cyber  Security Strategies together with the Slovakian  Presidency of the EC in November, bringing  together stakeholders from more than 15 Member  States.  Moreover, the updated good practice  guide was published in November 2016 following  validation phase with all relevant stakeholders and  the ENISA NCSS experts group. (Impact indicator in  WPK2.1.B. Assistance in the area of cybersecurity  strategies)  More than 60 participants in the second Trust  Services Forum, including stakeholders from  Supervisory Bodies, Conformity Assessment  Bodies and Trust Service providers.  ENISA organised the fourth pan-European cyber  exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016). CE2016 was  a large-scale distributed technical and operational  exercise started in April 2016, offering the  opportunity to cybersecurity professionals across  Europe to analyse complex, innovative and realistic  cybersecurity incidents. CE2016 overall in the  6-month period engaged over 1 000 participants.  The 2016 edition of the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) resulted in a successful advocacy  campaign with 32 countries taking part, some 455  activities from public and private stakeholders and  an outreach in social media topping the previous  year’s statistics including 429 articles published in  October referring to ECSM. Included within these  results are the 465 courses now registered in 28  countries for the NIS Education map.  ENISA organised the first European Cyber Security  Challenge where 100 of the best young security  talents from 10 different nations fought for the  title in the final of the European Cyber Security  Challenge in Düsseldorf, Germany.  More than 80 participants in the Annual Privacy  Forum (APF) 16: (researchers, policymakers  and industry participants) (Impact indicator in  WPK3.2.B. Assistance in the implementation of NIS  measures of EU data protection regulation.)  ENISA produced a set of deliverables supporting  the implementation of the eIDAS regulation  seeking to shed more light in the service delivery  of trust services.  ENISA compiled a data breach severity assessment  tool in close collaboration with several Member  State DPAs. The aim of this tool has been to make  available a coherent framework to assess data  breach severity across EU MS.  The Agency analysed important aspects of use  privacy protection in a mobile environment.  The emerging area of product certification  received particular attention throughout 2016,  as ENISA supported Commission initiatives and it  coordinated private and public stakeholders in an  effort to shape the field with a view to supporting  future policy.  Finally, reports on incident reporting in the energy  sector and on cyber-hygiene guidance have been  produced, reviewing the prevailing situation across  the EU.  Key conclusions on the effectiveness  of the internal control systems and  financial management  ENISA has consolidated internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to en- sure that policy and operational objectives are achieved  within the applicable legal and financial framework.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory and the Agency  consistently meets its goals in full.  The Agency has put in place an organisational  structure and a set of internal controls that are suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives,  in accordance with the standards and suitable to  mitigate risks associated with the environment in  which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency  adopted a set of 16 internal control standards laying  down the minimum requirements with which its  internal control systems need to comply. Previously  developed internal procedures were grouped  together, prioritised and implemented in the daily  workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2016, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on  the recommendations raised by the auditing bodies  (European Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit  Service of the European Commission). It has been  reported that with reference to 2014, the Agency  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1514  INTRODUCTION  achieved compliance with the internal control  standards; for more details, please refer to Sections 3  to 6 and to the annexes of this report.  Information for the stakeholders  2016 will be remembered as the year of the biggest  DDoS attack, the biggest data breach but also as the  year of the NIS directive:  In autumn 2016 a series of massive (distributed  denial-of-service) DDoS attacks occurred. They  were mainly propagated through compromised  internet of things (IoT) devices. ‘Mirai’, a type of  malware that originally targets IoT devices, was  used to orchestrate massive DDoS. In November  2016, another incident related to a variant of the  Mirai malware took place. An upgraded variant of  the malware targeted customers’ home routers of  Germany’s telecommunication company Deutsche  Telekom. A large number of home routers were hit  by the outage.  During 2016 a series of major and massive data  breaches emerged exposing hundreds of millions  of user emails and passwords (in hashed or  plaintext form). It is understood that the data  were originally sold on the black market, but soon  a lot of them became public. Interestingly, all  these data breaches are dated a few years back,  but they were only disclosed recently, remaining  within private circles for years. Following these  data breaches a wide range of attacks on well- known websites occurred because of users  reusing their passwords.  The directive on security of network and  information systems (the NIS directive) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July  2016. The directive entered into force in August  2016. ENISA’s Executive Director Prof. Dr Udo  Helmbrecht said: ‘The NIS directive is one of  the components for the delivery of digital  single market. Its success lies with the full  engagement of all the stakeholders identified in  the directive, including digital service providers.  Cybersecurity challenges can be only addressed  by working together.’  As underlined by the latest ENISA Threat Landscape,  2016 was characterised by ‘the efficiency of cyber- crime monetisation’. Undoubtedly, optimisation  of cybercrime turnover was the trend observed in  2016. And, as with many of the negative aspects in  cyberspace, this trend is here to stay. On the other  side, this is another confirmation of the necessity  of an agency like ENISA. Positive developments  can be reached only by strengthening the Agency  and putting more resources on the fight against  cyber-attacks. Only an agency with a clear and  comprehensive mandate and adequate resources  can contribute to better face all the cybersecurity  challenges that are arising and augment its  outreach to the benefit of different stakeholders  and asset owners across Europe.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 17  This Annual Activity Report (AAR) for 2016 follows the  structure of the ENISA Work Programme (WP) 2016  to assist reader understanding of what was achieved.  The WP 2016 was aligned with the strategic objectives  featured in the strategy and the multiannual planning  of the Agency. The strategic objectives (SO) of the WP  2016 were as follows:  SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of  expertise of EU actors taking into account evolutions  in network and information security (NIS).  SO2: To assist the Member States and the  Commission in enhancing capacity building  throughout the EU.  SO3: To assist the Member States and the  Commission in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory  requirements of network and information security.  SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the  Member States of the EU and between related  NIS communities.  In the following sections, the results of WP 2016  implementation are presented for each of the  abovementioned objectives. After the description of  the concrete results for each strategic objective, the  achievements against indicators and the detailed  results for each deliverable are presented in tables.  It should be noted that the ENISA WP2016 was  amended in March 2016 to address the changes in  ENISA activities generated by the adoption of the NIS  directive. This activity report follows the structure of  the amended WP2016.  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO1 — DEVELOP  AND MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF NIS  EXPERTISE OF EU ACTORS  SO1 aims to develop and maintain a high level of  expertise of EU actors, taking into account evolutions  in network and information security (NIS). In  2016, this SO covered the Threat Landscape and  risk assessment, including new technologies and  specific areas such as smart cars, smart airports and  smart hospitals as well as information sharing and  good practices and recommendations for critical  information infrastructure protection (CIIP).  List of work packages and short description  WPK 1.1 — Improving the expertise related to  critical information infrastructures In this work package (WPK) ENISA developed good  practices on emerging smart critical infrastructures  and services. This work provided smart critical  information infrastructure and service providers and  developers with good security and resilience practices  to be used when designing, developing and deploying  such services in order to minimise the exposure  of such networks and services to all relevant cyber  threat categories.  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF WORK  PROGRAMME 2016I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 1918  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  WPK 1.2 — NIS Threats Landscape analysis Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern  IT systems in any context requires recognising  and adapting to changes in the evolving threat  environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to  predict all future threats (security practices have often  been dramatically changed as a result of so called  ‘black swan’ events, which are notoriously difficult  to predict), it is possible to predict the evolution of  certain threats with a reasonable degree of accuracy  based on past data.  ENISA supported its stakeholders by compiling  existing data on threat evolution and tailoring  this data to the needs of specific stakeholder  communities. The approach covered threats across  all sectors, whilst identifying specificities particular to  particular communities in line with the goals of the  WP. This is a more scalable approach than carrying  out threat analysis directly.  WPK 1.3 — Research and development, innovation Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe  in the field of NIS, and this area is extensively  supported by European-funded programmes,  research is usually not focused on the aspects  where NIS policies need available technologies  to move forward on their implementation. ENISA  aims in this WPK to contribute to the various  consultations launched by the Commission in the  area of NIS. Such consultations may be conducted  in the context of setting the research priorities for  future calls for proposals or in the context policy  initiatives launched or about to be launched by  the Commission. Furthermore, during 2016 ENISA  prepared a set of recommendations on aligning  research programmes with policy in the area of NIS.  1.1.1 WPK 1.1: Improving the expertise  related to critical information  infrastructures  In this WPK ENISA developed good practices on  emerging smart critical infrastructures and services  using the concept of the internet of things (IoT) to  deliver new, innovative business models and services.  The reports provide smart critical information  infrastructure and service providers and developers  with good security and resilience practices when  designing, developing and deploying such services  in order to minimise the exposure of such network  and services to all relevant cyber threat categories.  This builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of  smart cities (WP 2015), smart grids (WP 2012-2015)  and intelligent transportation systems (WP 2015).  The main areas of work of this WPK are as follows.  ENISA defines smart cars as systems providing  connected, added-value features in order to  enhance car users experience or improve car  safety. It encompasses use cases such as telematics,  connected infotainment or intra-vehicular  communication. The 2016 report on cybersecurity  of smart cars listed the sensitive assets present in  smart cars, as well as the corresponding threats,  risks, attack scenarios, mitigation factors and  possible security measures to implement. Smart  cars subject matter experts were contacted to reflect  the needs of Europe’s automotive cybersecurity  stakeholders. The results are further aligned with  the C-ITS Platform run by DG Mobility and Transport,  to synergise efforts and the input from the ENISA  Cars and Roads SECurity (CaRSEC) Expert Group to  finalise the results. The goal is to secure smart cars  today for safer autonomous cars tomorrow.  The notion of smart hospitals is introduced when  internet of things (IoT) components are supporting  core functions of a hospital. Due to the great  number of significant assets at stake (patient  life, sensitive personal information and financial  resources) information security is a key issue  for smart hospitals. ENISA identified the assets  comprising the smart infrastructure inside the  hospital walls, threats faced by smart hospitals  as well as security measures set to address them.  Based on attack scenarios, the Agency identified  good practices and finally recommendations for  both healthcare operators as well as IoT devices  manufacturers and vendors.  Smart airports are those airports making use of  integrated internet of things (IoT) components to  bring added-value services. By integrating smart  components, airports are exposed to a larger  attack surface and new attack vectors. In response  to the new emerging threats faced by smart  airports, this 2016 ‘Securing Smart Airports’ report  provides a guide for airport decision-makers  (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of Operations)  and airport information security professionals, but  also relevant national authorities and agencies  that are in charge of cybersecurity for airports.  Based on an in-depth examination of existing  knowledge as well as validation interviews with  subject matter experts, this report highlights  the key assets of smart airports. Built on  this, a detailed analysis and threats mapping  was conducted with a particular focus on the  vulnerabilities of smart components.  For each area, ENISA identified all relevant public  and private stakeholders, engaged them in working  groups and jointly took stock of and analysed the  current situation in terms of cybersecurity and  resilience, placing emphasis on communication  security. The Agency also identified EU and national- funded projects in the area of IoT and M2M  communication, liaised with them, analysed their  findings and deliverables, and further engaged them  in corresponding expert groups. Special emphasis  was given to the resilience and robustness of such  smart critical information infrastructure and services.  Based on the consultation with stakeholders and  desktop analysis and research, ENISA developed  good practices and propose baseline security  requirements targeted at EU and national  policymakers, operators and manufacturers.  1.1.2 WPK 1.2: Network and information  security threats landscape analysis  The main goal of this work package was to develop the  current cyber threat landscape by the collection and  collation of publicity available information. The resulting  report includes current threats, as well as threat trends  in NIS, information about different attack vectors,  classification schemes for cyber threats (i.e. taxonomies)  and emerging technologies. This information will allow  the interested readers to achieve a more complete  coverage of the threat analysis life cycle.  In addition, as in previous years, in-depth studies on  two emerging technologies for risk assessment and  threat analysis were performed: ‘Hardware Threat  Landscape and Good Practice Guide’ and ‘Ad hoc and  sensor networking for M2M Communications Threat  Landscape and Good Practice Guide’. These reports  identified related network assets and the security  threats, challenges and risks arising from these  assets for each technology and identified security  mechanisms and good practices for each applicable  environment. Finally, based in the collated information,  technical, policy and organisational recommendations  for proactively enhancing the security for each  emerging technology were provided.  In this WPK ENISA  developed good  practices on emerging  smart critical  infrastructures  and services using  the concept of the  internet of things  (IoT) to deliver new,  innovative business  models and services.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 2120  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.1.3 WPK 1.3: Research and  development, innovation  In 2016, ENISA’s Crypto Challenge (which we named  Crypt a Bite) was launched. The pilot study aimed to  capture the interest of young students for information  security and cryptography. We especially aimed at  students with an interest in maths and logic. In order  to catch the attention of the ‘non-geek’, we decided on  a gamification of the contest. The pilot was successful  in the sense that a large fraction of registered users  did participate in the actual competition. Further, it  is possible to attract students with a viral campaign;  however, we also learned that a longer, more  coordinated advertisement phase is needed to reach  more students. For the pilot more than 700 users  registered and performed the training challenges of  phase I of which 94 participated at the final round. The  full report is published under the name Crypt a Bite —  ENISA’s Crypto Challenge.  Another aspect of this WPK for 2016 was the  preparation of a set of recommendations on aligning  research programmes with policy in the specialised  area of NIS. The specialised field of Network and  Information Security (NIS) is supported extensively by  EU-funded research programmes, but is not always  focused on the aspects where emerging policy and  legislative initiatives need available technologies to  move forward on their implementation. The scope  of this report was to summarise achievements that  have significantly promoted specific pillars of NIS,  identify specific outcomes that promoted and support  emerging policy and legislative initiatives, namely  eIDAS, GDPR, and provide recommendations on  the cPPP and the formulation of forthcoming work  programmes. During the preparation of this report,  selected stakeholders from academia, research, public  authorities and research and technology organisations  were contacted to provide their subject matter  experience and expertise.  Finally, in order to support the R & D in this area,  ENISA prepared a study on the security aspects of  virtualisation. The recent and widespread adoption  of virtualisation technologies has changed the  traditional view of ICT, as virtualisation can provide a  dramatic increase in the efficiency and effectiveness  of complex organisations and communities.  However, virtualised environments are increasingly  becoming targets of cyber-attacks: More and more  elaborate and specialised attacks are currently  devised to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses  at the virtualisation layer. The report prepared by  ENISA provides an analysis of the current status  of security of virtualisation, by presenting current  technologies affected, risks, efforts, gaps, and the  impact the latter have on environments based on  virtualisation technologies. The final objective of the  ‘Study on security aspects of virtualisation’ report is to  provide the basis to understand the main issues and  challenges related to the security in virtualisation, and  provide a look at common best practices to implement  a secure virtualised environment.  SO1 — To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of European Union actors, taking  into account evolutions in network and information security  WPKs, impact indicators Achieved results  WPK 1.1.: Improving the expertise related to critical information infrastructures  By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use  ENISA’s recommendations on smart cars.  Over the year, several authorities were involved in  the study and the activities of the ENISA Cars SECurity  (CaRSEC) Expert Group.  We have received valuable input and feedback from  French Ministry of Interior — Gendarmerie Nationale,  German Federal Office for Information Security,  Joint Research Center, ANSSI — French Network and  Information Security Agency and Kuratorium Sicheres  Östereich.  By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use  ENISA’s recommendations on smart health devices,  services and infrastructures.  ENISA has built this study based on healthcare  organisations (hospitals) from across the EU, namely  with representatives from Oulu University hospital,  Finland; Hospital Clinico San Carlos Madrid, Spain; HUG  Geneva Hospitals, Switzerland; Association of Hospitals  in Vienna, Austria; NHS Digital UK; National Oncology  Hospital of Sofia, Bulgaria; Jena University Hospital,  Sweden; Munich Municipal Hospital, Germany.  By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use  ENISA’s recommendations on smart airports.  The study involved several major airports across Europe  and related entities such as European Commission,  European Aviation Safety Agency, Eurocontrol, SESAR  Joint Undertaking and ACI Europe.  WPK 1.2: Network and information security Threats Landscape analysis  In 2016 at least 15 companies and five Member States  participate in the ENISA stakeholder groups established  to perform the work.  More than 15 companies and more than 5 Member  States contributed in the threat analysis/landscape  process as well as the validation of the work.  By 2017 produced results are referenced by at least 500  stakeholders in the area of threat/risk assessment.  ENISA Threat Landscape results have been reused within  multiple stakeholders, both within and outside EU. In  various discussions, blogs and presentations, references  to ENISA Threat Landscape 2016 have also been found  widely referenced in different social networks. During the first week of dissemination, the ENISA Threat  Landscape 2016 was disseminated via social media  with the following rates: ca. 200 views and 70 likes in  LinkedIn, ca. 2 000 impressions in Twitter ca. 15 re- tweets and ca. 50 engagements. This response from the  community is considered successful. Additional analytics  will be obtained after a sufficient time window.  By 2017 produced results are downloaded by at least 10  000 individuals.  Various ENISA Threat Landscape reports (ENISA Threat  Landscape and Thematic Landscapes) were downloaded  for more than 20 000 individuals in 2016. These numbers  are referring to 2015 deliverables disseminated in  2016. For the time being and after ca. one week of  dissemination, the uptake of ENISA 2017 deliverables  counts ca. 2 500 downloads.  WPK 1.3: NIS Threats Analysis  At least 10 experts from the community to participate in  the validation of the results of the studies.

Achievement of impact indicators for Objective 1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 2322  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.2 KEY RESULTS IN THE IMPLEMEN- TATION OF SO2 — ASSISTANCE IN  ENHANCING CAPACITY BUILDING  THROUGHOUT THE EU  SO2 aims at providing assistance to MS and EU  institutions and bodies, as well as the private sector  by supporting NIS enhancement of capacity building  through the EU. ENISA worked together with Member  States and EU institutions to assist them in capacity  building across the EU. In particular, the Agency  worked together with all relevant stakeholders to  ensure that the approach adopted has been coherent  across all EU stakeholders involved.  List of work packages and short description  WPK 2.1 — Assist Member States’  capacity building One of the main goals of this work package (WPK) has  been to develop and improve activities related to the  operational security support programme. In 2016,  ENISA built upon its work in the operational security  area, and updated the impact assessment related  to this area to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ via a  dialogue with relevant stakeholders.  Another main goal of this WPK has been to support  the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders,  such as the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to  develop and extend the necessary capabilities in  order to meet the ever-growing challenges to secure  their networks and data.  WPK 2.2 — Support EU institutions’ capacity building In this WPK ENISA aims at stepping up in its dialogue  with EU institutions and support them in reinforcing  their NIS capacity building. The Agency provided  its key stakeholders with timely and high-quality  responses to NIS developments.  WPK 2.3 — Assist private sector capacity building One of the main obstacles for the implementation  of wide and effective cybersecurity programmes  in organisations has been the lack of a common  language among managers and technical staff, which  makes it difficult for the latter to transmit the current  security scenario to the former. ENISA reviewed cyber  hygiene practices across the Member States for the  purpose of helping increase cybersecurity awareness  and promote a culture of cybersecurity within  organisations and Member States.  The agency collected information on prominent  experiences across various MS by focusing on the  theme of cyber-hygiene and associated guides that are  currently in use in various MS.  WPK 2.3 — Assist in improving the general  awareness ENISA delivered against its long-standing goal of the  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign  that dates back to 2010 and it expanded its outreach  with numerous activities in the Member States,  reaching directly or indirectly a large number of  European citizens. By coordinating the ECSM, ENISA  seeks to contribute to the efficient management  of MS capability in awareness raising on network  and information security and on the exchange of  good practices among its key stakeholders as it has  consistently done over time.  Additionally, ENISA promoted capacity building in  the security community by launching a competition  named the ‘ENISA cyber challenge’. Its goal was to  increase the interest in NIS by promoting excellence in  the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback  on the areas of interest for the communities.  1.2.1 WPK 2.1: Assist Member States’  capacity building  1.2.1.1 WPK 2.1.A: Assistance in the area of  operational security and NIS operational training  Objectives:  Facilitate voluntary information sharing techniques  to enhance quality of collection;  Extend mutual interactions with stakeholders in  MS-wide area for incident response collaboration;  Build upon successful work in the area of ‘training  methodologies and impact assessment’;  Update training material for operational  communities (e.g. CSIRTs);  Develop new sets of training for NIS;  Further develop and apply ENISA  recommendations for baseline capabilities;  Provide technical training for MS and EU bodies.  22  ENISA worked together  with Member States  and EU institutions to  assist them in capacity  building across the EU.

Mapping of deliverables into papers/publications/activities  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 25  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  24  One of the main goals of this WPK was to perform  sustainable research, development and improvement of  activities related to the multiannual development for  the operational security support programme.  In 2016, ENISA updated the training methodologies  and ‘baseline capabilities’ report. The goal was to  concisely identify ‘lessons learned’ via a dialogue with  relevant stakeholders, and to reflect constantly on  developing CSIRT activities for the coming years.  Another main goal of this WPK is to help the EU Member  States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU  institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop and  extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the  ever-growing challenges to secure their networks.  Most of the activities in this WPK target maintaining  and extending the collection of good practice  guidelines in various areas of operational- capability building. In addition, ENISA continues to  offer support to the Member States by providing  them with means to enhance their national and  governmental CSIRT capabilities.  Emphasis in this WPK was put on supporting  operational bodies and communities (namely CSIRTs,  but other communities where appropriate) via  concrete advice (such as good practice material) and  concrete actions (such as CSIRT training).  In 2016, ENISA updated and expanded its  comprehensive set of training and exercises,  consisting of material that can be used by both  students and trainers. The new training material  provides a step-by-step guide on how to address/ respond to incidents/issues as an incident handler  and investigator. The material is technical and aims  to provide a guided training both to incident handlers  and investigators, while providing lifelike conditions.  New topics in the training material cover aspects of  forensic analysis and incident response. The updated  training material provides new table top exercises in the  areas of incident handling management, including the  setting up of CSIRTs.  1.2.1.2 WPK 2.1.B: Assistance in the area of  cybersecurity strategies  ENISA published its first National Cyber Security  Strategy Good Practice Guide in 2012. Since then,  EU Member States and EFTA countries have made  great progress in developing and implementing their  strategies. The new updated guide includes up-to- date information on the different steps, objectives  and good practices for the implementation of NCSS  and analyses the status of NCSS in the European  Union and EFTA area. The aim is to support EU  Member States in their efforts to develop and update  their NCSS. Therefore, the target audience of this  guide are public officials and policymakers. The guide  also provides useful insights for the stakeholders  involved in the lifecycle of the strategy, such as  private, civil and industry stakeholders.  This guide places a special emphasis on the  evaluation and maintaining phase. Suggestions for  possible and indicative key performance indicators  (KPIs) for objectives of the strategy are described.  In addition, the guide presents the status of  implementation of NCSS among EU Member States  and identifies gaps.  ENISA acts as a facilitator in this process by bringing  together MS and the private sector with varying  degrees of experience to discuss and exchange good  practices, share lessons learned and identify challenges  and possible solutions.  In 2016, ENISA updated  and expanded its  comprehensive set of  training and exercises,  consisting of material  that can be used by both  students and trainers.

Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.2.1.3 WPK 2.1.C: Assistance in the area of privacy  and trust  ENISA supported Member States in their own decision- making process, by providing advice and referencing to  the appropriate ENISA studies in the area of privacy  and trust. While this was a task-on-demand, the  Agency provided appropriate tools that facilitate  Member State implementation of the provisions set  out in the trust services regulation and in the general  data protection regulation. Supervisory bodies of the  MS were involved in this line of work.  Specifically, in the area of personal data breaches,  ENISA compiled a data breach severity assessment  tool in close collaboration with several Member State  DPAs. The aim of this tool has been to make available  a coherent framework to assess data breach severity  across EU MS.  In addition to this work, defined by the ENISA Work  Programme, ENISA supported the Commission in the  preparation of the draft ePrivacy regulation.  1.2.2 WPK 2.2: Support European Union  institutions’ capacity building  1.2.2.1 WPK 2.2.A: Information notes on NIS:  production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  The main goal of this work package was to provide  information on NIS issues and developments  that reached a certain level of public attention  to ENISA’s key stakeholders, in a timely manner.  Through info notes, the Agency was able to timely  respond to NIS occurrences beyond its annual  work packages, closely following the rapid updates  and significant developments in the field of cyber  security. Each of the different types of notes focused  on highlighting facts and shortcomings behind  NIS issues, often providing recommendations for  addressing those shortcomings in the long term.  One of the essential aims of info notes was to provide  an independent, unbiased and ‘calm’ opinion to the  Agency’s stakeholders. In addition to previous years’  dissemination of info notes to ENISA’s key stakeholders,  info notes were also published online at ENISA’s  website, rendering them publicly available to any  interested party.  2.2.2.2 WPK 2.2.B: Reinforcement of the NIS of  Union institutions, bodies and agencies  In this WPK ENISA aimed to enhance the dialogue  among European institutions and support them  in reinforcing their NIS. In 2016, concrete actions  occurred.  ENISA has identified and liaised with all relevant  stakeholders within European institutions and  bodies. In cooperation with all relevant European  institutions and bodies, the Agency took stock of and  initiated an analysis of existing regulations, policies,  procedures and practices of many EU institutions  related to their NIS.  Through stocktaking and analysis, ENISA identified  overlaps and gaps between all these regulations  and policies. These findings were discussed with all  relevant stakeholders from EU MS in the context of  the NIS Directive Cooperation Group. This might pave  the way for a permanent strategic dialogue among all  European institutions and bodies on the future of NIS  policy in the EU.  This dialogue resulted in important recommendations  that will allow the simplification of policies, reduction  of overlaps, identification of synergies, creation of  awareness about NIS challenges and even proposals  for new actions to address identified gaps. This will  help European institutions and bodies to better focus  their efforts and properly use their resources to meet  the needs of EU MS and the private sector.  Considering the sensitiveness of the information that  ENISA might be provided with by European institutions,  deliverables were restricted in distribution.  Building on this work, ENISA will address, in future  work programmes, the setting up of a European  institution NIS contingency plan, the organisation of  dedicated EU institution cyber incidents exercises, and  the launch of awareness-raising initiatives.  1.2.3 WPK 2.3: Assist private sector  capacity building  ENISA has reviewed best practices in Member  States on how to reach out to the private sector  to create increased cybersecurity awareness and  skills. Additional ways to promote a culture of  cybersecurity have been analysed. In 2016, the  agency focused on studying and analysing cyber  hygiene guides across selected Member States that  have such instruments and policies in place and it  came up with a set of recommendations for issuers of  such guides and their users.  1.2.4 WPK 2.4: Assist in improving  general awareness  The growing need for IT security professionals is  widely acknowledged worldwide. To help solve this  shortage of skill, many countries launched national  cyber security competitions addressed towards  students, university graduates or even non-ICT  professionals with a clear aim: find new and young  cyber talent and encourage young people to pursue a  career in cyber security.  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)  leverages these competitions by adding a pan- European layer. Top cyber talents from each  participating country meet to network and collaborate  and finally compete against each. Contestants are  challenged in solving security-related tasks from  domains such as web security, mobile security, crypto  puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics and in the  process collect points for solving them.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that  brings together young talent from across Europe to  have fun and compete in cyber security.  The final stage of ECSC was held in Düsseldorf,  Germany between 7 and 9 November 2016. Ten  countries attended the event: Austria, Estonia,  Germany, Greece, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Romania,  Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The  participants were expected to discover vulnerabilities  in web applications, binaries and document files,  solve crypto puzzles and hack hardware systems.  However, technical skills were just one part of the  challenge. As time and resources were limited,  teamwork skills were also extremely important. The  competition ended with a presentation by each team.  Between the contestants, coaches and judges, more  than 130 people actively took part in the event. The  competition was also accompanied by a conference  with industry representatives and a job fair.  From its side, the 2016 edition of the European  Cyber Security Month (ECSM) resulted in a successful  advocacy campaign with 32 countries taking  part, some 455 activities from public and private  stakeholders and an outreach in social media topping  the previous year’s statistics including 429 articles  published in October referring to ECSM. Included within  these results are the 465 courses now registered in 28  countries for the NIS Education map.  European Cyber Security Challenge 2016  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 2928  PART I.

Over the year, ENISA supported the update of the CSIRT  baseline capabilities covering Challenges for National  CSIRTs in Europe in 2016.  Continued CSIRT services training will be provided to a  minimum of 20 participants of different organisations in  five Member States.  Services and training were provided to 11 Member  States for around 150 participants from: Hellenic National Cert training, Hellenic Ministry of  Interior, CERT.BE, Czech national CSIRT team, Estonia,  Lithuania, Hungary – GovCERT, CSIRT Malta, CSIRT  Slovakia, Germany, EC IAS staff  Improved operational practices of CSIRTs in at least 15  Member States (ongoing support with best practices  development).  A workshop was organised in The Hague 11 on May  2016 that gathered 50 participants from over 30 teams  coming from all EU and EFTA countries. Additionally, over  the year, ENISA participated and organised two informal  workshops for the EU NIS directive’s CSIRTs Network.  WPK 2.1.B: Assistance in the area of cybersecurity strategies  By 2017, 10 Member States use ENISA’s good practices  on NCSS.  Experts from Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia,  Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Luxembourg,  Hungary, Malta, Austria, Slovenia, Finland and Sweden  have provided information and are including in their  national strategies the recommendations by ENISA:  By 2017, 15 private organisations use ENISA’s good  practices on NCSS.  Experts from 15 private organisations have provided  information and are including in their national strategies  the recommendations by ENISA.  By 2017, 10 Member States use ENISA’s good practices  on national public–private partnerships (PPPs).  Experts from Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia,  Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Luxembourg,  Hungary, Malta, Austria, Slovenia, Finland and Sweden  have provided information and are including in their  national strategies the recommendations by ENISA.  By 2017, 15 private organisations use ENISA’s good  practices on national PPPs.  Experts from 15 private organisations have provided  information and are including in their national strategies  the recommendations by ENISA.  WPK 2.1.C: Assistance in the area of privacy and trust  At least five data protection authorities (DPA) and  10 large EU data controllers to use the personal data  breaches severity assessment tool.  The Agency has received more than 50 requests to  access the personal data breaches severity assessment  tool.  WPK 2.2: Support European Union institutions’ capacity building  WPK 2.2.A: Information notes on NIS: production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  In 2017 improve information flows regarding NIS issues  between the EU institutions.  In 2017, information and feedback from different EU  institutions were used for the creation, and as reference,  on different info notes. In the same way on-demand  topics info notes were created.  In 2017 improved mechanism for producing and  distributing of info notes.  In 2017 info notes will be contextualised according  to ENISA’s Threat Landscape and their content will  be updated as deemed necessary in order to provide  a more coherent representation of NIS occurrences  amongst the two work packages.  At least two EU bodies and five public stakeholders will  receive the timely information on NIS incidents and  significant developments in the field.  In 2016, info notes are published on the ENISA website  and are publicly available for all interested stakeholders  and announced on relevant channels.  1.2.5 General results. Achievement of impact indicators for Objective 2  SO2 — To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity building  throughout the EU  WPKs, impact indicators Achieved results  WPK 2.2.A: Information notes on NIS: production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  ENISA’s expertise regarding the MS NIS capacity  development is also to be offered to EU institutions,  agencies and bodies (hereinafter: ‘EU institutions’), in  cooperation with CERT-EU.  ENISA, drawing from its expertise in the area of National  Cyber  Security Strategies (NCSS), NISD, and CIIP, took  stock of sectorial initiatives developed by EU institutions,  mostly the Commission.  The Commission (DG CNECT) actively participated  in the study and provided additional comments and  suggestions, and as a result helped in validating the  content of it. The end result is also presented in the first  official meeting of the NISD Cooperation group.  Enhanced knowledge of EU institutions regulations,  policies, procedures related to their NIS.  The stocktaking also allowed EU institutions to better  understand the complex ecosystem, identify possible  overlaps and gaps. Through this, they developed better  knowledge and expertise on EU institutions regulations,  policies and procedures.  Identification of well-functioning practices that could be  disseminated to all or relevant EU institutions, as well as  information concerning critical weaknesses that should  be addressed.  The report identified several good practices widely used  in several sectorial EU initiatives. Examples include  PPPs, regulatory provisions (e.g. baseline requirements,  incident reporting), information sharing, national  NCSS. Such examples also provided better insights and  knowledge benefiting EU institutions but also ENISA.  Identification of future actions that ENISA could initiate  in order to further reinforce the NIS of EU institutions.  The key conclusion was the necessity to analyse all these  initiatives and identify possible synergies and gaps. In  addition, it is important to agree how the EU institutions  develop their NIS policies in terms of sectors. Such discus- sion has started within the Cooperation Group of the NISD.  WPK 2.3: Assist private sector capacity building  At least five MS and five private sector stakeholders  contribute to the production of the guidelines for  MS to reach the private sector through cybersecurity  awareness dissemination activities.  The stock taking activity of cyber hygiene practices across  the EU resulted in identifying three MS who actively reach  the private sector via guidelines that they produce.  At least 15 private sector stakeholders coming from  different MS, sectors of activity and size participate in  the elaboration of the recommendations for ICT security  staff on improving management level cybersecurity  awareness.  A review of cyber hygiene practices was carried out across  the EU and specifically to establish the understanding  of the private sector’s engagement with national cyber  hygiene programmes. 15 private sector stakeholders were  interviewed for the purpose of the review.  WPK 2.4: Assist in improving general awareness  At least 50 individuals from MS participate in the ENISA  cyber challenge.  More than 130 people, from 10 EU MS, actively took part  in ECSC2016  Representatives from the EU-28 MS and five partner  countries participate in ECSM and the release of general  NIS messages for citizens.  Over 100 participants from EU representatives and partner  countries participated in the ECSM kick-off event in Brus- sels and general NIS messages for citizens were released  in a coordinated press release. Activities from all 28 MS  were registered on the ECSM portal including 5 partner  countries, releasing general NIS messages for citizens.  At least five international stakeholders collaborate, for  better coordination, in the ECSM.  Stakeholders from across Europe participated in the  ECSM coordinators conference calls and the meeting in  Brussels for better coordination of the campaign. Interna- tional stakeholders included European Banking Federa- tion, Europol EC3, Confederation of European Computer  User Associations, ECDL Foundation and ITU Council.  At least 10 experts from the community participate in  reviewing the contents of the citizens’ portal.  The content of the ECSM portal was reviewed by ENISA  experts and external experts for its NIS messages and  usability.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3332  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.3 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO3 — ASSISTANCE  IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING  THE NIS-RELATED POLICIES  SO3 provides the framework for ENISA to assist the  EU MS and the EU institutions in developing and  implementing the policies necessary to meet the  legal and regulatory requirements of network and  information security (NIS).  List of work packages and short description  WPK 3.1 — Supporting EU policy development The key objective of this work package (WPK) was for  ENISA to proactively contribute to the development  of existing or new EU policy initiatives (before they  are launched) and assists the Commission, Member  States and the private sector in the implementation of  existing policies in this area.  ENISA achieved this objective by engaging with public  and private stakeholders and leveraging its existing  knowledge and expertise in the area of secure  infrastructure and services.  Another key objective of this WPK was cybersecurity  standardisation. From its initial set up, ENISA has  tracked the development of standards in the area  of NIS, maintaining close contacts and collaboration  with international standardisation organisations.  This approach enables ENISA to keep its activities  up-to-date with the latest developments as  well as informing its stakeholders on new NIS  standardisation activities and to flag opportunities  and/or risks as they develop.  In line with the more proactive role given to the  Agency in the latest mandate, ENISA supported this  area, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, by  developing recommendations for improving NIS  in EU standardisation policy, providing guidelines  of the possible frameworks that can be adopted  in order to achieve a harmonised scheme across  MS, as well as setting recommendations for the  stakeholders involved. Importantly ENISA contributes  to standardisation by reviewing standardisation gaps  and providing due justification for action by SDOs  and stakeholders alike. Finally, ENISA contributes to the  coordination of standards by joining key coordination  groups and meetings for the purpose of providing the  regulatory cybersecurity view to this important area of  the EU policy framework.  WPK 3.2 — Supporting EU policy implementation This WPK covered activities linked to the  implementation of EU directives and regulations (i.e.  activities linked to electronic identification and trust  services (eIDAS) regulation, ePrivacy directive, general  data protection regulation and the NIS directive) where  ENISA has been assigned a role and responsibilities  and where NIS is one of the main goals or means to  achieve suitable implementation.  ENISA has cooperated with all EU Member States  and the Commission to define the scope and the  implementation priorities of the NIS directive, the  actions related to ENISA and the sectors and/or  services affected. As a result of this, the Agency then  identified all relevant public and private stakeholders  (e.g. competent authorities, manufacturers and  operators) and engaged them in a structured  dialogue on the key objectives of the NIS directive and  how it can be best implemented within each sector  and/or service.  ENISA has been a recognised contributor to policy  in privacy and trust and the Agency has extensively  contributed to support the implementation of the  personal data protection regulatory framework  in many of its key technological aspects. ENISA  continued supporting the implementation of  EC Regulation 611/2013 by providing assistance  regarding technical protective measures (appropriate  cryptographic protective measures) as the  abovementioned regulation requests ENISA to do.  ENISA continued collecting and analysing annual  national reports of security breaches from national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) in accordance with  Article 13a of the framework directive on electronic  communications. The Agency, in cooperation with  experts from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. ENISA’s  e-communications reference group) analysed the  national reports, compared them with previous years,  identified new trends and developed good practices  and lessons learned.  Another WPK area has been related to aspects  of the implementation of the Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market. Trust services are a key enabler for  increasing citizens’ confidence in online services,  and given their nature, they require a high level  of security to ensure their integrity and reliability.  ENISA has contributed extensively to the area of  securing trust services in the past by providing best  practices for providers, recommendations on audit  schemes, standardisation guidance, security-breach  reporting and recommendations, etc. Building on  the work of 2015, in 2016 ENISA focused on the  key areas of interest for stakeholders’ including  guidelines on initiation and supervision of trust  service providers (TSPs), update on relevant  technical standards and security recommendations  for relying parties of trust services.  1.3.1 WPK 3.1: Supporting European Union  policy development  1.2.1.1 WPK 3.1.A: Contribution to EU policy linked  to secure infrastructures and services  In this WPK, ENISA engaged with public and private  stakeholders and developed state-of-the-art  recommendations and good practices in secure  infrastructure and services with the objective of  proactively contributing to the development of  existing or new EU policy initiatives (before they are  launched) and assist the Commission, Member States  and the private sector in the implementation of  existing policies in this area.  ENISA achieved this objective by engaging with public  and private stakeholders, by deploying existing  expert groups, e.g. the European SCADA and control  systems information Exchange (EuroSCSIE) and the  EICS — ENISA ICS Security Stakeholder Group and by  leveraging its existing knowledge and expertise in the  area of secure infrastructure and services. One of the  key vehicles to deliver this are the ENISA dedicated,  area-specific, expert groups that develop useful  insight, validate good practices and issue practical  recommendations. Whenever necessary ENISA liaised  with standards bodies to provide its technical opinion  on future standards in the areas below.  The main areas covered in this WPK are as follows.  EU cloud computing strategy and partnership ENISA organised the fourth edition of Secure Cloud  conference; a series of very successful events  that take place in Europe on Cloud Security with  stakeholders from all across the Globe. During this  conference, the ENISA Cloud Security and Resilience  Experts Group met and discussed the provisions  of the NIS directive for DSPs. Supporting the  requirements of this group, ENISA published a small  paper on ‘Exploring Cloud incidents’.  EU smart grids and ICS-SCADA strategy ENISA assisted the Commission, the Member States  and the private sector in the implementation of the  EU’s smart grid strategy and ICS-SCADA actions.  The agency, building on this existing knowledge  and expertise, provided sound technical advice,  recommendations and information on good practices  in the area of minimum security measures for smart  grids and ICS-SCADA, communication network  dependencies, attacks and incident-reporting  mechanisms for national critical industries. ENISA  engaged with all relevant stakeholders, provided  contributions to the Commission on policy initiatives  (e.g. EU CSS, DG Energy’s expert group 2 (EG2) and  Energy expert cybersecurity platform (EECSP), CEN/ Cenelec’s M490, EuroSCSIE and distributed energy  security knowledge (EE-Densek and Energy ISAC), and  made sure that these efforts properly aligned with  the EU’s overall smart grid policy.  Policy discussions on the certification of  components and systems ENISA cooperated with the Commission, Member  States and the private sector in order to foster EU  policy discussion regarding a European framework  for the certification of components and systems. The  agency supported the discussion on the evolution of  the existing initiatives. Through this, ENISA was able  to provide suggestions to key decision-makers on the  way MS and the EU should address this issue.  EU policy on NIS matters of the finance sector ENISA continues its efforts in the area of the finance  sector. The Agency assisted the European Banking  Authority and the European Central Bank in the  definition and implementation of the Payment  Services Directive 2. ENISA organised two workshops  with its Expert Group on Finance (EGFI) and discussed  technical and policy implementation issues.  ENISA achieved  this objective by  engaging with  public and private  stakeholders and  leveraging its  existing knowledge  and expertise in  the area of secure  infrastructure and  services.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3534  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.3.1.2 WPK 3.1.B: Policy development and standards  The new ENISA mandate gives the Agency a more  proactive role in the area of standardisation. The task  assigned to ENISA by the new regulation is to support  standardisation by facilitating the establishment and  take-up of European and international standards  for risk management and for the security of  electronic products, networks and services. A key  element towards the objective of improved security  standardisation is to facilitate close collaboration  between policymakers, standardisation organisations  and industry. ENISA facilitated the cooperation  of stakeholders by engaging policymakers,  standardisation organisations and industry, with the  aim of putting forward common strategies to enhance  NIS in EU standardisation policy.  Since 2012 ENISA has specifically participated in the  creation and further work of the ETSI CEN-Cenelec  Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG). In 2016  ENISA collaborated in the activities of the CSCG and  worked on developing synergies between the CSCG  and its WP.  In 2016 the Agency provided recommendations  for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy and  guidelines on the possible frameworks that can be  adopted in order to achieve a harmonised scheme  across MS.  1.3.1.3 WPK 3.1.C: Towards a digital single market  for NIS and related IT products and services  In 2016, ENISA ran a study to assess the current NIS  market in the EU from an economic and technical  point of view under the light of the DSM Strategy and  its future demands for protection. It focused on the  European market, even where NIS offerings are from  non-EU providers. The report provided an overview of  the current characteristics that make EU products and  services successful or non-successful in the market.  This report helped ENISA to advise the Commission  and Member States to better identify where efforts  should be placed in order to further support  European NIS and related ICT industries and services  in order to achieve and improve the adequate level of  diversity and trust in the EU.  The report proposed guidelines (lessons learned and  good practices) and recommendations to strengthen  the supply of NIS products and services from EU  suppliers, in the context of the DSM.  1.3.2 WPK 3.2. Supporting European  Union policy implementation  1.3.2.1 WPK 3.2.A: Assist EU MS and Commission in  the implementation of the NIS directive  This work package aimed to help EU MS, the  private sector and the Commission to implement  the NIS directive.  More specifically ENISA has assisted the Commission  and MS in the establishment of the Cooperation  Group envisaged in the NIS directive. The Agency, as  a member of this group, has provided ideas to the  Commission and MS about its governance structure,  its objectives and themes to focus on as well as its  working relationship to the CSIRT Network.  Digital service providers (DSPs) ENISA has assisted the Commission and MS in the  development of the implementing acts envisaged  in the NIS directive on incident reporting schemes  imposed on digital service providers (DSPs).  More specifically ENISA took stock of similar  provisions, processes, laws and regulations  (obligatory or voluntary) in MS and analysed them  in order to identify commonalities. Also the Agency  collected best practices from the private sector as  regards incident reporting and security measures.  Emphasis has been placed on the identification of the  parameters determining the impact of an incident  which will trigger the notification. In this respect, a  full-fledged technical proposal on how to address  the incident reporting requirements was developed  by ENISA. The work done in this area represents a  preliminary guideline on how incident notification  provisions for DSPs could be effectively implemented  across the EU. Based on valuable input from Member  States and companies directly impacted by the  directive, the guideline proposed arises from their  good practices in matters such as identifying types of  incidents, parameters and thresholds and results in  an outline technical proposal that can tentatively be  applied across EU.  At the same time, this guideline serves as a  technical input to the foregoing process of  adopting the implementing act that will further  specify details regarding the incident notification  provisions of the NISD.  Operators of essential services (OES) Moreover, the underlying work in the area of  operators of essential services (OES) has already  started from 2016.  In this respect ENISA started collecting well  established approaches different MS use to identify  their operators of essential services. The Agency  analysed the different approaches in use and tried  to identify commonalities that could constitute a  basis for a harmonised approach. This work was  not concluded in 2016 but will continue in 2017 and  2018. During this period ENISA will continue helping  MS to develop more knowledge and expertise on  this topic and will contribute in the discussions  towards an aligned EU approach, if possible.  This would allow operators of essential services  operating across several MS to be treated in a  seamless and consistent way.  In this effort ENISA has leveraged its existing  knowledge and expertise in stakeholder engagement  with the public and/or the private sector.  1.3.2.2 WPK 3.2.B: Assistance in the  implementation of NIS measures of EU data  protection regulation  ENISA has been a recognised contributor to policy  in privacy and trust and the Agency has contributed  extensively to the implementation of the personal  data protection regulatory framework in many of  its key technological aspects. As a core activity in  supporting the protection of personal information,  ENISA provided recommendations on technological  measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and  authenticity of personal data. In 2016, ENISA shifted  the focus on supporting personal data controllers  and processors on calculating the risk related to  personal data processing and selecting appropriate  technological and organisation security measures.  In addition, ENISA also conducted a study on  personal data clouds (‘PDCs’), identified the different  architectures and component of PDCs and discussed  their privacy and security challenges.  Furthermore, ENISA ensured continuity for the  activities where the Agency has achieved high  expertise in the area of privacy, as well as introducing  some emerging new topics, which have become  relevant for the privacy community. The Agency  carried on with its work on privacy enhancing  technologies (PETs), their evolution, newest ideas and  most up-to-date features of PETs, their building blocks  and a maturity assessment tool. Following previous  work in the field of privacy engineering, in 2016 ENISA  defined the ‘PETs control matrix’, an assessment  framework and tool for the systematic presentation  and evaluation of online and mobile privacy tools for  end users.  The defined framework relies on a set of  assessment criteria, which can be broken down into  specific parameters and assessment points, acting as  indicators of certain properties and features of the  tools.  In 2016, ENISA hosted the fourth edition of the  Annual Privacy Forum (APF). In light of the general  data protection regulation and the European digital  agenda, DG CNECT, EDPS, ENISA and, Goethe  University Frankfurt organised APF 2016 (http:// privacyforum.eu). APF 2016 was held on 7 and 8  September at Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main,  Germany. The event encouraged dialogue with  keynote speakers, panel discussions, and provided  room for exchange of ideas in between scientific  sessions. The objective of the Agency for 2016, as  in previous years, was to address the topics which  are of current interest for the privacy community,  in order to reach the maximum number of relevant  participants, representing different stakeholder  communities across Member States.  Regarding new activities, ENISA undertook a study to  support SME’s on how to adopt security measures  for the protection of personal data, following a risk- based approach. In particular, the objectives of the  study were to facilitate SMEs in understanding the  context of the personal data processing operation  and subsequently assess the associated security  risks. Based on that the study also proposes possible  organisational and technical security measures  for the protection of personal data, which are  appropriate to the risk presented and in accordance  to the provisions of GDPR.  Finally, during 2016 ENISA supported the European  Commission (DG CNECT) in the upcoming revision of  the Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy directive). ENISA  acted as technical advisor of the EC on the topics  below by producing respective working papers:  1.  Effectiveness and efficiency of security rules  in the electronic communications sector; this  includes an assessment of relevance and added  value of specific security rules in the electronic  communications sector; (Article 4), taking into  account the revised relevant provisions of GDPR;  2.  Assessment of the option to enlarge the scope of  security rules to encompass other critical actors in  the electronic communications value-chain, such as  component manufacturers, software providers, etc.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 3736  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.3.2.3 WPK 3.2.C: Assistance in the  implementation of mandatory incident-reporting  schemes  This work package focused on assisting regulatory  authorities in the implementation of EU regulations  related to mandatory incident reporting. It is based  on the successful work done in this area over the  years in the area of Article 13a.  The main tasks of this work package were to support  the following:  NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article  13a (security-breach notification).  NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article  19 of the new regulation on eIDAS.  ENISA has continued to collect and analyse  national reports on security incidents in  accordance with Article 13a of the framework  directive on electronic communications. The  Agency has analysed the national reports,  compared them with previous years, identified  new trends and developed good practices and  lessons learned. The Annual Incidents Report 2016,  including the analysis on the incidents reported,  was published around September 2016.  The CIRAS incident reporting platform was also  improved to fit to the new requirements of the  NRAs, in terms of new services and threats being  added, together with an overall improvement of  the reporting process and the user interface.  ENISA has cooperated with electronic  communications providers and MS competent  authorities (e.g. NRAs) to address security issues in  an integrated and holistic manner. In that respect  the Agency, in cooperation with the Commission,  have continued their efforts towards achieving  an EU level harmonised reporting scheme for the  e-communication providers.  ENISA together with the Article 13a WG provided  feedback to the EC on security aspects regarding the  new telecom code. The feedback was well received  as some of the observations are included in the new  regulation proposal.  Also, in the area of security measures for  e-communication providers, the Agency has  developed a line of work with the objective of  identifying concrete security measures deployed  in the telecom sector, that draws on experience  gathered in terms of security measures.  ENISA has continued its efforts to develop common  guidelines for a cost-effective mandatory security  breach notification scheme implementing Article  19 of the eIDAS regulation. The Agency, building  on the Forum of European Supervisory Authorities  for Electronic Signatures (FESA) and other related  public stakeholder groups, has brought together  most of the EU stakeholders to discuss the scope of  the scheme, the services affected, the impact of the  incidents reported (e.g. parameters and thresholds),  the reporting attributes, the reporting modalities, the  reporting tools and others.  In this respect, ENISA has developed a security  incident reporting framework for TSPs (trusted  service providers) covering Article 19 of the European  eIDAS regulation, with the objective of supporting  efficient and harmonised incident notification  schemes across the European Union. The Agency  has also developed a tool (CIRAS-T) which enables  supervisory bodies to submit their national reports  to ENISA and the Commission.  1.3.2.4 WPK 3.2.D: Support for policy  implementation in the area of electronic  identification and trust services  The main objective of this WPK was to continue  to support the large-scale adoption of secure  electronic identification means and trust services  across Europe. Trust services are a key enabler for  increasing citizens’ confidence in online services,  and given their nature, they require a high level of  security to ensure their integrity and reliability. ENISA  has contributed extensively to the area of securing  trust services in the past by providing best practices  for providers, recommendations on audit schemes,  standardisation guidance, security-breach reporting  recommendations, etc.  From the policy perspective, a milestone in this area  was achieved with the adoption of Regulation (EU)  No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market. ENISA aims to support the  implementation of the regulation by further focusing  on the security aspects related to trust services  providers.  In order to identify key aspects and gaps in this  area, in 2015 ENISA launched, in collaboration with  the EC, a forum that brings together communities,  namely: trust service providers from the EU trusted  lists, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory  authorities. The forum has proven to be a useful tool  for identifying gaps and areas where further work is  needed, and its activities continued in 2016. The 2016  edition took place on 24 May in Brussels with a broad  participation of stakeholders.  ENISA continued working on the implementation  and update of the guidelines for security incidents  notification to supervisory bodies by trust service  providers (facilitating the application of the obligation  stemming from Article 19 of the regulation). For this  reason, ENISA has launched the Article 19 expert  group that brings together the representatives from  national competent authorities responsible for the  implementation of the eIDAS Article 19 security  measures and incident notification requirements.  ENISA continued supporting the EC in the assessment  of the candidate standards that might be listed  in implementing acts that may be adopted by the  EC. This activity aimed to develop a concise set  of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for  voluntary use of all stakeholders, including trust  service providers, supervisory bodies and conformity  assessment bodies. The objective was to provide  guidelines to meet requirements originating from  specific provisions of the eIDAS regulation.  The study on security recommendations for relying  parties of trust services, resulted in a series of five  documents which aim to assist parties wishing to use  qualified electronic signatures, seals, time stamps,  eDelivery or website authentication certificates  to understand the subject correctly as well as  the potential benefits, amongst others, by giving  examples of possible application. This series of  documents also targets giving those parties some  advice on how to correctly deploy and use the related  qualified trust services.

List of work packages and short description  WPK 4.1 — Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises In the context of this work package (WKP), ENISA  further enhanced its methodology, seminars, training  and technical capabilities on the organisation and  management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises. The  Agency continued enhancing its internal capabilities  for managing complex, distributed exercises, by  building on its previous efforts. ENISA explored new  opportunities that will enhance the overall realism of  cyber exercises.  In 2016, ENISA organised the fourth pan-European  cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016). This  exercise builds on the experience gained in previous  exercise and takes into account previously identified  recommendations and findings.  Furthermore, ENISA continued supporting Member  States towards the development of a sound and  implementable European cyber crisis cooperation  framework and procedures.  WPK 4.2 — NIS community building The key goal of this WPK is to build upon the good  experience ENISA has in supporting different  operational communities (CSIRT network, law  enforcement communities, European financial  institutes — information sharing and analysis  centre (FI-ISAC), A-ISAC, etc.) to enhance mutually  satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA developed and provided guidance based on  good practice in the area of operational community  efforts (operational cooperation, information  exchange, etc.). Where possible, synergies with other  ENISA collaboration- and community-supporting  efforts were extended and, where needed, developed.  The Agency continued its work and support of the  Transits training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning by doing’ approach.  ENISA continued to support the collaboration  between CSIRT and law enforcement communities,  based on the recent policy and technical  developments in this area in Member States.  1.4.1 WPK 4.1 Support for EU cooperation  initiatives through initiatives amongst  NIS-related communities in the context  of the EU CSS  In 2016 ENISA further enhanced capacity on the  organisation and management of large-scale cyber  crisis exercises, while also organised a number  complex, distributed exercises with enhanced realism.  Exercise Organisation In 2016, the Agency organised together with the MS  the fourth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe  2016 (CE2016). CE2016 was a large-scale distributed  technical and operational exercise started in April  2016, offering the opportunity to cybersecurity  professionals across Europe to analyse complex,  innovative and realistic cybersecurity incidents.  On 13 and 14 October, ICT and IT security industry  experts together with cybersecurity authorities, were  called upon to mitigate the apex of this 6-month  long cyber crisis, to ensure business continuity and,  ultimately, to safeguard the European ICT market.  The Cyber Europe motto is ‘stronger together’: Indeed  cooperation at all levels is key to the successful  mitigation of major, borderless cyber incidents.  CE2016 overall in the 6-month period engaged over  1 000 participants.  EuroSOPEx 2016 was another exercise organised by  the Agency during this year. EuroSOPEx is a distributed  table-top exercise for the national and governmental  CSIRTs that trains on multinational cooperation  procedures. The exercise was organised in four  sessions in June and engaged over 50 participants.  Finally, ENISA supported the exercise Multilayer  2016 (ML16) organised the European External Action  Service (EEAS). In particular, after a formal request  (c.f. Article 14 of the Agency’s regulation) from EEAS  developed the cybersecurity sub-scenarios of this  joint civil–military exercise and provided support  during the execution of the exercise, in relation with  the cybersecurity scenarios.  Enhanced capacity to support and organise  cyber exercises In 2016 ENISA further enhanced its methodology,  seminars, training and technical capabilities on  the organisation and management of cyber crisis  exercises. The Agency developed capabilities for  managing complex, distributed exercises with  enhanced realism.  In the context of this effort ENISA expanded and  improved its cyber exercise platform (CEP). CEP is  a set of interconnected infrastructures supporting  exercise management as well as the exercise play/ reality through a virtual universe. The former includes  capabilities such as exercise planning, scenario  management, injection, visualisation, control,  monitoring and evaluation. The latter includes virtual  universe of several simulated online web services,  such as social media, websites, video streaming  services and network infrastructures.  As a result of an agreement reached in 2016, ENISA  is also assisting the European Defence Agency  (EDA) in the organisation of cyber exercises for their  community.  Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises activities  overview In 2016 ENISA, in close cooperation with the EU  Member States and institutions, drafted a proposal  for a pan-European roadmap for cyber exercises. This  roadmap will guide the exercise developments in the  coming years.  ENISA continued supporting the EU Member  States towards the development of sound and  implementable European cyber crisis cooperation  framework and procedures. The Agency will continue  exploring requirements for developing infrastructures  for cooperation, e.g. secure communications channels  or directories. In this context, ENISA supported the  effort to review and revise the EU Cyber Standard  Operational Procedures (EU-CSOPs). These EU- CSOPs were put under test both in EuroSOPEx and  Cyber Europe 2016. Related to this set of activities,  in 2016 the European Commission announced in the  Communication COM(2016)/410 — ‘Strengthening  Europe’s Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a  Competitive and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry’  the development in 2017 of a ‘blueprint’ that will  ensure the synergies and coherence for the crisis  cooperation during significant cyber incidents.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 4544  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of Work Programme 2016  1.4.2 WPK 4.2. Support for EU  cooperation initiatives amongst NIS- related communities in the context of  the EU CSS  Objectives:  Support incident-response community building  and information exchange.  Contributing to the existing communities’ efforts in  the incident response field.  Enable continuous trust and collaboration building  for communities through regular events.  Information provided to key stakeholders on NIS  policy developments.  The key goal of this WPK was to build upon the  good experience ENISA has acquired in supporting  different operational communities (CSIRT, law  enforcement communities, European FI-ISAC, A-ISAC,  CSIRT network provided for by the NIS directive, etc.)  to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA developed and provided guidance based on  good practice in the area of operational community  efforts (operational cooperation, information exchange,  etc.). Where possible, synergies with other ENISA  collaboration- and community-supporting efforts will  be extended and, where needed, developed.  The Agency continued its work and support of the  TRANSITS training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach.  ENISA also continued to support the collaboration  between CSIRT and law enforcement communities,  based on the recent policy and technical  developments in this area in Member States.  This work included close collaboration with other  institutions, which are active in this field, namely  the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the collaboration  agreement between ENISA and EC3 were further  developed. For example, in the area of encouraging  a more practical and regular flow of information  between CSIRTs and law enforcement communities,  the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise,  elaboration of general situational reports,  reports resulting from strategic analyses and  best practice and strengthening capacity building  through training and awareness raising in order  to safeguard NIS at EU level. To support better  coordination and in order to avoid overlaps with  ENISA activities, the agency will stay engaged in the  EC3 programme board. The very well established,  commonly organised ENISA-EC3 workshop was  held in October that gathered 33 teams from 30  countries from the EU and EFTA countries.  Following its successful mechanism for building  the European national and governmental CSIRT  community trust and collaboration, ENISA organised  its traditional workshop to support the national and  governmental CSIRT community grow. (11th CSIRTs in  Europe workshop).  In its Article 8b, the NIS directive established the  CSIRTs network ‘in order to contribute to developing  confidence and trust between the Member States  and to promote swift and effective operational  cooperation’. It is ‘composed of representatives of the  Member States’ CSIRTs and CERT-EU’.  The CSIRTs Network provides a forum where Member  States’ National CSIRTs can cooperate, exchange  information and also build trust. Member States  CSIRTs are able to improve the handling of cross- border incidents, and even discuss how to respond in  a coordinated manner to specific incidents.  ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network  and actively support the cooperation among the  CSIRTs. In 2016 the Agency organised the informal  meeting of the CSIRTs Network adjacent to its 11th  CSIRTs in Europe workshop. ENISA also provided its  expertise and advice both to the Commission and  Member States, either in the form of guidance or in  answer to specific requests.

The Agency worked with the different Presidency teams  to elaborate the Terms of Reference and the Work Plan  for the CSIRTs Network.  D5: Review on new operational communities’  development (A-ISAC, etc.) (Q4, 2016).  ENISA published a new report ‘Cyber Security  Information Sharing in the Energy Sector’ that addresses  the development of CSIRTs, ISACs, as well as relevant  initiatives on information sharing on cyber security  incidents in the energy sector by focusing on the  subsectors identified in the NIS directive (European  Parliament and Council, 2016) — namely electricity, oil  and gas — complemented by the nuclear and alternative  fuels subsectors. The report is available at https://www. enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-in- the-energy-sector  1.4.4 Specific results. Mapping of deliverables into papers/publications/activities 1.5 HORIZONTAL ACTIVITIES AND KEY  RESULTS  1.5.1 Management Board, Executive  Board and Permanent Stakeholders  Group secretariat  During 2016, ENISA continued to support its formal  bodies, the Management Board (MB) and the  Permanent Stakeholder Group (PSG) as well as the  Executive Board (EB) in their functions by providing  secretariat functions.  For the MB, one ordinary meeting was organised  during October 2016, to adopt decisions on budgetary  and administrative matters as well as to discuss the  approach and timeline of the preparation of Draft  Programming Document 2018-2020. In June 2016  the MB held its extraordinary meeting to elect the  Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson. Mr Jean- Baptiste Demaison (France) has been appointed as  Chairperson of ENISA’s MB. Jean-Baptiste Demaison’s  mandate became effective starting of 18 October  2016. Mr Krzysztof Silicki (Poland) has been also  appointed as the Deputy Chairperson of ENISA’s MB  with immediate effect.  In March 2016, the MB adopted the amended  Work Programme 2016, which reflects the tasks  addressed to ENISA in the NIS directive; the amended  WP includes more activities addressed to the  implementation of adopted NIS directive. In 2016, the  MB decided to discontinue the MB Ad Hoc Group and  instead held three MB informal meetings.  In 2016 the existing electronic newsletter was  converted into a broader publication to reach other  stakeholders, however the MB Portal is maintained  for the exclusive benefit of the MB.  For the PSG, one formal meeting was organised in the  course of the year to keep ENISA close to the industry,  academia and all other society sectors that are  represented in the Group and gather advice to the  ENISA Executive Director on drawing up a proposal  for the Agency’s Work Programme.  Four of the EB formal meetings were organised  during 2016; once per quarter (Q).  1.5.2 National Liaison Officer Network  Since 2014, ENISA has initiated a number of activities  with the aim of strengthening cooperation within the  national liaison officers’ (NLO) network. In 2016, ENISA  built upon these efforts and improved its cooperation  with the NLO network, the first point of contact for  ENISA in the MS. The agency maintained and shared  with the NLO network information on all relevant  ENISA project activities. Information was sent to the  members of the NLO network at regular intervals  on ENISA project-related tenders, vacancy notices,  and events organised by ENISA or which the Agency  contributed to (for example co-organiser, etc.) and a  NLO meeting was organised to discuss improvements  of the collaboration.  1.5.3 European Union relations  As in previous years, the Agency carried out the EU  relations work with the statutory stakeholders: the  Commission, the EU Parliament, the Council (working  groups) and MS. Several meeting took place, at the  highest level these were managed by the ED so that  the level of participation is appropriate. A similar  approach was taken for speaking engagements.  1.5.4 Stakeholders communication and  dissemination activities  In 2016, ENISA continued to improve its focus on its  key activities and to provide regular information to  the press and media regarding these activities. In  order to achieve this, constant contact with the media  was maintained and trust relations established to  assure adequate information of the EU citizens about  ENISA’s work and activities.  The Agency continued to develop various tools and  channels such as info graphics, the ENISA website,  social media, social networking and videos with  continuous improvement of outreach. This resulted  in an increase in numbers of press releases, website  news item, wider media coverage, social media  followers and interactions and overall communication  with different stakeholders.  1.5.5 Quality management system  During 2016, the Agency started to put in place a  quality management system. A quality management  manual as well as standard operation procedures  (SOPs) and work instructions (WINs) were drafted  bases on ISO 9001 standards (the Agency does not  have as objective to be certified). All these documents  are in the phase of revision by the management and  will be implemented in 2017.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 4948  PART I.

The primary goal of the QC is to im  prove performance across the agency while reducing  operational costs and enhancing stakeholders  satisfaction. The methodology is based on the plan- do-check-act (PDCA) cycle.  1.5.6 Article 14 requests  Article 14 of ENISA regulation provides a mechanism  that allows the MS or EU institutions to make direct  requests to ENISA for carrying out particular activities.  This mechanism has become increasingly accepted  in the last few years and it has grown in significance.  In Work Programme 2016, under SO2, both WPKs  WPK2.1 Assist MS capacity building and WPK2.2  Support EU institutions include deliverables dedicated  to assistance/on-request support for EU MS and  institutions. The table on the left provides a summary  of Article 14 requests and their status at the end of  2016. It should be noted that some of these requests  foresee activities during 2017.  1.5.7 Data Protection Officer  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO)  during 2016 included information and advice for  the Agency on its obligations pursuant to Regulation  45/2001/EC. Activities included the requirements for  data security, information of data subjects and their  requests in exercising their rights under Regulation  45/2001/EC, as well as the requirements for prior  check or prior consultation with EDPS.  1.6 KEY RESULTS FOR MANAGEMENT AND  ADMINISTRATION ACTIVITIES  The ED is responsible for the overall management of  the Agency. During 2016, the ED decided to set up  an Executive Director’s Office (EDO) to support his  activities. The tasks covered by EDO include policy  advice, legal advice, Management Board Secretariat  and coordination of the Work Programme. In 2016,  EDO continued to support the Management Board  (MB) and the Executive Board in their functions by  providing secretariat assistance.  In order to gain in efficiency and effectiveness,  the Administration and support department (ASD)  became the Stakeholder Relations and Administrative  Support Department (SRAD) during 2016.  The SRAD is responsible for ensuring that the  management of the Agency is in line with the  regulatory framework established by the competent  EU institutions, the MB and the ED. The regulatory  framework is composed of the financial regulation  and the staff regulations and their respective  implementing rules, as well as administrative  procedures, the internal control framework and  other control mechanisms put in place to ensure  compliance with the rules.  The SRAD monitors the Agency control and risk  framework. Constant upgrading of the internal  systems and revision of the operating standards set  the ground for continuous optimisation of the internal  processes and procedures. Benchmarking with other  organisations, as well as the recommendations of the  European Court of Auditors (CoA) and the Internal  Audit Service (IAS) are used as internal performance  indicators and relevant possibilities of improvement  are considered. Furthermore, the SRAD department  is the main contact point as regards administrative  matters, with external stakeholders, including Hellenic  authorities, etc.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5150  PART I.

However, to avoid duplication,  information regarding Management Board is already  located in section 2.5.1 Management Board,  Executive Board and Permanent Stakeholders  Group secretariat. Furthermore, details regarding  major developments are described in section  1.2 Highlights of the year and in particular, in  section 1.2.3 Information for the stakeholders, as  well as in section 2.6 Key results for management  and administration activities.  2.1 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  2.1.1 Budget execution of EU subsidy  (C1 funds)  The excellent budget execution can be translated into  the following figures, the expenditure appropriations  of ENISA Budget 2016 of EUR 10 984 847, were  committed at a rate of 98.55 % on 31 December 2016.  The remaining amount is a not automatic carry over  committed in 2017 for refurbishment project.  ENISA did not cancel any appropriations of the  year (C1) appropriations by the end of the year  (cancellation rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven capacity of the Agency to efficiently use  the entrusted funds, in order to implement its  annual Work Programme as well as manage its  administrative expenditure and investments.  The respective payment rate on expenditure  appropriations was 90.00 % in 2016. This payment  rate is high and demonstrates that the capacity of  the Agency to finalise its annual activities as well as  execute the relevant payments within the year of  reference was maintained. The procurement planning  which was moved forward to the end of the preceding  year (2015) and enabled the launch of projects related  to the Work Programme in early 2016, contributed  significantly to the improvement of the payment rate  of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.2 Amending budgets/budgetary  transfers  The following table summarises the effect of the  Budget transfers No 1 to 8, approved by the Executive  Director (ED) of ENISA, and the Amending Budget (AB)  1/2016, approved by the Management Board, on the  initial Budget 2016:  PART II MANAGEMENT II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 53  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5554 ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 55  PART II.

During 2016, 11 staff left the Agency, nine vacancy  notices were published and 11 staff were recruited/  took up new duties within the Agency. ENISA still  experiences significant challenges in attracting  and retaining suitably qualified staff to support the  activities of the Agency. This is a challenge due to  several factors, mainly the types of post that are  being offered (CA posts) that are not financially  competitive for the IT NIS job market, and moreover  the low salary coefficient which contributes even  more to a non-competitive package offer, especially  for CA positions.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members  in Athens, where no European Schools are based,  several service level agreements have been  concluded with each of the private schools being used  by the children of the staff. Several children of staff  members in ENISA Heraklion attended the European  School in Heraklion in 2016, which offers education at  the following levels: nursery, primary and secondary  education. ENISA has a service level agreement with  DG Human Resources and Security for the provision  of these services.  In 2016, ENISA adopted by analogy four implementing  rules, namely:  C (2015) 5320 on Unpaid Leave and  Leave on personal ground, C (2015) 1509 on the  Use and Employment of TA’s 2(f), C (2015) 9650 on  Reclassification of Temporary Agents and C (2015)  9561 on Reclassification of Contract Agents.  Additionally, in accordance with Article 110 of  the SR, the Agency received the agreement of  its Management Board to derogate from four  implementing rules as sent by the European  Commission: C (2016) 3828 on the implementation  of the Learning and Development Strategy, C (2016)  3288 on Middle Management, C (2016) 3214 on  the function of Advisor and C (2015) 9151 on the  implementation of telework. The Agency is waiting for  the Agencies’ Models to be adopted in order to adopt  them or to decide to draft its own rules (ex novo  decision).  The organisational chart, establishment plan and  statistics for ENISA staff is attached in Annex A.1.  2.2.2 Results of screening  Following European Commission methodology, the  Agency performed the ‘job screening’ benchmarking  exercise for 2016. The result of the exercise, which is  a snapshot of the staffing situation at end December  2016, appears in Annex A.4. It is relevant to mention  that the ‘Overhead’, support functions, is only 20.24  % of the total statutory staff count, which is below  the maximum value accepted for the Agencies that  is estimated at 25 %. This is only possible due to very  efficient resources management.  2.1.3 Carry forward of commitment  appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations), which were not  consumed by payments at the end of 2016, were  carried forward (automatic carry forward) to 2017  (C8 appropriations).  The appropriations corresponding to the EU subsidy  (C1 appropriations), which were not committed by the  The funds carried forward to 2017 (C8 appropriations) are detailed below:  Title  Total C1 ap- propriations  carried forward  to 2017  Carried Over (C1  2016 to C3 2017)  EU subsidy  Carried Forward  (R0 2016 to R0  2017) Subsidy  from Hellenic  Authorities  Title 1 — Staff 380 610.17 0.00 0.00 380 610.17  Title 2 — Administration 300 018.38 159 000.00 51 364.89 510 383.27  Title 3 — Operations 287 569.77 0.00 0.00 287 569.77  Total 968 198.32 159 000.00 51 364.89 1 178 563.21  end of 2016, were carried over (non-automatic carry  over to C3 appropriations in 2017).

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5756 ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 57  PART II. Management  2.3 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2.3.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multiannual  character of programmes as well as the nature of the  payments concerned.  In line with Internal Control Standard 8 (ICS 8  Processes and Procedures), the Agency has done the  ex post control report for the financial year 2015.  The recommendations issued on the report were  addressed during the year.  The ex post controls of the financial year 2015 were  quite extensive. A total of 267 financial transactions  were sampled and controlled, representing 13.17  % of all financial transactions of the Agency and  representing 76.43 % of the 2015 Agency’s budget.  As a result, one recommendation was issued which  regards a delay of payments which did not generate  any interest to be paid.  Moreover, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is  in charge of the annual audit of the Agency, which  is concluded by the publication of an annual report  according to the provisions of Article 287(1) of TFEU.  For several consecutive years, the ECA reports have  confirmed the improvement in the Agency’s overall  internal controls environment and performance.  2.4 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  ENTRUSTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND  ENTITIES  The Agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  2.5 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT RESULTS  AND FOLLOW UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS  2.5.1 Internal Audit Services (IAS)  The Agency has no open recommendations with the  Internal Audit Service in 2016. In September, the IAS  performed the Agency Risk assessment. The report  shows the next three topics for auditing: Stakeholders  involvement in the deliverables, Human Resources  and IT. The Agency shall take immediate actions  regarding the construction of a quality management  system as well as in implementation of its risk  management policy.  2.5.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  The annual report of ECA on the accounts of ENISA  for 2015 does not contain recommendations.  2.5.3 Follow up of audits plans, audits  and recommendations  The Agency will focus on the quality management  system as well as on the implementation of the risk  management policy.  2.6 FOLLOW UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 28  April 2016, the Executive Director of the Agency was  granted a discharge in respect of the implementation  of the Agency’s budget for the financial year 2014.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 28  April 2016, the closure of the accounts of the Agency  for the financial year 2014 was approved.  2.6.1 Follow up of the 2013 discharge  The Agency did not have any comment made  by the Court.  2.6.2 2014 discharge  2.6.2.1 Budget and financial management  The Discharge authority noted that budget  monitoring efforts during the financial year 2014  resulted in a high budget implementation rate of  100 % and that the payment appropriations execution  rate was 85.61 %.  2.6.2.2 Commitments and carryovers  The Discharge authority noted that, according to  the Court’s report, the total amount of committed  appropriations carried over to 2015 amounted  to EUR 1 332 421 (15 % of total appropriations).  It took note of the fact that the carry-overs were  EUR 612 981 (49 %) for Title II (administrative  expenditure), representing a decrease of 10 %  compared to 2013 and acknowledged the fact  that those carry-overs related to investments in IT  infrastructure ordered as planned near the year- end for the Agency’s two offices.  The Discharge authority observed that an amount of  EUR 717 927 was carried forward from the financial  year 2013; notes that EUR 49 460 (6.89 %) of the 2013  carry-forwards were cancelled.  2.6.2.3 Transfers  The Discharge authority noted with satisfaction that,  according to the Agency’s Annual Report, as well as  the Court’s audit findings, the level and nature of  transfers in 2014 remained within the limits of the  financial rules.  2.6.2.4 Recruitment procedures  The Discharge authority noted that from the Agency’s  Annual Activity Report that, at the end of 2014, 62  statutory staff were employed; notes, furthermore,  that during 2014, three staff left the Agency,  10 vacancy notices were published and seven staff  were recruited.  The Discharge authority observed that the Agency  experiences challenges in attracting and holding  suitably qualified staff to support its activities, mainly  due to the location of its office in Crete, where  international education is a challenging factor. It  acknowledged the fact that the Agency concluded  a service level agreement with each of the private  schools being used by the children of the staff in  the Athens office, as no European schools are based  there. The Discharge authority furthermore noted  that a new mandate and service agreement was  concluded between the Commission and the Agency  which provides the detail of the funding for European  schools used by the children of Agency staff.  The Discharge authority noted according to  the Agency’s Annual Activity Report, the Agency  conducted a job-screening exercise using the  common methodology adopted for the Agencies  for the first time in 2014. The Discharge authority  furthermore noted that, according to that exercise,  68 % of the Agency’s staff were in the operational  functions category, 22 % were in the administrative  support and coordination category and 10 % were  employed in relation to neutral functions.  2.6.2.5 Internal Audit  The Discharge authority took note of the fact  that at the beginning of 2014, the Agency had 25  open recommendations from previous reports of  the Commission’s Internal Audit Service (‘IAS’). It  acknowledged the fact that 24 recommendations  were closed during 2014 as confirmed by the IAS in  its ‘on-the-spot’ visit to the Agency in November 2014.  The Discharge authority noted that one remaining  open recommendation was closed in 2015, after the  tool for e-workflows had been implemented.  In order to achieve the  best control possible,  the Agency has focused  intensively on the  verification of results  before transactions  are initiated (‘ex ante  verification’).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 5958 ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 59  PART II. Management  2.6.2.6 Other comments  The Discharge authority acknowledged the fact that  the Agency adopted internal policies in order to  improve cost-effectiveness and the environmental  friendliness of its facilities. It noted that an important  step towards satisfying both requirements was the  adoption of a ‘paperless’ platform serving as workflow  and storage of internal documents. It also noted  with satisfaction that the Agency has practically  eliminated all paper-based workflows, including  financial transactions and human resources files and  documents, and has replaced them with electronic  documents and workflows in an effort to achieve  a paperless office environment. The Discharge  authority acknowledged the fact that this tool was  successfully introduced in January 2015.  The Discharge authority stated that the annual  reports of the Agency could play an important  role in compliance regarding transparency,  accountability and integrity and called on the  Agency to include a standard chapter on those  components in its annual report.  The Discharge authority acknowledged the fact that,  as a follow up from the 2013 discharge of the Agency,  according to the lease agreement between the Greek  authorities, the Agency and the landlord, rent for the  offices in Athens is paid by the Greek authorities.  The authority is concerned about the constant  late payment of rent, which continued in 2014 and  2015 and which presents significant reputational,  financial and business-continuity risks for the Agency.  Furthermore, it noted with concern that in 2015, the  payment of the instalment for the first 6 months of  the year was made on 27 August 2015 and only after  the Agency received a warning that litigation would  be launched by the landlord of the Athens office.  The Discharge authority urges the Commission, the  Agency and the Greek authorities to find a solution  for this issue in order to reduce significantly the risks  to which the Agency is exposed.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6160  3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT  The Agency was using the risk assessment done by  the Internal Audit Service in 2012. In September 2016,  the Internal Audit Service produced the new risk  assessment of the Agency.  Regarding the specific whistleblowing policy, the  latter was submitted to the European Data Protection  Supervisor for comments.  3.2 COMPLIANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF  INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control  standards, based on international good practice,  that aim to ensure the achievement of policy and  operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational  structure and the internal control systems suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives,  in accordance with the standards and having due  regard to the risks associated with the environment  in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency  adopted a set of 16 internal control standards laying  down the minimum requirements with which its  internal control systems need to comply. Previously  developed internal procedures were grouped  together, prioritised and implemented in the daily  workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on  the recommendations raised by the auditing bodies  (ECA and IAS). During 2015, the Agency achieved  compliance with the internal control standards  listed below.  3.2.1 Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in  the ENISA regulation. Mission statements for  departments and units were established based on the  evolution of the organisation in 2016. The roles and  tasks of each department and unit are clearly defined.  3.2.2 Ethical and organisational values  (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place — including  updates and yearly reminders — to ensure that all  staff are aware of relevant ethical and organisational  values (e.g. ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of  interest, fraud prevention, reporting of irregularities).  PART III ASSESSMENT OF THE  EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMSIII  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 61  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6362  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Specific training is organised by the Agency for its  staff every year in order to reinforce professional  behaviour, compliance with the expected behaviour,  ethics and integrity, and in order to prevent  workplace harassment.  3.2.3 Staff allocation and mobility (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary, management aligns  organisational structures and staff allocations with  priorities and workload.  3.2.4 Staff evaluation and development  (ICS 4)  In the context of the Career Development Report  (CDR) process, discussions are held individually with  all staff to establish their annual objectives. Staff  performance is evaluated according to standards set  by the Agency. An annual training plan is developed at  Agency level based on needs deriving from the policy  of the Agency. As part of the CDR process, every year  each staff member completes an individual training  plan. Management ensures that at a minimum  every staff member attends the compulsory training  courses defined in the annual training plan.  3.2.5 Objectives and performance  indicators (ICS 5)  The Work Programme (WP) for 2017, part of the  Programming document (PD) 2017-2019, of the  Agency was developed by the Agency services,  with continuous input and guidance from its two  governing bodies, the Management Board and the  Permanent Stakeholders Group. The PD clearly sets  out how the planned activities at each management  level contribute to the achievement of objectives,  taking into account the resources allocated and the  risks identified. The PD objectives are established on  SMART (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant,  Time-bound) criteria and updated or changed during  the year in order to address significant changes in  priorities and activities.  The role of the Executive Board is to assist preparing  decisions to be adopted by the Management Board  on administrative and budgetary matters only.  The Agency has based the measurement of its  performance on key performance indicators (KPIs)  that are applied to all areas of activity. KPIs are  more qualitative for the Agency’s operational goals,  whereas they are more quantitative for the Agency’s  administrative goals. The effectiveness of key controls  is assessed using relevant KPIs, including self- assessments that have been carried out in the form  of progress reports and follow-up actions that seek to  re-align divergences from the Work Programme.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed again to optimise the  budget execution for five consecutive years. The  commitment rate of budget appropriations available  for the year 2016 (C1) reached 99 %.  3.2.6 Risk management process (ICS 6)  The Agency did not have any open recommendation  for 2016. The IAS performed a risk assessment of  the Agency in September 2016. The report shows  the three next topics for auditing: Stakeholders  involvement in the deliverables, Human Resources  and IT. The Agency shall take immediate actions  regarding the construction of a Quality Management  System as well as in implementation of its Risk  Management policy.  3.2.7 Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned  and communicated by means of the Executive  Director’s Decisions (EDD). It conforms to  regulatory requirements and is appropriate to the  level of importance of the decisions to be taken as  well as the risks involved. All delegated, authorising  officers have received and acknowledged the  Charter of the role and responsibility of the  Authorising Officer (by Delegation) as well as the  individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date. The Agency records  derogations granted to allow staff to remain in sensitive  functions beyond 5 years along with documentation of  the risk analysis and the controls for mitigation.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been  taken in order to avoid potential conflict of interest  situations. However, due to the small size of the  Agency, the mobility of staff in sensitive functions is  very limited and takes into account service needs and  available resources. Proper back-ups are designated  in order to ensure business continuity and adequate  segregation of duties.  3.2.8 Processes and procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen the  processes and procedures internal control standard.  The Agency created a policy on financial circuits.  The roles and responsibilities of financial actors are  described in this policy as well as existing workflows  (see comment on ‘Paperless’ application in ICS 11).  A Code of Professional Conduct for ex ante  financial verification was developed. The document  emphasises the role and responsibilities of the  Financial Verifying Agent.  The Agency proceeded in 2016 with the full 2015 ex  post control exercise, and, it will deliver the 2016 ex  post control report in the first semester of 2017.  Importantly in 2016, a quality management system  was introduced, strengthening the performance  management of the Agency.  3.2.9 Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The management team, which comprises  the Executive Director and the heads of departments  and units, meets monthly and sets priorities for the  actions to be taken in order to achieve the short-  and medium-term objectives of the Agency. A list  of action items is compiled. It contains all agreed  actions as allocated to specific departments or units.  The list is published on a dedicated intranet page  and regularly reviewed by the management team.  Besides the monthly management team meeting,  a heads of units meeting is organised every week.  Management supervision covers both legality and  regularity aspects (i.e. set-up and compliance with  applicable rules) and operational performance (i.e.  achievement of PD objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in  order to address accepted ECA and IAS audit  recommendations and monitors the implementation  of these action plans throughout the year.  3.2.10 Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational  activities and financial transactions — are in place to  ensure the continuity of all services during ‘business- as-usual’ interruptions (such as sick leave, staff  mobility, migration to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been  developed and implemented. An Agency-wide BCP,  designed to cover crisis response and recovery  arrangements with respect to major disruptions,  has been developed and fully implemented. The  BCP’s Agency identified the functions, services  and infrastructure that need to be restored within  certain time limits and the resources necessary for  this purpose. Electronic and hardcopy versions of  both BCPs are stored in secure and easily accessible  locations, which are known to relevant staff.  3.2.11 Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related  procedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory  security measures; (2) provisions on document  management; and (3) rules on the protection of  personal data. Information security policy specific  to data categorisation and labelling is in place. As  regards the exchange of information classified  at the level RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED, an  administrative arrangement between the Security  Directorate of the European Commission and the  Agency was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets out  the conditions according to which documents need  to be registered, filed and saved using the Agency’s  registration and filing systems. A special, intranet- based tool was developed to capture the information  needed to register and retrieve documents. In  addition, an incoming and outgoing mail procedure  was developed.  As regards the financial and administrative workflows,  ENISA adopted in January 2015 a SharePoint-based  application, ‘Paperless’, which routes documents  to staff involved in preparation, review and  approval of all kinds of work-related documents  and transactions. All financial and administrative  Management at all  levels supervises the  activities for which  they are responsible  and tracks the main  issues identified.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6564  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  workflows are well documented and all supporting  documents are uploaded and stored in ‘Paperless’  including changes and comments of workflow actors.  Approved workflows are permanently stored and an  appropriate audit trail is produced.  3.2.12 Information and communication  (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices  are in place for sharing information and monitoring  activities. These include regular Management  Team meetings during which issues relevant to  performance, audit results and financial information  are discussed, and actions are decided upon and  assigned. Regular financial reporting is available to  all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All engagements in new  projects are discussed during the implementation  of the Annual Work Programme and decisions are  documented and communicated.  An External Communication Strategy is in place.  ICT security policies are in place for main systems  and sub-systems, and described in procedures and  policies. Internal communication is also supported  through use of the intranet and through weekly staff  meetings within units. External communication and  dissemination procedures must be further developed  and communicated to staff accordingly.  The weekly staff meeting is used as platform of  communication between all departments. Every  week, staff members can share their work with the  rest of the Agency.  3.2.13 Accounting and financial  reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are  documented in the Internal Control Manual of  the Agency. The preparation, implementation,  monitoring and reporting on budget  implementation is centralised in the Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Section, within  the Stakeholders Relations and Administration  Department. The European Commission’s budget  and accounting management system, ABAC, is  the main tool used for financial management. It  is compliant with applicable financial regulatory  frameworks. The ABAC Assets module is used for  the management of ENISA’s inventory. Financial  management information produced by the Agency,  including financial information provided in the  Annual Activity Report, complies with applicable  financial and accounting rules.  3.2.14 Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to  measure the performance and assess the impact of  the Agency’s projects as provided for in its annual Work  Programmes. The General Report and the Annual  Activity Report are the tools used by the Agency to  report on performance and impact. The feedback of  relevant stakeholders is taken into account.  3.2.15 Assessment of internal control  systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the  compliance of annual activities and performance  with the internal control systems in place, as part of  preparation of the Annual Activity Report.  3.2.16 Internal audit capability (ICS 16)  The Head of the Stakeholders Relations and  Administration Department assumes the Internal  Control Coordination (ICC) function. He is responsible  for implementing internal control systems in the  Agency and liaising with the IAS of the European  Commission. As the Agency lacks human resources,  the role of Internal Audit Capability (IAC) cannot be  performed. Since 2005, the Agency has relied on the  IAS to carry out internal audits. The IAS plays a key  role in auditing bodies of the European Union.  Internal Control tasks performed in ENISA include 100  % of ex ante verifications, annual ex post controls,  hierarchical controls and outsourced engagements,  coordinated by the ICC. The role of ICC was reinforced  in order to comply with all the recommendations  issued by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the Agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness:  staff that have the required knowledge and skills;  systems and procedures designed and  implemented to manage the key risks effectively;  and  no instances of ineffective controls that have  exposed the Agency to substantial risk.  All finance and  accounting procedures  are documented in the  Internal Control Manual  of the Agency.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of the  continuous improvement of management procedures.  It includes taking into account any control weaknesses  reported and exceptions recorded.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6766  4.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The risk framework is used as a common means  of classifying and communicating risk across the  Agency. It provides a common understanding and  language regarding ‘risk’, as well as a structure for the  assessment, reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk  framework defines the categories, sub-categories and  business risks applicable at the organisational level,  for ENISA as a whole. It includes:  risk categories and sub-categories;  risks specific to each category (business risks);  risk definition.  Assessment by management: The Agency’s operations are channelled through  the following activity areas that belong to  administrative functions:  Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in  line with the SPD in terms of operational and  administrative activities;  Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be in-sourced  by the Agency. External agents are appointed  either through a procurement procedure or  through a call for expressions of interest for  funding related to the co-organisation of events.  Alternatively, in the case of working group  members, they may be chosen by means of a  selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its  administrative activities, the Agency has carried out  the activities presented in the table below:  4.2 EXCEPTIONS  In 2016, the Agency recorded 18 exceptions. Only  one is with high materiality (> 60 000). This case is  related to an a posteriori commitment. A human  error on a handover provided by a previous staff  member created a delay in concluding the budgetary  commitment.  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors.  The results are contained in the reports listed. These  reports result from a systematic analysis of the  evidence available. This approach provides sufficient  guarantees as to the completeness and reliability of  the information reported, and results in complete  coverage of the budget delegated to the Executive  Director of ENISA.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 67  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 6968  PART IV.

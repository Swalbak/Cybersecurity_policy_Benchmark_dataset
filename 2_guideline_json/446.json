Given that urgency,  the NIS Directive goes on to argue that “operators of essential services” need to identify “which services  have to be considered as essential for the maintenance of critical societal and economic activities”. This is  in fact referring to the operators in the so-called critical sectors, with those being: energy, transport,  banking, financial market infrastructures, health sector, drinking water supply and distribution, and digital  infrastructure.  The protection of these seven critical sectors should have the highest priority, because when they are under  threat, the functioning of society itself and the well-being of its citizens are at stake. As part of this effort, it  is extremely important to increase the competences of cyber security personnel. This requires the  availability of high quality trainings across the board, available to all critical sectors.  Within the critical sectors, there are significant differences regarding the maturity level of cyber security.  Therefore, some of the critical infrastructure operators will not be as ready as others, to counter the risks  resulting from new cyber security threats in a timely and adequate manner.  With the emphasis that the NIS Directive places on the importance of the seven critical sectors, this study  aims to identify the current situation in these sectors in regard to the available cyber security trainings, and  if there are any training needs specific to each of the sectors, beyond the generic needs for such trainings.  Over the past years, ENISA has developed a wide range of cyber security trainings, and also delivered the  training content to several national and governmental CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams)  as well as their constituents. The next important question that this study set out to answer is if and how the  ENISA training portfolio actually is useful for the seven critical sectors – and what could be done to improve  the suitability of that portfolio to the existing training needs.  The main general conclusions are:   the cyber security training field is extensive and diversified, but does not sufficiently address the  issue of raising the cyber security resilience of critical infrastructure: CIP-related trainings are still a  niche   there is a shortage of specialised trainings in the field of ICS/SCADA systems cyber security – which  is an essential element in countering operational threats (e.g. in the energy sector)   there are very few trainings specialising in the specific threats encountered in the different  (sub)sectors   cyber security awareness raising trainings are lagging behind   there is a shortage of trainings in regard to decision making as a result of data leakages or privacy  incidents  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  05   there is a pressing need for trainings related to GDPR2, since this will affect every sector, and could  have an operational impact on the organization.  As for the fit of ENISA’s current training offer to the needs of the seven critical sectors, the study has found  that:   ENISA should present the context of threats and risks related to each sector in the trainings. In  particular, dependencies and mutual influence of infrastructures operating in different sectors  should be explained, and their possible impact on cyber-security issues concerning e.g. global  payments or air traffic control   ENISA should provide trainings in more local languages   ENISA should determine whether cyber ranges and gamification based trainings will likely provide a  more effective approach than traditional trainings. On-demand training accessibility is gaining in  importance.   ENISA is advised to organise a pilot study in for instance the transport sector to further gauge the  results of this study and come to implementable proposals on how to improve the training situation  in that sector. This approach may be used for other sectors too.  2 General Data Protection Regulations  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  06  1. Introduction  1.1 General Context  Quoting from the European Union’s NIS Directive, “Network and information systems and services play a  vital role in society. Their reliability and security are essential to economic and societal activities, and in  particular to the functioning of the internal market. The magnitude, frequency and impact of security  incidents are increasing, and represent a major threat to the functioning of network and information  systems. Those systems may also become a target for deliberate harmful actions intended to damage or  interrupt the operation of the systems. Such incidents can impede the pursuit of economic activities,  generate substantial financial losses, undermine user confidence and cause major damage to the economy  of the Union. Network and information systems, and primarily the internet, play an essential role in  facilitating the cross- border movement of goods, services and people. Owing to that transnational nature,  substantial disruptions of those systems, whether intentional or unintentional and regardless of where they  occur, can affect individual Member States and the Union as a whole. The security of network and  information systems is therefore essential for the smooth functioning of the internal market.”  Given that urgency, the NIS Directive goes on to argue that “operators of essential services” need to be  identified, “which services have to be considered as essential for the maintenance of critical societal and  economic activities”. This is in fact referring to the operators in so-called critical sectors. These critical sectors  are identified in Annex II of the NIS Directive:  1. Energy. Subsectors: Electricity, Oil and Gas;  2. Transport. Subsectors: Air, Rail, Water and Road transport;  3. Banking;  4. Financial market infrastructures;  5. Health sector;  6. Drinking water supply and distribution;  7. Digital Infrastructure.  The protection of these critical sectors should have the highest priority, because when they are under threat,  the functioning of society itself and the health and well-being of its’ citizens are under threat. Many  organisational and technical initiatives have been, and will be launched all over the world, to increase the  state of security for these sectors, however all such attempts depend on the people carrying out the security  and protection work, and how well they are equipped to do their jobs with high quality. Thus, to increase  the competences of cyber security personnel is of paramount importance. This requires the availability of  high quality trainings available to all critical sectors.  There is a significant difference in the maturity level of cyber security among sectors. Therefore, it is  reasonable to assume that some of the critical infrastructure operators will be less prepared than others to  timely and adequately counter the risks resulting from new IT/OT3 threats. This has been illustrated by:  3 Information Technology/Operation Technology  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  07   WannaCry (impacted the health sector, but was also spread widely)   NotPetya (not sector specific)   Attacks on power plants in the energy sector   Ongoing attacks on the banking sector using phishing and Trojan Horses   The increasing number of leakages of sensitive data in the health sector.  With the emphasis that the NIS Directive rightfully places on the importance of the identified critical sectors,  it is therefore relevant to find out what the situation is in regard to available cyber security trainings, and if  there are any training needs specific to each of the sectors, beyond the generic need for such trainings.  ENISA has developed a wide range of cyber security trainings, with emphasis on cyber security incident  response teams (CSIRTs), offering training courses where the commercial market may fail to provide them.  The full set of training material and supporting tools are freely available for download on ENISA’s website.  Once the market comes up to speed with the training being offered, ENISA focuses on other ‘untapped’  trainings.  Moreover, ENISA uses a ‘train the trainer’ approach in order to be able to provide a more scalable  solution. This study asks to what extent is cyber security training available to various sectorial players and  to what extent ENISA’s training portfolio meeting to the critical sectors’ demand – and what could be done  to improve on the identified shortcomings of the present portfolio.  1.2 Objective and Scope  The primary objective of this project is to provide a mapping of ENISA’s training program and a strategy to  adapt it in the light of the recently adopted EU NIS Directive, catering for the needs of the identified critical  sectors.  The project provides a structured report based on relevant training/education initiatives, stakeholders’  input, ENISA reports, and other relevant material.  The primary target audience is ENISA and the NIS Directive sectors. The secondary target audience are  decision making bodies in Member States and EU organisations, responsible for the cyber security agenda  for the sectors impacted by the NIS Directive.  1.3 Methodology  In order to achieve the objectives, the following methodology was adopted:  1. Stock taking by means of desktop research of existing cyber security initiatives (public and private) in all  seven critical sectors, and see what specificity there is in relation to the sectors  2. Identify training needs for each of the seven critical sectors, by means of reaching out to relevant  stakeholders, starting from IT/OT threats that are relevant for these sectors  3. Finally, by means of desktop research:  a. Map ENISA’s portfolio of cyber security trainings to the identified sectoral needs  b. Identify gaps in ENISA’s portfolio compared with the critical sectors  c. Propose ways how ENISA’s portfolio can better help all seven critical sectors to increase their  cyber security training level.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  08  2. Overview of Cyber Security Training Initiatives  2.1 Information Sources  The approach to take stock of existing cyber security initiatives in the seven critical sectors identified in the  NIS Directive was as follows. The first step of the research process was the preparation of a list of public and  private institutions together with CSIRT teams that offer cyber security training. In this context, more than  50 institutions and 15 CSIRTs providing trainings were identified, and their training information was  harvested mostly by means of web research, and additionally by means of e-mail queries and an online  questionnaire.  To identify which cyber security trainings from the offer could more specifically address sectoral needs, web  research was used. However, when checking the websites of these organisations, two impressions emerged:   the number of trainings offered by renowned training institutions was often very high, without any  clear specificity as to target audience or scope being offered – so it is in many cases not straight  forward to determine to what extent the trainings are useful for specific sectors   in a number of cases, the information found on training organisations’ websites seemed to be either  not regularly updated or incomplete. In these cases, training vendors and CSIRTs were contacted via  e-mail, to obtain more accurate and up-to-date information.  Thus, queries were sent to vendors and CSIRTs asking them individually about their cyber security related  trainings, and to provide some specificity inasmuch as specific trainings meet the needs of the 7 critical  sectors. An online questionnaire was put at their disposal in order to facilitate the information acquisition  process. The training offer of those organizations who did not respond to the queries sent out, was harvested  based only on the information available on the web.  2.2 Results of Taking Stock of Trainings  This section presents a summary of the results from the stock taking of existing training initiatives. The  collection of cyber security training include two inputs: from questionnaires and from desktop research. It  should be noted that it is not exhaustive of all available trainings/institutions in the market. The obtained  trainings collection is presented in two tables (see Appendix B) that contain the detailed information about  trainings as in Table 1. training list is non-exhaustive. The structure of this table reflects the information that  was collected using a questionnaire.  Table 1: Contents of the Training Tables (from questionnaires/desktop research)  # ITEM DESCRIPTION  1 Organizer (Ownership) Name of the training organiser with information about its origin (public / private)  2 Training Title Name of a training  3 General Description Short description of a training, including information about its content and scope  4 Skills Level Level of required skills before signing up for a training (Beginner / Intermediate /  Advanced)  5 Training Method Information about trainings methods (more hands-on / more theoretical)  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  09  6 Target Audience A type of a participant for which a training is dedicated (Non-technical Employees /  OT Security Specialists / IT Security Specialists / Security Managers / Top  Management)  7 Cyber Range Simulator  Information whether a training is supported with a Cyber Range Platform  8 Topic Relevance Information on how much a training is relevant to a particular topic (e.g. IDS, Mobile  Security, Data Privacy, ICS/SCADA Security)  9 Sector Relevance Information on how much a training is relevant for a particular critical sector  10 Availability Information on how training is available (online / live - on vendor’s /or client’s side)  11 Accessibility Information on how training is accessible (on demand / on register)  12 Location  Place(s) where a training is organized  13 Duration Information on how long a training takes  14 Materials Additional materials (training manual / exercises book / presentation)  15 Certificate Name of the training certificate (if available)  16 Training Category (Taxonomy) Training category – see trainings taxonomy (Table 2)  From questionnaires, ENISA received 57 trainings records from 15 organisations, and from desktop research,  29 records from 16 organisations. The details for both cases can be found in Appendix B. The main findings  about all the collected trainings are listed in Subsection 2.3. However, for the purpose of analysis and  conclusions, it should be mentioned that information collected in the process of desktop research, is  considered to be not as accurate, up-to-date and complete, as the information provided directly by vendors.  Therefore, the following analysis and the resulting conclusions are based mainly on the set of trainings  collected through questionnaires.  For convenience, the collected trainings are sorted in training tables according to the taxonomy presented  in Table 2.  Table 2: Trainings Taxonomy  # TYPE OF TRAINING  CATEGORY  CATEGORY DESCRIPTION  1 Cyber Security  Foundations  Under this category basic cyber security trainings were concerned, such as threat landscape,  authentication issues, malware types, cryptography and network security.  2 Audit/Penetration  Testing/Ethical Hacking  Under this category trainings related with security audits, penetration testing and ethical  hacking were concerned.  3 Monitoring  Under this category trainings related with network monitoring, Intrusion Prevention &  Detection systems and Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) were concerned.  4 CSIRTs/Incident Response  Under this category trainings related with Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)  activity, incident handling and management were concerned.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  10  5 General Cyber Security  Under this category general cyber security trainings were concerned, which are not  particularly connected to the specific areas of cyber security.  6 ICS/SCADA Security Under this category trainings related to critical infrastructure protection are concerned, such  as security of SCADA, ICS, PLC and other cyber-physical devices.  2.2.1 Geographical Availability of Trainings  The present study was not set-up to derive a complete list of available trainings. That being said, the  following categories have been recognised in regard the geographical availability of trainings:  (i) Online, available worldwide;  (ii) On location on demand, potentially available worldwide and certainly inside the EU;  (iii) On vendor allocated locations – these can also vary if the vendor supports “training tours” (e.g.  TRANSITS, SANS). These are available in many locations in the EU – and outside, of course.  Categories (i) and (ii) are available to all of the EU member states. For category (iii) the coverage of this  research is the least complete, as a survey of all 28 Member States was not intended – also taking into  account the language factor. Here a sample set was taken – English, Dutch, German and Polish.  In Appendix B the geographical availability of trainings is part of the listing of all trainings.  2.3 Summary of Findings  When analysing the training collection, the main findings and conclusions are as follows:   Most of the available training initiatives are not dedicated to specific sectorial needs but apply to all  sectors. Only ICS/SCADA security trainings cover specific needs for three sectors (energy, transport,  drinking water supply and distribution) as they concern OT threats.   Some of the available trainings vendors’ offers, are exactly the same in sense that they are either  approved or organized in partnership with renowned training centres.   In some cases, the course material of one course may overlap with that of another, but then the  appropriate information appears in the course description (“Course Content Overlap Notice”).   A majority of 44 out of 57 trainings is provided by private vendors.   Only 19 out of 57 trainings are not available as online trainings.   Most of the trainings can be conducted live at clients’ premises.   Vendors are cautious with implementing tools for trainings; e.g. just 14 out of 57 trainings are conducted  with the support of cyber platforms.   The majority of the training courses span over 5 days.   A majority (40 out of 57) of the available trainings has a “hands-on” factor of at least 50%.

Critical Sectors Trainings Needs  3.1 Information Sources and Findings  The next step of our research aimed to identify specific trainings needs for critical sectors. A starting point  included sending a survey and conducting interviews with sectorial stakeholders (included in Appendix A).  Questions asked in a survey and during interviews concerned two aspects:   Type of the sector;   Type of training needs in that particular sector.  Stakeholders’ opinions that were obtained in regard to their sectors can be summarised as follows:   Sectors that need special trainings are especially those which use ICS/SCADA which also increasingly  include Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions: energy, transport, drinking water supply and  distribution.   Energy sector (electricity): the connectedness of the grids across Europe necessitates close  cooperation also on the incident response level. Relevant trainings are welcome.   Energy sector (oil & gas): traditional focus on physical security, and cooperation inside the sector.  More openness needed across the sectors. Relevant trainings are welcome.   Transport (air): new threats emerging with the Internet-of-Things. It is not evident that this is  covered adequately. The minimum requirement is for awareness trainings.   Banking & financial markets sector: there is a significant need for malware analysis trainings.   Banking sector: there is a need for security awareness initiatives for customers (both businesses  and the general public). It is recognised that this is not easy to put into trainings.   Health sector: there is a gap between the frontrunners – such as university hospitals are – who are  advanced in cyber security and have a high level of training on the one hand – and on the other  hand smaller hospitals or small practices in all countries, where the knowledge and experience in  this field is often very limited.  o As all are part of the same chain and are increasingly exchanging sensitive data, there is a  dire need to close this gap. Trainings of various kinds, starting with awareness, should be  part of this effort.   Digital infrastructure: especially from the CSIRT perspective, the most needed trainings are for  raising awareness and incident management.  Among more general conclusions resulted from interviews are the following:   It is very important to adjust a training to the maturity of the participants/organisations.   Local trainings in local languages are very important. They ensure better communication and problem  understanding.  3.2 Identification of Threats Related to Critical Sectors  After consulting the critical infrastructure protection practitioners, it was decided to conduct additional  research to further clarify the picture of the cyber security threat landscape of the critical infrastructures.  This step assumed that the identification of specific threats related to particular sectors, by doing desktop  research, to enable supplement the experts’ point of view and in result more fully determine the needs for  the cyber security trainings in these sectors.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  12  The initial observation from taking stock of existing training initiatives (Section 2.2) is that very few of the  available training programmes are dedicated to particular sectors. It was then confirmed when we started  gathering trainings information directly from the vendors. All of the contacted vendors claimed that the  trainings they have in their offers are – with a very few exceptions – relevant to all critical sectors identified  in the NIS Directive. The only major difference here concerns those sectors, which uses Operation  Technology systems, i.e. Energy, Transport and Water Supply sectors.  It was also found that differences in the context of cyber security among sectors actually lie in the various  threats vectors. Indeed, there are threats strongly linked to some sectors and less to others. To give an  example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a much bigger concern in the Digital Infrastructure  sector than in some of the other sectors, due to the fact that eveb short periods of downtime can have  significant business implications. However, the way the attack is executed is technically the same. On the  other hand, one must also consider interdependencies among sectors and their security implications. For  example, a DDoS attack in Digital Infrastructure may impact an e-Health application.  The above observations led to an approach in which for the purpose of threats identification related to  sectors, the group of sectors were divided into two following subgroups:   ICS(Industrial Control Systems)-based sectors: energy, transport, drinking water supply and distribution  sectors,   Non-ICS-based sectors: banking, financial market infrastructure, and digital infrastructure sectors.  While ENISA has developed in the past sectorial threat models, for the purpose of this study it was more  efficient to use a smaller scheme, that can be correlated to specific potential training topics. All the critical  sectors, ICS-based and non-ICS-based have related IT threats, but it could be assumed that OT threats are  relevant only to sectors from the ICS-based sectors; thus, to provide a more structured approach, separate  groups of specific OT/IT threats and shared IT threats are considered. The identified collection of IT and OT  threats related to sectors are included in Table 1. The identification of a complete and comprehensive list of  threats for each sector is outside the scope of this work. However, the categorisation below, even though it  is non-exhaustive, should provide enough information to facilitate the mapping of threats to specific  sectorial training needs.  Table 3: Threats (OT & IT) related to seven critical sectors identified in NIS Directive.

This methodology is based on the assumption  that threats identified in sectors can be associated with one or more training types4 (for training topics see  Table 4). Applying the following scoring methodology identified what types of trainings are less or more  needed in particular sectors. In general, this methodology assesses for each identified threat, and its’  relevance to a particular training. The following examples provide a better understanding of the entire  mapping process:   if privacy protection threat is identified within a particular sector it scores 1 point under General Data  Protection training and 1 point under Data Security training,   if malware exploits threat is identified within a particular sector it scores 1 point under Malware Analysis  training, 1 point under Forensic Analysis training, 1 point under Threat Intelligence training, 1 point  under Incident Response training and 1 point under Intrusion Prevention and Detection training,   if vulnerabilities of ICS components threat is identified within a particular sector (in this case it is  identified within all OT sectors: energy, transport and water supply) it scores 1 point under ICS/SCADA  Security training and 1 point under Vulnerability Assessment training.  After completing the above mapping process for each threat identified, the four-level scale to evaluate the  need of a particular type of training in every sector was proposed. The scale is as follows:   0 – not relevant – the training is very loosely related to the sectorial need,   1 – good to have – the training is the part of the good practice for cyber security management process  but not specifically related to the sector,   2 – should have – the training is the part of the good practice for cyber security management process  and an organization should not avoid it,   3 (3+) – must have – the exercise is crucial for organising a proper cyber security management process.  It includes specific material for the sector.  To conclude the whole above process, the more points the training received after mapping, the more  emphasis should be put in the implementation of such a training in a particular sector. In some cases, for  e.g. ICS/SCADA Security trainings in the energy sector, there are more points than 3 which suggests even  stronger urgency regarding implementation of such a training.  The results of the above mapping process are presented in Table 4.  4 In cases where a threat could not be associated with a certain training type, it would probably indicate the need to  add appropriate training.

This can be regarded as an argument to treat these sectors with extra attention in terms of  training.   The energy, transport, drinking water supply and distribution sectors have similar Operation  Technology risks. Such risks are related to cyber security threats to ICS systems and include: HMI  (Human-Machine Interfaces), IoT, electric devices and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition) systems. This means that trainings should be available focusing on these topics.   ICT systems increased interdependencies between all critical infrastructure sectors and in result  these sectors share similar IT threats. One example is the banking and financial infrastructure sectors  that share very similar threats concerning data protection and privacy.   New security challenges arise as systems are becoming more interconnected, integrating more and  more digital technologies and increasingly use data to deliver higher capacity and performance.  These systems were designed to maximize efficiency and functionality, not security.   The lack of awareness of the potential severity of malicious cyber security attacks in every sector is  the gravest concern. Awareness raising trainings are thus of great importance in all sectors. It is  important to notice that these kind of trainings are mainly dedicated for ordinary staff, and only  partially for cyber security specialists.   The Social Engineering threat concerns all sectors, but is particularly important in digital  infrastructure sector due to the wide spectrum of this type of attacks (e.g. DNS Cache Poisoning,  DNS Spoofing, cybersquatting, typosquatting).   ICS systems are not only at risk from current vulnerabilities which target standard business  networks, such as malware, denial-of-service and user error, but also from specific vulnerabilities  which target the unique characteristics inherent in these systems as e.g. the use of advanced  technology in transport sector, such as 4G/LTE networks mixed with legacy systems.   New factors influence the cyber threat landscape: shadow IT, mobile and flexible working, bring own  devices (e.g. infected USB drives), IoT (Internet of Things). IoT threats are becoming increasingly  important, especially in the context of the health sector and smart cities – the concept increasingly  applied in the transport sector.   The risks associated with ransomware cannot be underestimated. Unfortunately, recent cases  (“WannaCry”, “NotPetya”) have proven that this kind of malware is not always targeted to specific  sectors and can paralyse a significant part of the critical infrastructure.   Desktop research (identification of specific threats related to critical sectors) led to expanding of the  training catalogue with additional trainings such as: security of the chain supply, security of the  outsourcing, protection against APT, protection against DDoS attacks, protection against insider  threats. Insider threats especially are a complex area, and are only partially technical in nature –  psychology and how staff is treated and managed all come into play here: how to create a work  environment that minimises these risks.   Vulnerability assessment, risk and threat management are of significant importance for all critical  sectors.   Information on breaches in critical sectors is confidential and therefore often difficult to obtain. This  is a significant problem as sharing information about cyber security and incidents reporting is of  great importance when addressing cyber security. It is not trivial to address by means of trainings,  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  17  but one way could be to share success stories of information sharing5 and explain how it is possible  to share information without breaching confidentiality. This also includes training people in such  concepts as TLP – the Traffic Light Protocol – which was designed for purposes like this.   Trainings curricula should include for each sector context information and present direct  consequences of IT/OT security threats by e.g. presenting real examples of incidents. This will  improve understanding of cyber security threats in particular sectors.  5 Like in the financial sector in some countries, or the CSIRT community, and vendors who exchange security  information while competing in the commercial area.

Mapping ENISA CSIRT Trainings into Critical Sectors Needs  4.1 Mapping Methodology  The aim of this section is to provide an insight and evaluation of ENISA’s trainings availability in the context  of cyber security and critical sectors identified by the NIS Directive. The results should lead to a better  adaptation of the ENISA offer to sectorial training needs. To provide such an evaluation, the methodology  of mapping of ENISA’s trainings material6 to the training needs (identified in Section 3.3) of all sectors was  proposed. A similar scoring methodology as above was used, but here for each cyber security topic (see  Table 4), the ENISA trainings catalogue was searched, identifying any ENISA’s training that is related to this  topic. For example, the topic “Protection against APT” is covered by three trainings offered by ENISA and  such a training type scores 3 points under “ENISA’s trainings availability” column (see Table 5). The identified  ENISA trainings are listed in the same column.  Having identified numbers of relevant ENISA’s trainings for each cyber security topic and comparing them  with the numbers of previously identified cyber security trainings needs in sectors (for both see Table 5), it  is possible to make trainings gaps analysis and identification that are presented in details in the next sections.  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  19  ENISA’ TRAININGS AVAILABILITY ENERGY TRANSPORT  DRINKING WATER  SUPPLY AND  DISTRIBUTION  BANKING  AND  FINANCIAL  MARKET  INFRASTRUCTURES  HEALTH  DIGITAL  INFRASTRUCTURE  Communication (team  exercises)   Incident Handling  Management   Establishing External  Contact   Incident handling in live  role playing   Cooperation with Law  Enforcement Agencies -  Advising in Cyber Crime  Cases   Assessing and Testing  Communication Channels  with CERTs and all their  stakeholders   Cooperation in the Area  of Cybercrime  6 1 1 1 1 1 1  Awareness Raising Lack of dedicated trainings 0 3 3+ 2 3 2 3+  General Data  Protection  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 0 0 2 2 0  Vulnerability  Assessment   Vulnerability handling 1 2 2 1 1 0 0  Identity & Access  Management  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 1 1 0 0 0  Malware Analysis   Processing and storing  artifacts   Artifact analysis  fundamentals   Advanced artifact  handling  7 1 0 2 0 1 0  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  20   Introduction to advanced  artefact analysis   Dynamic analysis of  artefacts   Common framework for  artefact analysis  activities   Static analysis of  artefacts  Network Analysis   Network forensics   Forensic analysis:  Network Incident  Response   Digital forensics  3 2 2 2 0 2 0  Web App Security   Forensic analysis:  Webserver Analysis  1 3 2 1 3 2 1  Data Security Lack of dedicated trainings 0 3 2 2 3 3 1  Cloud Security   Incident handling in the  cloud  1 1 1 1 0 0 0  Wireless Security Lack of dedicated trainings 0 2 1 1 0 0 0  Forensics Analysis   Forensic analysis: Local  Incident Response   Forensic analysis:  Network Incident  Response   Forensic analysis:  Webserver Analysis   Digital forensics   Network forensics  5 1 0 0 0 1 0  Device & Endpoint  Security  Lack of dedicated training 0 2 3 2 3 1 1  ICS/SCADA Security  • Incident handling during  an attack on Critical  Information Infrastructure  1 3+ 3+ 3+ 0 0 0  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  21  Threat Intelligence Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 0 1 0 1 0  Intrusion Prevention &  Detection   Presenting, correlating  and filtering various feeds   Developing  Countermeasures   Using indicators to  enhance defence  capabilities   Proactive incident  detection  4 2 1 1 0 1 0  Incident Response  Management   Automation in incident  handling   Incident handling during  an attack on Critical  Information  Infrastructure   Large scale incident  handling   Incident handling  management   Incident handling and  cooperation during  phishing campaign  5 3 2 2 2 2 2  Security of the Chain  Supply  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 1 0 2 0 0  Security of the  Outsourcing  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 1 1 0 0 0  Protection against APT   Advanced Persistent  Threat incident handling   Social networks used as  an attack vector for  targeted attacks   Incident handling during  an attack on Critical  Information  Infrastructure  3 1 1 1 1 3 2  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  22  Table 5: Results of mapping cyber security trainings needs in critical sectors into ENISA’s trainings’ catalogue  Protection against  DDoS attacks  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 2 2 1 1 2 3  Protection against  Insider threats  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 2 1 1 1 2  Mobile Application  Security   Mobile threats incident  handling   Mobile threats incident  handling (Part II)  2 2 2 1 2 1 1  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  23  4.2 Gap Analysis and Evaluation Results  4.2.1 General Overview of ENISA’s Trainings Availability Concerning Critical Sectors Needs  In this section, the outcome and conclusions from trainings gaps analysis is presented, resulting from the  mapping methodology, as introduced in the previous section. Figure 1 shows the current ENISA’s availability  of cyber security related trainings.  Figure 1: ENISA’s trainings availability  The availability of ENISA’s cyber security related trainings in the context of critical sectors needs can be  summarized as follows.   ENISA offers a wide spectrum of trainings regarding Malware Analysis on different levels of advancement.   ENISA specialises in trainings relevant to Incident Response Management and the examples of trainings  listed in Table 3 are only examples. Thus, all critical sector needs in terms of Incident Response  Management should be met and there is no urgent need for ENISA to introduce more such trainings.   Although, it might seem like ENISA does not provide trainings strictly dedicated to Device & Endpoint  Security or Data Security, it should be noted that a part of this knowledge is provided across a number of  trainings.   When it comes to the Communication (Team Exercises) training, the two presented in the ENISA offer  (Incident Handling Management, Establishing External Contacts) include only some of the elements  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Communication (team exercises)  Awareness Raising  General Data Protection  Vulnerability Assessment  Identity & Access Management  Malware Analysis  Network Analysis  Web App Security  Data Security  Cloud Security  Wireless Security  Forensics Analysis  Device & Endpoint Security  ICS/SCADA Security  Threat Intelligence  Intrusion Prevention & Detection  Incident Response Management  Security of the Chain Supply  Security of the Outsourcing  Protection against APT  Protection against DDoS attacks  Protection against Insider threats  Mobile Application Security  ENISA's Trainings Availability  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  24  regarding communication exercises. There are no exercises specializing in communication between team  members.   The only training connected with Vulnerability Assessment is dedicated to the CSIRTs incident handlers  and managers.   The only training connected to the Cloud Security is dedicated to the CSIRTs incident handlers and  managers.   ENISA does not provide dedicated trainings concerning: Awareness Raising, General Data Protection,  Identity & Access Management, Wireless Security, Threat Intelligence, Security of the Outsourcing,  Security of the Chain Supply, Protection from the DDOS attacks, Protection from the Insider Threats. It  does not mean that elements of these topics are not included in the offer at all, but the emphasis is put  on other good practices, primarily: Artefact Analysis, Incident Handling and Forensics Analysis.   Apart from the above-mentioned trainings, the low number of ICS/SCADA Security trainings (only 1, and  basic) is a point of attention, especially when cyber security of critical sectors utilizing operation  technologies are concerned (Energy, Transport and Water Supply sectors).  The gaps analysis and evaluation presented above provide a general overview of ENISA’s trainings availability  concerning critical sectors’ needs. The proposed adaptation of ENISA’s training material to trainings needs  for a chosen sector (Transport Sector) will be analysed in detail in the following subsections.  4.2.2 Gap Analysis for the Transport Sector  The process of identification of critical sectors’ needs showed a high demand of various types of cyber  security trainings in these areas. Focusing on one of the sectors, the gap analysis between ENISA’s trainings  catalogue and this sector training needs is presented, suggesting the broadening of ENISA’s existing training  material to better suit the sector’s needs. The chosen sector is the Transport sector. The gap analysis is  presented in Figure 2 and analysed in details below.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  25  Figure 2: Trainings gaps analysis for transport sector  The results of the gap analysis for the transport sector can be summarized as follows.  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Communication (team exercises)  Awareness Raising  General Data Protection  Vulnerability Assessment  Identity & Access Management  Malware Analysis  Network Analysis  Web App Security  Data Security  Cloud Security  Wireless Security  Forensics Analysis  Device & Endpoint Security  ICS/SCADA Security  Threat Intelligence  Intrusion Prevention & Detection  Incident Response Management  Security of the Chain Supply  Security of the Outsourcing  Protection against APT  Protection against DDoS attacks  Protection against Insider threats  Mobile Application Security  Trainings Gaps Analysis for Transport Sector  Transport Sector Trainings Needs ENISA's Trainings Availability  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  26   The Transport sector has a significant or urgent need for ICS/SCADA Security and IoT related  trainings, whereas ENISA provides only one basic training dedicated to this topic. However, some  elements related to ISC/SCADA Security can be found across a number of ENISA’s training materials.   The Transport sector has an average need for Data Security trainings, whereas ENISA does not  provide trainings strictly dedicated to this area. However, since data security is concerned as a broad  and complex topic, the issues pertaining to it are available partially in most of the available trainings.   The Transport sector has an average need for Awareness Raising trainings, whereas ENISA does not  provide trainings dedicated to this area nor does it offer cyber security foundations trainings for  beginners (where Awareness Rising issue is crucial).   The Transport sector has an average need for Vulnerability Assessment trainings, whereas ENISA  provides only 1 training dedicated to this topic.   The Transport sector has an average need for Device & Endpoint Security trainings, whereas ENISA  does not provide trainings directly dedicated to this topic.   The Transport sector has an average need for Insider Threats trainings, whereas ENISA does not  provide trainings dedicated to this topic.  However, ENISA’s trainings catalogue fully meets the following transport sector trainings needs:   Communication (Team exercises),   Network Analysis,   Intrusion Prevention & Detection,   Mobile Application Security.  4.2.3 Covering Transport Sector Trainings Needs  Below, some findings concerning the transport sector are presented, obtained from the interview with the  expert of the Polish Governmental Aviation Agency:   There is a substantial need for cyber security trainings and exercises dedicated to aviation sector.  Trainings offered by the vendors on the market are not sufficient.   Awareness raising is often limited to the very basic aspect of cyber security. Also, it is presented in  the context of physical security (e.g. misuse of USB sticks).   On the other hand, aviation employees are trained with data protection issues (e.g: trade secrets).   The crucial trainings needs are connected with operations continuity and maintaining land-air  communication.   Aviation is very a specific sector also because processing of information is twofold: “business” IT  systems and operations.   The main cyber security challenge of aviation IT infrastructure is securing information flow between  the stakeholders. The operators are often mistakenly convinced that their networks are completely  segregated, whereas in reality public-networks are commonly used.   One of the greatest technological challenge is to provide real-time encryption between the air-land  communication.   There are several concepts of so called “Aviation CERT” in the industry, but so far there are only  commercial platforms available. Not all operators can afford using them.   Game-changer for the aviation sector might be the implementation of the NIS Directive.

Conclusions  The main conclusion from the conducted research is that the available cyber security training offer is large  and characterized by a great diversity; however, this offering does not address raising cyber security  resilience of critical infrastructure through trainings. The area of CIP-related trainings is still a niche field.  There are few organizations and CSIRTs (e.g. ICS-CERT) that provide specialized trainings, in particular in the  field of ICS/SCADA systems, but this is still a small fraction within the trainings that are currently available.  Despite the availability of various cyber security trainings, there is a lack of cyber security training dedicated  to the specific needs of critical sectors that take into account threat context and complexity of  interconnections of IT/OT systems.  The emerging need in all NIS Directive sectors is related to cyber security awareness raising. Also, aspects  such as e.g. decision making in cyber security management process should be covered – particularly  concerning decisions-making in cases of data security incidents, data leakage, etc. Moreover, cyber security  trainings should take into account various roles of employees in the cyber security management process and  the level of technical advancement of the staff to adequately adjust the trainings to different audience.  There is also a need of trainings related to GDPR, in the light of the upcoming EU regulations, as this will  affect every sector in such a way that any breach of personal data protection (e.g. customer data in transport  sector) may result in sanctions (both financial and organizational) and could have an impact on the  organization operations.  Below are some other practical findings that could assist in tailoring the existing ENISA’s training material in  the context of NIS Directive sectors needs resulting from the research are summarized.   ENISA should present the context of threats and risks related to each sector in the trainings. In particular,  dependencies and mutual influence of infrastructures operating in different sectors should be explained,  and their possible impact on cyber-security issues concerning e.g. global payments or air traffic control.   ENISA should provide trainings in the local languages.   ENISA should determine whether cyber ranges and gamification based trainings will likely provide a  more effective approach than traditional trainings. On-demand training accessibility is gaining in  importance.   On-demand training accessibility is gaining importance. Such an option is beneficial for the training  vendor and organizations, but on the other hand can be less beneficial for the individuals enrolling for  the training.

Given that urgency,  the NIS Directive goes on to argue that “operators of essential services” need to identify “which services  have to be considered as essential for the maintenance of critical societal and economic activities”. This is  in fact referring to the operators in the so-called critical sectors, with those being: energy, transport,  banking, financial market infrastructures, health sector, drinking water supply and distribution, and digital  infrastructure.  The protection of these seven critical sectors should have the highest priority, because when they are under  threat, the functioning of society itself and the well-being of its citizens are at stake. As part of this effort, it  is extremely important to increase the competences of cyber security personnel. This requires the  availability of high quality trainings across the board, available to all critical sectors.  Within the critical sectors, there are significant differences regarding the maturity level of cyber security.  Therefore, some of the critical infrastructure operators will not be as ready as others, to counter the risks  resulting from new cyber security threats in a timely and adequate manner.  With the emphasis that the NIS Directive places on the importance of the seven critical sectors, this study  aims to identify the current situation in these sectors in regard to the available cyber security trainings, and  if there are any training needs specific to each of the sectors, beyond the generic needs for such trainings.  Over the past years, ENISA has developed a wide range of cyber security trainings, and also delivered the  training content to several national and governmental CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams)  as well as their constituents. The next important question that this study set out to answer is if and how the  ENISA training portfolio actually is useful for the seven critical sectors – and what could be done to improve  the suitability of that portfolio to the existing training needs.  The main general conclusions are:   the cyber security training field is extensive and diversified, but does not sufficiently address the  issue of raising the cyber security resilience of critical infrastructure: CIP-related trainings are still a  niche   there is a shortage of specialised trainings in the field of ICS/SCADA systems cyber security – which  is an essential element in countering operational threats (e.g. in the energy sector)   there are very few trainings specialising in the specific threats encountered in the different  (sub)sectors   cyber security awareness raising trainings are lagging behind   there is a shortage of trainings in regard to decision making as a result of data leakages or privacy  incidents  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  05   there is a pressing need for trainings related to GDPR2, since this will affect every sector, and could  have an operational impact on the organization.  As for the fit of ENISA’s current training offer to the needs of the seven critical sectors, the study has found  that:   ENISA should present the context of threats and risks related to each sector in the trainings. In  particular, dependencies and mutual influence of infrastructures operating in different sectors  should be explained, and their possible impact on cyber-security issues concerning e.g. global  payments or air traffic control   ENISA should provide trainings in more local languages   ENISA should determine whether cyber ranges and gamification based trainings will likely provide a  more effective approach than traditional trainings. On-demand training accessibility is gaining in  importance.   ENISA is advised to organise a pilot study in for instance the transport sector to further gauge the  results of this study and come to implementable proposals on how to improve the training situation  in that sector. This approach may be used for other sectors too.  2 General Data Protection Regulations  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  06  1. Introduction  1.1 General Context  Quoting from the European Union’s NIS Directive, “Network and information systems and services play a  vital role in society. Their reliability and security are essential to economic and societal activities, and in  particular to the functioning of the internal market. The magnitude, frequency and impact of security  incidents are increasing, and represent a major threat to the functioning of network and information  systems. Those systems may also become a target for deliberate harmful actions intended to damage or  interrupt the operation of the systems. Such incidents can impede the pursuit of economic activities,  generate substantial financial losses, undermine user confidence and cause major damage to the economy  of the Union. Network and information systems, and primarily the internet, play an essential role in  facilitating the cross- border movement of goods, services and people. Owing to that transnational nature,  substantial disruptions of those systems, whether intentional or unintentional and regardless of where they  occur, can affect individual Member States and the Union as a whole. The security of network and  information systems is therefore essential for the smooth functioning of the internal market.”  Given that urgency, the NIS Directive goes on to argue that “operators of essential services” need to be  identified, “which services have to be considered as essential for the maintenance of critical societal and  economic activities”. This is in fact referring to the operators in so-called critical sectors. These critical sectors  are identified in Annex II of the NIS Directive:  1. Energy. Subsectors: Electricity, Oil and Gas;  2. Transport. Subsectors: Air, Rail, Water and Road transport;  3. Banking;  4. Financial market infrastructures;  5. Health sector;  6. Drinking water supply and distribution;  7. Digital Infrastructure.  The protection of these critical sectors should have the highest priority, because when they are under threat,  the functioning of society itself and the health and well-being of its’ citizens are under threat. Many  organisational and technical initiatives have been, and will be launched all over the world, to increase the  state of security for these sectors, however all such attempts depend on the people carrying out the security  and protection work, and how well they are equipped to do their jobs with high quality. Thus, to increase  the competences of cyber security personnel is of paramount importance. This requires the availability of  high quality trainings available to all critical sectors.  There is a significant difference in the maturity level of cyber security among sectors. Therefore, it is  reasonable to assume that some of the critical infrastructure operators will be less prepared than others to  timely and adequately counter the risks resulting from new IT/OT3 threats. This has been illustrated by:  3 Information Technology/Operation Technology  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  07   WannaCry (impacted the health sector, but was also spread widely)   NotPetya (not sector specific)   Attacks on power plants in the energy sector   Ongoing attacks on the banking sector using phishing and Trojan Horses   The increasing number of leakages of sensitive data in the health sector.  With the emphasis that the NIS Directive rightfully places on the importance of the identified critical sectors,  it is therefore relevant to find out what the situation is in regard to available cyber security trainings, and if  there are any training needs specific to each of the sectors, beyond the generic need for such trainings.  ENISA has developed a wide range of cyber security trainings, with emphasis on cyber security incident  response teams (CSIRTs), offering training courses where the commercial market may fail to provide them.  The full set of training material and supporting tools are freely available for download on ENISA’s website.  Once the market comes up to speed with the training being offered, ENISA focuses on other ‘untapped’  trainings.  Moreover, ENISA uses a ‘train the trainer’ approach in order to be able to provide a more scalable  solution. This study asks to what extent is cyber security training available to various sectorial players and  to what extent ENISA’s training portfolio meeting to the critical sectors’ demand – and what could be done  to improve on the identified shortcomings of the present portfolio.  1.2 Objective and Scope  The primary objective of this project is to provide a mapping of ENISA’s training program and a strategy to  adapt it in the light of the recently adopted EU NIS Directive, catering for the needs of the identified critical  sectors.  The project provides a structured report based on relevant training/education initiatives, stakeholders’  input, ENISA reports, and other relevant material.  The primary target audience is ENISA and the NIS Directive sectors. The secondary target audience are  decision making bodies in Member States and EU organisations, responsible for the cyber security agenda  for the sectors impacted by the NIS Directive.  1.3 Methodology  In order to achieve the objectives, the following methodology was adopted:  1. Stock taking by means of desktop research of existing cyber security initiatives (public and private) in all  seven critical sectors, and see what specificity there is in relation to the sectors  2. Identify training needs for each of the seven critical sectors, by means of reaching out to relevant  stakeholders, starting from IT/OT threats that are relevant for these sectors  3. Finally, by means of desktop research:  a. Map ENISA’s portfolio of cyber security trainings to the identified sectoral needs  b. Identify gaps in ENISA’s portfolio compared with the critical sectors  c. Propose ways how ENISA’s portfolio can better help all seven critical sectors to increase their  cyber security training level.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  08  2. Overview of Cyber Security Training Initiatives  2.1 Information Sources  The approach to take stock of existing cyber security initiatives in the seven critical sectors identified in the  NIS Directive was as follows. The first step of the research process was the preparation of a list of public and  private institutions together with CSIRT teams that offer cyber security training. In this context, more than  50 institutions and 15 CSIRTs providing trainings were identified, and their training information was  harvested mostly by means of web research, and additionally by means of e-mail queries and an online  questionnaire.  To identify which cyber security trainings from the offer could more specifically address sectoral needs, web  research was used. However, when checking the websites of these organisations, two impressions emerged:   the number of trainings offered by renowned training institutions was often very high, without any  clear specificity as to target audience or scope being offered – so it is in many cases not straight  forward to determine to what extent the trainings are useful for specific sectors   in a number of cases, the information found on training organisations’ websites seemed to be either  not regularly updated or incomplete. In these cases, training vendors and CSIRTs were contacted via  e-mail, to obtain more accurate and up-to-date information.  Thus, queries were sent to vendors and CSIRTs asking them individually about their cyber security related  trainings, and to provide some specificity inasmuch as specific trainings meet the needs of the 7 critical  sectors. An online questionnaire was put at their disposal in order to facilitate the information acquisition  process. The training offer of those organizations who did not respond to the queries sent out, was harvested  based only on the information available on the web.  2.2 Results of Taking Stock of Trainings  This section presents a summary of the results from the stock taking of existing training initiatives. The  collection of cyber security training include two inputs: from questionnaires and from desktop research. It  should be noted that it is not exhaustive of all available trainings/institutions in the market. The obtained  trainings collection is presented in two tables (see Appendix B) that contain the detailed information about  trainings as in Table 1. training list is non-exhaustive. The structure of this table reflects the information that  was collected using a questionnaire.  Table 1: Contents of the Training Tables (from questionnaires/desktop research)  # ITEM DESCRIPTION  1 Organizer (Ownership) Name of the training organiser with information about its origin (public / private)  2 Training Title Name of a training  3 General Description Short description of a training, including information about its content and scope  4 Skills Level Level of required skills before signing up for a training (Beginner / Intermediate /  Advanced)  5 Training Method Information about trainings methods (more hands-on / more theoretical)  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  09  6 Target Audience A type of a participant for which a training is dedicated (Non-technical Employees /  OT Security Specialists / IT Security Specialists / Security Managers / Top  Management)  7 Cyber Range Simulator  Information whether a training is supported with a Cyber Range Platform  8 Topic Relevance Information on how much a training is relevant to a particular topic (e.g. IDS, Mobile  Security, Data Privacy, ICS/SCADA Security)  9 Sector Relevance Information on how much a training is relevant for a particular critical sector  10 Availability Information on how training is available (online / live - on vendor’s /or client’s side)  11 Accessibility Information on how training is accessible (on demand / on register)  12 Location  Place(s) where a training is organized  13 Duration Information on how long a training takes  14 Materials Additional materials (training manual / exercises book / presentation)  15 Certificate Name of the training certificate (if available)  16 Training Category (Taxonomy) Training category – see trainings taxonomy (Table 2)  From questionnaires, ENISA received 57 trainings records from 15 organisations, and from desktop research,  29 records from 16 organisations. The details for both cases can be found in Appendix B. The main findings  about all the collected trainings are listed in Subsection 2.3. However, for the purpose of analysis and  conclusions, it should be mentioned that information collected in the process of desktop research, is  considered to be not as accurate, up-to-date and complete, as the information provided directly by vendors.  Therefore, the following analysis and the resulting conclusions are based mainly on the set of trainings  collected through questionnaires.  For convenience, the collected trainings are sorted in training tables according to the taxonomy presented  in Table 2.  Table 2: Trainings Taxonomy  # TYPE OF TRAINING  CATEGORY  CATEGORY DESCRIPTION  1 Cyber Security  Foundations  Under this category basic cyber security trainings were concerned, such as threat landscape,  authentication issues, malware types, cryptography and network security.  2 Audit/Penetration  Testing/Ethical Hacking  Under this category trainings related with security audits, penetration testing and ethical  hacking were concerned.  3 Monitoring  Under this category trainings related with network monitoring, Intrusion Prevention &  Detection systems and Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) were concerned.  4 CSIRTs/Incident Response  Under this category trainings related with Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)  activity, incident handling and management were concerned.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  10  5 General Cyber Security  Under this category general cyber security trainings were concerned, which are not  particularly connected to the specific areas of cyber security.  6 ICS/SCADA Security Under this category trainings related to critical infrastructure protection are concerned, such  as security of SCADA, ICS, PLC and other cyber-physical devices.  2.2.1 Geographical Availability of Trainings  The present study was not set-up to derive a complete list of available trainings. That being said, the  following categories have been recognised in regard the geographical availability of trainings:  (i) Online, available worldwide;  (ii) On location on demand, potentially available worldwide and certainly inside the EU;  (iii) On vendor allocated locations – these can also vary if the vendor supports “training tours” (e.g.  TRANSITS, SANS). These are available in many locations in the EU – and outside, of course.  Categories (i) and (ii) are available to all of the EU member states. For category (iii) the coverage of this  research is the least complete, as a survey of all 28 Member States was not intended – also taking into  account the language factor. Here a sample set was taken – English, Dutch, German and Polish.  In Appendix B the geographical availability of trainings is part of the listing of all trainings.  2.3 Summary of Findings  When analysing the training collection, the main findings and conclusions are as follows:   Most of the available training initiatives are not dedicated to specific sectorial needs but apply to all  sectors. Only ICS/SCADA security trainings cover specific needs for three sectors (energy, transport,  drinking water supply and distribution) as they concern OT threats.   Some of the available trainings vendors’ offers, are exactly the same in sense that they are either  approved or organized in partnership with renowned training centres.   In some cases, the course material of one course may overlap with that of another, but then the  appropriate information appears in the course description (“Course Content Overlap Notice”).   A majority of 44 out of 57 trainings is provided by private vendors.   Only 19 out of 57 trainings are not available as online trainings.   Most of the trainings can be conducted live at clients’ premises.   Vendors are cautious with implementing tools for trainings; e.g. just 14 out of 57 trainings are conducted  with the support of cyber platforms.   The majority of the training courses span over 5 days.   A majority (40 out of 57) of the available trainings has a “hands-on” factor of at least 50%.

Critical Sectors Trainings Needs  3.1 Information Sources and Findings  The next step of our research aimed to identify specific trainings needs for critical sectors. A starting point  included sending a survey and conducting interviews with sectorial stakeholders (included in Appendix A).  Questions asked in a survey and during interviews concerned two aspects:   Type of the sector;   Type of training needs in that particular sector.  Stakeholders’ opinions that were obtained in regard to their sectors can be summarised as follows:   Sectors that need special trainings are especially those which use ICS/SCADA which also increasingly  include Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions: energy, transport, drinking water supply and  distribution.   Energy sector (electricity): the connectedness of the grids across Europe necessitates close  cooperation also on the incident response level. Relevant trainings are welcome.   Energy sector (oil & gas): traditional focus on physical security, and cooperation inside the sector.  More openness needed across the sectors. Relevant trainings are welcome.   Transport (air): new threats emerging with the Internet-of-Things. It is not evident that this is  covered adequately. The minimum requirement is for awareness trainings.   Banking & financial markets sector: there is a significant need for malware analysis trainings.   Banking sector: there is a need for security awareness initiatives for customers (both businesses  and the general public). It is recognised that this is not easy to put into trainings.   Health sector: there is a gap between the frontrunners – such as university hospitals are – who are  advanced in cyber security and have a high level of training on the one hand – and on the other  hand smaller hospitals or small practices in all countries, where the knowledge and experience in  this field is often very limited.  o As all are part of the same chain and are increasingly exchanging sensitive data, there is a  dire need to close this gap. Trainings of various kinds, starting with awareness, should be  part of this effort.   Digital infrastructure: especially from the CSIRT perspective, the most needed trainings are for  raising awareness and incident management.  Among more general conclusions resulted from interviews are the following:   It is very important to adjust a training to the maturity of the participants/organisations.   Local trainings in local languages are very important. They ensure better communication and problem  understanding.  3.2 Identification of Threats Related to Critical Sectors  After consulting the critical infrastructure protection practitioners, it was decided to conduct additional  research to further clarify the picture of the cyber security threat landscape of the critical infrastructures.  This step assumed that the identification of specific threats related to particular sectors, by doing desktop  research, to enable supplement the experts’ point of view and in result more fully determine the needs for  the cyber security trainings in these sectors.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  12  The initial observation from taking stock of existing training initiatives (Section 2.2) is that very few of the  available training programmes are dedicated to particular sectors. It was then confirmed when we started  gathering trainings information directly from the vendors. All of the contacted vendors claimed that the  trainings they have in their offers are – with a very few exceptions – relevant to all critical sectors identified  in the NIS Directive. The only major difference here concerns those sectors, which uses Operation  Technology systems, i.e. Energy, Transport and Water Supply sectors.  It was also found that differences in the context of cyber security among sectors actually lie in the various  threats vectors. Indeed, there are threats strongly linked to some sectors and less to others. To give an  example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a much bigger concern in the Digital Infrastructure  sector than in some of the other sectors, due to the fact that eveb short periods of downtime can have  significant business implications. However, the way the attack is executed is technically the same. On the  other hand, one must also consider interdependencies among sectors and their security implications. For  example, a DDoS attack in Digital Infrastructure may impact an e-Health application.  The above observations led to an approach in which for the purpose of threats identification related to  sectors, the group of sectors were divided into two following subgroups:   ICS(Industrial Control Systems)-based sectors: energy, transport, drinking water supply and distribution  sectors,   Non-ICS-based sectors: banking, financial market infrastructure, and digital infrastructure sectors.  While ENISA has developed in the past sectorial threat models, for the purpose of this study it was more  efficient to use a smaller scheme, that can be correlated to specific potential training topics. All the critical  sectors, ICS-based and non-ICS-based have related IT threats, but it could be assumed that OT threats are  relevant only to sectors from the ICS-based sectors; thus, to provide a more structured approach, separate  groups of specific OT/IT threats and shared IT threats are considered. The identified collection of IT and OT  threats related to sectors are included in Table 1. The identification of a complete and comprehensive list of  threats for each sector is outside the scope of this work. However, the categorisation below, even though it  is non-exhaustive, should provide enough information to facilitate the mapping of threats to specific  sectorial training needs.  Table 3: Threats (OT & IT) related to seven critical sectors identified in NIS Directive.

This methodology is based on the assumption  that threats identified in sectors can be associated with one or more training types4 (for training topics see  Table 4). Applying the following scoring methodology identified what types of trainings are less or more  needed in particular sectors. In general, this methodology assesses for each identified threat, and its’  relevance to a particular training. The following examples provide a better understanding of the entire  mapping process:   if privacy protection threat is identified within a particular sector it scores 1 point under General Data  Protection training and 1 point under Data Security training,   if malware exploits threat is identified within a particular sector it scores 1 point under Malware Analysis  training, 1 point under Forensic Analysis training, 1 point under Threat Intelligence training, 1 point  under Incident Response training and 1 point under Intrusion Prevention and Detection training,   if vulnerabilities of ICS components threat is identified within a particular sector (in this case it is  identified within all OT sectors: energy, transport and water supply) it scores 1 point under ICS/SCADA  Security training and 1 point under Vulnerability Assessment training.  After completing the above mapping process for each threat identified, the four-level scale to evaluate the  need of a particular type of training in every sector was proposed. The scale is as follows:   0 – not relevant – the training is very loosely related to the sectorial need,   1 – good to have – the training is the part of the good practice for cyber security management process  but not specifically related to the sector,   2 – should have – the training is the part of the good practice for cyber security management process  and an organization should not avoid it,   3 (3+) – must have – the exercise is crucial for organising a proper cyber security management process.  It includes specific material for the sector.  To conclude the whole above process, the more points the training received after mapping, the more  emphasis should be put in the implementation of such a training in a particular sector. In some cases, for  e.g. ICS/SCADA Security trainings in the energy sector, there are more points than 3 which suggests even  stronger urgency regarding implementation of such a training.  The results of the above mapping process are presented in Table 4.  4 In cases where a threat could not be associated with a certain training type, it would probably indicate the need to  add appropriate training.

This can be regarded as an argument to treat these sectors with extra attention in terms of  training.   The energy, transport, drinking water supply and distribution sectors have similar Operation  Technology risks. Such risks are related to cyber security threats to ICS systems and include: HMI  (Human-Machine Interfaces), IoT, electric devices and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition) systems. This means that trainings should be available focusing on these topics.   ICT systems increased interdependencies between all critical infrastructure sectors and in result  these sectors share similar IT threats. One example is the banking and financial infrastructure sectors  that share very similar threats concerning data protection and privacy.   New security challenges arise as systems are becoming more interconnected, integrating more and  more digital technologies and increasingly use data to deliver higher capacity and performance.  These systems were designed to maximize efficiency and functionality, not security.   The lack of awareness of the potential severity of malicious cyber security attacks in every sector is  the gravest concern. Awareness raising trainings are thus of great importance in all sectors. It is  important to notice that these kind of trainings are mainly dedicated for ordinary staff, and only  partially for cyber security specialists.   The Social Engineering threat concerns all sectors, but is particularly important in digital  infrastructure sector due to the wide spectrum of this type of attacks (e.g. DNS Cache Poisoning,  DNS Spoofing, cybersquatting, typosquatting).   ICS systems are not only at risk from current vulnerabilities which target standard business  networks, such as malware, denial-of-service and user error, but also from specific vulnerabilities  which target the unique characteristics inherent in these systems as e.g. the use of advanced  technology in transport sector, such as 4G/LTE networks mixed with legacy systems.   New factors influence the cyber threat landscape: shadow IT, mobile and flexible working, bring own  devices (e.g. infected USB drives), IoT (Internet of Things). IoT threats are becoming increasingly  important, especially in the context of the health sector and smart cities – the concept increasingly  applied in the transport sector.   The risks associated with ransomware cannot be underestimated. Unfortunately, recent cases  (“WannaCry”, “NotPetya”) have proven that this kind of malware is not always targeted to specific  sectors and can paralyse a significant part of the critical infrastructure.   Desktop research (identification of specific threats related to critical sectors) led to expanding of the  training catalogue with additional trainings such as: security of the chain supply, security of the  outsourcing, protection against APT, protection against DDoS attacks, protection against insider  threats. Insider threats especially are a complex area, and are only partially technical in nature –  psychology and how staff is treated and managed all come into play here: how to create a work  environment that minimises these risks.   Vulnerability assessment, risk and threat management are of significant importance for all critical  sectors.   Information on breaches in critical sectors is confidential and therefore often difficult to obtain. This  is a significant problem as sharing information about cyber security and incidents reporting is of  great importance when addressing cyber security. It is not trivial to address by means of trainings,  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  17  but one way could be to share success stories of information sharing5 and explain how it is possible  to share information without breaching confidentiality. This also includes training people in such  concepts as TLP – the Traffic Light Protocol – which was designed for purposes like this.   Trainings curricula should include for each sector context information and present direct  consequences of IT/OT security threats by e.g. presenting real examples of incidents. This will  improve understanding of cyber security threats in particular sectors.  5 Like in the financial sector in some countries, or the CSIRT community, and vendors who exchange security  information while competing in the commercial area.

Mapping ENISA CSIRT Trainings into Critical Sectors Needs  4.1 Mapping Methodology  The aim of this section is to provide an insight and evaluation of ENISA’s trainings availability in the context  of cyber security and critical sectors identified by the NIS Directive. The results should lead to a better  adaptation of the ENISA offer to sectorial training needs. To provide such an evaluation, the methodology  of mapping of ENISA’s trainings material6 to the training needs (identified in Section 3.3) of all sectors was  proposed. A similar scoring methodology as above was used, but here for each cyber security topic (see  Table 4), the ENISA trainings catalogue was searched, identifying any ENISA’s training that is related to this  topic. For example, the topic “Protection against APT” is covered by three trainings offered by ENISA and  such a training type scores 3 points under “ENISA’s trainings availability” column (see Table 5). The identified  ENISA trainings are listed in the same column.  Having identified numbers of relevant ENISA’s trainings for each cyber security topic and comparing them  with the numbers of previously identified cyber security trainings needs in sectors (for both see Table 5), it  is possible to make trainings gaps analysis and identification that are presented in details in the next sections.  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  19  ENISA’ TRAININGS AVAILABILITY ENERGY TRANSPORT  DRINKING WATER  SUPPLY AND  DISTRIBUTION  BANKING  AND  FINANCIAL  MARKET  INFRASTRUCTURES  HEALTH  DIGITAL  INFRASTRUCTURE  Communication (team  exercises)   Incident Handling  Management   Establishing External  Contact   Incident handling in live  role playing   Cooperation with Law  Enforcement Agencies -  Advising in Cyber Crime  Cases   Assessing and Testing  Communication Channels  with CERTs and all their  stakeholders   Cooperation in the Area  of Cybercrime  6 1 1 1 1 1 1  Awareness Raising Lack of dedicated trainings 0 3 3+ 2 3 2 3+  General Data  Protection  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 0 0 2 2 0  Vulnerability  Assessment   Vulnerability handling 1 2 2 1 1 0 0  Identity & Access  Management  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 1 1 0 0 0  Malware Analysis   Processing and storing  artifacts   Artifact analysis  fundamentals   Advanced artifact  handling  7 1 0 2 0 1 0  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  20   Introduction to advanced  artefact analysis   Dynamic analysis of  artefacts   Common framework for  artefact analysis  activities   Static analysis of  artefacts  Network Analysis   Network forensics   Forensic analysis:  Network Incident  Response   Digital forensics  3 2 2 2 0 2 0  Web App Security   Forensic analysis:  Webserver Analysis  1 3 2 1 3 2 1  Data Security Lack of dedicated trainings 0 3 2 2 3 3 1  Cloud Security   Incident handling in the  cloud  1 1 1 1 0 0 0  Wireless Security Lack of dedicated trainings 0 2 1 1 0 0 0  Forensics Analysis   Forensic analysis: Local  Incident Response   Forensic analysis:  Network Incident  Response   Forensic analysis:  Webserver Analysis   Digital forensics   Network forensics  5 1 0 0 0 1 0  Device & Endpoint  Security  Lack of dedicated training 0 2 3 2 3 1 1  ICS/SCADA Security  • Incident handling during  an attack on Critical  Information Infrastructure  1 3+ 3+ 3+ 0 0 0  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  21  Threat Intelligence Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 0 1 0 1 0  Intrusion Prevention &  Detection   Presenting, correlating  and filtering various feeds   Developing  Countermeasures   Using indicators to  enhance defence  capabilities   Proactive incident  detection  4 2 1 1 0 1 0  Incident Response  Management   Automation in incident  handling   Incident handling during  an attack on Critical  Information  Infrastructure   Large scale incident  handling   Incident handling  management   Incident handling and  cooperation during  phishing campaign  5 3 2 2 2 2 2  Security of the Chain  Supply  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 1 0 2 0 0  Security of the  Outsourcing  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 1 1 0 0 0  Protection against APT   Advanced Persistent  Threat incident handling   Social networks used as  an attack vector for  targeted attacks   Incident handling during  an attack on Critical  Information  Infrastructure  3 1 1 1 1 3 2  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  22  Table 5: Results of mapping cyber security trainings needs in critical sectors into ENISA’s trainings’ catalogue  Protection against  DDoS attacks  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 2 2 1 1 2 3  Protection against  Insider threats  Lack of dedicated trainings 0 1 2 1 1 1 2  Mobile Application  Security   Mobile threats incident  handling   Mobile threats incident  handling (Part II)  2 2 2 1 2 1 1  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  23  4.2 Gap Analysis and Evaluation Results  4.2.1 General Overview of ENISA’s Trainings Availability Concerning Critical Sectors Needs  In this section, the outcome and conclusions from trainings gaps analysis is presented, resulting from the  mapping methodology, as introduced in the previous section. Figure 1 shows the current ENISA’s availability  of cyber security related trainings.  Figure 1: ENISA’s trainings availability  The availability of ENISA’s cyber security related trainings in the context of critical sectors needs can be  summarized as follows.   ENISA offers a wide spectrum of trainings regarding Malware Analysis on different levels of advancement.   ENISA specialises in trainings relevant to Incident Response Management and the examples of trainings  listed in Table 3 are only examples. Thus, all critical sector needs in terms of Incident Response  Management should be met and there is no urgent need for ENISA to introduce more such trainings.   Although, it might seem like ENISA does not provide trainings strictly dedicated to Device & Endpoint  Security or Data Security, it should be noted that a part of this knowledge is provided across a number of  trainings.   When it comes to the Communication (Team Exercises) training, the two presented in the ENISA offer  (Incident Handling Management, Establishing External Contacts) include only some of the elements  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Communication (team exercises)  Awareness Raising  General Data Protection  Vulnerability Assessment  Identity & Access Management  Malware Analysis  Network Analysis  Web App Security  Data Security  Cloud Security  Wireless Security  Forensics Analysis  Device & Endpoint Security  ICS/SCADA Security  Threat Intelligence  Intrusion Prevention & Detection  Incident Response Management  Security of the Chain Supply  Security of the Outsourcing  Protection against APT  Protection against DDoS attacks  Protection against Insider threats  Mobile Application Security  ENISA's Trainings Availability  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  24  regarding communication exercises. There are no exercises specializing in communication between team  members.   The only training connected with Vulnerability Assessment is dedicated to the CSIRTs incident handlers  and managers.   The only training connected to the Cloud Security is dedicated to the CSIRTs incident handlers and  managers.   ENISA does not provide dedicated trainings concerning: Awareness Raising, General Data Protection,  Identity & Access Management, Wireless Security, Threat Intelligence, Security of the Outsourcing,  Security of the Chain Supply, Protection from the DDOS attacks, Protection from the Insider Threats. It  does not mean that elements of these topics are not included in the offer at all, but the emphasis is put  on other good practices, primarily: Artefact Analysis, Incident Handling and Forensics Analysis.   Apart from the above-mentioned trainings, the low number of ICS/SCADA Security trainings (only 1, and  basic) is a point of attention, especially when cyber security of critical sectors utilizing operation  technologies are concerned (Energy, Transport and Water Supply sectors).  The gaps analysis and evaluation presented above provide a general overview of ENISA’s trainings availability  concerning critical sectors’ needs. The proposed adaptation of ENISA’s training material to trainings needs  for a chosen sector (Transport Sector) will be analysed in detail in the following subsections.  4.2.2 Gap Analysis for the Transport Sector  The process of identification of critical sectors’ needs showed a high demand of various types of cyber  security trainings in these areas. Focusing on one of the sectors, the gap analysis between ENISA’s trainings  catalogue and this sector training needs is presented, suggesting the broadening of ENISA’s existing training  material to better suit the sector’s needs. The chosen sector is the Transport sector. The gap analysis is  presented in Figure 2 and analysed in details below.  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  25  Figure 2: Trainings gaps analysis for transport sector  The results of the gap analysis for the transport sector can be summarized as follows.  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  Communication (team exercises)  Awareness Raising  General Data Protection  Vulnerability Assessment  Identity & Access Management  Malware Analysis  Network Analysis  Web App Security  Data Security  Cloud Security  Wireless Security  Forensics Analysis  Device & Endpoint Security  ICS/SCADA Security  Threat Intelligence  Intrusion Prevention & Detection  Incident Response Management  Security of the Chain Supply  Security of the Outsourcing  Protection against APT  Protection against DDoS attacks  Protection against Insider threats  Mobile Application Security  Trainings Gaps Analysis for Transport Sector  Transport Sector Trainings Needs ENISA's Trainings Availability  Stock taking of information security training needs in critical sectors  December 2017  26   The Transport sector has a significant or urgent need for ICS/SCADA Security and IoT related  trainings, whereas ENISA provides only one basic training dedicated to this topic. However, some  elements related to ISC/SCADA Security can be found across a number of ENISA’s training materials.   The Transport sector has an average need for Data Security trainings, whereas ENISA does not  provide trainings strictly dedicated to this area. However, since data security is concerned as a broad  and complex topic, the issues pertaining to it are available partially in most of the available trainings.   The Transport sector has an average need for Awareness Raising trainings, whereas ENISA does not  provide trainings dedicated to this area nor does it offer cyber security foundations trainings for  beginners (where Awareness Rising issue is crucial).   The Transport sector has an average need for Vulnerability Assessment trainings, whereas ENISA  provides only 1 training dedicated to this topic.   The Transport sector has an average need for Device & Endpoint Security trainings, whereas ENISA  does not provide trainings directly dedicated to this topic.   The Transport sector has an average need for Insider Threats trainings, whereas ENISA does not  provide trainings dedicated to this topic.  However, ENISA’s trainings catalogue fully meets the following transport sector trainings needs:   Communication (Team exercises),   Network Analysis,   Intrusion Prevention & Detection,   Mobile Application Security.  4.2.3 Covering Transport Sector Trainings Needs  Below, some findings concerning the transport sector are presented, obtained from the interview with the  expert of the Polish Governmental Aviation Agency:   There is a substantial need for cyber security trainings and exercises dedicated to aviation sector.  Trainings offered by the vendors on the market are not sufficient.   Awareness raising is often limited to the very basic aspect of cyber security. Also, it is presented in  the context of physical security (e.g. misuse of USB sticks).   On the other hand, aviation employees are trained with data protection issues (e.g: trade secrets).   The crucial trainings needs are connected with operations continuity and maintaining land-air  communication.   Aviation is very a specific sector also because processing of information is twofold: “business” IT  systems and operations.   The main cyber security challenge of aviation IT infrastructure is securing information flow between  the stakeholders. The operators are often mistakenly convinced that their networks are completely  segregated, whereas in reality public-networks are commonly used.   One of the greatest technological challenge is to provide real-time encryption between the air-land  communication.   There are several concepts of so called “Aviation CERT” in the industry, but so far there are only  commercial platforms available. Not all operators can afford using them.   Game-changer for the aviation sector might be the implementation of the NIS Directive.

Conclusions  The main conclusion from the conducted research is that the available cyber security training offer is large  and characterized by a great diversity; however, this offering does not address raising cyber security  resilience of critical infrastructure through trainings. The area of CIP-related trainings is still a niche field.  There are few organizations and CSIRTs (e.g. ICS-CERT) that provide specialized trainings, in particular in the  field of ICS/SCADA systems, but this is still a small fraction within the trainings that are currently available.  Despite the availability of various cyber security trainings, there is a lack of cyber security training dedicated  to the specific needs of critical sectors that take into account threat context and complexity of  interconnections of IT/OT systems.  The emerging need in all NIS Directive sectors is related to cyber security awareness raising. Also, aspects  such as e.g. decision making in cyber security management process should be covered – particularly  concerning decisions-making in cases of data security incidents, data leakage, etc. Moreover, cyber security  trainings should take into account various roles of employees in the cyber security management process and  the level of technical advancement of the staff to adequately adjust the trainings to different audience.  There is also a need of trainings related to GDPR, in the light of the upcoming EU regulations, as this will  affect every sector in such a way that any breach of personal data protection (e.g. customer data in transport  sector) may result in sanctions (both financial and organizational) and could have an impact on the  organization operations.  Below are some other practical findings that could assist in tailoring the existing ENISA’s training material in  the context of NIS Directive sectors needs resulting from the research are summarized.   ENISA should present the context of threats and risks related to each sector in the trainings. In particular,  dependencies and mutual influence of infrastructures operating in different sectors should be explained,  and their possible impact on cyber-security issues concerning e.g. global payments or air traffic control.   ENISA should provide trainings in the local languages.   ENISA should determine whether cyber ranges and gamification based trainings will likely provide a  more effective approach than traditional trainings. On-demand training accessibility is gaining in  importance.   On-demand training accessibility is gaining importance. Such an option is beneficial for the training  vendor and organizations, but on the other hand can be less beneficial for the individuals enrolling for  the training.

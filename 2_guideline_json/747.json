Passwords protect so many parts of our lives, from our money to our businesses  and even the appliances in our smart homes. Remembering all these passwords  can be a real challenge, particularly when every account has different password  requirements. That’s where password managers can help.  A password manager is an application that securely stores, generates and  manages passwords for all of your accounts. With a password manager, you  only need to remember one master password, the password manager takes care  of the rest. Think of a password manager as a safe for your passwords and the  master password as the key to the safe. You can use password managers  on computers and mobile devices.  Password Manager Wins. Win #1.  Make your master password  your strongest. Your master password is the key to your safe.  If someone guesses your master password,  they may be able to access all your passwords.  Make sure your master password is unique  and your strongest password.  The strongest type of password is a passphrase  which is easy to remember. Passphrases are a  combination of random words, for example,  ‘crystal onion clay pretzel’. The best passphrases:  • are at least 14 characters long  • use a random mix of four or more words  •  do not use popular phrases, for example, song  lyrics or famous quotes.  • are not re-used across multiple accounts  Passphrases are easy for you to remember  and hard for machines to crack.  Do not reuse passwords. It is not secure to use the same password for all of  your accounts. With a password manager, you can  have different passwords for all of your accounts while  only having to remember your master password.  Quick Wins  |  for your Password Manager2  Quick Wins for your Password Manager.  Win #2.  Enable multi-factor  authentication (MFA).  MFA is a method of increasing the security of a  password manager.  MFA requires you to prove your identity in two  or more ways before you can access sensitive  features of your password manager. It typically  requires a combination  of at least two of:  •  something you know (e.g. a passphrase or PIN)  •  something you have (e.g. an authenticator  app or physical token) or  •  something you are (e.g. your fingerprint or  face scan).  Enabling MFA on your password manager adds  an additional layer  of security. It means that even if a cybercriminal  learns your master password, they will not  be able to access your other passwords as  your other authentication methods keep  your password manager secure.  Don’t lose access to your  password manager.  Forgetting your master password or losing access to  your multi-factor authentication method is like losing  the key to a physical safe. It may mean you lose access  to all the passwords stored in your password manager.  Win #3.  Choose the right password  manager for you.  There are many different types of password  managers but their quality and security may vary.  When choosing a password manager, do your  research to ensure that the vendor has a good  reputation and that their product has strong  security features, strong privacy features and  is maintained with regular security updates.  Different password managers have different  features. Consider what features are important  to you. You may want to check if your password  manager:  • has a plan that covers family members  •  can manage your passwords across multiple  devices  •  supports all the different devices you use  •  ensures only you can see your saved passwords,  even the company that makes the password  manager cannot see them.  Many password managers are free and some  are included with certain devices and programs.  Be careful when using the  ‘remember me’ feature.  Some password mangers have a ‘remember me’  feature. If you select ‘remember me’ the password  manager will trust the device you are using and  ask you for your master password less frequently.  Do not use the ‘remember me’ feature for your  password manager if you are on a public computer  or if you share the device with other users.  If you do, other people that use the device  could access your accounts.  Quick Wins  |  for your Password Manager 3  Disclaimer.

In parallel, an  evolving cyber threat landscape shows a sharp increase and levels of sophistication of cyber incidents and  attacks. Against this backdrop, the relevance of ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security) and its role in networking and trust building, as well as capacity building to achieve high and  effective levels of network and information security in the European CSIRT community, stands out.  Undoubtedly, ENISA’s support to achieve high and effective levels of network and information security  within the European CSIRT community will remain an important cornerstone in the years to come. ENISA is  uniquely positioned to spot the gaps and the needs of the community, and to lead the way towards sustained  levels of cyber-security.  This report represents the update of an impact assessment performed by Deloitte of ENISA’s capacity  building activities for CSIRTs in 2014. This updated assessment serves as a basis for a proposed roadmap to  2020.  The impact of the ENISA support to the CSIRT community was assessed from a dual perspective - legislative  and regulatory, as well as operational, with the key objectives to:   Update the policy analysis;   Gather additional input from practitioners, including specific input on the new duties;   Together with ENISA, propose concrete projects or actions towards the roadmap implementation.  The legislative and regulatory perspective covers the objectives formulated in the ENISA regulation, the 2014  and 2015 ENISA Work Programmes, the Digital Agenda for Europe, the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the  proposed NIS Directive, as well as the EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP).  The operational perspective includes an assessment of the impact of ENISA’s CSIRT support looking at four  activity pillars:   Baseline Capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building in sharing good practice and CSIRTs training;   Supporting the CSIRTs in better collaboration with law enforcement agencies (LEAs);   Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  The study was conducted using a multi-dimensional approach including document reviews, online surveys,  one-to-one interviews and an internal ENISA workshop with input from key CSIRT experts.  The intended target audience for this study is for all interested in ENISA, yet primarily policy-makers,  managerial staff, and senior experts in CSIRTs and other competent authorities in the EU Member States as  well as senior EU level officials involved in activities supporting the work of CSIRTs across Europe.  The main results from the report have been included in a roadmap to 2020, including suggestions on  concrete actions for ENISA’s future CSIRT support.  Leading the way  07  The key findings can be summarised in the following points:   Legislative and regulatory perspective: Based on the EU policies and strategy documents reviewed,  it is evident that ENISA’s role and impact in this domain is recognised and clearly reflected through  the ever-increasing scope and authority extended over time to the Agency. For instance, the NIS  Directive (final adoption pending) is expected to bring about important changes to the ENISA  mandate.   Operational perspective: Overall, the respondent views and findings concur with the findings of the  2014 report. ENISA is still considered to be the representative voice of the European CSIRT  community and of other operational communities. Being uniquely positioned in the cybersecurity  landscape, the CSIRT community welcomes the Agency to make use of its experience and to push  the envelope by being bolder and taking a clearer stance in its publications, and proactively reaching  out and endorsing initiatives when identifying them.   As highlighted in the 2014 report, there is a need for ENISA to accommodate a ‘two-speed’ structure  of CSIRTs, support less and more mature teams respectively. This is the case for the material the  Agency produces, as well as for the trainings it organises. While the material pertaining to the  baseline capabilities (activity pillar I) and capacity building (activity pillar II) remains vital  contributions to the community, there is also a scope for the sharper technical focus of the ENISA  reports, on the one hand and more policy oriented reports on the other.   The awareness of ENISA’s CSIRT support actions is high within the CSIRT community and overall  there was a positive view of ENISA’s CSIRT related work. There is still a strong support of ENISA’s  role as the facilitator and coordinator of the CSIRT community, serving as a middle ground mediator  between the CSIRTs and the European Commission. ENISA bridges the gap between the technical  focus of the CSIRTs and the political focus of the Commission. ENISA should also strengthen the ties  between the CSIRTs and LEAs through further collaborating with the European Cybercrime Centre  at Europol, Eurojust and CEPOL.   The Cyber Europe exercises are appreciated by the CSIRT community. Suggestions for  improvements include more advanced technical challenges to the exercises, and to manage the  growing size of participants by grouping them regionally, while also inviting participations from the  private. An increase in exercises focusing on more on crisis management is also welcomed.   360° Feedback: Echoing the words of Commissioner Oettinger, ENISA was requested to explore a  stronger mandate that would allow the Agency to drive the EU’s technological independence. ENISA  could play an instrumental role in the EU’s ambition to regain ‘digital sovereignty” and to reassert  its digital independence. This new branch of strategic activities would examine the ‘bigger picture’,  including industrial politics, and provide input in the form of strategic studies and workshops.  Several respondents even pointed to the possibility for ENISA to expand its constituency (working  increasingly with CSIRTs in various sectors) and coverage beyond the borders of the EU. For instance,  there was a call for ENISA to enhance communication with non-EU countries and to establish  minimal security standards for Member States on strategic and operational levels.  Leading the way  08  1 Introduction  ENISA strives to continuously improve the quality of its deliverables and their relevance for its stakeholders.  The Agency has thus partnered with Deloitte to perform an impact Assessment of its work in the CSIRT area,  and propose a roadmap for its future activities.  CSIRTs and operational communities are an essential target for capacity building, because they are in the  field and address actual incidents. ENISA’s activities that focus on this target group can have real world  impact, through guidance with good practices as well as exercises that develop Member States develop crisis  management capabilities. This report represents the outcome of a desk review, stakeholder survey, in-depth  interviews, as well as an internal workshop conducted in Athens in April 2015 as a part of the evidence  gathering for the project \"Update of Impact Assessment and Roadmap\".  1.1 State of Play – 2014 Impact Assessment  The background of the project is the 2014 “Impact Assessment & Roadmap” [1] performed by Deloitte with  ENISA’s support to Computer Security Incident Response Team for the period 2005 to 2014. The impact  assessment has served as a basis for a proposed roadmap to 2020.  The key objectives of the study were to:   Identify ENISA achievements in relation to European CSIRTs in light of relevant policy documents;   Analyse the impact of these achievements and other operational communities;   Provide a roadmap for the period leading up to 2020 based on the results of the impact analysis.  The study team assessed the impact of the ENISA support to the CSIRT community from a legislative and  regulatory perspective on the one hand, and an operational perspective on the other.  The legislative and regulatory perspectives cover the objectives formulated in the ENISA Regulation [2], the  2013 [3] and 2014 [4] ENISA Work Programmes, and specific elements of other relevant acts, such as the  Digital Agenda for Europe [5], the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union [6] and the proposed NIS  Directive [7].  The operational perspective included an assessment looking at three activity pillars:   Baseline Capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building in sharing good practice and CSIRT training;   Supporting the CSIRTs in better collaboration with law enforcement agencies.  With the ongoing \"Update of Impact Assessment and Roadmap\" project ENISA aims to carry out a follow-up  on the 2014 “Impact Assessment and Roadmap” on its impact in the area of support for CSIRTs.  The 2014 roadmap, which was validated by a group of CSIRT experts, is summarised below:  Legislative and regulatory perspective: Based on the EU policies and strategy documents reviewed, it is  evident that ENISA’s role and impact in this domain is recognised and clearly reflected through the ever-  Leading the way  09  increasing scope and authority extended over time to the Agency. In the coming years, ENISA may act as a  representative voice for CSIRTs in the European policy context.  Operational perspective: The awareness of ENISA’s CSIRT support actions is high among the CSIRT  stakeholders and overall there was a positive view of ENISA’s CSIRT related work. However, awareness was  higher among representatives of national and governmental CSIRTs than among other CSIRT communities  (i.e. in the private, financial sector, etc.). As for the ENISA trainings, there was an expressed need to keep  the baseline capabilities more separate from the capacity building activities as the former should cater to  the needs of CSIRT teams of varied levels of maturity. Suggestions for future actions include a clear  separation between supports to “new teams” vs. “advanced teams”. This is linked to the request for greater  clarity of the required level of prior knowledge needed to participate in different trainings. Regarding ENISA  reports, there is a need for more technical topics on the one hand for the practitioners, and more policy- related reports on the other hand, serving to make the case of the ENISA raison d’être to policy and decision- makers. It was also suggested that ENISA should pick up topics and current trends/threats from the EU  Member States and research them in-depth, as well as having them  translated into several languages.  360° Feedback: Key points raised stressed that ENISA is the main CSIRT  community connector and facilitator, within and beyond the traditional  CSIRT stakeholder groups. ENISA’s credibility as the voice of European  CSIRTs within the EU and internationally was undisputed. Improved  channels of information was another key point, requesting ENISA to better  disseminate information via its website, related to both its activities, but also  to alert the CSIRT community and other operational communities on current  attacks and incidents. ENISA is also called upon to lead the work on  compiling information on incidents and threats in a catalogue along with  recommendations on how to handle them. The 360° feedback also included  a call for greater harmonisation and common standards among CSIRTs under  the lead and guidance of ENISA.  1.2 Study Purpose and Objectives  Although the 2014 report contributed with a wide array of stakeholder views on the ENISA CSIRT support, it  was slightly impacted by a limited response rate to the survey and the project did not allow for much internal  discussion on how to implement it. As a result, the proposals in the roadmap were primarily high-level  recommendations. In addition, since the publication of the 2014 report, the responsibilities and resources  of the ENISA “Operational Security” Unit have expanded to include cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  These were out of scope in the first study.  Therefore, the objectives of the “Update of Impact Assessment and Roadmap” are to:   Update the analysis of relevant policy documents from regulation and from operational  perspective;   Gather additional input from practitioners, including specific input on the new duties;   Together with ENISA, propose concrete projects or actions towards the roadmap implementation.  Leading the way  10  The main difference from the 2014 report is that the operational perspective of the update project includes  a fourth pillar:   Baseline capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building sharing good practice and CSIRT training;   Support CSIRTs to better collaborate with law enforcement agencies;   Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  In terms of the legislative and regulatory perspective it focuses on the objectives formulated in the ENISA  Regulation, the 2015 Work Programme, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union (and roadmap)  and the proposed NIS Directive.  1.3 Policy Perspective  This chapter presents an overview of the results of the desk review, which was undertaken focusing on key  strategic documents outlining the EUs policies influencing the domain, as well as the main official documents  laying down ENISA’s mandate and tasks related to support to CSIRTs. Additionally, views of respondents of  both the interviews and surveys with regard to the policy and regulation perspective of ENISA’s support  activities have been incorporated where applicable. The information gathered has been grouped according  to the following structure:   ENISA Regulation;   EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP);   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union;   Proposed NIS Directive;   ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015.  1.4 Operational Perspective  For the purpose of this document, the operational perspective of this study focuses on the following four  pillars for capacity building:   Baseline capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building sharing good practice and CSIRT training;   Support CSIRTs to better collaborate with Law Enforcement;   Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  The four pillars are treated in separate chapters in which we present the key points and suggestions that  came out of the internal ENISA workshop, along with some of the feedback gathered from the respondents  (surveys and interviews), on their views on these possible future activities of ENISA in the area of support to  CSIRTs. We conclude each chapter with a draft roadmap to 2020 per pillar for the reader to have an overview  of the suggested activities.  1.5 Target Audience  This study seeks to inform ENISA’s stakeholders in a decision maker’s role regarding its support activities  until 2020 for CSIRTs and other operational activities. In addition, this study is intended to inform wider  policy debates about how to make ENISA an even more valuable partner for national and governmental  Leading the way  11  CSIRTs and other relevant stakeholders in Europe and beyond, as well as to inform those CSIRTs and  stakeholders about ways in which ENISA could support their work in the future. The study is also targeted at  policy-makers, managerial staff, and senior experts in national and governmental CSIRTs and other  competent authorities in the European Union Member States as well as senior EU level officials involved in  activities supporting the work of CSIRTs across Europe.  1.6 Structure of this Report  The study consists of the following chapters. The introduction is followed by chapter 2, which outlines the  study’s qualitative methodological approach that combines a review of documents with online surveys and  interviews with key experts in the field.  Chapter 3 puts into context the policy perspectives which were  taken into consideration for this study. This includes the European Union Policy on Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, the proposed NIS  Directive and ENISA’s Annual Work Programmes for 2014 and 2015, while also presenting the responses of  various stakeholders to the former. Chapter 4 illustrates the overall respondent views on the ENISA CSIRT  support. These views have been grouped into three overarching themes focusing on their awareness,  appreciation and perceived weakness of the related activites. The following four chapters, 5 to 8, concern  themsleves with the operational perspective of this study reflecting the responsibilities and resources of  ENISA related to its four operational pillars. These four chapters follow a similar structure, which starts off  by describing ENISA’s perspective on the road ahead, followed by the respondents views and concluding  with a high-level roadmap to 2020. The final chapter 9, discusses the findings of the study and proposes a  complete  roadmap to 2020 for the four pillars.  Leading the way  12  2 Methodology  This study is supported by a desk review of the key legal and policy documents, interviews with key experts  and online surveys with stakeholders from the CSIRT community and other operational communities. In the  following chapters we present how the information collection for this study was undertaken.  2.1 Definitions  The purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview of what is understood, within the  framework of this study, by “deliverables”, “activities” and “CSIRT community support”:  THEME  DESCRITPTION  Deliverables  Reports and studies   Training guides and exercises   Awareness materials  Activities   Trainings   Support to the set-up of CSIRTs   Workshops   Technical part of Cyber Crisis Cooperation exercises  CSIRT community support   Participation in conferences and events (incl. as speaker)   Meeting facilitations (between CSIRTs and other actors)   Liaising, co-operation and information exchange initiatives   Provide advice  In order to further facilitate for the reader of what is understood by “deliverables”, “activities” and  “community support” in the remainder of this report we have added a number of concrete examples. This  list of examples is non-exhaustive, but it does display a wide variety of ENISA CSIRT related actions.  “Deliverables” are all materials (reports, studies, training guides and exercises and awareness materials,  etc.) that ENISA makes available to the CSIRT community, either though closed distribution channels or  through their website, such as:   The studies on Building a CERT and Running a CERT [8];   Good practice guide for incident management [9].   Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems [10].  “Activities” includes open and closed meetings (by invitation only), trainings, set-up of CSIRTs, exercises and  workshops, etc., such as:   Annual national and governmental CERT workshops [11];   ENISA Train the trainers and multipliers workshop [12];   ENISA-EUROPOL/EC3 workshops [11];   TRANSITS training support [13];   Technical part of Cyber Europe Exercises [14].  Leading the way  13  “Community support” englobes ENISA activities and deliverables that are of a more ad hoc nature and  therefore less visible on the ENISA website and through other communication channels, such as:   Meeting facilitations (between CSIRTs and other actors);   Liaising / raising awareness;   European CSIRT Community – TF-CSIRT [15] and FIRST [16].  2.1.1 Time line for the proposed roadmap  In the proposed roadmap following this report, we refer to actions and activities to be implemented in the  short, medium and long term, by which we suggest the following:   Short term: within the next year (2016/17)   Medium term: 2-3 years (2018/19)   Long term: 4 years and beyond (2020 and after).  2.2 Information Collection  2.2.1 Desk study  A number of key documents have served as a foundation for the study to identify the legal and policy  framework of ENISA’s CSIRT-related mandate, activities and performance with regards to supporting the  CSIRTs and other operational communities. The overview below provides a list of the key documents that  have been reviewed within the scope of the desk study of this report:   EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP);   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union;   Proposed NIS Directive;   ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015.  2.2.2 ENISA internal workshop  An ENISA internal workshop has been conducted in Athens in April 2015 as a part of the evidence gathering  for the project, by including the key ENISA experts that are involved in the CSIRT-related activities of the  Agency. Upon the completion of the workshop and validation by ENISA staff, the main points coming out of  this workshop were summarised and included in this report.  2.2.3 Online survey  One of the key instruments used for data collection for this study was an online survey, which was hosted  on the European Commission’s ‘EUSurvey’ platform. The study team has designed the online survey  questionnaire in order to provide:   A clear structure with a straightforward presentation of questions and possible answers;   An easy monitoring of the survey progress and results.  Selected experts from seven stakeholder groups were contacted and invited to participate in the online  survey. The table below presents the share of respondents (as percentage) per stakeholder group.

The study team conducted the interviews, either  in person (with the stakeholders located in Brussels, Belgium) or via phone. The interviews were conducted  between June and September 2015.  The interviews were pursued in a semi-structured manner allowing for auxiliary questions and for new lines  of questioning depending on the responses of the respondents. During the interviews, the study team  followed an agreed-upon protocol covering all the different themes that were treated during the interview  with the selected CSIRT stakeholders. However, interview respondents were free to discuss additional  relevant topics they considered as important or interesting.  Leading the way  15  Only note taking was used to capture the content of the interviews. Referencing to Chatham House rules,  interviewees were assured of non-attribution and anonymity when using direct quotes, unless they gave the  study team explicit permission to be quoted. As a result, in reporting on the interviews in this study, a quasi- anonymous approach is pursued, with references only being made to participant’s role or type of host  organisation, i.e. CSIRT, LEA, policy-making body, or other.  Figure 2 – Overview of host organisations of interview respondents  2.3 Stakeholder Categories  2.3.1 National Liaison Officers  ENISA has set up a network of National Liaison Officers (NLOs), which serve as ENISA’s contact point with  the Member States on specific issues. ENISA also gains access to a network of national contacts through  individual NLOs, reinforcing the activity of the Agency in the Member States.  Member States representatives – one from each EU and EEA country – are part of the NLO network. A  representative from the European Commission and a representative from the Council of the European Union  are also part of this network.  2.3.2 National/Governmental CSIRTs  National and governmental CSIRTs are Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that serve the  government of a country by helping to protect the critical information infrastructure. National and  governmental CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant stakeholders at  the national level. They also bear the responsibility for cooperation with the national and governmental  teams in other countries.  Leading the way  16  2.3.3 Other CSIRTs in EU Member States  This stakeholder group represents CSIRTs which are located in the European Union but not mandated by the  government. Examples include among others CSIRTs in research and education, as well as military CSIRTs.  2.3.4 Non-EU CSIRTs  This stakeholder group represents CSIRTs which are located outside of the European Union. Examples  include CERT-GIB, Swisscom and SWITCH-CERT.  2.3.5 European Institutions (e.g. JRC, EC, CERT-EU etc.)  The institutions of the European Union include the European Commission, the European Parliament,  European Agencies such as JRC, and CERT-EU.  2.3.6 Member State bodies (NIS authorities. national CIIPs, CIPs)  This stakeholder group includes professionals from the national authorities dealing with information security  and issues related to CSIRT activities. Examples include, NIS and cyber-security bodies.  2.3.7 Public and private stakeholders (e.g. academia, CI, CII)  This group includes any other public or private organisation that relates to CSIRT activities. Examples include  professional services, associations of providers and legal & policy experts.  Leading the way  17  3 Policy Perspective  This chapter presents an overview of the results of the desk review, which was undertaken focusing on key  strategic documents outlining the EUs policies influencing the domain, as well as the main official documents  laying down ENISA’s mandate and tasks related to support to CSIRTs. Additionally, views of respondents of  both the interviews and surveys with regard to the policy and regulation perspective of ENISA’s support  activities have been incorporated where applicable. The information gathered has been grouped according  to the following structure:   EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP);   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union;   Proposed NIS Directive;   ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015.  3.1 EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP)  The European Commission Communication [17] on Critical Information Infrastructure protection focusing  on the protection of Europe from cyber disruptions by enhancing security and resilience was adopted in  2009. The Communication included an action plan based on five pillars, involving the Member States and  the private sector:   Preparedness and prevention;   Detection and response;   Mitigation and recovery;   International cooperation;   Criteria for European Critical Infrastructures in the field of ICT.  The CIIP Ministerial Conference organised by the Hungarian Presidency of the EU in 2011 served as a forum  to evaluate progress, assess lessons learnt and to discuss the remaining challenges ahead and next steps.  The following 2012 European Parliament Resolution on “Critical Information Infrastructure Protection:  towards global cyber security” [18] made further recommendations to the Commission. Several of these  were echoed in the Cybersecurity strategy and in the proposal for a Directive on network on information  security (hereafter “the NIS Directive”) published in 2013.  Among the key achievements related to the CIIP policy, brought about by ENISA include:   The adoption of a minimum set of baseline capabilities and services, and related policy  recommendations for national/governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams to function  effectively;   The carrying out of pan-European exercises, (i.e. Cyber Europe 2010, 2012, etc.)  Whilst the EU Cybersecurity Strategy did include certain actions, such as the pan-European exercises, the  voluntary nature of the CIIP policy [19] has been seen as a weakness, which could be amended by the adoption  of the NIS Directive. This would require the Member States to put in place a minimum level of capabilities at  national level and to cooperate across borders [20].  Leading the way  18  3.2 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union [6] outlines the  EU’s vision in the domain of cyber security, clarifying roles and  responsibilities, and specifying required actions to promote online  security and citizens’ rights.  The vision presented in the Strategy is articulated in five priorities  and foresees a key role for ENISA in protecting Europe’s cyberspace  in the first and the fourth priority to ‘achieving cyber resilience’ and  to ‘develop industrial and technological resources for  cybersecurity’.  To boost cyber resilience in the EU, both the public and the private sector must develop capabilities and  cooperate effectively. In the second priority of the Strategy the Commission asks ENISA to:   Assist Member States in developing strong national cyber resilience capabilities, by building  expertise on security and resilience of industrial control systems, transport and energy  infrastructure;   Examine in 2013 the feasibility of Computer Security Incident Response Team(s) for Industrial  Control Systems (ICS-CSIRTs) for the EU [21];   Continue supporting the MS and the EU institutions in carrying out regular pan-European cyber  incident exercises which will also constitute the operational basis for the EU participation in  international cyber incident exercises.  To develop industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity, in the fourth priority of the Strategy the  Commission asks ENISA to:   Propose in 2013 a roadmap for a ‘Network and Information Security driving licence’ as a voluntary  certification programme to promote enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals (e.g.  website administrators);   Develop, in cooperation with relevant national competent authorities, relevant stakeholders, and  international and European standardisation bodies and the European Commission Joint Research  Centre, technical guidelines and recommendations for the adoption of NIS standards and good  practices in the public and private sectors.  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union is not a legally binding document, however ENISA is  expected to take into account these requests coming from such a high level document.  3.2.1 Respondent views  The respondents were asked what additional CSIRT-related areas and activities, in line with the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the EU, they would recommend ENISA to focus on for the coming five years. Respondent from  national CSIRTs suggested that ENISA should prioritise CSIRT capacity building, training and exercises.  However, when it comes to incident handling, it is believed that ENISA should not handle incidents now or  in the coming five years. Most of the respondents believe that ENISA should concentrate more on organising  trainings and workshops with emphasis on technical aspects.  “ENISA’s role in  supporting the  Cybersecurity Strategy is  really important and  ENISA does it very well.”  Respondent from a Member State  body  Leading the way  19  Other respondents stressed that while the European cyber exercises are extremely helpful, there is a need  for a European cyber crisis system. This was deemed to be a difficult task for ENISA since the decisions on  crisis management remain mainly at the national level and ENISA does not have a mandate outside the area  of NIS.  In addition, the table below illustrates the results from the ‘EUSurvey’ platform, demonstrating that over  80% of the responding National Liaison Officers believe that ENISA CSIRT related activities are of importance  in supporting the Cybersecurity Strategy of the  European Union.  The respondents were asked to what extent they  believe that ENISA capacity building activities are  important in supporting the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the European Union, in particular the  goals related to co-ordination between NIS  competent authorities, CSIRTs and law  enforcement. Most of the respondents agreed  that ENISA capacity building activities are  important in supporting the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the European Union and in particular  the goals related to co-ordination between NIS  competent authorities, CSIRTs, and law  enforcement. However, one of the respondents did not completely agree with this statement and expressed  that according to him, there is still a lot to be done in this direction and that cooperation between those  three authorities is still not in good state due to cultural differences.  Furthermore, the respondents, with respect to the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, suggested  that ENISA should focus on the following:   Trust building: Several respondents recommended that ENISA continues this and some proposed  the following:  o ENISA engages more with senior policy makers to outline that cyber security matters;  o Secondment and staff exchanges between CSIRTs in other Member States, and between  Member States and EU institutions. Enhancing communication with non-EU countries;   Cooperation: ENISA should build on this basis by serving as a coordinator as it already has  established good relations with CSIRTs and develop upon its existing cooperation network to  expand to other sectors, industries and stakeholders. In addition, CSIRTs are very often not very  well connected to private companies’ CSIRTs and this could be promoted by supporting CSIRT  associations like CERT-Verbund in Germany. Some respondents even mentioned, which would go  beyond the remits of the ENISA mandate, enhanced cooperation with the military sector. In  addition, ENISA could provide a secretariat and guidance function for the CSIRT network in view to  harmonise differences between MSs;   Training: Tailored trainings and exercises, for example for incident handlers, liaisons, analysts, press  contacts, etc. ENISA can also conduct trust building measures and capacity building, coordinate  50%  17%  33%  ENISA CSIRT activities importance  in supporting the Cybersecurity  Strategy  important  less important  relatively important  Leading the way  20  technical/operational trainings, enhance training material, support tool building initiatives, and  support the CSIRT needs. This could include the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)2.   Materials: Provide guidance materials and reports and act as a repository or a “go-to place” in terms  of having a broad source of information whether the materials are produced by ENISA or others.  3.3 Proposed NIS Directive  The proposed NIS Directive [7] is a legislative instrument, pending final adoption by EU Council Ministers  and the EU Parliament, to support the achievement of some of the high level goals identified in the  Cybersecurity Strategy, including promoting a high common level of NIS by improving internet security,  private networks, and information systems. The proposed NIS Directive lays down measures to ensure a high  common level of Network and Information Security (NIS) across the EU:   Establish common minimum requirements for NIS at national level;   Set up coordinated prevention, detection mitigation and response mechanism, enabling  information sharing and mutual assistance amongst the national NIS competent authorities;   Improve preparedness and engagement of the private sector.  The proposed NIS Directive elaborates on the role of ENISA with regard to supporting Member States and  the EU by assisting in the operation of the cooperation network, providing Member States and the EU with  its expertise and advice, and by facilitating the exchange of best practices. The proposal also suggests that  ENISA should cooperate with the EU institutions and Member States to develop a cooperation plan to  counter risks and incidents.  3.3.1 Respondent views  In relation to the NIS Directive, one respondent from the NLOs stated that ENISA should focus on how it can  help on the effective implementation of the NIS directive. In relation to article 8 of the NIS directive on the  formation of a cooperation network, one respondent from a governmental CSIRT called for ENISA’s already  existing cooperation with CSIRTs to be fully used and for its role to be crystallised in order for ENISA to serve  as a coordinator, so as to not duplicate efforts. In the current version of the proposed Directive, ENISA is  only to assist the cooperation network when requested to. It was also stressed in the interviews that ENISA  should develop operational procedures in support of new activities, if requested. Moreover, as the NIS  Directive is a work in progress, ENISA should “not create additional work for itself by overstepping their  current mandate”.  Other responses highlighted the need for ENISA’s role in assisting in the effective implementation of the NIS  directive:   NIS community support;   NIS stakeholder brokerage and trust-building Initiatives between MS CSIRTs;   Policy support for EU bodies and MS;   Set up of an information hub for the NIS community;   CSIRT functionality assessment for regulatory compliance with the NIS Directive;  2 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility  Leading the way  21   CSIRT baseline capabilities assessment and regulatory self-assessment toolkit.  It is also important to consider that 80% of the European Institutions and Member State Bodies respondents  have a neutral response to whether ENISA should develop operational procedures to support new activities  introduced by the proposed NIS Directive. This could be due to the fact that the NIS Directive is still under  negotiation by competent institutions.  3.4 ENISA Regulation  The new ENISA Regulation [2], constitutes the most recent ENISA mandate and replaces the prior Regulation  from 2004. It guarantees the operations of ENISA until 2018 and provides the Agency’s general strategy,  building on ENISA’s achievements in areas such as support to CSIRTs in Member States and facilitation of  pan-European cybersecurity exercises.  The new Regulation enlarges the scope of ENISA and its authority to make an even bigger differ-ence in  protecting Europe’s cyberspace, including ENISA supporting the development of EU cyber-security policy  and legislation. In terms of ENISA CSIRT support activities, the Regulation lays down a number of  expectations in relation to national and governmental CSIRTs and other CSIRTs in Europe, which are  summarised below.   CSIRT Operational Frameworks and Mandates: Facilitation of the emergence and maintenance of a  stable national and governmental CSIRT architecture across the EU, which also provides overarching  framework for EU information security.   CSIRT Service Portfolios: ENISA support to the formulation of a peer review system amongst  national and governmental CSIRTs to assess performance against a common set of capabilities.   CSIRT Resources: ENISA support for strengthened capabilities of national and governmental CSIRTs  that should also establish a common set of operational capability criteria. These should also match  those of the ‘most developed CSIRTs’ in the EU.   Cooperation: The Regulation tasks ENISA to “promote cooperation and the exchange of information  and best practices’ between CSIRTs and other relevant organisations”, and also gives ENISA a  greater interfacing ability with the European Cybercrime Centre, providing for a more proactive  ENISA role with regard to encouraging information exchange amongst national and governmental  CSIRTs and LEAs.  3.5 ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015  3.5.1 ENISA Work Programme 2014  The 2014 Work Programme [3] stressed that ENISA’s strategic priorities are designed to support Member  States’ efforts to meet EU policy objectives.  The Work Programme reflects the fact that ENISA obtained new  tasks to perform during 2014 following its new mandate and the Cybersecurity Strategy for the European  Union. In this context, ENISA identified three Work Streams that define its current core operational activities:   WS1: Support EU policy building;   WS2: Support capacity building;   WS3: Support cooperation.  Leading the way  22  Since not all work streams included CSIRT related tasks for ENISA, the desk review focused on work packages  2.1 and 3.3 as described below.  3.5.1.1 Work Package 2.1: Support Member States’ Capacity Building  Work Package 2.1 aimed at improving the operational activities of CSIRTs through the following:   Stock-taking of achievements, good practices and experience with a view to develop a road map;   Enhance training and exercise methodology to improve the competencies of trainers;   Produce good practice guides on training methodologies for CSIRTs derived from experiences in  delivering suitable CSIRT training;   Provide an update of the “baseline capabilities” definition and to draw conclusions for new training  materials. In addition, ENISA will deliver a new set of CSIRT exercise material with at least five new  scenarios covering the four main baseline capabilities competencies, including operational,  technical, mandate and cooperation competencies.  3.5.1.2 Work Package 3.3: Regular Cooperation among NIS Communities  Under the Work Package 3.3, ENISA implemented activities with the aim to:   Actively support or organise common trainings for different communities, such as CSIRTs and LEAs;   Engage with the European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), where appropriate, through formal and  informal cooperation channels;   Take stock of the response of other communities to cyber security challenges and establish how  they could inform the works of CSIRTs;   Facilitate the outreach to other bodies and /or communities, including taking stock of accepted  methods for trust building within and among communities;   Continue to collect good practice useful for CSIRTs and LEAs and to enhance ENISA exercise and  training materials.  This work package extended the scope of ENISA’s support to the communities dealing with NIS to non- operational communities, to enable communications between CSIRTs, law enforcement, financial and other  communities. Activities scheduled to implement these goals included ENISA to utilise the 9th ENISA CSIRT  workshop to prepare future work in the area of CSIRT training and CSIRT cooperation with LEAs in  collaboration with the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). ENISA also engaged in the formulation of a good  practice guide and/or training and exercise materials concerning the exchange and processing of actionable  information by CSIRTs, as well as in the drafting of good practice materials for first responders in cooperation  with the EC3. Moreover, as a part of this work package, ENISA prepared and published the reports  “Stocktaking of standards formats used in exchange of processing actionable information” [22], and  “Scalable and Accepted Methods for Trust Building in Operational Communities” [3].  3.5.2 ENISA Work Programme 2015  In 2015, the ENISA work streams were permanently replaced by strategic objectives, which in turn are  aligned with the ENISA Strategy document and the multi-annual planning (2015-2017) [23].  The ENISA strategic objectives for 2015 are as follows:  Leading the way  23   SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of expertise  of EU actors taking into account evolutions in Network  and Information Security (NIS);   SO2: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU;   SO3: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in developing and implementing the policies necessary  to meeting the legal and regulatory requirements of  Network and Information Security;   SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the  Member States and the EU and between related NIS  communities.  As was the case in previous years, CSIRT related tasks were not included in all strategic objectives, and  therefore our desk review focused on work packages 1.4, 2.1, 4.1 and 4.2 as described below.  3.5.2.1 Work package 1.4: Short- and mid-term sharing of information regarding issues in NIS  The objective of this works package is to allow the Agency to provide timely and qualitative responses to NIS  developments through the definition and implementation of a framework. As regards CSIRTs the aim is to  improve the information flows between the CERT EU, ENISA and the CSIRT community at large.  3.5.2.2 Work package 2.1 Assist in public sector capacity building  This work package aims to assist CSIRTs, and other operational communities, as appropriate to develop and  extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet challenges to secure their networks. By doing so, CSIRTs  and other operational communities will benefit from trainings and tailor-made capability enhancement  actions.  3.5.2.3 Work package 4.1 Support for EU cooperation initiatives amongst NIS-related communities in  the context of the EU Cyber Security Strategy (EU CSS)  The aim of this work package is to continue to build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals.  Specifically, the work package will exploit the good experiences of the Agency from its support to CSIRTs,  the CSIRT communities and Law Enforcement communities in order to identify mutually satisfactory ways to  collaborate. ENISA will develop and provide guidance leveraging best practice for cooperation between  stakeholder communities, including CSIRTs, the CIIP community, law enforcement and financial services, etc.  In the spirit of building communities through ‘learning by doing’, ENISA will continue its support of the  TRANSITS training in the area of CSIRTs.  ENISA’s support to the collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement communities, including close  collaboration with other institutions such as EC3 (Europol).  In this vein, the agreement between ENISA and  EC3 will be further developed to include a more operational and systematic flows of expertise, elaboration  of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best practice, enhancing capacity  building through training and awareness raising in order to safeguard network and information security at  the EU level. To this end, ENISA will stay engaged in the EC3 programme board.  “There is disconnection  between the  operational and  political levels, and  ENISA is good at trying  to fill this gap.”  Respondent from the European  institutions  Leading the way  24  3.5.2.4 Work package 4.2 European cyber crisis cooperation through exercises  The aim of this work package is to facilitate the planning of the upcoming pan-European Cyber Exercise in  2015-2016. To this end, ENISA will further develop its methodology, training outreach and technical  capability to organise large-scale cyber crisis exercises.  In practice, this translates into three following topics:   Pan-European cyber exercises management (Cyber Europe and EuropeSOPEx);   Enhance capacity to support and organise cyber exercises;   Promote, maintain and improve EU cyber crisis cooperation plans and procedures (i.e. EU SOPs),  including bringing close the cyber crisis cooperation community [23].  3.5.3 Respondent views  When asked to what extent the respondents agreed with the statement that ENISA has successfully  implemented the capacity building activities included in this study (i.e., CSIRT support and Cyber Crisis  Cooperation and Exercises related activities) set out in the Annual Work Programmes, in the past five years,  the respondents, in particular the National Liaison Officers indicated an overall agreement. This is further  confirmed by the online survey with 73% of the National Liaison Officers and European Institutions  respondents agreeing.  One EU official stated that while he did not have a detailed overview of the ENISA CSIRT support, he had  noted that “ENISA has established good cooperation at various levels with CSIRTs and at a personal level”,  during past ENISA Cyber Exercises which he had attended. “They speak the same language”, the official  continued. In this respect, it seems that ENISA has established cooperation on all levels. However, the  challenge is what happens at the top political level. In the event of a crisis, decisions need to be taken fast,  which requires a solid understand of the sector.  The EU official also noted that in the cyber domain “jargon is a killer”, which makes it harder for “non-techie”  staff to understand the issues. However, ENISA is perceived to be doing a good job in bridging the gap  between the operational and policy levels, given the Agency’s size and the fact that the bar is continuously  being raised.  3.6 Policy perspective - Summary table of ENISA impact  The following table summarises key ENISA capacity building activities of the European Union Policy of Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, Proposed NIS  Directive and ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015 and provides conclusions on how ENISA has  responded to them.  POLICY PROPOSED ENISA CSIRT RELATED ACTIVITIES  CONCLUSION  EU Policy of Critical  Information Infrastructure  Protection (CIIP)  The Commission has asked ENISA to:   Carry out pan-European exercises   Adopt a minimum set of baseline capabilities  and services and related policy  recommendations for (CSIRTs) to function  effectively.  ENISA has carried out Cyber Europe  Exercises in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and  will continue to do so in 2016.  ENISA has established various baseline  capabilities and services to CSIRTs  (capability materials, technical updates,  improved communication, enhanced  information sharing, etc.)  Leading the way  25  POLICY PROPOSED ENISA CSIRT RELATED ACTIVITIES  CONCLUSION  Cybersecurity Strategy of  the European Union  The Commission asks ENISA to:   Assist MS in developing cyber resilience  capabilities;   Examine the feasibility of ICS-CSIRTs;   Continue support-EU cyber incident exercises;  ENISA has continued to encourage  good practices in information and  network security to ensure its  assistance and support to Member  States in developing strong national  cyber resilience capabilities. ENISA has  done so by supporting and organising  pan-EU cyber incident exercises,  trainings and workshops, and by  building on expertise, cooperation and  support on security and resilience of  industrial control systems, transport  and energy infrastructure, etc.  Regarding the roadmap for a ‘NIS  driving licence,’ ENISA has started the  consultation process in order to involve  the relevant stakeholders and guide  the process in order to ensure quality  results.  Proposed NIS Directive3 The Commission would ask ENISA to:   Assist in the operation of the cooperation  network;   Provide MS and the EU with expertise and  advice;   Facilitate the exchange of best practices.  The Network and Information Security  Directive was proposed by the  Commission in 2013 and is currently in  the final stages of negotiations  between the European Parliament and  the Council.  ENISA Annual Work  Programme 2014 & 2015  The 2014 & 15 WP outlined the following ENISA  support to CSIRTs:   Support Member States’ Capacity Building   Regular Cooperation among NIS Communities   Short- and mid-term sharing of information  regarding issues in NIS   Assist in public sector capacity building   Support for EU cooperation initiatives amongst  NIS-related communities in the context of the EU  Cyber Security Strategy (EU CSS)   European cyber crisis cooperation through  exercises  ENISA supported the communities  dealing with NIS to non-operational  communities, enabling  communications between CSIRTs, LEAs,  financial and other communities.  Capacity building, trainings, workshops,  exercises and dissemination of good  practices. Facilitating cooperation and  coordination between public and  private stakeholders.  ENISA implemented the operational  security activities (i.e. CSIRT support  and Cyber Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises related activities) set out in  the Annual Work Programmes.  ENISA enhanced cooperation with LEAs  and the EC3.  3 At the time of writing, adoption of the NIS Directive is pending. However, no significant changes are expected to the proposed directive.  Leading the way  26  4 Overall Respondent views on ENISA CSIRT Support  The following chapter reflects the respondents’ awareness, appreciation and perceived weakness of the  ENISA CSIRT support. It is important to note that most of the views expressed by the respondents did not  deviate far from the ones of last year’s report covering the same parts.  4.1 Respondent awareness of related activities  A majority of the respondents are aware of ENISA’s activities in carrying out baseline capabilities, capacity  building, sharing of good practices and CSIRT trainings. When asked whether ENISA should take a more active  role in implementing baseline capabilities, a majority of the respondents agreed with the suggestion. One  respondent proposed that ENISA could further increase awareness about its tasks by taking a more  ‘marketing’ approach to widening its reach, as its  work is valuable, needed and more stakeholders  should be aware of it.  All of the respondents were aware of ENISA’s  website and mailing list and all had experience  with ENISA CSIRT trainings or relevant material.  Moreover, almost half of all the respondents had  recently attended an ENISA CSIRT-related event  (e.g. workshops, cyber exercises, trainings etc.).  Some respondents, predominately from the  European Institutions noticed the lack of ENISA  trainings for European Officials and remarked  that such trainings would be very beneficial for  them.  4.2 Respondent appreciation of related activities  The majority of respondents appreciate ENISAs CSIRT support. This is reflected by the fact that a large  majority of the National CSIRTs and Governmental CSIRTs, MS Bodies and Public and Private Stakeholder  respondents agree that ENISA’s CSIRT related support and  activities evolve in line with the needs and priorities of the CSIRT  community. “ENISA training materials  are very useful and we  use them often.”  Respondent for the Public/Private Sector  25%  12%  25%  38%  ENISA should take on a more  active role in implementing  the baseline capabilities  agree  disagree  neutral  strongly agree  Leading the way  27  Moreover, most respondents stated that they are satisfied with ENISA's role as a networker for the  community and believe that ENISA should continue working as a facilitator, coordinator and a trusted  introducer, disseminating good practices and  bringing CSIRTs and relevant stakeholders  together. There is also an incentive for ENISA to  further develop its methods and techniques for  identifying gaps and help to achieve stronger  cooperation. When asked about the usefulness of  ENISA’s CSIRT related events, respondents  were  in agreement that it they are useful.  Furthermore, as illustrated in the chart, a majority  of respondents agree and appreciate ENISA  contributing to enhancing and supporting national  crisis management capabilities.  Finally, the respondents acknowledge and appreciate that sufficient means and channels are available to the  CSIRT community in order to provide ENISA with feedback, suggestions and questions on its CSIRT related  activities.  4.3 Perceived weakness of related activities  The perceived weaknesses focused on the issues of costs, cooperation and crisis management. Some  Member State Bodies, National CSIRTs and Governmental CSIRTs stressed that the costs of traveling to ENISA  workshops often times exceed the budgets. However, as mentioned by a different respondent, ENISA  organises them in different places every year, with the help of a local host. In other words, travel expenses  could be reduced if a CSIRT hosted the workshop. Likewise, respondents shared that they would like to see  the topics and presentations at ENISA’s CSIRT related events to be more focused on practical, technical and  relevant areas for CSIRTs, such as exercising, and avoid wider policy topics.  In addition, according to respondents, the cooperation between the Operational Security Community and  the EU Institutions and its Agencies is still insufficient and needs to be further improved. They believe that  the reason for this relates to cultural differences among Member States. To illustrate, a respondent gave the  example that what is qualified as a cybersecurity incident in one country could be qualified as terrorism in  another.  Respondents also mentioned that CSIRTs focus on large-scale incidents and ENISA could support CSIRTs in  handling small incidents, because ‘not handling these small incidents, builds the ground for large scale  attacks.’ In addition, some respondents mentioned that ENISA could play a greater role in supporting CSIRT  connections with industry and the private sector to ensure good practises are more widespread outside of  the current National CSIRT environment. Respondents also mentioned that ENISA could support CSIRTs by  enhancing communication with non-EU countries and by establishing minimal security standards for  Member States on strategic and operational levels. It was also mentioned that even though it is not a part  of the ENISA mandate the Agency could enhance its communication with the defence sector.  In relation to CSIRTs crisis management some EU Officials stated that ENISA lacks staff and personnel to  properly support CSIRTs in a crisis.  50%  25%  17% 8%  ENISA has contributed to  enhancing national  cybersecurity crisis  management capabilities  agree  disagree  strongly agree  strongly disagree  Leading the way  28  5 Operational Perspective – Baseline Capabilities for CSIRTs  As for baseline capabilities, ENISA has identified four focus points for its  research and continuous work to support CSIRTs. These include  ‘mandate and strategy’, ‘service portfolio’, ‘operational capabilities’ and  ‘cooperation capabilities’. These baseline capabilities aim to tackle the  diversity of capabilities across Member States, which is seen by ENISA as  the main obstacle to cross-border cooperation and incident response.  5.1 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the  Agency’s work were brought forward and subsequently included in the  survey and interview questions.  5.1.1 Stronger ENISA Voice  To date, ENISA has primarily delivered paper reports, some of which may have lacked sufficiently  straightforward recommendations especially to the CSIRT community. This was done deliberately so as to  create community buy-in and in order to not be perceived as pushing ideas onto the national and  governmental CSIRTs that were in the process of developing and finding their own way.  Nevertheless, ENISA has built a stronger position over the years and should therefore take more of a stance  in the papers, studies and public statements that it produces. Instead of limiting papers to stock takings and  vague suggestions, it was agreed that ENISA should take a bolder stance and taking more risks in terms of  speaking its mind more proactively and directly.  5.1.2 Proactive Endorser  Similar to the prior point, it was pointed out that any kind of support or validation of an initiative, even in  the form of a simple endorsement, is important for professionals of the trade. While ENISA at times has  preferred to be on stand-by and to wait for requests from the community, it was agreed that the Agency  should become more proactive. One participant stated that ENISA should help improve the overall  international cooperation by engaging communities and act as a trusted partner that finds sponsors for  CSIRTs.  ENISA is able to support some initiatives within the framework of rules for such support. However, instead  of supporting initiatives in ‘stand-by mode’ waiting for requests to come, ENISA should be more proactive  and not wait for support requests to come. As an example, ENISA could recommend and push open source  code on GitHUB4.  4 GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source  code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. https://github.com/  “On organisational  and political level,  ENISA CERT  activities provide a  good level of  support”  Respondent from a Member  State Body  https://github.com/  Leading the way  29  5.1.3 From paper based studies to service oriented support  As one of the current challenges, support to CSIRTs to build up capabilities with limited resources available  at the Member State level was identified. This represents an opportunity for ENISA to take a more active  role in supporting the implementation of the baseline capabilities of CSIRTs, which would also be a means  to meet the increasing expectations of CSIRTs towards this kind of assistance. From the past experience with  the community, it is apparent that CSIRTs appreciate direct interaction and practical advice.  The shift from paper work to ad hoc support and more tangible advice  could be achieved by using a more interactive approach through, for  instance, ENISA going onsite upon request to perform a maturity  assessment of a CSIRT coupled with an overview of how the team is  situated in the community.  Initial requests of this kind have already been received by ENISA  (although formally it may fall under Article 14 ‘Requests to the Agency’5),  and as such requests are expected to increase in number. As  certifications of CSIRTs are on the rise (for instance by the TF-CSIRT  Trusted Introducer (TF-CSIRT/TI)6, which offers registration/listing,  accreditation and certification to European CSIRTs.7), ENISA is committed  to assisting the teams in reaching this status.  It was agreed that ENISA, in addition to its studies, should develop a  more service based approach vis-à-vis the CSIRTs, including offering  multiple products and services to the CSIRTs.  5.1.4 Two-speed approach to less and more mature CSIRTs  ENISA trainings constitute an important means for improving the baseline capabilities of CSIRTs. However,  as the level of maturity of CSIRTs are somewhat uneven, it was suggested that ENISA further tailor its  trainings putting, for instance, some of the training activities under the CyberEurope8 label (e.g.to offer  specific trainings that can improve the right skills which will be tested during the CE exercise). Supporting  CSIRTs and adapting to differences in maturity of new and less mature teams is seen as a success factor to  ENISA. This is an important factor in managing the expectations of CSIRTs.  5 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013, repealing Regulation (EC) No  460/2004.: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN  6 TF-CSIRT: The Trusted Introducer Service (TI) lists well known teams and accredits as well as certify teams according  to their demonstrated and checked level of maturity. https://www.trusted-introducer.org/  7 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/cert-community-recognition- mechanisms-and-schemes  8 Cyber Europe: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber- europe  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN https://www.trusted-introducer.org/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe  Leading the way  30  5.1.5 Materials for the CSIRT Community  In line with the findings of the 2014 Impact Assessment and Roadmap report, ENISA looks to produce  handbook type materials for the CSIRT community. The key suggestions include a “CSIRT tool book”, which  would focus on what is needed to run a CSIRT, and a playbook on how to deal with different types of  incidents.  5.1.6 Benchmarking of baseline capabilities  In view of ensuring a benchmark for the sector, one additional  suggestion was for ENISA to declare CSIRT teams as meeting, or even  exceeding, the ENISA recommended baseline capabilities. This could be  seen as a complement to, or as a first step for CSIRTs towards obtaining  the TF-CSIRT Trusted Introducer certification.  5.2 Respondent views  Most respondents, and in particular the national and governmental  CSIRTs were in favour of ENISA proactively endorsing or supporting  initiatives relevant to the CSIRTs and other operational security  communities. It was also suggested that if there are initiatives relating  to funding for CSIRTs, ENISA should play an active role in supporting the  CSIRTs in acquiring funds.  When asked whether ENISA should create a certified list of companies as trusted cybersecurity service  providers, the response was mixed. The main question brought forward was whether this type of activity  was best done at the EU or Member State level.  It was believed that if it was to be done by ENISA, some  convincing at the local level would be necessary, although it was clear that some Members States are not  sufficiently active in the field. On a positive note, it was seen as putting pressure on the market, which would  facilitate the identification of cybersecurity-trusted providers in a domain where many claim to be experts  without the actual expertise.  Some respondents expressed the need for ENISA to provide more activities and support for operational  baseline capabilities for CSIRTs. Most respondents agreed that ENISA has an important advisory role to play  but on the other hand, since ENISA has limited operational mandate, ENISA would not be in a position to  assess CSIRTs operational capabilities. Others mentioned that TF-CSIRT is already active in the accreditation  scheme and ENISA could assist them in developing it. One National Liaison Officers respondent stated that  a CSIRT Baseline Capabilities Assessment could be an additional focus area and activity to be further  considered by ENISA.  5.3 Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (based on the 2014 report & 2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS- PILLAR I: BASELINE CAPABILITIES FOR CSIRTS TIMELINE  Stronger ENISA voice   This action involves ENISA to take a clearer stance in its papers, studies and public statements,  towards proactively communicating opinions and recommendations.

In addition, the awareness and perception of Article 14 requests to the  Agency was examined following an increase in related workload for ENISA over the past years. In practice  requests include support information sharing projects driven by the CSIRT community, various trainings,  assistance in enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities and support to specific projects, for instance  honeypots.  6.1 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the Agency’s work were brought forward  and subsequently included in the survey and interview questions.  6.1.1 Information Exchange and Connector Role  The ENISA view is that the Agency should explore further possibilities to reinforce its role as information  exchange connector. While the expectations within the CSIRT community remain quite high, with varied  ideas of what could or should be achieved through information sharing. From the ENISA angle, the Agency  can serve by sharing information from to relevant stakeholders and by providing guidance on good practices.  Thanks to its unique position in the community, ENISA will continue to leverage this advantage to connect  community members as well as linking them with relevant players.  The Connecting Europe Facility Cyber Security Digital Service Infrastructure [24] (CEF Cyber Security DSI) is  defined in the CEF Annual Work Programme (WP) 2014 and 2015. The preparatory actions foreseen in the  CEF WP 2014 (European Commission, 2014b) are aimed at preparing the DSI as a mature DSI for the CEF WP  2015 (European Commission, 2014a) to establish and launch a core cooperation platform and mechanisms  that will enhance the EU capability for preparedness, cooperation and information exchange, coordination  and response to cyber threats. Such mechanisms will be used by Member States on a voluntary basis, to  strengthen capacity building and cooperation, in line with established governance structure and  requirements (European Commission, 2014c). ENISA already contributes to this initiative as member of the  Governance Board.  Leading the way  33  6.1.2 Sharing Good Practices among the Teams  ENISA discussed a tool for sharing good practices, which could also mix the features of a blog and a forum,  and be used as a social network for the CSIRT community. The existing cyber exercise platform (developed  by ENISA) was mentioned as a working example of an information  exchange platform, which could be used as a pilot version for exchange  between MS in case of crisis. This could be transformed into a platform  for dynamic day to day information exchange, as requested by some  member States. ENISA should explore the possibility of hosting an  informal social network for the operational security community.  6.1.3 Trainings and Train-the-Trainers  To date, trainings have been limited to CSIRT services in the context of  baseline capabilities. However, in terms of capacity building, the content  of trainings should shift from stand-alone topics to more modular topics  to create high value trainings for maturing teams. Therefore, in order to  better cater to different maturity levels of the teams, current CSIRT  trainings could be further enhanced in order to improve ‘training of the  trainers’ through for example online webinars. In parallel to trainings on  “this is how you train people”, the Agency would still offer the modular  subject matter trainings to support the development of baseline  capabilities. This was also seen as a way of better meeting the needs of  more mature CSIRTs.  6.1.4 Participant Evaluations  In an attempt to better meet the needs of CSIRTs of varied maturity levels, ENISA discussed the possibility  of adding assessments of the participants prior to the trainings and exercises. This would ensure a good fit  between the level of the participant and the level of difficulty of a training or exercise.  It would also be used  as a tool to test the new skills acquired at the end of a training session, and implicitly as a motivator for the  participants to stay attentive during the training. Furthermore, based on such assessments, ENISA could try  to identify the weak points in exercises (e.g. national and European), and propose the development of  additional trainings thereby continuing the training lifecycle.  6.2 Respondent views  The respondent views for ENISA capacity building, good practices, and CSIRT training complement the views  expressed in the internal ENISA workshop, with the expectation that no mention was made of participant  evaluations or the re-using of training materials.  Various respondents believe that ENISA should focus on information sharing by putting into place effective  mechanisms to cement their information sharing (threat intelligence, incidents, etc.) and connector role.  Respondents mentioned that this could be done through a secure communications platform and/or working  with Internet Service Providers. One Governmental CSIRT mentioned that ENISA should focus on establishing  additional information security exchanges in different sectors such as the healthcare or energy sector.  Moreover, respondents mentioned that at the moment, information is shared mainly via conference calls  which remains inefficient and that more face to face meetings would benefit the community as a whole.  Leading the way  34  The vast majority of respondents agree that ENISA has been successful  in disseminating good practices to relevant operational security  community. In addition, many respondents brought up the point that  these ENISA activities, security guidelines and procedures are used and  applied to their teams, stressing that ENISA is an ”influential player in the  development of international sharing of cyber information.\"  Furthermore, one non-EU CSIRT stated that ‘ENISA material is excellent  for the construction of the CSIRTs and has helped many times with  controversial moments.’  All respondents mentioned that more trainings should be provided to the  trainers of the CSIRT community, especially training for teams that are,  or will be, newly created. One respondent stated that ENISA should  organise a ”Senior Manager Workshop” to support CSIRT leaders to  effectively manage, train and provide leadership to their teams and the  greater CSIRT community. Moreover, a few respondents mentioned that  ENISA could bring those trainings to MSs in order to avoid costly travel.  To conclude, most respondents believe that ENISA should continue working as a facilitator, coordinator and  a trusted introducer, disseminating good practices and bringing people together while not enter into an  operational role.  6.3 - Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (based on the 2014 report & 2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS –PILLAR II: CAPACITY BUILDING, SHARING GOOD PRACTICES AND CSIRT TRAINING TIMELINE  Reinforced Information Exchange and Connector Role:   Improved information exchange (threat intelligence, incidents, etc.) and enhanced sharing of  good practices   Website – networking and community building  Short – medium  term  Continued support for mature CSIRTs   Regular updates of CSIRT capacity building material a clearer focus on “advanced team support”  for mature CSIRTs   Greater focus on technical updates, checklists, summaries  Medium – long  term  Clearer focus on operational vs strategic reports:   More technical reports for practitioners   Policy-related reports for decision makers  Short – medium  term  Trainings   Train the trainer   Module subject matter trainings.   Participant evaluations- pre/post trainings and & exercises  Medium – long  term  Leading the way  35  Re-use of training material as a step to streamline the services of the team following the  reorganisation  Awareness raising  Enhance the awareness and up-take of ENISA materials (capacity building) by advertising them more  widely, within the CSIRT community and other operational communities  Short – medium  term  Leading the way  36  7 Operational perspective - Support CSIRTs to better collaborate with  Law Enforcement Agencies  In 2010, ENISA started its support for operational collaboration between the CSIRTs and LEAs (law  enforcement agencies). Various activities have since been launched, including stock-takings of legal and  operational obstacles that prevent collaboration, advice resulting from that, workshops that brought  together members of both communities, consultation with members of both communities, etc.  7.1 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the Agency’s work were brought forward  and subsequently included in the survey and interview questions.  7.1.1 ENISA-EUROPOL collaboration  7.1.1.1 Workshops  Despite a slow start, the ENISA collaboration with European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol on organising workshops has  over time become an established practice9 10 11 and many  participants have expressed their interest to continue with these  kinds of workshops. The focus should be to make sure that CSIRTs,  in the first place, are equipped to interact with law enforcement  agencies. While LEA’s main objective is to collect evidence and  arrest perpetrators, they tend to be less interested in learning  new techniques. Nevertheless, in the context of botnet  takedowns, there are examples of direct communication between  EC3 and CSIRT teams, especially when cases are being investigated during CSIRT/LEA workshops. This is a  good example of an area where ENISA could solidify its role while continuously exploring together with EC3  additional needs of the CSIRTs and LEA community.  7.1.1.2  Good practice library for CSIRTs and LEA cooperation  In this vein, the current ENISA/EC3 current taxonomy project should be further elaborated. There should be  two focus points in relation to the taxonomy related work. Firstly, improved LEA-CSIRT cooperation in the  fight against cybercrime. Secondly, strategic cooperation with EC3 that would go beyond the current  ENISA/EC3 workshops and the “Report on information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs  and Law Enforcement” project.  9 4th ENISA/EC3 Workshop: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  10 8th CERT workshop - Part II (co-organised with EC3): https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert- workshop-part-ii  11 9th CERT ENISA/EC3 Workshop Part II: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/9th-cert-workshop- part-ii  “ENISA should bridge the  gap between CERTs and  Law Enforcement by  further collaborating with  the European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3) at Europol and  Eurojust.”  Respondent for the public sector  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/9th-cert-workshop-part-ii https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/9th-cert-workshop-part-ii  Leading the way  37  7.1.1.3 Digital Forensics  Law enforcement agencies are by nature typically restrictive in the exchange of evidence. Nevertheless, in  order to solve cases, players from different countries should be involved, which opens a door for ENISA to  assist in the process related to digital forensics. For instance, ENISA could  further approach the operational  level of LEAs in order to develop training scenarios where it would be able to bring its expertise on subjects  such as how to exchange information securely using Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP) or how to take forensics samples from a procedural point of view.  7.1.1.4 ENISA as Europol observer  Even though fighting cybercrime is not its mandate, many communities  look to ENISA for guidance. Therefore, ENISA could work more closely  with EC3 on operational activities, for example, as an observer Through  an observer status,  ENISA could gain knowledge, for instance on how  handle botnets, while bringing technical expertise to the EC3, which  would ensure a mutually beneficial collaboration between the two  Agencies.  7.1.2 LEA – CSIRT collaboration activities  7.1.2.1 CEPOL – trainings/networking  Whilst ENISA has organised joint LEA/CSIRT trainings12 13, it should also  look into the possibility of collaborating with the European Police  College14 (CEPOL).  There is added value of bringing CSIRT expertise into the law enforcement community as  police and CSIRTs are interested in similar topics, such as taking down botnets, handling incidents, etc.  In  many cases LEAs outsource technical work to CSIRTs providing a clear link between the organisations, which  can be built upon.  Another idea in this area is for ENISA to engage prosecutors or at least raise their awareness about activities  in the CSIRT world. Similarly, awareness about prosecution phases should be raised for CSIRTs. However, for  the latter case ENISA is less qualified as it has limited knowledge on how the police operates.  7.1.2.2 Guidance to CSIRTs on H2020 funding  Another topic that was discussed is the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation15, also  known as “Horizon 2020”. A participant mentioned that there are calls about joint collaboration between  CSIRTs and LEAs that promote joint exercise to simulate cooperation. Here, ENISA could encourage CSIRTs  12 Cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies - Advising in Cyber Crime Cases:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#writing-security- advisories  13 Cooperation in the Area of Cybercrime: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training- resources/legal-cooperation#cooperation-in-the-area-of-cybercrime  14 The European Police College (CEPOL) is an EU agency dedicated to providing training and learning opportunities to  senior police officers on issues vital to the security of the European Union and its citizens:  https://www.cepol.europa.eu/  15 The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation: https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#writing-security-advisories https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#writing-security-advisories https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#cooperation-in-the-area-of-cybercrime https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#cooperation-in-the-area-of-cybercrime https://www.cepol.europa.eu/ https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/  Leading the way  38  or LEAs to participate in calls to get funding through grants by coaching and providing guidance. In fact, it  seems many CSIRTs and LEAs want to participate in such calls but have no idea what the Commission might  be looking for.  7.2 Respondent views  When asked whether cooperation between ENISA and EC3 should go beyond the current ENISA/EC3  workshops and if both organisations should be more involved at the level of operational cooperation, the  response was mixed. For some respondents it seemed obvious that ENISA should bridge the gap between  CSIRTs and law enforcement by further collaborating with the EC3 and even with Eurojust. Others disagreed,  claiming that ENISA should stick to technical aspects and not go into, for instance, forensics as this topic  could be too politically touchy.  One respondent from a law enforcement agency summed up the current situation and needs in the following  way: ‘Not only is cybercrime borderless, it also moves seamlessly from one sector to another’. Nobody wins  if they try to solve the issues on their own without sharing information on what is going on. However,  information sharing requires trust as a lot is at stake. For instance, a bank runs a huge reputational risk if its  clients learn about cyber-attacks affecting their bank accounts, and hence will be reluctant to share  information about security issues. However, ‘by not sharing information, you cannot learn from others’, as  one respondent stated. By teaming up in public-private partnerships (PPP), for instance, banks and financial  institutions in partnership with law enforcement, trust can be built and information shared which benefit all  parties. In this context, ENISA could develop a framework on how information can be shared, what  information can be shared (overcoming national privacy laws) and with whom. By doing this, ENISA would  raise its profile among LEAs and make a valuable contribution. The idea of  ENISA expanding its scope and developing PPPs (academia, National and  Governmental CSIRTs, Eurojust and registry services, etc.) was echoed by  another respondent.  Some additional concrete examples of possible trainings included to  mainstream the topic of cybercrime in the general curricula. The  respondent claimed that a lot of cooperation stays at a high (abstract) level  of organisations when it actually needs to focus on the operational levels.  By this, the respondent meant that trainings needs to reach further than  just a few specialists, otherwise, the gaps in skills set will be too wide within  organisations. Very often, only one person from each organisation is sent  to a training, when in reality, the awareness needs to be broader, including  all levels of the organisation from the local police officers to the specialised  units. More workshops and trainings on forensics would be good as well as  training of colleagues on the police force about the dark net and how it is  used by criminals for information sharing. Respondents were in favour of  ENISA collaborating with CEPOL to organise joint LEA/CSIRT trainings.  A majority of the respondents were positive to the idea of ENISA supporting (through coordination and  guidance) CSIRTs/operational security communities on how to participate in Horizon 2020 calls to obtain  additional funding. One National CSIRT affirmed that ENISA could support initiatives relating to funding for  CSIRTs. Another respondent stated that often there are situations were different teams are working on the  Leading the way  39  same solutions and sometimes common projects with small funding can make a big difference. ENISA could  assist different teams from different countries to work together, using joint resources instead of each CSIRT  going for it alone.  7.3 Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (based on 2014 report & 2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS –PILLAR III: CSIRT SUPPORT CSIRTS TO BETTER COLLABORATE WITH LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES  TIMELINE  ENISA – EUROPOL collaboration   Joint workshops   ENISA observer status and knowledge transfer  Short – medium term  Good practice library for CSIRTs and LEAs   Taxonomy report   Fight against cybercrime  Short – medium term  Facilitate more joint CSIRT-LEA events and training   Mainstream the topic of cybercrime in the general curricula   Additional workshops and trainings on forensics and the dark net  Short – medium term  Digital forensics – knowledge sharing Short – medium term  Enhanced support to the fight against cybercrime   ENISA to explore possibility of LEAs to enter into public-private partnerships (PPP)   ENISA could develop an information sharing framework  Short – long term  LEA-CSIRT collaboration activities   CEPOL trainings/networking   Guidance to CSIRTs on H2020 funding  Short – medium term  Awareness raising  Enhance the awareness and up-take of ENISA materials (CSIRT-LEA) by advertising them more  widely, within the CSIRT community / other operational communities & LEAs  Short – medium term  Leading the way  40  8 Operational perspective Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises  ENISA has been a facilitator for EU Member States by supporting the exchange of good practices in the area  of Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises through a series of pan-European cyber exercises such as Cyber  Europe and Cyber Atlantic. In addition, ENISA published a ‘Good Practice Guide on National Exercises’ with  the aim to assist European stakeholders to design, plan, execute and monitor  a national exercise on the resilience of public communication networks.  Finally, ENISA is organising annual international conferences covering topics  in the area of cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  8.1 Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management  ENISA’s work package for 2015 focuses on cyber crisis cooperation and  management in the following topics:   Pan-European cyber exercises management (Cyber Europe and  EuroSOPEx);   Enhance the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises;   Promote maintain and improve EU cyber crisis cooperation plans  and procedures (e.g., EU SOPs), which includes bringing closer the  cyber crisis cooperation community.  This work package focuses on ENISA further enhancing its methodology, training outreach and technical  capability to organise large-scale cyber crisis exercises in addition to seeking to facilitate the planning of the  next pan European Cyber Exercise in 2015-2016.  8.2 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the Agency’s work were brought forward  and subsequently included in the survey and interview questions.  8.2.1 Cyber Crisis Management and Contingency Planning  ENISA has developed a good practice guide on national risk assessment and offers regular trainings on the  topic. Additionally, ENISA has led a study on cybersecurity crisis  management and is currently leading a study on general crisis  management. ENISA should be able to offer a training on the  latter by 2016.  8.2.2 EU-Level NIS Cooperation (EU-SOPs)  The EU-SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) give guidance on  how to manage major cyber incidents that would escalate to a  crisis. ENISA has been and will remain heavily involved in the  development of the EU-SOPs.  As the EU-SOPs will evolve in the context of the NIS Directive, potential cooperation between the teams  within ENISA can be sought. First, it was identified in Cyber Europe 2014 that the EU-SOPs should include  “ENISA should have a  key role in preparedness  measures for cyber crisis  management.”  One National Liaison Officer  respondent  Leading the way  41  procedures for technical cooperation for incident handling (currently it contains only operational  cooperation procedures for crisis management.  Second, a Commission initiative under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) cybersecurity pillar currently  looks at the possibility of building on existing tools and capabilities, for further developing of a common  platform for Member States to cooperate during cybersecurity incidents, crises and to exchange relevant  information on a trust basis. ENISA’s experience in fostering cooperation during simulated cyber crises will  be valuable for this CEF initiative promoted by the Commission. In this context, ENISA should play a relevant  role.  8.3 Cyber Exercises  8.3.1 Pan European Cyber Exercises (Cyber Europe series)  ENISA will continue organising the Cyber Europe series every two  years while developing new exercising opportunities on a more  regular basis. Synergies within ENISA can be sought with regards  to exercises and trainings: future technical exercises should  reference related trainings offered by ENISA and vice versa.  8.3.2 Supporting other Cyber Exercises  ENISA has developed a Cyber Exercise Platform to support the  planning and execution of Cyber Europe exercises. This platform will be opened in 2016 to Member States  so that they can use it to plan and execute their own exercises.  8.4 Respondent views  One EU Official stated that ENISA is trying its best given the size of the organisation and considering that the  bar is getting raised by the digital Commissioners. On the subject of cyber crises management, the same  respondent argued that in a moment of crisis cooperation is key and it allows for things to be accomplished  faster. Unfortunately, CSIRTs have a limited view on what is going on beyond their own field and there is a  disconnection between the local (MS) and central (EU) levels. They know their national competence, like in  the case of the Icelandic volcano eruption where Eurocontrol [25] played a crucial role as a pan-European  player. Still EU MSs do not act and it seems that a cyber-crisis is needed for them to take action on crisis  coordination. What is needed is an EU-level framework for crisis management within the cyber sector.  Respondents from various stakeholder groups agreed that the Cyber Europe exercises help develop practical  cooperation between different stakeholders during cross-border incidents. As one CSIRT respondent put it:  ‘They help foster trust building and building of relations’. The relationship building extended, in some cases,  beyond the stakeholders of the national or governmental CSIRT, and allowed for further development of  practical cooperation in-country.  The ENISA cyber exercises, including the Cyber Europe series, were also considered to help the operational  security community, including CSIRTs, to identify gaps and help towards stronger cooperation in Europe.  However, while respondents from most stakeholder groups agreed to this statement, one respondent  pointed out that ‘when it comes to gaps, on paper, the official procedures for contacting CSIRTs is good but  Leading the way  42  in reality you contact those you know. Thus, gaps in developing personal relations still exist. Nonetheless,  having the official contacts is important and used as a fall-back  mechanism’.  Respondents saw the ENISA cyber exercise material as relevant and  useful to operational security professionals, in particular from the  Member State bodies, especially the SOPs. However, as one  respondent pointed out, if a crisis occurs, not all Member States were  likely to follow the SOPs as these are not mandatory and ENISA has  to rely on the good will of the Member States. Therefore, the use of  the procedures should be made, if possible, mandatory.  Feedback on the ENISA Cyber Europe exercises can be summarised in  the following themes:   Content: Both respondents from the national and governmental CSIRT community and EU official  stated that the Cyber Europe Exercises could be more technical in their nature. This may include  more advanced technical challenges (i.e. test effect of APTs to organisations (detection, reaction,  prevention) and more collaboration on the crisis management level. In addition to having more  topics on privacy and cloud computing and more international industry generic and specific  exercises, including red teaming and  force on force. One of the respondents  went as far as to say that while the  Cyber Exercises do satisfy the political  agenda in Europe and show that things  are being done in the cyber domain, it  would serve more purpose to steer  away from the politics and go deeper  into the technical, practical and realistic  aspects of the cyber world. The current  scenarios presented by ENISA were  perceived as highly tailored to the  political level and while they are well- prepared they should focus more on  technical aspects. The same respondent  stressed that the NATO exercises, although a bit too ‘military’, were good examples of great  exercises as they are more practical and realistic.   Frequency: For some respondents, it was also preferable to increase the frequency of the Cyber  Europe Exercises from every second year to twice a year, even though this would make it harder for  the participants to find funding for, it would be more beneficial.   Scope: It was seen as a positive development that the Cyber Europe Exercises are extending their  reach to include the private sector. CSIRTs were believed to benefit from engaging more with the  private sector since, for the most part, if/when something happens it happens in the private sector,  and in many cases the private sector holds more critical resources and information.  36%  5% 7%  25%  27%  ENISA cyber exercises help the  Operational security community to  identify gaps and help towards stronger  cooperation in Europe  agree  disagree  n/a  neutral  strongly agree  “The Cyber Europe series is  very useful and important  as it helps to fill the gaps  and study new technical  challenges.”  Respondent from a Member State body  Leading the way  43   Geography: With regards to the issue involving the growing size of participants in Cyber Europe  exercises, regional exercises could be considered, according to a respondent from a national CSIRT.  For example, a Baltic Nordic Regional exercise or grouping could be used as a test case. The idea of  regional grouping was also brought forward by an EU official who claimed that the Cyber Exercises  would be better suited to tailor to a smaller audience based more on regional boundaries. The  reason for this, according to the respondent, was that in a real cyber crisis, the situation looks a lot  different. Entities handle incidents locally and regionally and very rarely on such as scale as the  ENISA Cyber Exercises.   Results: One respondent pointed out that following an exercise, the outcomes disseminated by  ENISA were very generalised and politically correct, when, in reality,  the participants were keen on learning the exact outcomes on how  specific teams/individuals performed, for instance in a possible  comparison or ranking scheme. This was echoed by an EU official  interested in raising awareness at the political level who suggested  that the feedback received from the exercises could be better  disseminated and spread to persons who were more difficult to  reach, or individuals, entities that did not participate in the exercises.   Improved means of information sharing was stressed by several  stakeholders who urged ENISA to also disseminate the feedback  from the exercises to people who were not able to attend. ENISA was  also requested to put in place effective mechanisms for information  sharing and not limit it to conference calls.  When asked about additional CSIRT focused areas and activities to be covered during Cyber Europe  exercises, the respondents provided several suggestions, including:   Increased technical focus: More on data protection, on social media and about Internet  infrastructure and Cyber Supply Chain. More on developing European Cyber capabilities, such as a  European search engine, and on cultivating European cyber independence in the face of firmware,  hardware or computers are made in China and the US – not Europe.   Including the political level: One respondent stressed the importance of linking cyber to the EU  political level by building on the cyber scenario. This would allow the ministries and politicians to  understand the cyber domain better and, conversely, the technical experts would better  understand the political level  8.5 Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS- PILLAR IV: CYBER CRISIS COOPERATION AND EXERCISES TIMELINE  EU-level Cyber Crisis Cooperation   Cyber crisis training with a pan-European focus   Elaboration of EU-level SOP   Involvement in the development of a MS platform for cooperation during cybersecurity incidents  Short – long  term  Cyber Exercises  Short – long  term  Leading the way  44   Continued implementation of Cyber Europe series (bi-annual): sharper technical focus and regional  groups.

However, much of the feedback was not directly linked to the  ENISA four activity pillars focused on CSIRTs. Hence, this chapter starts off by capturing a number of  respondent views to provide a 360° understanding of the possible future direction of ENISA.  9.1.1 Expanded constituency  Overall, the respondent views and findings concur with the findings of the 2014 report. ENISA is still  considered to be the representative voice of the European CSIRT community and of other operational  communities. Several respondents even pointed to the possibility for ENISA to expand its constituency  (working increasingly with CSIRTs in various sectors) and coverage beyond the borders of the EU. For  instance, there was a call for ENISA to enhance communication with non-EU countries and to establish  minimal security standards for Member States on strategic and operational levels.  9.1.2 European cyber independence  Echoing the words of Commissioner Oettinger, one respondent called for a stronger mandate that would  allow ENISA to drive the EU’s technological independence. ENISA has a real possibility of becoming  instrumental in the EU’s ambition to regain ‘digital sovereignty” and to reassert its digital independence.  This new branch of strategic activities would examine the ‘bigger picture’, including industrial politics, and  provide input in the form of strategic studies and workshops.  As an extension of this reasoning it was suggested, that ENISA should focus more on cybersecurity aspects  of industry, social networks and data protection related issues. This could include and in-depth look into the  actual cyber threats and impacts related to industry, as well as social networks.  9.2 Discussion on key findings  9.2.1 Facilitator and connector role  The respondents attest to a strong support of ENISA’s role as the facilitator and coordinator of the CSIRT  community, as well as a middle ground mediator between the CSIRTs and the Commission. ENISA bridges  the gap between the technical focus of the CSIRTs and the policy focus of the Commission.  ENISA should also strengthen the ties between the CSIRTs and LEAs through further collaborating with the  European Cybercrime Centre at Europol, Eurojust and CEPOL.  In addition, ENISA should expand its reach and scope and develop private-public partnerships (academia,  other non-governmental CSIRTs, and registry services).  Leading the way  46  9.2.2 Focus and develop further exercises and workshops  ENISA has a key role in supporting the CSIRT and other operational communities through its pertinent and  state of the art workshops and exercises. With regards to Cyber Europe exercises, we received different  suggestions such as focusing the exercises more on crisis management. These include more advanced  technical challenges to the exercises, and to accommodate the growing size of participants by grouping them  regionally, while also inviting participations from the private sector. A point for improvement is the  information sharing following an exercise in order for the individual teams and participants to be able to  compare levels of expertise, results, etc.  9.2.3 Putting new topics on the agenda  Being uniquely positioned in the cybersecurity landscape, the CSIRT community welcomes the Agency to  make use of its experience and to push the envelope by being bolder and taking a clearer stance on in its  publications and to proactively reaching out and endorsing initiatives when identifying them. While the  materials pertaining to the baseline capabilities (pillar I) and capacity building (pillar II) remain vital  contributions to the community, there is also scope for a sharper technical focus of the ENISA reports, on  the one hand and more policy oriented reports on the other.  It was also suggested that ENISA uses its unique position to bring ‘new’ topics and trends or important  developments in the sector forward. For instance, ENISA could engage in discussions on topics such as  network neutrality, acceptable traffic management and security, including levels of incident protection  allowed. This could be done through short ‘viewpoints’ or white papers, which can be produced within a  short time frame, requiring less effort than the typical ENISA studies.  ENISA should find multipliers to ensure that the important work done by its teams reaches even further,  beyond the established communities. Repeatedly the “modest” size and strongly limited budget of the  Agency was highlighted as biggest obstacle for the agency to perform up to all expectations.  Leading the way  47  9.3 The Way Ahead: roadmap for ENISA CSIRT Support  The proposed high-level roadmap 2020 presented below provides an overview of possible areas of priority on the basis of previous chapters.

In parallel, an  evolving cyber threat landscape shows a sharp increase and levels of sophistication of cyber incidents and  attacks. Against this backdrop, the relevance of ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security) and its role in networking and trust building, as well as capacity building to achieve high and  effective levels of network and information security in the European CSIRT community, stands out.  Undoubtedly, ENISA’s support to achieve high and effective levels of network and information security  within the European CSIRT community will remain an important cornerstone in the years to come. ENISA is  uniquely positioned to spot the gaps and the needs of the community, and to lead the way towards sustained  levels of cyber-security.  This report represents the update of an impact assessment performed by Deloitte of ENISA’s capacity  building activities for CSIRTs in 2014. This updated assessment serves as a basis for a proposed roadmap to  2020.  The impact of the ENISA support to the CSIRT community was assessed from a dual perspective - legislative  and regulatory, as well as operational, with the key objectives to:   Update the policy analysis;   Gather additional input from practitioners, including specific input on the new duties;   Together with ENISA, propose concrete projects or actions towards the roadmap implementation.  The legislative and regulatory perspective covers the objectives formulated in the ENISA regulation, the 2014  and 2015 ENISA Work Programmes, the Digital Agenda for Europe, the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the  proposed NIS Directive, as well as the EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP).  The operational perspective includes an assessment of the impact of ENISA’s CSIRT support looking at four  activity pillars:   Baseline Capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building in sharing good practice and CSIRTs training;   Supporting the CSIRTs in better collaboration with law enforcement agencies (LEAs);   Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  The study was conducted using a multi-dimensional approach including document reviews, online surveys,  one-to-one interviews and an internal ENISA workshop with input from key CSIRT experts.  The intended target audience for this study is for all interested in ENISA, yet primarily policy-makers,  managerial staff, and senior experts in CSIRTs and other competent authorities in the EU Member States as  well as senior EU level officials involved in activities supporting the work of CSIRTs across Europe.  The main results from the report have been included in a roadmap to 2020, including suggestions on  concrete actions for ENISA’s future CSIRT support.  Leading the way  07  The key findings can be summarised in the following points:   Legislative and regulatory perspective: Based on the EU policies and strategy documents reviewed,  it is evident that ENISA’s role and impact in this domain is recognised and clearly reflected through  the ever-increasing scope and authority extended over time to the Agency. For instance, the NIS  Directive (final adoption pending) is expected to bring about important changes to the ENISA  mandate.   Operational perspective: Overall, the respondent views and findings concur with the findings of the  2014 report. ENISA is still considered to be the representative voice of the European CSIRT  community and of other operational communities. Being uniquely positioned in the cybersecurity  landscape, the CSIRT community welcomes the Agency to make use of its experience and to push  the envelope by being bolder and taking a clearer stance in its publications, and proactively reaching  out and endorsing initiatives when identifying them.   As highlighted in the 2014 report, there is a need for ENISA to accommodate a ‘two-speed’ structure  of CSIRTs, support less and more mature teams respectively. This is the case for the material the  Agency produces, as well as for the trainings it organises. While the material pertaining to the  baseline capabilities (activity pillar I) and capacity building (activity pillar II) remains vital  contributions to the community, there is also a scope for the sharper technical focus of the ENISA  reports, on the one hand and more policy oriented reports on the other.   The awareness of ENISA’s CSIRT support actions is high within the CSIRT community and overall  there was a positive view of ENISA’s CSIRT related work. There is still a strong support of ENISA’s  role as the facilitator and coordinator of the CSIRT community, serving as a middle ground mediator  between the CSIRTs and the European Commission. ENISA bridges the gap between the technical  focus of the CSIRTs and the political focus of the Commission. ENISA should also strengthen the ties  between the CSIRTs and LEAs through further collaborating with the European Cybercrime Centre  at Europol, Eurojust and CEPOL.   The Cyber Europe exercises are appreciated by the CSIRT community. Suggestions for  improvements include more advanced technical challenges to the exercises, and to manage the  growing size of participants by grouping them regionally, while also inviting participations from the  private. An increase in exercises focusing on more on crisis management is also welcomed.   360° Feedback: Echoing the words of Commissioner Oettinger, ENISA was requested to explore a  stronger mandate that would allow the Agency to drive the EU’s technological independence. ENISA  could play an instrumental role in the EU’s ambition to regain ‘digital sovereignty” and to reassert  its digital independence. This new branch of strategic activities would examine the ‘bigger picture’,  including industrial politics, and provide input in the form of strategic studies and workshops.  Several respondents even pointed to the possibility for ENISA to expand its constituency (working  increasingly with CSIRTs in various sectors) and coverage beyond the borders of the EU. For instance,  there was a call for ENISA to enhance communication with non-EU countries and to establish  minimal security standards for Member States on strategic and operational levels.  Leading the way  08  1 Introduction  ENISA strives to continuously improve the quality of its deliverables and their relevance for its stakeholders.  The Agency has thus partnered with Deloitte to perform an impact Assessment of its work in the CSIRT area,  and propose a roadmap for its future activities.  CSIRTs and operational communities are an essential target for capacity building, because they are in the  field and address actual incidents. ENISA’s activities that focus on this target group can have real world  impact, through guidance with good practices as well as exercises that develop Member States develop crisis  management capabilities. This report represents the outcome of a desk review, stakeholder survey, in-depth  interviews, as well as an internal workshop conducted in Athens in April 2015 as a part of the evidence  gathering for the project \"Update of Impact Assessment and Roadmap\".  1.1 State of Play – 2014 Impact Assessment  The background of the project is the 2014 “Impact Assessment & Roadmap” [1] performed by Deloitte with  ENISA’s support to Computer Security Incident Response Team for the period 2005 to 2014. The impact  assessment has served as a basis for a proposed roadmap to 2020.  The key objectives of the study were to:   Identify ENISA achievements in relation to European CSIRTs in light of relevant policy documents;   Analyse the impact of these achievements and other operational communities;   Provide a roadmap for the period leading up to 2020 based on the results of the impact analysis.  The study team assessed the impact of the ENISA support to the CSIRT community from a legislative and  regulatory perspective on the one hand, and an operational perspective on the other.  The legislative and regulatory perspectives cover the objectives formulated in the ENISA Regulation [2], the  2013 [3] and 2014 [4] ENISA Work Programmes, and specific elements of other relevant acts, such as the  Digital Agenda for Europe [5], the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union [6] and the proposed NIS  Directive [7].  The operational perspective included an assessment looking at three activity pillars:   Baseline Capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building in sharing good practice and CSIRT training;   Supporting the CSIRTs in better collaboration with law enforcement agencies.  With the ongoing \"Update of Impact Assessment and Roadmap\" project ENISA aims to carry out a follow-up  on the 2014 “Impact Assessment and Roadmap” on its impact in the area of support for CSIRTs.  The 2014 roadmap, which was validated by a group of CSIRT experts, is summarised below:  Legislative and regulatory perspective: Based on the EU policies and strategy documents reviewed, it is  evident that ENISA’s role and impact in this domain is recognised and clearly reflected through the ever-  Leading the way  09  increasing scope and authority extended over time to the Agency. In the coming years, ENISA may act as a  representative voice for CSIRTs in the European policy context.  Operational perspective: The awareness of ENISA’s CSIRT support actions is high among the CSIRT  stakeholders and overall there was a positive view of ENISA’s CSIRT related work. However, awareness was  higher among representatives of national and governmental CSIRTs than among other CSIRT communities  (i.e. in the private, financial sector, etc.). As for the ENISA trainings, there was an expressed need to keep  the baseline capabilities more separate from the capacity building activities as the former should cater to  the needs of CSIRT teams of varied levels of maturity. Suggestions for future actions include a clear  separation between supports to “new teams” vs. “advanced teams”. This is linked to the request for greater  clarity of the required level of prior knowledge needed to participate in different trainings. Regarding ENISA  reports, there is a need for more technical topics on the one hand for the practitioners, and more policy- related reports on the other hand, serving to make the case of the ENISA raison d’être to policy and decision- makers. It was also suggested that ENISA should pick up topics and current trends/threats from the EU  Member States and research them in-depth, as well as having them  translated into several languages.  360° Feedback: Key points raised stressed that ENISA is the main CSIRT  community connector and facilitator, within and beyond the traditional  CSIRT stakeholder groups. ENISA’s credibility as the voice of European  CSIRTs within the EU and internationally was undisputed. Improved  channels of information was another key point, requesting ENISA to better  disseminate information via its website, related to both its activities, but also  to alert the CSIRT community and other operational communities on current  attacks and incidents. ENISA is also called upon to lead the work on  compiling information on incidents and threats in a catalogue along with  recommendations on how to handle them. The 360° feedback also included  a call for greater harmonisation and common standards among CSIRTs under  the lead and guidance of ENISA.  1.2 Study Purpose and Objectives  Although the 2014 report contributed with a wide array of stakeholder views on the ENISA CSIRT support, it  was slightly impacted by a limited response rate to the survey and the project did not allow for much internal  discussion on how to implement it. As a result, the proposals in the roadmap were primarily high-level  recommendations. In addition, since the publication of the 2014 report, the responsibilities and resources  of the ENISA “Operational Security” Unit have expanded to include cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  These were out of scope in the first study.  Therefore, the objectives of the “Update of Impact Assessment and Roadmap” are to:   Update the analysis of relevant policy documents from regulation and from operational  perspective;   Gather additional input from practitioners, including specific input on the new duties;   Together with ENISA, propose concrete projects or actions towards the roadmap implementation.  Leading the way  10  The main difference from the 2014 report is that the operational perspective of the update project includes  a fourth pillar:   Baseline capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building sharing good practice and CSIRT training;   Support CSIRTs to better collaborate with law enforcement agencies;   Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  In terms of the legislative and regulatory perspective it focuses on the objectives formulated in the ENISA  Regulation, the 2015 Work Programme, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union (and roadmap)  and the proposed NIS Directive.  1.3 Policy Perspective  This chapter presents an overview of the results of the desk review, which was undertaken focusing on key  strategic documents outlining the EUs policies influencing the domain, as well as the main official documents  laying down ENISA’s mandate and tasks related to support to CSIRTs. Additionally, views of respondents of  both the interviews and surveys with regard to the policy and regulation perspective of ENISA’s support  activities have been incorporated where applicable. The information gathered has been grouped according  to the following structure:   ENISA Regulation;   EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP);   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union;   Proposed NIS Directive;   ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015.  1.4 Operational Perspective  For the purpose of this document, the operational perspective of this study focuses on the following four  pillars for capacity building:   Baseline capabilities for CSIRTs;   Capacity building sharing good practice and CSIRT training;   Support CSIRTs to better collaborate with Law Enforcement;   Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  The four pillars are treated in separate chapters in which we present the key points and suggestions that  came out of the internal ENISA workshop, along with some of the feedback gathered from the respondents  (surveys and interviews), on their views on these possible future activities of ENISA in the area of support to  CSIRTs. We conclude each chapter with a draft roadmap to 2020 per pillar for the reader to have an overview  of the suggested activities.  1.5 Target Audience  This study seeks to inform ENISA’s stakeholders in a decision maker’s role regarding its support activities  until 2020 for CSIRTs and other operational activities. In addition, this study is intended to inform wider  policy debates about how to make ENISA an even more valuable partner for national and governmental  Leading the way  11  CSIRTs and other relevant stakeholders in Europe and beyond, as well as to inform those CSIRTs and  stakeholders about ways in which ENISA could support their work in the future. The study is also targeted at  policy-makers, managerial staff, and senior experts in national and governmental CSIRTs and other  competent authorities in the European Union Member States as well as senior EU level officials involved in  activities supporting the work of CSIRTs across Europe.  1.6 Structure of this Report  The study consists of the following chapters. The introduction is followed by chapter 2, which outlines the  study’s qualitative methodological approach that combines a review of documents with online surveys and  interviews with key experts in the field.  Chapter 3 puts into context the policy perspectives which were  taken into consideration for this study. This includes the European Union Policy on Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, the proposed NIS  Directive and ENISA’s Annual Work Programmes for 2014 and 2015, while also presenting the responses of  various stakeholders to the former. Chapter 4 illustrates the overall respondent views on the ENISA CSIRT  support. These views have been grouped into three overarching themes focusing on their awareness,  appreciation and perceived weakness of the related activites. The following four chapters, 5 to 8, concern  themsleves with the operational perspective of this study reflecting the responsibilities and resources of  ENISA related to its four operational pillars. These four chapters follow a similar structure, which starts off  by describing ENISA’s perspective on the road ahead, followed by the respondents views and concluding  with a high-level roadmap to 2020. The final chapter 9, discusses the findings of the study and proposes a  complete  roadmap to 2020 for the four pillars.  Leading the way  12  2 Methodology  This study is supported by a desk review of the key legal and policy documents, interviews with key experts  and online surveys with stakeholders from the CSIRT community and other operational communities. In the  following chapters we present how the information collection for this study was undertaken.  2.1 Definitions  The purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview of what is understood, within the  framework of this study, by “deliverables”, “activities” and “CSIRT community support”:  THEME  DESCRITPTION  Deliverables  Reports and studies   Training guides and exercises   Awareness materials  Activities   Trainings   Support to the set-up of CSIRTs   Workshops   Technical part of Cyber Crisis Cooperation exercises  CSIRT community support   Participation in conferences and events (incl. as speaker)   Meeting facilitations (between CSIRTs and other actors)   Liaising, co-operation and information exchange initiatives   Provide advice  In order to further facilitate for the reader of what is understood by “deliverables”, “activities” and  “community support” in the remainder of this report we have added a number of concrete examples. This  list of examples is non-exhaustive, but it does display a wide variety of ENISA CSIRT related actions.  “Deliverables” are all materials (reports, studies, training guides and exercises and awareness materials,  etc.) that ENISA makes available to the CSIRT community, either though closed distribution channels or  through their website, such as:   The studies on Building a CERT and Running a CERT [8];   Good practice guide for incident management [9].   Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems [10].  “Activities” includes open and closed meetings (by invitation only), trainings, set-up of CSIRTs, exercises and  workshops, etc., such as:   Annual national and governmental CERT workshops [11];   ENISA Train the trainers and multipliers workshop [12];   ENISA-EUROPOL/EC3 workshops [11];   TRANSITS training support [13];   Technical part of Cyber Europe Exercises [14].  Leading the way  13  “Community support” englobes ENISA activities and deliverables that are of a more ad hoc nature and  therefore less visible on the ENISA website and through other communication channels, such as:   Meeting facilitations (between CSIRTs and other actors);   Liaising / raising awareness;   European CSIRT Community – TF-CSIRT [15] and FIRST [16].  2.1.1 Time line for the proposed roadmap  In the proposed roadmap following this report, we refer to actions and activities to be implemented in the  short, medium and long term, by which we suggest the following:   Short term: within the next year (2016/17)   Medium term: 2-3 years (2018/19)   Long term: 4 years and beyond (2020 and after).  2.2 Information Collection  2.2.1 Desk study  A number of key documents have served as a foundation for the study to identify the legal and policy  framework of ENISA’s CSIRT-related mandate, activities and performance with regards to supporting the  CSIRTs and other operational communities. The overview below provides a list of the key documents that  have been reviewed within the scope of the desk study of this report:   EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP);   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union;   Proposed NIS Directive;   ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015.  2.2.2 ENISA internal workshop  An ENISA internal workshop has been conducted in Athens in April 2015 as a part of the evidence gathering  for the project, by including the key ENISA experts that are involved in the CSIRT-related activities of the  Agency. Upon the completion of the workshop and validation by ENISA staff, the main points coming out of  this workshop were summarised and included in this report.  2.2.3 Online survey  One of the key instruments used for data collection for this study was an online survey, which was hosted  on the European Commission’s ‘EUSurvey’ platform. The study team has designed the online survey  questionnaire in order to provide:   A clear structure with a straightforward presentation of questions and possible answers;   An easy monitoring of the survey progress and results.  Selected experts from seven stakeholder groups were contacted and invited to participate in the online  survey. The table below presents the share of respondents (as percentage) per stakeholder group.  Leading the way  14  STAKEHOLDER GROUP (%)  National Liaison Officers 15%  National CSIRTs & Governmental CSIRTs 38%  Other CSIRTs in EU Member States. 13%  Non-EU CSIRTs 8%  European Institutions (e.g. JRC, EC, CERT-EU etc.) 3%  Member State Bodies (NIS authorities. national CIIPs, CIPs) 5%  Public and private stakeholders (e.g. academia, CI, CII)  18%  Figure 1 – share (%) of respondents by group  2.2.4 Interviews  The list of respondents interviewed was selected by ENISA. The study team conducted the interviews, either  in person (with the stakeholders located in Brussels, Belgium) or via phone. The interviews were conducted  between June and September 2015.  The interviews were pursued in a semi-structured manner allowing for auxiliary questions and for new lines  of questioning depending on the responses of the respondents. During the interviews, the study team  followed an agreed-upon protocol covering all the different themes that were treated during the interview  with the selected CSIRT stakeholders. However, interview respondents were free to discuss additional  relevant topics they considered as important or interesting.  Leading the way  15  Only note taking was used to capture the content of the interviews. Referencing to Chatham House rules,  interviewees were assured of non-attribution and anonymity when using direct quotes, unless they gave the  study team explicit permission to be quoted. As a result, in reporting on the interviews in this study, a quasi- anonymous approach is pursued, with references only being made to participant’s role or type of host  organisation, i.e. CSIRT, LEA, policy-making body, or other.  Figure 2 – Overview of host organisations of interview respondents  2.3 Stakeholder Categories  2.3.1 National Liaison Officers  ENISA has set up a network of National Liaison Officers (NLOs), which serve as ENISA’s contact point with  the Member States on specific issues. ENISA also gains access to a network of national contacts through  individual NLOs, reinforcing the activity of the Agency in the Member States.  Member States representatives – one from each EU and EEA country – are part of the NLO network. A  representative from the European Commission and a representative from the Council of the European Union  are also part of this network.  2.3.2 National/Governmental CSIRTs  National and governmental CSIRTs are Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) that serve the  government of a country by helping to protect the critical information infrastructure. National and  governmental CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident management with the relevant stakeholders at  the national level. They also bear the responsibility for cooperation with the national and governmental  teams in other countries.  Leading the way  16  2.3.3 Other CSIRTs in EU Member States  This stakeholder group represents CSIRTs which are located in the European Union but not mandated by the  government. Examples include among others CSIRTs in research and education, as well as military CSIRTs.  2.3.4 Non-EU CSIRTs  This stakeholder group represents CSIRTs which are located outside of the European Union. Examples  include CERT-GIB, Swisscom and SWITCH-CERT.  2.3.5 European Institutions (e.g. JRC, EC, CERT-EU etc.)  The institutions of the European Union include the European Commission, the European Parliament,  European Agencies such as JRC, and CERT-EU.  2.3.6 Member State bodies (NIS authorities. national CIIPs, CIPs)  This stakeholder group includes professionals from the national authorities dealing with information security  and issues related to CSIRT activities. Examples include, NIS and cyber-security bodies.  2.3.7 Public and private stakeholders (e.g. academia, CI, CII)  This group includes any other public or private organisation that relates to CSIRT activities. Examples include  professional services, associations of providers and legal & policy experts.  Leading the way  17  3 Policy Perspective  This chapter presents an overview of the results of the desk review, which was undertaken focusing on key  strategic documents outlining the EUs policies influencing the domain, as well as the main official documents  laying down ENISA’s mandate and tasks related to support to CSIRTs. Additionally, views of respondents of  both the interviews and surveys with regard to the policy and regulation perspective of ENISA’s support  activities have been incorporated where applicable. The information gathered has been grouped according  to the following structure:   EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP);   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union;   Proposed NIS Directive;   ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015.  3.1 EU Policy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP)  The European Commission Communication [17] on Critical Information Infrastructure protection focusing  on the protection of Europe from cyber disruptions by enhancing security and resilience was adopted in  2009. The Communication included an action plan based on five pillars, involving the Member States and  the private sector:   Preparedness and prevention;   Detection and response;   Mitigation and recovery;   International cooperation;   Criteria for European Critical Infrastructures in the field of ICT.  The CIIP Ministerial Conference organised by the Hungarian Presidency of the EU in 2011 served as a forum  to evaluate progress, assess lessons learnt and to discuss the remaining challenges ahead and next steps.  The following 2012 European Parliament Resolution on “Critical Information Infrastructure Protection:  towards global cyber security” [18] made further recommendations to the Commission. Several of these  were echoed in the Cybersecurity strategy and in the proposal for a Directive on network on information  security (hereafter “the NIS Directive”) published in 2013.  Among the key achievements related to the CIIP policy, brought about by ENISA include:   The adoption of a minimum set of baseline capabilities and services, and related policy  recommendations for national/governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams to function  effectively;   The carrying out of pan-European exercises, (i.e. Cyber Europe 2010, 2012, etc.)  Whilst the EU Cybersecurity Strategy did include certain actions, such as the pan-European exercises, the  voluntary nature of the CIIP policy [19] has been seen as a weakness, which could be amended by the adoption  of the NIS Directive. This would require the Member States to put in place a minimum level of capabilities at  national level and to cooperate across borders [20].  Leading the way  18  3.2 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union [6] outlines the  EU’s vision in the domain of cyber security, clarifying roles and  responsibilities, and specifying required actions to promote online  security and citizens’ rights.  The vision presented in the Strategy is articulated in five priorities  and foresees a key role for ENISA in protecting Europe’s cyberspace  in the first and the fourth priority to ‘achieving cyber resilience’ and  to ‘develop industrial and technological resources for  cybersecurity’.  To boost cyber resilience in the EU, both the public and the private sector must develop capabilities and  cooperate effectively. In the second priority of the Strategy the Commission asks ENISA to:   Assist Member States in developing strong national cyber resilience capabilities, by building  expertise on security and resilience of industrial control systems, transport and energy  infrastructure;   Examine in 2013 the feasibility of Computer Security Incident Response Team(s) for Industrial  Control Systems (ICS-CSIRTs) for the EU [21];   Continue supporting the MS and the EU institutions in carrying out regular pan-European cyber  incident exercises which will also constitute the operational basis for the EU participation in  international cyber incident exercises.  To develop industrial and technological resources for cybersecurity, in the fourth priority of the Strategy the  Commission asks ENISA to:   Propose in 2013 a roadmap for a ‘Network and Information Security driving licence’ as a voluntary  certification programme to promote enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals (e.g.  website administrators);   Develop, in cooperation with relevant national competent authorities, relevant stakeholders, and  international and European standardisation bodies and the European Commission Joint Research  Centre, technical guidelines and recommendations for the adoption of NIS standards and good  practices in the public and private sectors.  The Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union is not a legally binding document, however ENISA is  expected to take into account these requests coming from such a high level document.  3.2.1 Respondent views  The respondents were asked what additional CSIRT-related areas and activities, in line with the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the EU, they would recommend ENISA to focus on for the coming five years. Respondent from  national CSIRTs suggested that ENISA should prioritise CSIRT capacity building, training and exercises.  However, when it comes to incident handling, it is believed that ENISA should not handle incidents now or  in the coming five years. Most of the respondents believe that ENISA should concentrate more on organising  trainings and workshops with emphasis on technical aspects.  “ENISA’s role in  supporting the  Cybersecurity Strategy is  really important and  ENISA does it very well.”  Respondent from a Member State  body  Leading the way  19  Other respondents stressed that while the European cyber exercises are extremely helpful, there is a need  for a European cyber crisis system. This was deemed to be a difficult task for ENISA since the decisions on  crisis management remain mainly at the national level and ENISA does not have a mandate outside the area  of NIS.  In addition, the table below illustrates the results from the ‘EUSurvey’ platform, demonstrating that over  80% of the responding National Liaison Officers believe that ENISA CSIRT related activities are of importance  in supporting the Cybersecurity Strategy of the  European Union.  The respondents were asked to what extent they  believe that ENISA capacity building activities are  important in supporting the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the European Union, in particular the  goals related to co-ordination between NIS  competent authorities, CSIRTs and law  enforcement. Most of the respondents agreed  that ENISA capacity building activities are  important in supporting the Cybersecurity  Strategy of the European Union and in particular  the goals related to co-ordination between NIS  competent authorities, CSIRTs, and law  enforcement. However, one of the respondents did not completely agree with this statement and expressed  that according to him, there is still a lot to be done in this direction and that cooperation between those  three authorities is still not in good state due to cultural differences.  Furthermore, the respondents, with respect to the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, suggested  that ENISA should focus on the following:   Trust building: Several respondents recommended that ENISA continues this and some proposed  the following:  o ENISA engages more with senior policy makers to outline that cyber security matters;  o Secondment and staff exchanges between CSIRTs in other Member States, and between  Member States and EU institutions. Enhancing communication with non-EU countries;   Cooperation: ENISA should build on this basis by serving as a coordinator as it already has  established good relations with CSIRTs and develop upon its existing cooperation network to  expand to other sectors, industries and stakeholders. In addition, CSIRTs are very often not very  well connected to private companies’ CSIRTs and this could be promoted by supporting CSIRT  associations like CERT-Verbund in Germany. Some respondents even mentioned, which would go  beyond the remits of the ENISA mandate, enhanced cooperation with the military sector. In  addition, ENISA could provide a secretariat and guidance function for the CSIRT network in view to  harmonise differences between MSs;   Training: Tailored trainings and exercises, for example for incident handlers, liaisons, analysts, press  contacts, etc. ENISA can also conduct trust building measures and capacity building, coordinate  50%  17%  33%  ENISA CSIRT activities importance  in supporting the Cybersecurity  Strategy  important  less important  relatively important  Leading the way  20  technical/operational trainings, enhance training material, support tool building initiatives, and  support the CSIRT needs. This could include the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)2.   Materials: Provide guidance materials and reports and act as a repository or a “go-to place” in terms  of having a broad source of information whether the materials are produced by ENISA or others.  3.3 Proposed NIS Directive  The proposed NIS Directive [7] is a legislative instrument, pending final adoption by EU Council Ministers  and the EU Parliament, to support the achievement of some of the high level goals identified in the  Cybersecurity Strategy, including promoting a high common level of NIS by improving internet security,  private networks, and information systems. The proposed NIS Directive lays down measures to ensure a high  common level of Network and Information Security (NIS) across the EU:   Establish common minimum requirements for NIS at national level;   Set up coordinated prevention, detection mitigation and response mechanism, enabling  information sharing and mutual assistance amongst the national NIS competent authorities;   Improve preparedness and engagement of the private sector.  The proposed NIS Directive elaborates on the role of ENISA with regard to supporting Member States and  the EU by assisting in the operation of the cooperation network, providing Member States and the EU with  its expertise and advice, and by facilitating the exchange of best practices. The proposal also suggests that  ENISA should cooperate with the EU institutions and Member States to develop a cooperation plan to  counter risks and incidents.  3.3.1 Respondent views  In relation to the NIS Directive, one respondent from the NLOs stated that ENISA should focus on how it can  help on the effective implementation of the NIS directive. In relation to article 8 of the NIS directive on the  formation of a cooperation network, one respondent from a governmental CSIRT called for ENISA’s already  existing cooperation with CSIRTs to be fully used and for its role to be crystallised in order for ENISA to serve  as a coordinator, so as to not duplicate efforts. In the current version of the proposed Directive, ENISA is  only to assist the cooperation network when requested to. It was also stressed in the interviews that ENISA  should develop operational procedures in support of new activities, if requested. Moreover, as the NIS  Directive is a work in progress, ENISA should “not create additional work for itself by overstepping their  current mandate”.  Other responses highlighted the need for ENISA’s role in assisting in the effective implementation of the NIS  directive:   NIS community support;   NIS stakeholder brokerage and trust-building Initiatives between MS CSIRTs;   Policy support for EU bodies and MS;   Set up of an information hub for the NIS community;   CSIRT functionality assessment for regulatory compliance with the NIS Directive;  2 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility  Leading the way  21   CSIRT baseline capabilities assessment and regulatory self-assessment toolkit.  It is also important to consider that 80% of the European Institutions and Member State Bodies respondents  have a neutral response to whether ENISA should develop operational procedures to support new activities  introduced by the proposed NIS Directive. This could be due to the fact that the NIS Directive is still under  negotiation by competent institutions.  3.4 ENISA Regulation  The new ENISA Regulation [2], constitutes the most recent ENISA mandate and replaces the prior Regulation  from 2004. It guarantees the operations of ENISA until 2018 and provides the Agency’s general strategy,  building on ENISA’s achievements in areas such as support to CSIRTs in Member States and facilitation of  pan-European cybersecurity exercises.  The new Regulation enlarges the scope of ENISA and its authority to make an even bigger differ-ence in  protecting Europe’s cyberspace, including ENISA supporting the development of EU cyber-security policy  and legislation. In terms of ENISA CSIRT support activities, the Regulation lays down a number of  expectations in relation to national and governmental CSIRTs and other CSIRTs in Europe, which are  summarised below.   CSIRT Operational Frameworks and Mandates: Facilitation of the emergence and maintenance of a  stable national and governmental CSIRT architecture across the EU, which also provides overarching  framework for EU information security.   CSIRT Service Portfolios: ENISA support to the formulation of a peer review system amongst  national and governmental CSIRTs to assess performance against a common set of capabilities.   CSIRT Resources: ENISA support for strengthened capabilities of national and governmental CSIRTs  that should also establish a common set of operational capability criteria. These should also match  those of the ‘most developed CSIRTs’ in the EU.   Cooperation: The Regulation tasks ENISA to “promote cooperation and the exchange of information  and best practices’ between CSIRTs and other relevant organisations”, and also gives ENISA a  greater interfacing ability with the European Cybercrime Centre, providing for a more proactive  ENISA role with regard to encouraging information exchange amongst national and governmental  CSIRTs and LEAs.  3.5 ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015  3.5.1 ENISA Work Programme 2014  The 2014 Work Programme [3] stressed that ENISA’s strategic priorities are designed to support Member  States’ efforts to meet EU policy objectives.  The Work Programme reflects the fact that ENISA obtained new  tasks to perform during 2014 following its new mandate and the Cybersecurity Strategy for the European  Union. In this context, ENISA identified three Work Streams that define its current core operational activities:   WS1: Support EU policy building;   WS2: Support capacity building;   WS3: Support cooperation.  Leading the way  22  Since not all work streams included CSIRT related tasks for ENISA, the desk review focused on work packages  2.1 and 3.3 as described below.  3.5.1.1 Work Package 2.1: Support Member States’ Capacity Building  Work Package 2.1 aimed at improving the operational activities of CSIRTs through the following:   Stock-taking of achievements, good practices and experience with a view to develop a road map;   Enhance training and exercise methodology to improve the competencies of trainers;   Produce good practice guides on training methodologies for CSIRTs derived from experiences in  delivering suitable CSIRT training;   Provide an update of the “baseline capabilities” definition and to draw conclusions for new training  materials. In addition, ENISA will deliver a new set of CSIRT exercise material with at least five new  scenarios covering the four main baseline capabilities competencies, including operational,  technical, mandate and cooperation competencies.  3.5.1.2 Work Package 3.3: Regular Cooperation among NIS Communities  Under the Work Package 3.3, ENISA implemented activities with the aim to:   Actively support or organise common trainings for different communities, such as CSIRTs and LEAs;   Engage with the European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), where appropriate, through formal and  informal cooperation channels;   Take stock of the response of other communities to cyber security challenges and establish how  they could inform the works of CSIRTs;   Facilitate the outreach to other bodies and /or communities, including taking stock of accepted  methods for trust building within and among communities;   Continue to collect good practice useful for CSIRTs and LEAs and to enhance ENISA exercise and  training materials.  This work package extended the scope of ENISA’s support to the communities dealing with NIS to non- operational communities, to enable communications between CSIRTs, law enforcement, financial and other  communities. Activities scheduled to implement these goals included ENISA to utilise the 9th ENISA CSIRT  workshop to prepare future work in the area of CSIRT training and CSIRT cooperation with LEAs in  collaboration with the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). ENISA also engaged in the formulation of a good  practice guide and/or training and exercise materials concerning the exchange and processing of actionable  information by CSIRTs, as well as in the drafting of good practice materials for first responders in cooperation  with the EC3. Moreover, as a part of this work package, ENISA prepared and published the reports  “Stocktaking of standards formats used in exchange of processing actionable information” [22], and  “Scalable and Accepted Methods for Trust Building in Operational Communities” [3].  3.5.2 ENISA Work Programme 2015  In 2015, the ENISA work streams were permanently replaced by strategic objectives, which in turn are  aligned with the ENISA Strategy document and the multi-annual planning (2015-2017) [23].  The ENISA strategic objectives for 2015 are as follows:  Leading the way  23   SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of expertise  of EU actors taking into account evolutions in Network  and Information Security (NIS);   SO2: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU;   SO3: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in developing and implementing the policies necessary  to meeting the legal and regulatory requirements of  Network and Information Security;   SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the  Member States and the EU and between related NIS  communities.  As was the case in previous years, CSIRT related tasks were not included in all strategic objectives, and  therefore our desk review focused on work packages 1.4, 2.1, 4.1 and 4.2 as described below.  3.5.2.1 Work package 1.4: Short- and mid-term sharing of information regarding issues in NIS  The objective of this works package is to allow the Agency to provide timely and qualitative responses to NIS  developments through the definition and implementation of a framework. As regards CSIRTs the aim is to  improve the information flows between the CERT EU, ENISA and the CSIRT community at large.  3.5.2.2 Work package 2.1 Assist in public sector capacity building  This work package aims to assist CSIRTs, and other operational communities, as appropriate to develop and  extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet challenges to secure their networks. By doing so, CSIRTs  and other operational communities will benefit from trainings and tailor-made capability enhancement  actions.  3.5.2.3 Work package 4.1 Support for EU cooperation initiatives amongst NIS-related communities in  the context of the EU Cyber Security Strategy (EU CSS)  The aim of this work package is to continue to build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals.  Specifically, the work package will exploit the good experiences of the Agency from its support to CSIRTs,  the CSIRT communities and Law Enforcement communities in order to identify mutually satisfactory ways to  collaborate. ENISA will develop and provide guidance leveraging best practice for cooperation between  stakeholder communities, including CSIRTs, the CIIP community, law enforcement and financial services, etc.  In the spirit of building communities through ‘learning by doing’, ENISA will continue its support of the  TRANSITS training in the area of CSIRTs.  ENISA’s support to the collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement communities, including close  collaboration with other institutions such as EC3 (Europol).  In this vein, the agreement between ENISA and  EC3 will be further developed to include a more operational and systematic flows of expertise, elaboration  of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best practice, enhancing capacity  building through training and awareness raising in order to safeguard network and information security at  the EU level. To this end, ENISA will stay engaged in the EC3 programme board.  “There is disconnection  between the  operational and  political levels, and  ENISA is good at trying  to fill this gap.”  Respondent from the European  institutions  Leading the way  24  3.5.2.4 Work package 4.2 European cyber crisis cooperation through exercises  The aim of this work package is to facilitate the planning of the upcoming pan-European Cyber Exercise in  2015-2016. To this end, ENISA will further develop its methodology, training outreach and technical  capability to organise large-scale cyber crisis exercises.  In practice, this translates into three following topics:   Pan-European cyber exercises management (Cyber Europe and EuropeSOPEx);   Enhance capacity to support and organise cyber exercises;   Promote, maintain and improve EU cyber crisis cooperation plans and procedures (i.e. EU SOPs),  including bringing close the cyber crisis cooperation community [23].  3.5.3 Respondent views  When asked to what extent the respondents agreed with the statement that ENISA has successfully  implemented the capacity building activities included in this study (i.e., CSIRT support and Cyber Crisis  Cooperation and Exercises related activities) set out in the Annual Work Programmes, in the past five years,  the respondents, in particular the National Liaison Officers indicated an overall agreement. This is further  confirmed by the online survey with 73% of the National Liaison Officers and European Institutions  respondents agreeing.  One EU official stated that while he did not have a detailed overview of the ENISA CSIRT support, he had  noted that “ENISA has established good cooperation at various levels with CSIRTs and at a personal level”,  during past ENISA Cyber Exercises which he had attended. “They speak the same language”, the official  continued. In this respect, it seems that ENISA has established cooperation on all levels. However, the  challenge is what happens at the top political level. In the event of a crisis, decisions need to be taken fast,  which requires a solid understand of the sector.  The EU official also noted that in the cyber domain “jargon is a killer”, which makes it harder for “non-techie”  staff to understand the issues. However, ENISA is perceived to be doing a good job in bridging the gap  between the operational and policy levels, given the Agency’s size and the fact that the bar is continuously  being raised.  3.6 Policy perspective - Summary table of ENISA impact  The following table summarises key ENISA capacity building activities of the European Union Policy of Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, Proposed NIS  Directive and ENISA Annual Work Programme 2014 & 2015 and provides conclusions on how ENISA has  responded to them.  POLICY PROPOSED ENISA CSIRT RELATED ACTIVITIES  CONCLUSION  EU Policy of Critical  Information Infrastructure  Protection (CIIP)  The Commission has asked ENISA to:   Carry out pan-European exercises   Adopt a minimum set of baseline capabilities  and services and related policy  recommendations for (CSIRTs) to function  effectively.  ENISA has carried out Cyber Europe  Exercises in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and  will continue to do so in 2016.  ENISA has established various baseline  capabilities and services to CSIRTs  (capability materials, technical updates,  improved communication, enhanced  information sharing, etc.)  Leading the way  25  POLICY PROPOSED ENISA CSIRT RELATED ACTIVITIES  CONCLUSION  Cybersecurity Strategy of  the European Union  The Commission asks ENISA to:   Assist MS in developing cyber resilience  capabilities;   Examine the feasibility of ICS-CSIRTs;   Continue support-EU cyber incident exercises;  ENISA has continued to encourage  good practices in information and  network security to ensure its  assistance and support to Member  States in developing strong national  cyber resilience capabilities. ENISA has  done so by supporting and organising  pan-EU cyber incident exercises,  trainings and workshops, and by  building on expertise, cooperation and  support on security and resilience of  industrial control systems, transport  and energy infrastructure, etc.  Regarding the roadmap for a ‘NIS  driving licence,’ ENISA has started the  consultation process in order to involve  the relevant stakeholders and guide  the process in order to ensure quality  results.  Proposed NIS Directive3 The Commission would ask ENISA to:   Assist in the operation of the cooperation  network;   Provide MS and the EU with expertise and  advice;   Facilitate the exchange of best practices.  The Network and Information Security  Directive was proposed by the  Commission in 2013 and is currently in  the final stages of negotiations  between the European Parliament and  the Council.  ENISA Annual Work  Programme 2014 & 2015  The 2014 & 15 WP outlined the following ENISA  support to CSIRTs:   Support Member States’ Capacity Building   Regular Cooperation among NIS Communities   Short- and mid-term sharing of information  regarding issues in NIS   Assist in public sector capacity building   Support for EU cooperation initiatives amongst  NIS-related communities in the context of the EU  Cyber Security Strategy (EU CSS)   European cyber crisis cooperation through  exercises  ENISA supported the communities  dealing with NIS to non-operational  communities, enabling  communications between CSIRTs, LEAs,  financial and other communities.  Capacity building, trainings, workshops,  exercises and dissemination of good  practices. Facilitating cooperation and  coordination between public and  private stakeholders.  ENISA implemented the operational  security activities (i.e. CSIRT support  and Cyber Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises related activities) set out in  the Annual Work Programmes.  ENISA enhanced cooperation with LEAs  and the EC3.  3 At the time of writing, adoption of the NIS Directive is pending. However, no significant changes are expected to the proposed directive.  Leading the way  26  4 Overall Respondent views on ENISA CSIRT Support  The following chapter reflects the respondents’ awareness, appreciation and perceived weakness of the  ENISA CSIRT support. It is important to note that most of the views expressed by the respondents did not  deviate far from the ones of last year’s report covering the same parts.  4.1 Respondent awareness of related activities  A majority of the respondents are aware of ENISA’s activities in carrying out baseline capabilities, capacity  building, sharing of good practices and CSIRT trainings. When asked whether ENISA should take a more active  role in implementing baseline capabilities, a majority of the respondents agreed with the suggestion. One  respondent proposed that ENISA could further increase awareness about its tasks by taking a more  ‘marketing’ approach to widening its reach, as its  work is valuable, needed and more stakeholders  should be aware of it.  All of the respondents were aware of ENISA’s  website and mailing list and all had experience  with ENISA CSIRT trainings or relevant material.  Moreover, almost half of all the respondents had  recently attended an ENISA CSIRT-related event  (e.g. workshops, cyber exercises, trainings etc.).  Some respondents, predominately from the  European Institutions noticed the lack of ENISA  trainings for European Officials and remarked  that such trainings would be very beneficial for  them.  4.2 Respondent appreciation of related activities  The majority of respondents appreciate ENISAs CSIRT support. This is reflected by the fact that a large  majority of the National CSIRTs and Governmental CSIRTs, MS Bodies and Public and Private Stakeholder  respondents agree that ENISA’s CSIRT related support and  activities evolve in line with the needs and priorities of the CSIRT  community. “ENISA training materials  are very useful and we  use them often.”  Respondent for the Public/Private Sector  25%  12%  25%  38%  ENISA should take on a more  active role in implementing  the baseline capabilities  agree  disagree  neutral  strongly agree  Leading the way  27  Moreover, most respondents stated that they are satisfied with ENISA's role as a networker for the  community and believe that ENISA should continue working as a facilitator, coordinator and a trusted  introducer, disseminating good practices and  bringing CSIRTs and relevant stakeholders  together. There is also an incentive for ENISA to  further develop its methods and techniques for  identifying gaps and help to achieve stronger  cooperation. When asked about the usefulness of  ENISA’s CSIRT related events, respondents  were  in agreement that it they are useful.  Furthermore, as illustrated in the chart, a majority  of respondents agree and appreciate ENISA  contributing to enhancing and supporting national  crisis management capabilities.  Finally, the respondents acknowledge and appreciate that sufficient means and channels are available to the  CSIRT community in order to provide ENISA with feedback, suggestions and questions on its CSIRT related  activities.  4.3 Perceived weakness of related activities  The perceived weaknesses focused on the issues of costs, cooperation and crisis management. Some  Member State Bodies, National CSIRTs and Governmental CSIRTs stressed that the costs of traveling to ENISA  workshops often times exceed the budgets. However, as mentioned by a different respondent, ENISA  organises them in different places every year, with the help of a local host. In other words, travel expenses  could be reduced if a CSIRT hosted the workshop. Likewise, respondents shared that they would like to see  the topics and presentations at ENISA’s CSIRT related events to be more focused on practical, technical and  relevant areas for CSIRTs, such as exercising, and avoid wider policy topics.  In addition, according to respondents, the cooperation between the Operational Security Community and  the EU Institutions and its Agencies is still insufficient and needs to be further improved. They believe that  the reason for this relates to cultural differences among Member States. To illustrate, a respondent gave the  example that what is qualified as a cybersecurity incident in one country could be qualified as terrorism in  another.  Respondents also mentioned that CSIRTs focus on large-scale incidents and ENISA could support CSIRTs in  handling small incidents, because ‘not handling these small incidents, builds the ground for large scale  attacks.’ In addition, some respondents mentioned that ENISA could play a greater role in supporting CSIRT  connections with industry and the private sector to ensure good practises are more widespread outside of  the current National CSIRT environment. Respondents also mentioned that ENISA could support CSIRTs by  enhancing communication with non-EU countries and by establishing minimal security standards for  Member States on strategic and operational levels. It was also mentioned that even though it is not a part  of the ENISA mandate the Agency could enhance its communication with the defence sector.  In relation to CSIRTs crisis management some EU Officials stated that ENISA lacks staff and personnel to  properly support CSIRTs in a crisis.  50%  25%  17% 8%  ENISA has contributed to  enhancing national  cybersecurity crisis  management capabilities  agree  disagree  strongly agree  strongly disagree  Leading the way  28  5 Operational Perspective – Baseline Capabilities for CSIRTs  As for baseline capabilities, ENISA has identified four focus points for its  research and continuous work to support CSIRTs. These include  ‘mandate and strategy’, ‘service portfolio’, ‘operational capabilities’ and  ‘cooperation capabilities’. These baseline capabilities aim to tackle the  diversity of capabilities across Member States, which is seen by ENISA as  the main obstacle to cross-border cooperation and incident response.  5.1 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the  Agency’s work were brought forward and subsequently included in the  survey and interview questions.  5.1.1 Stronger ENISA Voice  To date, ENISA has primarily delivered paper reports, some of which may have lacked sufficiently  straightforward recommendations especially to the CSIRT community. This was done deliberately so as to  create community buy-in and in order to not be perceived as pushing ideas onto the national and  governmental CSIRTs that were in the process of developing and finding their own way.  Nevertheless, ENISA has built a stronger position over the years and should therefore take more of a stance  in the papers, studies and public statements that it produces. Instead of limiting papers to stock takings and  vague suggestions, it was agreed that ENISA should take a bolder stance and taking more risks in terms of  speaking its mind more proactively and directly.  5.1.2 Proactive Endorser  Similar to the prior point, it was pointed out that any kind of support or validation of an initiative, even in  the form of a simple endorsement, is important for professionals of the trade. While ENISA at times has  preferred to be on stand-by and to wait for requests from the community, it was agreed that the Agency  should become more proactive. One participant stated that ENISA should help improve the overall  international cooperation by engaging communities and act as a trusted partner that finds sponsors for  CSIRTs.  ENISA is able to support some initiatives within the framework of rules for such support. However, instead  of supporting initiatives in ‘stand-by mode’ waiting for requests to come, ENISA should be more proactive  and not wait for support requests to come. As an example, ENISA could recommend and push open source  code on GitHUB4.  4 GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source  code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. https://github.com/  “On organisational  and political level,  ENISA CERT  activities provide a  good level of  support”  Respondent from a Member  State Body  https://github.com/  Leading the way  29  5.1.3 From paper based studies to service oriented support  As one of the current challenges, support to CSIRTs to build up capabilities with limited resources available  at the Member State level was identified. This represents an opportunity for ENISA to take a more active  role in supporting the implementation of the baseline capabilities of CSIRTs, which would also be a means  to meet the increasing expectations of CSIRTs towards this kind of assistance. From the past experience with  the community, it is apparent that CSIRTs appreciate direct interaction and practical advice.  The shift from paper work to ad hoc support and more tangible advice  could be achieved by using a more interactive approach through, for  instance, ENISA going onsite upon request to perform a maturity  assessment of a CSIRT coupled with an overview of how the team is  situated in the community.  Initial requests of this kind have already been received by ENISA  (although formally it may fall under Article 14 ‘Requests to the Agency’5),  and as such requests are expected to increase in number. As  certifications of CSIRTs are on the rise (for instance by the TF-CSIRT  Trusted Introducer (TF-CSIRT/TI)6, which offers registration/listing,  accreditation and certification to European CSIRTs.7), ENISA is committed  to assisting the teams in reaching this status.  It was agreed that ENISA, in addition to its studies, should develop a  more service based approach vis-à-vis the CSIRTs, including offering  multiple products and services to the CSIRTs.  5.1.4 Two-speed approach to less and more mature CSIRTs  ENISA trainings constitute an important means for improving the baseline capabilities of CSIRTs. However,  as the level of maturity of CSIRTs are somewhat uneven, it was suggested that ENISA further tailor its  trainings putting, for instance, some of the training activities under the CyberEurope8 label (e.g.to offer  specific trainings that can improve the right skills which will be tested during the CE exercise). Supporting  CSIRTs and adapting to differences in maturity of new and less mature teams is seen as a success factor to  ENISA. This is an important factor in managing the expectations of CSIRTs.  5 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013, repealing Regulation (EC) No  460/2004.: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN  6 TF-CSIRT: The Trusted Introducer Service (TI) lists well known teams and accredits as well as certify teams according  to their demonstrated and checked level of maturity. https://www.trusted-introducer.org/  7 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/cert-community-recognition- mechanisms-and-schemes  8 Cyber Europe: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber- europe  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN https://www.trusted-introducer.org/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe  Leading the way  30  5.1.5 Materials for the CSIRT Community  In line with the findings of the 2014 Impact Assessment and Roadmap report, ENISA looks to produce  handbook type materials for the CSIRT community. The key suggestions include a “CSIRT tool book”, which  would focus on what is needed to run a CSIRT, and a playbook on how to deal with different types of  incidents.  5.1.6 Benchmarking of baseline capabilities  In view of ensuring a benchmark for the sector, one additional  suggestion was for ENISA to declare CSIRT teams as meeting, or even  exceeding, the ENISA recommended baseline capabilities. This could be  seen as a complement to, or as a first step for CSIRTs towards obtaining  the TF-CSIRT Trusted Introducer certification.  5.2 Respondent views  Most respondents, and in particular the national and governmental  CSIRTs were in favour of ENISA proactively endorsing or supporting  initiatives relevant to the CSIRTs and other operational security  communities. It was also suggested that if there are initiatives relating  to funding for CSIRTs, ENISA should play an active role in supporting the  CSIRTs in acquiring funds.  When asked whether ENISA should create a certified list of companies as trusted cybersecurity service  providers, the response was mixed. The main question brought forward was whether this type of activity  was best done at the EU or Member State level.  It was believed that if it was to be done by ENISA, some  convincing at the local level would be necessary, although it was clear that some Members States are not  sufficiently active in the field. On a positive note, it was seen as putting pressure on the market, which would  facilitate the identification of cybersecurity-trusted providers in a domain where many claim to be experts  without the actual expertise.  Some respondents expressed the need for ENISA to provide more activities and support for operational  baseline capabilities for CSIRTs. Most respondents agreed that ENISA has an important advisory role to play  but on the other hand, since ENISA has limited operational mandate, ENISA would not be in a position to  assess CSIRTs operational capabilities. Others mentioned that TF-CSIRT is already active in the accreditation  scheme and ENISA could assist them in developing it. One National Liaison Officers respondent stated that  a CSIRT Baseline Capabilities Assessment could be an additional focus area and activity to be further  considered by ENISA.  5.3 Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (based on the 2014 report & 2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS- PILLAR I: BASELINE CAPABILITIES FOR CSIRTS TIMELINE  Stronger ENISA voice   This action involves ENISA to take a clearer stance in its papers, studies and public statements,  towards proactively communicating opinions and recommendations.

In addition, the awareness and perception of Article 14 requests to the  Agency was examined following an increase in related workload for ENISA over the past years. In practice  requests include support information sharing projects driven by the CSIRT community, various trainings,  assistance in enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities and support to specific projects, for instance  honeypots.  6.1 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the Agency’s work were brought forward  and subsequently included in the survey and interview questions.  6.1.1 Information Exchange and Connector Role  The ENISA view is that the Agency should explore further possibilities to reinforce its role as information  exchange connector. While the expectations within the CSIRT community remain quite high, with varied  ideas of what could or should be achieved through information sharing. From the ENISA angle, the Agency  can serve by sharing information from to relevant stakeholders and by providing guidance on good practices.  Thanks to its unique position in the community, ENISA will continue to leverage this advantage to connect  community members as well as linking them with relevant players.  The Connecting Europe Facility Cyber Security Digital Service Infrastructure [24] (CEF Cyber Security DSI) is  defined in the CEF Annual Work Programme (WP) 2014 and 2015. The preparatory actions foreseen in the  CEF WP 2014 (European Commission, 2014b) are aimed at preparing the DSI as a mature DSI for the CEF WP  2015 (European Commission, 2014a) to establish and launch a core cooperation platform and mechanisms  that will enhance the EU capability for preparedness, cooperation and information exchange, coordination  and response to cyber threats. Such mechanisms will be used by Member States on a voluntary basis, to  strengthen capacity building and cooperation, in line with established governance structure and  requirements (European Commission, 2014c). ENISA already contributes to this initiative as member of the  Governance Board.  Leading the way  33  6.1.2 Sharing Good Practices among the Teams  ENISA discussed a tool for sharing good practices, which could also mix the features of a blog and a forum,  and be used as a social network for the CSIRT community. The existing cyber exercise platform (developed  by ENISA) was mentioned as a working example of an information  exchange platform, which could be used as a pilot version for exchange  between MS in case of crisis. This could be transformed into a platform  for dynamic day to day information exchange, as requested by some  member States. ENISA should explore the possibility of hosting an  informal social network for the operational security community.  6.1.3 Trainings and Train-the-Trainers  To date, trainings have been limited to CSIRT services in the context of  baseline capabilities. However, in terms of capacity building, the content  of trainings should shift from stand-alone topics to more modular topics  to create high value trainings for maturing teams. Therefore, in order to  better cater to different maturity levels of the teams, current CSIRT  trainings could be further enhanced in order to improve ‘training of the  trainers’ through for example online webinars. In parallel to trainings on  “this is how you train people”, the Agency would still offer the modular  subject matter trainings to support the development of baseline  capabilities. This was also seen as a way of better meeting the needs of  more mature CSIRTs.  6.1.4 Participant Evaluations  In an attempt to better meet the needs of CSIRTs of varied maturity levels, ENISA discussed the possibility  of adding assessments of the participants prior to the trainings and exercises. This would ensure a good fit  between the level of the participant and the level of difficulty of a training or exercise.  It would also be used  as a tool to test the new skills acquired at the end of a training session, and implicitly as a motivator for the  participants to stay attentive during the training. Furthermore, based on such assessments, ENISA could try  to identify the weak points in exercises (e.g. national and European), and propose the development of  additional trainings thereby continuing the training lifecycle.  6.2 Respondent views  The respondent views for ENISA capacity building, good practices, and CSIRT training complement the views  expressed in the internal ENISA workshop, with the expectation that no mention was made of participant  evaluations or the re-using of training materials.  Various respondents believe that ENISA should focus on information sharing by putting into place effective  mechanisms to cement their information sharing (threat intelligence, incidents, etc.) and connector role.  Respondents mentioned that this could be done through a secure communications platform and/or working  with Internet Service Providers. One Governmental CSIRT mentioned that ENISA should focus on establishing  additional information security exchanges in different sectors such as the healthcare or energy sector.  Moreover, respondents mentioned that at the moment, information is shared mainly via conference calls  which remains inefficient and that more face to face meetings would benefit the community as a whole.  Leading the way  34  The vast majority of respondents agree that ENISA has been successful  in disseminating good practices to relevant operational security  community. In addition, many respondents brought up the point that  these ENISA activities, security guidelines and procedures are used and  applied to their teams, stressing that ENISA is an ”influential player in the  development of international sharing of cyber information.\"  Furthermore, one non-EU CSIRT stated that ‘ENISA material is excellent  for the construction of the CSIRTs and has helped many times with  controversial moments.’  All respondents mentioned that more trainings should be provided to the  trainers of the CSIRT community, especially training for teams that are,  or will be, newly created. One respondent stated that ENISA should  organise a ”Senior Manager Workshop” to support CSIRT leaders to  effectively manage, train and provide leadership to their teams and the  greater CSIRT community. Moreover, a few respondents mentioned that  ENISA could bring those trainings to MSs in order to avoid costly travel.  To conclude, most respondents believe that ENISA should continue working as a facilitator, coordinator and  a trusted introducer, disseminating good practices and bringing people together while not enter into an  operational role.  6.3 - Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (based on the 2014 report & 2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS –PILLAR II: CAPACITY BUILDING, SHARING GOOD PRACTICES AND CSIRT TRAINING TIMELINE  Reinforced Information Exchange and Connector Role:   Improved information exchange (threat intelligence, incidents, etc.) and enhanced sharing of  good practices   Website – networking and community building  Short – medium  term  Continued support for mature CSIRTs   Regular updates of CSIRT capacity building material a clearer focus on “advanced team support”  for mature CSIRTs   Greater focus on technical updates, checklists, summaries  Medium – long  term  Clearer focus on operational vs strategic reports:   More technical reports for practitioners   Policy-related reports for decision makers  Short – medium  term  Trainings   Train the trainer   Module subject matter trainings.   Participant evaluations- pre/post trainings and & exercises  Medium – long  term  Leading the way  35  Re-use of training material as a step to streamline the services of the team following the  reorganisation  Awareness raising  Enhance the awareness and up-take of ENISA materials (capacity building) by advertising them more  widely, within the CSIRT community and other operational communities  Short – medium  term  Leading the way  36  7 Operational perspective - Support CSIRTs to better collaborate with  Law Enforcement Agencies  In 2010, ENISA started its support for operational collaboration between the CSIRTs and LEAs (law  enforcement agencies). Various activities have since been launched, including stock-takings of legal and  operational obstacles that prevent collaboration, advice resulting from that, workshops that brought  together members of both communities, consultation with members of both communities, etc.  7.1 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the Agency’s work were brought forward  and subsequently included in the survey and interview questions.  7.1.1 ENISA-EUROPOL collaboration  7.1.1.1 Workshops  Despite a slow start, the ENISA collaboration with European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol on organising workshops has  over time become an established practice9 10 11 and many  participants have expressed their interest to continue with these  kinds of workshops. The focus should be to make sure that CSIRTs,  in the first place, are equipped to interact with law enforcement  agencies. While LEA’s main objective is to collect evidence and  arrest perpetrators, they tend to be less interested in learning  new techniques. Nevertheless, in the context of botnet  takedowns, there are examples of direct communication between  EC3 and CSIRT teams, especially when cases are being investigated during CSIRT/LEA workshops. This is a  good example of an area where ENISA could solidify its role while continuously exploring together with EC3  additional needs of the CSIRTs and LEA community.  7.1.1.2  Good practice library for CSIRTs and LEA cooperation  In this vein, the current ENISA/EC3 current taxonomy project should be further elaborated. There should be  two focus points in relation to the taxonomy related work. Firstly, improved LEA-CSIRT cooperation in the  fight against cybercrime. Secondly, strategic cooperation with EC3 that would go beyond the current  ENISA/EC3 workshops and the “Report on information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs  and Law Enforcement” project.  9 4th ENISA/EC3 Workshop: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  10 8th CERT workshop - Part II (co-organised with EC3): https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert- workshop-part-ii  11 9th CERT ENISA/EC3 Workshop Part II: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/9th-cert-workshop- part-ii  “ENISA should bridge the  gap between CERTs and  Law Enforcement by  further collaborating with  the European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3) at Europol and  Eurojust.”  Respondent for the public sector  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/9th-cert-workshop-part-ii https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/9th-cert-workshop-part-ii  Leading the way  37  7.1.1.3 Digital Forensics  Law enforcement agencies are by nature typically restrictive in the exchange of evidence. Nevertheless, in  order to solve cases, players from different countries should be involved, which opens a door for ENISA to  assist in the process related to digital forensics. For instance, ENISA could  further approach the operational  level of LEAs in order to develop training scenarios where it would be able to bring its expertise on subjects  such as how to exchange information securely using Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP) or how to take forensics samples from a procedural point of view.  7.1.1.4 ENISA as Europol observer  Even though fighting cybercrime is not its mandate, many communities  look to ENISA for guidance. Therefore, ENISA could work more closely  with EC3 on operational activities, for example, as an observer Through  an observer status,  ENISA could gain knowledge, for instance on how  handle botnets, while bringing technical expertise to the EC3, which  would ensure a mutually beneficial collaboration between the two  Agencies.  7.1.2 LEA – CSIRT collaboration activities  7.1.2.1 CEPOL – trainings/networking  Whilst ENISA has organised joint LEA/CSIRT trainings12 13, it should also  look into the possibility of collaborating with the European Police  College14 (CEPOL).  There is added value of bringing CSIRT expertise into the law enforcement community as  police and CSIRTs are interested in similar topics, such as taking down botnets, handling incidents, etc.  In  many cases LEAs outsource technical work to CSIRTs providing a clear link between the organisations, which  can be built upon.  Another idea in this area is for ENISA to engage prosecutors or at least raise their awareness about activities  in the CSIRT world. Similarly, awareness about prosecution phases should be raised for CSIRTs. However, for  the latter case ENISA is less qualified as it has limited knowledge on how the police operates.  7.1.2.2 Guidance to CSIRTs on H2020 funding  Another topic that was discussed is the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation15, also  known as “Horizon 2020”. A participant mentioned that there are calls about joint collaboration between  CSIRTs and LEAs that promote joint exercise to simulate cooperation. Here, ENISA could encourage CSIRTs  12 Cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies - Advising in Cyber Crime Cases:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#writing-security- advisories  13 Cooperation in the Area of Cybercrime: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training- resources/legal-cooperation#cooperation-in-the-area-of-cybercrime  14 The European Police College (CEPOL) is an EU agency dedicated to providing training and learning opportunities to  senior police officers on issues vital to the security of the European Union and its citizens:  https://www.cepol.europa.eu/  15 The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation: https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#writing-security-advisories https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#writing-security-advisories https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#cooperation-in-the-area-of-cybercrime https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/training/training-resources/legal-cooperation#cooperation-in-the-area-of-cybercrime https://www.cepol.europa.eu/ https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/  Leading the way  38  or LEAs to participate in calls to get funding through grants by coaching and providing guidance. In fact, it  seems many CSIRTs and LEAs want to participate in such calls but have no idea what the Commission might  be looking for.  7.2 Respondent views  When asked whether cooperation between ENISA and EC3 should go beyond the current ENISA/EC3  workshops and if both organisations should be more involved at the level of operational cooperation, the  response was mixed. For some respondents it seemed obvious that ENISA should bridge the gap between  CSIRTs and law enforcement by further collaborating with the EC3 and even with Eurojust. Others disagreed,  claiming that ENISA should stick to technical aspects and not go into, for instance, forensics as this topic  could be too politically touchy.  One respondent from a law enforcement agency summed up the current situation and needs in the following  way: ‘Not only is cybercrime borderless, it also moves seamlessly from one sector to another’. Nobody wins  if they try to solve the issues on their own without sharing information on what is going on. However,  information sharing requires trust as a lot is at stake. For instance, a bank runs a huge reputational risk if its  clients learn about cyber-attacks affecting their bank accounts, and hence will be reluctant to share  information about security issues. However, ‘by not sharing information, you cannot learn from others’, as  one respondent stated. By teaming up in public-private partnerships (PPP), for instance, banks and financial  institutions in partnership with law enforcement, trust can be built and information shared which benefit all  parties. In this context, ENISA could develop a framework on how information can be shared, what  information can be shared (overcoming national privacy laws) and with whom. By doing this, ENISA would  raise its profile among LEAs and make a valuable contribution. The idea of  ENISA expanding its scope and developing PPPs (academia, National and  Governmental CSIRTs, Eurojust and registry services, etc.) was echoed by  another respondent.  Some additional concrete examples of possible trainings included to  mainstream the topic of cybercrime in the general curricula. The  respondent claimed that a lot of cooperation stays at a high (abstract) level  of organisations when it actually needs to focus on the operational levels.  By this, the respondent meant that trainings needs to reach further than  just a few specialists, otherwise, the gaps in skills set will be too wide within  organisations. Very often, only one person from each organisation is sent  to a training, when in reality, the awareness needs to be broader, including  all levels of the organisation from the local police officers to the specialised  units. More workshops and trainings on forensics would be good as well as  training of colleagues on the police force about the dark net and how it is  used by criminals for information sharing. Respondents were in favour of  ENISA collaborating with CEPOL to organise joint LEA/CSIRT trainings.  A majority of the respondents were positive to the idea of ENISA supporting (through coordination and  guidance) CSIRTs/operational security communities on how to participate in Horizon 2020 calls to obtain  additional funding. One National CSIRT affirmed that ENISA could support initiatives relating to funding for  CSIRTs. Another respondent stated that often there are situations were different teams are working on the  Leading the way  39  same solutions and sometimes common projects with small funding can make a big difference. ENISA could  assist different teams from different countries to work together, using joint resources instead of each CSIRT  going for it alone.  7.3 Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (based on 2014 report & 2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS –PILLAR III: CSIRT SUPPORT CSIRTS TO BETTER COLLABORATE WITH LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES  TIMELINE  ENISA – EUROPOL collaboration   Joint workshops   ENISA observer status and knowledge transfer  Short – medium term  Good practice library for CSIRTs and LEAs   Taxonomy report   Fight against cybercrime  Short – medium term  Facilitate more joint CSIRT-LEA events and training   Mainstream the topic of cybercrime in the general curricula   Additional workshops and trainings on forensics and the dark net  Short – medium term  Digital forensics – knowledge sharing Short – medium term  Enhanced support to the fight against cybercrime   ENISA to explore possibility of LEAs to enter into public-private partnerships (PPP)   ENISA could develop an information sharing framework  Short – long term  LEA-CSIRT collaboration activities   CEPOL trainings/networking   Guidance to CSIRTs on H2020 funding  Short – medium term  Awareness raising  Enhance the awareness and up-take of ENISA materials (CSIRT-LEA) by advertising them more  widely, within the CSIRT community / other operational communities & LEAs  Short – medium term  Leading the way  40  8 Operational perspective Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises  ENISA has been a facilitator for EU Member States by supporting the exchange of good practices in the area  of Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises through a series of pan-European cyber exercises such as Cyber  Europe and Cyber Atlantic. In addition, ENISA published a ‘Good Practice Guide on National Exercises’ with  the aim to assist European stakeholders to design, plan, execute and monitor  a national exercise on the resilience of public communication networks.  Finally, ENISA is organising annual international conferences covering topics  in the area of cyber crisis cooperation and exercises.  8.1 Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management  ENISA’s work package for 2015 focuses on cyber crisis cooperation and  management in the following topics:   Pan-European cyber exercises management (Cyber Europe and  EuroSOPEx);   Enhance the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises;   Promote maintain and improve EU cyber crisis cooperation plans  and procedures (e.g., EU SOPs), which includes bringing closer the  cyber crisis cooperation community.  This work package focuses on ENISA further enhancing its methodology, training outreach and technical  capability to organise large-scale cyber crisis exercises in addition to seeking to facilitate the planning of the  next pan European Cyber Exercise in 2015-2016.  8.2 The road ahead – the ENISA perspective  During the internal ENISA workshop a number of action points for the Agency’s work were brought forward  and subsequently included in the survey and interview questions.  8.2.1 Cyber Crisis Management and Contingency Planning  ENISA has developed a good practice guide on national risk assessment and offers regular trainings on the  topic. Additionally, ENISA has led a study on cybersecurity crisis  management and is currently leading a study on general crisis  management. ENISA should be able to offer a training on the  latter by 2016.  8.2.2 EU-Level NIS Cooperation (EU-SOPs)  The EU-SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) give guidance on  how to manage major cyber incidents that would escalate to a  crisis. ENISA has been and will remain heavily involved in the  development of the EU-SOPs.  As the EU-SOPs will evolve in the context of the NIS Directive, potential cooperation between the teams  within ENISA can be sought. First, it was identified in Cyber Europe 2014 that the EU-SOPs should include  “ENISA should have a  key role in preparedness  measures for cyber crisis  management.”  One National Liaison Officer  respondent  Leading the way  41  procedures for technical cooperation for incident handling (currently it contains only operational  cooperation procedures for crisis management.  Second, a Commission initiative under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) cybersecurity pillar currently  looks at the possibility of building on existing tools and capabilities, for further developing of a common  platform for Member States to cooperate during cybersecurity incidents, crises and to exchange relevant  information on a trust basis. ENISA’s experience in fostering cooperation during simulated cyber crises will  be valuable for this CEF initiative promoted by the Commission. In this context, ENISA should play a relevant  role.  8.3 Cyber Exercises  8.3.1 Pan European Cyber Exercises (Cyber Europe series)  ENISA will continue organising the Cyber Europe series every two  years while developing new exercising opportunities on a more  regular basis. Synergies within ENISA can be sought with regards  to exercises and trainings: future technical exercises should  reference related trainings offered by ENISA and vice versa.  8.3.2 Supporting other Cyber Exercises  ENISA has developed a Cyber Exercise Platform to support the  planning and execution of Cyber Europe exercises. This platform will be opened in 2016 to Member States  so that they can use it to plan and execute their own exercises.  8.4 Respondent views  One EU Official stated that ENISA is trying its best given the size of the organisation and considering that the  bar is getting raised by the digital Commissioners. On the subject of cyber crises management, the same  respondent argued that in a moment of crisis cooperation is key and it allows for things to be accomplished  faster. Unfortunately, CSIRTs have a limited view on what is going on beyond their own field and there is a  disconnection between the local (MS) and central (EU) levels. They know their national competence, like in  the case of the Icelandic volcano eruption where Eurocontrol [25] played a crucial role as a pan-European  player. Still EU MSs do not act and it seems that a cyber-crisis is needed for them to take action on crisis  coordination. What is needed is an EU-level framework for crisis management within the cyber sector.  Respondents from various stakeholder groups agreed that the Cyber Europe exercises help develop practical  cooperation between different stakeholders during cross-border incidents. As one CSIRT respondent put it:  ‘They help foster trust building and building of relations’. The relationship building extended, in some cases,  beyond the stakeholders of the national or governmental CSIRT, and allowed for further development of  practical cooperation in-country.  The ENISA cyber exercises, including the Cyber Europe series, were also considered to help the operational  security community, including CSIRTs, to identify gaps and help towards stronger cooperation in Europe.  However, while respondents from most stakeholder groups agreed to this statement, one respondent  pointed out that ‘when it comes to gaps, on paper, the official procedures for contacting CSIRTs is good but  Leading the way  42  in reality you contact those you know. Thus, gaps in developing personal relations still exist. Nonetheless,  having the official contacts is important and used as a fall-back  mechanism’.  Respondents saw the ENISA cyber exercise material as relevant and  useful to operational security professionals, in particular from the  Member State bodies, especially the SOPs. However, as one  respondent pointed out, if a crisis occurs, not all Member States were  likely to follow the SOPs as these are not mandatory and ENISA has  to rely on the good will of the Member States. Therefore, the use of  the procedures should be made, if possible, mandatory.  Feedback on the ENISA Cyber Europe exercises can be summarised in  the following themes:   Content: Both respondents from the national and governmental CSIRT community and EU official  stated that the Cyber Europe Exercises could be more technical in their nature. This may include  more advanced technical challenges (i.e. test effect of APTs to organisations (detection, reaction,  prevention) and more collaboration on the crisis management level. In addition to having more  topics on privacy and cloud computing and more international industry generic and specific  exercises, including red teaming and  force on force. One of the respondents  went as far as to say that while the  Cyber Exercises do satisfy the political  agenda in Europe and show that things  are being done in the cyber domain, it  would serve more purpose to steer  away from the politics and go deeper  into the technical, practical and realistic  aspects of the cyber world. The current  scenarios presented by ENISA were  perceived as highly tailored to the  political level and while they are well- prepared they should focus more on  technical aspects. The same respondent  stressed that the NATO exercises, although a bit too ‘military’, were good examples of great  exercises as they are more practical and realistic.   Frequency: For some respondents, it was also preferable to increase the frequency of the Cyber  Europe Exercises from every second year to twice a year, even though this would make it harder for  the participants to find funding for, it would be more beneficial.   Scope: It was seen as a positive development that the Cyber Europe Exercises are extending their  reach to include the private sector. CSIRTs were believed to benefit from engaging more with the  private sector since, for the most part, if/when something happens it happens in the private sector,  and in many cases the private sector holds more critical resources and information.  36%  5% 7%  25%  27%  ENISA cyber exercises help the  Operational security community to  identify gaps and help towards stronger  cooperation in Europe  agree  disagree  n/a  neutral  strongly agree  “The Cyber Europe series is  very useful and important  as it helps to fill the gaps  and study new technical  challenges.”  Respondent from a Member State body  Leading the way  43   Geography: With regards to the issue involving the growing size of participants in Cyber Europe  exercises, regional exercises could be considered, according to a respondent from a national CSIRT.  For example, a Baltic Nordic Regional exercise or grouping could be used as a test case. The idea of  regional grouping was also brought forward by an EU official who claimed that the Cyber Exercises  would be better suited to tailor to a smaller audience based more on regional boundaries. The  reason for this, according to the respondent, was that in a real cyber crisis, the situation looks a lot  different. Entities handle incidents locally and regionally and very rarely on such as scale as the  ENISA Cyber Exercises.   Results: One respondent pointed out that following an exercise, the outcomes disseminated by  ENISA were very generalised and politically correct, when, in reality,  the participants were keen on learning the exact outcomes on how  specific teams/individuals performed, for instance in a possible  comparison or ranking scheme. This was echoed by an EU official  interested in raising awareness at the political level who suggested  that the feedback received from the exercises could be better  disseminated and spread to persons who were more difficult to  reach, or individuals, entities that did not participate in the exercises.   Improved means of information sharing was stressed by several  stakeholders who urged ENISA to also disseminate the feedback  from the exercises to people who were not able to attend. ENISA was  also requested to put in place effective mechanisms for information  sharing and not limit it to conference calls.  When asked about additional CSIRT focused areas and activities to be covered during Cyber Europe  exercises, the respondents provided several suggestions, including:   Increased technical focus: More on data protection, on social media and about Internet  infrastructure and Cyber Supply Chain. More on developing European Cyber capabilities, such as a  European search engine, and on cultivating European cyber independence in the face of firmware,  hardware or computers are made in China and the US – not Europe.   Including the political level: One respondent stressed the importance of linking cyber to the EU  political level by building on the cyber scenario. This would allow the ministries and politicians to  understand the cyber domain better and, conversely, the technical experts would better  understand the political level  8.5 Proposed Roadmap to 2020 (2015 results)  PROPOSED ACTIONS- PILLAR IV: CYBER CRISIS COOPERATION AND EXERCISES TIMELINE  EU-level Cyber Crisis Cooperation   Cyber crisis training with a pan-European focus   Elaboration of EU-level SOP   Involvement in the development of a MS platform for cooperation during cybersecurity incidents  Short – long  term  Cyber Exercises  Short – long  term  Leading the way  44   Continued implementation of Cyber Europe series (bi-annual): sharper technical focus and regional  groups.

However, much of the feedback was not directly linked to the  ENISA four activity pillars focused on CSIRTs. Hence, this chapter starts off by capturing a number of  respondent views to provide a 360° understanding of the possible future direction of ENISA.  9.1.1 Expanded constituency  Overall, the respondent views and findings concur with the findings of the 2014 report. ENISA is still  considered to be the representative voice of the European CSIRT community and of other operational  communities. Several respondents even pointed to the possibility for ENISA to expand its constituency  (working increasingly with CSIRTs in various sectors) and coverage beyond the borders of the EU. For  instance, there was a call for ENISA to enhance communication with non-EU countries and to establish  minimal security standards for Member States on strategic and operational levels.  9.1.2 European cyber independence  Echoing the words of Commissioner Oettinger, one respondent called for a stronger mandate that would  allow ENISA to drive the EU’s technological independence. ENISA has a real possibility of becoming  instrumental in the EU’s ambition to regain ‘digital sovereignty” and to reassert its digital independence.  This new branch of strategic activities would examine the ‘bigger picture’, including industrial politics, and  provide input in the form of strategic studies and workshops.  As an extension of this reasoning it was suggested, that ENISA should focus more on cybersecurity aspects  of industry, social networks and data protection related issues. This could include and in-depth look into the  actual cyber threats and impacts related to industry, as well as social networks.  9.2 Discussion on key findings  9.2.1 Facilitator and connector role  The respondents attest to a strong support of ENISA’s role as the facilitator and coordinator of the CSIRT  community, as well as a middle ground mediator between the CSIRTs and the Commission. ENISA bridges  the gap between the technical focus of the CSIRTs and the policy focus of the Commission.  ENISA should also strengthen the ties between the CSIRTs and LEAs through further collaborating with the  European Cybercrime Centre at Europol, Eurojust and CEPOL.  In addition, ENISA should expand its reach and scope and develop private-public partnerships (academia,  other non-governmental CSIRTs, and registry services).  Leading the way  46  9.2.2 Focus and develop further exercises and workshops  ENISA has a key role in supporting the CSIRT and other operational communities through its pertinent and  state of the art workshops and exercises. With regards to Cyber Europe exercises, we received different  suggestions such as focusing the exercises more on crisis management. These include more advanced  technical challenges to the exercises, and to accommodate the growing size of participants by grouping them  regionally, while also inviting participations from the private sector. A point for improvement is the  information sharing following an exercise in order for the individual teams and participants to be able to  compare levels of expertise, results, etc.  9.2.3 Putting new topics on the agenda  Being uniquely positioned in the cybersecurity landscape, the CSIRT community welcomes the Agency to  make use of its experience and to push the envelope by being bolder and taking a clearer stance on in its  publications and to proactively reaching out and endorsing initiatives when identifying them. While the  materials pertaining to the baseline capabilities (pillar I) and capacity building (pillar II) remain vital  contributions to the community, there is also scope for a sharper technical focus of the ENISA reports, on  the one hand and more policy oriented reports on the other.  It was also suggested that ENISA uses its unique position to bring ‘new’ topics and trends or important  developments in the sector forward. For instance, ENISA could engage in discussions on topics such as  network neutrality, acceptable traffic management and security, including levels of incident protection  allowed. This could be done through short ‘viewpoints’ or white papers, which can be produced within a  short time frame, requiring less effort than the typical ENISA studies.  ENISA should find multipliers to ensure that the important work done by its teams reaches even further,  beyond the established communities. Repeatedly the “modest” size and strongly limited budget of the  Agency was highlighted as biggest obstacle for the agency to perform up to all expectations.  Leading the way  47  9.3 The Way Ahead: roadmap for ENISA CSIRT Support  The proposed high-level roadmap 2020 presented below provides an overview of possible areas of priority on the basis of previous chapters.

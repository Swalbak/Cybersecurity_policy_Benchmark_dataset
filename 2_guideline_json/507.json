Despite the significant debate on  the technical specifications and the technological maturity of 5G, which are under discussion in various fora3,  5G is expected to affect positively and significantly several industry sectors ranging from ICT to industry  sectors such as car and other manufacturing, health and agriculture in the period up to and beyond 2020.  5G will be driven by the influence of software on network functions, known as Software Defined Networking  (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The key concept that underpins SDN is the logical  centralization of network control functions by decoupling the control and packet forwarding functionality of  the network. NFV complements this vision through the virtualization of these functionalities based on recent  advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualization. Considering the technological maturity of the  technologies that 5G can leverage on, SDN is the one that is moving faster from development to production.  To realize the business potential of SDN/5G, a number of technical issues related to the design and operation  of Software Defined Networks need to be addressed. Amongst them, SDN/5G security is one of the key  issues, that needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to avoid missing the business opportunities  arising from SDN/5G.  In this report, we review threats and potential compromises related to the security of SDN/5G networks.  More specifically, this report contains a review of the emerging threat landscape of 5G networks with  particular focus on Software Defined Networking. It also considers security of NFV and radio network access.  To provide a comprehensive account of the emerging threat SDN/5G landscape, this report has identified  related network assets and the security threats, challenges and risks arising for these assets.  Driven by the  identified threats and risks, this report has also reviewed and identified existing security mechanisms and  good practices for SDN/5G/NFV, and based on these it has analysed gaps and provided technical, policy and  organizational recommendations for proactively enhancing the security of SDN/5G.  This report proposes 6 technical recommendations and 3 organizational recommendations:   Technical Recommendations  o Recommendation 1 (for Network providers): Mandate encryption and authentication in  NBI, SBI and EWBI.  o Recommendation 2 (for Network providers): Identify and monitor exposed  functionalities of SDN controllers.  o Recommendation 3 (for Network and Service providers): Control and monitor running  application resources.  o Recommendation 4 (for Network, Service providers and End users): Holistic Support for  Security policies.  o Recommendation 5 (for Administrators): Access control and Credentials enforcement  o Recommendation 6 (for Developers): Application Isolation and Sandboxing.  1 www.5g-ppp.eu/roadmaps  2 http://ioeassessment.cisco.com/  3 http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1734-ran_5g  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  07   Organisational Recommendations  o Recommendation 7 (for Service providers): Develop incident response capabilities and  information sharing practices among telecom operators.  o Recommendation 8 (for Administrators): Keep systems up to date  o Recommendation 9 (for Network and Service providers): Use adequate security  methods  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  08  1. Introduction  Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new network paradigm moving rapidly from development to  production environments. The key concept of the new paradigm is the decoupling of the control and packet  forwarding functionality of the network. In classic networks, these two functionalities were the responsibility  of the forwarding devices of the network. In SDN, these two functionalities have been separated into two  functionality planes: the control plane and the data plane. The separation of these two functionality planes  in SDNs has two significant consequences: (a) it reduces the difficulty in the configuration and alteration of  the control functions of the network, as this functionality has no longer the responsibility of the forwarding  devices of the network that tend to have proprietary implementations (e.g., operating systems), and (b) it  enables the implementation of more consistent control policies through fewer and uniformly accessible  controllers.  The concept of SDN has been around for many years having its roots in “active programmable networking”  in academic research and the research literature4.  In contrast to the early incarnations of SDN, the “modern”  SDN realisation paradigm completely separates the Control and Data planes for increased functionality,  control and programmability.  The potential benefits of SDN have attracted the interest of the wider IT community with many parties  realigning the still “cloudy” concept of SDN, to fit their purposes. A large number of research and scientific  reports, which are discussed in this report, have already been published reciting the architecture of SDN and  the potentially benefits on simple and complex network Infrastructures. In summary, SDN is seen as a means  of providing a more efficient, extremely flexible, cost effective, and potentially fully automated holistic  network management and provisioning.  Policy Context  The value of threat analysis and emerging trends in cyber security is prioritized in the Cyber Security Strategy  for the EU5. The ENISA Threat Landscape is aligned with this EU strategy and aims to contribute by identifying  emerging trends in cyber-threats and analysing the evolution of cyber-crime (see ENISA’s report on  Understanding the Importance of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe6).  Moreover, in the new ENISA regulation7  the need of analysing current and emerging risks is highlighted. The  new ENISA regulation stipulates that “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate,  4  Psounis, Konstantinos. \"Active networks: Applications, security, safety, and architectures.\" Communications  Surveys, IEEE 2.1 (1999): 2-16.  5  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  6  ENISA, “Understanding the Importance of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe”,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines- for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks  7  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  09  with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. More specifically, it is stated that it should  “enable effective responses to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  Therefore it is evident that the ENISA Threat Landscape makes a significant contribution to the EU Cyber  Security Strategy, as it streamlines and consolidates available information on cyber-threats and their  evolution.  This study on “Software Defined Networks Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide” is one of the  deliverables (“WPK1.1-D2: Risk Assessment on two emerging technology/application areas” that focuses on  SDN/5G) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 20158, which aims to provide a contribution in the  assessment of the exposure to cyber threats of the envisioned 5G networks with particular focus on their  backbone networking technology represented by Software Defined Networking. As such, it contributes in  the definition of the current state of the art as far as cyber security is concerned in this domain and it directly  contributes to the cyber security assessment by addressing industry concerns in the area.  Scope  This report contributes to the definition of a threat landscape, which is an overview of current and emerging  threats applicable to the SDN/5G technologies and their associated trends. Since 5G is a general term that  integrates various networking technologies with different technological maturity, this study focuses on  backbone network operation technologies, i.e., Software Defined Networking. Around these core  technologies, other integral components of 5G, including radio access and NFV are also discussed. This  discussion, however, is scoped by the relation of these other 5G components to SDN.  The goal is to identify threats and needs for enhancing the security of 5G networks with particular focus on  SDN, and to provide good practices and recommendations for threats that are considered important.  Target Audience  This report can be useful to carry out detailed threat analyses and risk assessments for telecom operators  and service providers according to their particular needs and mandate (e.g., protect specific based on asset  impact analysis, respond to specific vulnerabilities with customized mitigation measures etc.). The threat  exposure of SDN/5G that is presented in this study may be deepened by telecom operators through their  own further threat analysis and risk assessment. Where this is necessary, the aim of this report is to provide  a generic, yet comprehensive, set of asset and threat details that can serve as a starting point for further  analysis. Deeper analysis may also be informed by the assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and impact  statements of this report in as far as they are relevant to the concrete assets deployed by the particular  telecom operators.  Moreover, the SDN/5G threat landscape presented in this report may be useful to policy-makers for  understanding the current state of threats and respective mitigation practices and measures. The threat  8 “ENISA Work Programme 2015”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/amending-work- programme-2015  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/amending-work-programme-2015 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/amending-work-programme-2015  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  10  landscape identified in this report may support policy actions in the areas of 5G networks, SDN, NFV, cyber  security, critical infrastructure protection, Internet of Things9 and Industrial Internet.  Furthermore, the SDN/5G security and threat research and technology reports collected and analysed by  this study provide a comprehensive collection of information regarding related cyber security threats. To  this end, this report targets also individual researchers, who might want to obtain access to these identified  sources in order to use them for their own research purposes.  Structure of this document  The remainder of this report is organised as follows:  Chapter 2 gives insight into the methodology adopted for conducting this study.  Chapter 3 presents the architectural framework of SDN and describes the separation of control and  forwarding functions, logically centralized network control elements and programmable interfaces at  multiple levels.  Chapter 4 presents the SDN/5G asset types identified in our study by giving an overview of them and  identifying their dependencies in the form of a mind map.  Chapter 5 presents a taxonomy of the threat types that our analysis has shown for the identified assets.  Interrelated threats have been grouped to form a taxonomy that is presented as mind map.  Chapter 6 introduces the threat agents of SDN/5G.  Chapter 7 reviews existing and emerging (i.e., under development) practices for mitigating the identified  threats. It also identifies and analyses the gaps identified in addressing current and emerging threats.  Chapter 8 provides technical and organisational recommendations arising in the context of our study.  Finally, Chapter 9 provides concluding remarks.  The report includes also three annexes, containing more detailed information on SDN/5G assets (Annex A)  and their taxonomy (Annex B), and SDN/5G threats (Annex C).  The provision of more detailed material as  annexes was necessary  in order to keep the size of the report within reasonable boundaries, and at the  same time give to interested stakeholders access to more comprehensive lists of SDN/5G assets and threats.  A general note that is important to make prior to the rest of this report is that all material, which has been  referenced by a URL in footnotes was last accessed on the day of publication of this study.  9  Petroulakis, Nikolaos E., et al. \"A privacy-level model of user-centric cyber-physical systems.\" Human Aspects  of Information Security, Privacy, and Trust.

Methodology  The methodology adopted in this study is in line with the methodology introduced in the ENISA’s Cyber  Threat Landscape.10 According to this methodology, someone has first to identify valuable assets and then  perform a risk assessment, which identifies the necessary protection levels for these assets. Subsequently,  security measures that can achieve the required protection levels by mitigating fully or partly the assessed  risks are identified. Any risks, which are not addressed by these measures, might be transferred or accepted.  The elements of risk are graphically depicted in Figure 1.  Threats have a key role in defining the risk assessment especially when considering the components of risks.  ISO 27005, the widely adopted standard in the area defines that risks emerge when: “Threats abuse  vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”.  Following this methodology, we have identified assets, threats, existing and emerging security measures for  SDN/5G. These constitute the core of the SDN Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide (STL) presented  in this report. Based on this core, we have also identified gaps that originate from non-mitigated threats and  provided relevant recommendations. An additional key element of our methodology is that identification  and analysis has been based on a study of the related literature, without attempting any experimental or  other form of validation of the claims made within this literature.  Figure 1 - Elements of risks  Furthermore, this study does not consider the use of any specific SDN equipment or the operational  processes and services. Thus, it has not been possible to make a detailed and quantitative assessment of the  impact and vulnerabilities of assets. Such activities could only be performed by asset owners and would  probably require supporting tools for carrying out more comprehensive risk assessments in complex  environments.  10  “ENISA Threat Landscape 2014”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  Assets  Vulnerabilities  Measures  Threat  Attacker  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  12  3. SDN/5G Architecture  SDN Architecture  The main principle that underpins an SDN’s architecture can be summarized as the separation of control and  forwarding functions, logically centralized network control elements and programmable interfaces at  multiple levels.  Figure 2 - Typical SDN Architecture Topology  The typical architecture of SDNs according to the Open Networking Foundation11 is shown in Figure 2. As  shown in the figure, this architecture involves three separate functionality planes:   The Data Plane – i.e., the plane responsible for the data forwarding functionality of the network.  The functionality of this plane is realized through a set of physical network devices (network  elements).   The Control Plane – i.e., the plane responsible for the control functionality of the network. The  functionality of this plane is realized through a set of controllers and devices that facilitate the  creation and destruction of network flows and paths. In an SDN, different controllers have control  responsibility over disjoint subsets of forwarding devices. Through these forwarding devices, they  11  Open Networking Foundation, https://www.opennetworking.org/  https://www.opennetworking.org/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  13  control different parts of the SDN. Typical SDN Controllers include OpenDaylight12, NSX13, Nuage14,  OpenContrail15, ONOS16, Beacon17, Floodlight18, NOX19, ONIX20, POX21 and Maestro22.   The Application Plane – i.e., the plane responsible for generic network management auditing, and  reporting functionalities (e.g., SDN management, monitoring and security). The functionality of this  plane is realized through different network management applications (e.g. Network visualization).  The SDN architecture defines also the key interfaces between the different components in it. These  interfaces are:   The East/West bound API –  This interface is implemented by the different controllers of the SDN  and is used to facilitate communications between them. Representative examples of such APIs are  ALTO23 and Hyperflow24.   The Southbound API – This interface is implemented by the different forwarding devices in the SDN  to enable the communication between these devices and the controllers of the network.  Representative examples of such APIs are OpenFlow25, ForCES26, PCEP27, NetConf28 and IRS29.  12  OpenDaylight: open platform for programmable networks, https://www.opendaylight.org/  13  NSX: Vmware network virtualization platform, http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx  14  Nuage: Nuage Networks network virtualization platform,  http://www.nuagenetworks.net/products/virtualized-services-platform/  15  OpenContrail: open source network virtualization platform for the cloud, http://www.opencontrail.org/  16  ONOS: open carrier-grade SDN network operating system designed, http://onosproject.org/  17  Beacon: cross-platform and modular Java-based OpenFlow controller,  https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Home  18  Floodlight: open enterprise-class SDN controller, http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/  19  NOX: open c++ based SDN development controller platform, http://www.noxrepo.org/  20  Koponen, Teemu, et al. \"Onix: A Distributed Control Platform for Large-scale Production Networks.\" OSDI.

Representative examples of such APIs are FML30, Procera31, Frenetic32, Maple33 and RESTful34.  The final purpose of separating the network’s control and forwarding planes is to provide various benefits;  as simplified administration, automated reconfiguration and performance improvements, however it can  also introduces some significant challenges in network security. In addition this approach reduces the CAPital  EXpenditure (CAPEX), the initial money investment of a company as well as the OPerating EXpenditure  (OPEX) that is the ongoing cost of the investment.  In the following, we identify the key assets in an SDN that  may become the source of security risks for it.  5G Design Principles  The fifth generation of mobile technology known as 5G is positioned to address the demands and business  of the future internet. Whether the need is to download multimedia content, provide content for robots and  autonomous cars or enable distant healthcare, 5G will be the technology behind the scenes and will be on  the forefront of all consumer and business applications. Experts speculate that 5G will be in place by the end  of the decade.  At the time of writing this report, there is no standardized architecture for 5G access. An illustration of the  5G architecture as envisioned by the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN)35 alliance is depicted in  Figure 3.  30  Katta, Naga Praveen, Jennifer Rexford, and David Walker. \"Logic programming for software-defined  networks.\" Workshop on Cross-Model Design and Validation (XLDI).

As such, the 5G architecture is a native SDN/ NFV  architecture covering aspects ranging from devices, (mobile/ fixed) infrastructure, network functions, value  enabling capabilities and all the management functions to orchestrate the 5G system. The architecture  comprises three layers and an E2E management and orchestration entity.”36  The infrastructure resource layer contains any physical device including mobile devices, Internet of Things  (IoT) devices etc. (5G devices), as well as fixed networking devices (networking nodes, cloud nodes, access  nodes etc.). This layer utilizes the SDN/NFV programmability as well as the configurability of 5G devices in  order to meet the 5G design specifications (e.g. bandwidth, capacity latency).  The business enablement layer contains all the necessary functions for the 5G converged network in the  form of modular architecture building blocks. These blocks along with configuration parameters can be  evoked from a common repository upon request depending on the use case.  The E2E management and orchestration entity has access to manage and orchestrate the above mentioned  architectural blocks. In addition, it defines network slices for each use case, interconnects the relevant  functions of the network, assigns the proper configuration to meet E2E specifications and maps all these to  the network entities of the infrastructure resource layer.  The business application layer contains applications and services of the 5G network operators or other  enterprises that use the network. An interface to the E2E management and orchestration entity can be used  to map an application to existing network slices, or to create new slices for the applications.  36 “NGMN 5G white paper”, https://www.ngmn.org/5g-white-paper/5g-white-paper.html  Business Application Layer Use cases,  Business models  and Value proposition  Business Enablement Layer Library of modular network  functions& value enabling capabilities  Infrastructure Resources Layer Cloud, Networking  and Radio Access E2  E  m  an ag  em en  t  an  d  o  rc hi  st ra  to r  5G  https://www.ngmn.org/5g-white-paper/5g-white-paper.html  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  16  4. SDN/5G Assets  Methodological conventions  As commonly defined, in our study, an asset is anything that has value and therefore requires protection.  Due to their value, assets become the targets of threat agents. Threat agents are human or software agents,  which may wish to abuse, compromise and/or damage assets. Threat agents may perform attacks, which  create threats that pose risks to assets.  In a typical ICT system, assets can be: (a) hardware, software and communication components; (b)  communication links between them; (c) data that control the function of the system, are produced and/or  consumed by it, or flow within it; (d) the physical and organizational infrastructure within which the ICT  system is deployed, and (e) the human agents who interact with the system and may affect its operation  (e.g., users, system administrators etc.).  In the overview of SDN assets that we provide in the remainder of this report, we have categorized assets  into the above categories. Furthermore, we have grouped assets according to their position within the  typical SDN architecture, i.e., into data plane, control plane and application plane assets.  Another important consideration has been the inter-domain multi-operator landscape, which refers to the  interconnection of several network operators through specific SLAs.  In the current, non-SDN-based network  model, a network operator is only capable to request network resources from a neighbouring network  operator based on static and agreed SLAs. This is not flexible and requires high negotiation efforts to  facilitate end-to-end QoS through multiple operator networks. Moreover, in contemporary multi-operator  ecosystems, QoS provisioning, as required by industrial applications is not manageable due to different QoS  levels that operators are able to provide37. SDN technology addresses these issues, by providing mechanisms  that enable and allow to access the network infrastructure in different operator domains and provide path- level QoS across different operator domains.  It should be noted that, due to the emerging nature of SDNs, there is no commonly accepted detailed  architecture of data and software components below the 3 architectural layers indicated in Figure 2. Hence,  to provide a thorough asset analysis, we have identified the different types of functionalities, which have  been suggested in the literature for each of the different SDN architecture layers, and mapped them onto  logical functional SDN components, which we, subsequently, refer to as assets. Clearly, these “logical”  software assets may be realized through different groups of actual software components in different SDN  implementations. Nevertheless, we believe that, as a first step towards a security threats analysis, the  reference to “logical” software assets is sufficient.  37 ETICS White paper (2013), https://www.ict-etics.eu/fileadmin/documents/news/ETICS_white_paper_final.pdf  https://www.ict-etics.eu/fileadmin/documents/news/ETICS_white_paper_final.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  17  Categories of SDN Assets  In this part valuable assets of an SDN network infrastructure are presented that are commonly found in the  literature in a hierarchical manner. Based on a single first top layer classification these SDN assets are  distinguished into:   Data Plane Assets:  This asset group includes all assets of the SDN network deployments that include  the physical instances of the network such as switching devices (Switches/Routers) and the  communication medium (wired or wireless). Data plane assets include both hardware and software  (e.g. Firmware, or a more or less full-fledged operating system and software switch) of the so called  network elements.   Control plane Assets: This asset group includes any SDN assets related to the control plane of the  SDN. Such assets include both the hardware (e.g. controllers and Interfaces) and software used to  realize SDN control (e.g. protocols for the controller communication), along with system  configuration and control data.   Application plane Assets: This asset group includes software applications that are used to  implement any network explicitly, directly. Applications can communicate their network  requirements and desired network behaviour to the SDN Controllers via APIs. Application plane  assets include also hardware that is used to run these applications (e.g. Servers)   SDN Users: This asset group includes any User that is using equipment attached to the Data plane  of an SDN deployment. Service-level agreements and regulations can be considered as SDN user  assets as well.   Service provider IT Infrastructure Assets: This asset group includes any component of an IT  infrastructure that is used by or belong to any service provider in the SDN from a billing system to  stored data of an end user in a cloud.   Network service provider physical infrastructure Assets: This asset group includes physical assets  of the network service providers including every construction (e.g. Buildings, data centres etc.),  machinery as well as the power supply networks   Human Assets: This asset group includes any human in the SDN ecosystem from system and network  administrators to simple end users.  A mind map presenting the above taxonomy is shown in Figure 4. A more detailed taxonomy of assets  categorised in deeper taxonomic levels is also provided in Annex A.Annex A:  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  18  Figure 4 - SDN assets threat landscape  It should be noted that the SDN network infrastructure and its respective components/assets, assumed by  our analysis, may belong either to a single network operator (intra-domain case) or to multiple network  operators (inter-domain case).

SDN Threats  SDN brings significant innovation to networking.  Key concepts associated with SDN such as Logically  Centralized Intelligence, Programmability and Network Abstraction establish a basis for future  communications. While significant improvements may be achieved in network security by centralization and  programmability, these two concepts can also attract a new level of threats and attacks.  Security within the SDN paradigm is a challenge, as all layers, sub-layers and components need to  communicate according to strict security policies. In this report, we have attempted to increase awareness  by identifying key valuable assets of the SDN infrastructure that are needed in order to ensure proper  network function and interoperability. As these assets may, however, become the target of attacks, they  become naturally the main driver of threat analysis aimed at securing SDNs.  Taxonomy of SDN/5G Threats  The identification of SDN/5G threats has been based on a study of the related literature, which indicates not  only SDN threats but also generic taxonomies that could be used for classifying them.  One of these taxonomies has been documented in the ENISA report “ENISA Threat Landscape 2014”38  (ETL14). Although this taxonomy has not been developed for SDN/5G threats, our view is that it is generic  enough to be used for classification of such threats. This is because of the similarity of the respective  landscapes, i.e., the Internet Infrastructure and the SDN/5G landscape, which renders the taxonomic  classification presented in ELT14 broadly applicable to the SDN/5G landscape. Furthermore, the adoption of  this taxonomy can make the understanding of the SDN/5G threat landscape easier for the reader.  Based on ETL14, the general categories of threats for the SDN/5G landscape are:   Nefarious activity/abuse (NAA): This threat category is defined as “intended actions that target ICT  systems, infrastructure, and/or networks by means of malicious acts with the aim to either steal,  alter, or destroy a specified target”34   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking (EIH):  This threat category is defined as “actions aiming to  listen, interrupt, or seize control of a third party communication without consent”34   Physical attacks (PA): This threat category is defined as “actions which aim to destroy, expose, alter,  disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to physical assets such as infrastructure, hardware, or  interconnection”34   Damage (DAM): This threat category is defined as intentional actions aimed at causing “ destruction,  harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or reduction in usefulness”34   Unintentional Damage (UD): This threat category is defined as unintentional actions aimed at  causing “ destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or reduction in  usefulness ”34  38 ENISA Threat Landscape 2013, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  20   Failures or malfunctions (FM): This threat category is defined as “insufficient functioning of an  (Internet infrastructure) asset”34. In the case of SDN/5G the assets include those defined in the asset  list.   Outages (OUT): This threat category is defined as “unexpected disruptions of service or decrease in  quality falling below a required level “34   Disaster (DIS): This threat category is defined as “serious disruption of the functioning of a society”34   Legal (LEG): This threat category is defined as “legal actions of third parties (contracting or  otherwise), in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on applicable law” 34  In addition to the above general taxonomy, we also categorise threats depending on whether their source  is an SDN element, a 5G element or a generic network element. Based on this criterion, threats can be further  categorised into:   SDN specific threats39: These are threats related to the elements of the SDN architecture. These  threats fall under the categories “Nefarious activity/abuse” and “Eavesdropping/Interception/  Hijacking”. SDN specific threats are described in detail in Sect. 5.2.   Network Virtualisation threats: These are threats related to the underlying IT infrastructure used for  virtualising network operations. Network Virtualisation specific threats are described in more detail  in Sect. 5.3.   5G/Radio access threats40: These are threats related to the 5G landscape but not specific to the SDN  infrastructure. 5G specific threats include threats related to the wireless medium, the virtualisation  of functions and the multi-operator environment. Threats of the wireless medium are mostly related  to “Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking”; threats on virtualisation are related to “Nefarious  activity/abuse” and “Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking”. 5G specific threats are described in  more detail in Sect. 5.4.   Generic network infrastructure threats: These are threats that any network infrastructure faces  without reference to the 5G and/or SDN landscape. Generic network infrastructure threats fall under  the categories “Physical attacks”, “Damage or loss of equipment”, “Equipment failures or  malfunctions”, “Outages”, “Disaster” and “Legal and business”. Generic network infrastructure  threats are described in more detail in Sect. 5.5.  SDN specific Threats  In the following, we present types of threats that are specific to SDN. Such threats may relate to different  assets in the reference SDN architecture, as shown in Figure 5. For the listed threats, we also identify the  layer of the reference SDN architecture that these threats are primarily related to according to the literature  if relevant.  Data forging: This threat involves compromising an SDN element (e.g., controller, router, switch) in order to  forge network data and launch other attacks (e.g., DOS). Whilst data forging may, in principle, relate to data  39  SDNSecurity.org, “An Overview of Misuse / Attack Cases”, http://sdnsecurity.org/project_SDN-Security- Vulnerbility-attack-list.html  40  Ericsson White paper, “5G Security”, Uen 284 23-3269 | June 2015,  http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/whitepapers/wp-5g-security.pdf  http://sdnsecurity.org/project_SDN-Security-Vulnerbility-attack-list.html http://sdnsecurity.org/project_SDN-Security-Vulnerbility-attack-list.html http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/whitepapers/wp-5g-security.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  21  held by any component of an SDN (e.g., network switches, controllers and/or SDN applications), a threat  specific to SDN consists in forging requests from accessible low level SDN controllers to upper level ones, in  order to drive their decisions on how to redefine large parts of the network. In the literature it has been  identified as a threat related to components in the data plane and the controller plane.  Traffic diversion: This threat involves compromising a network element in order to divert traffic flows and  to enable eavesdropping. Traffic diversion is a threat relating to network elements of the data plane. A  specific kind of traffic diversion that is available in virtualized networks is network slice trespassing. This  occurs when the mandatory isolation between slices is compromised in any active node or when the  enforcing access to a slice in the edge equipment is either bypassed or misconfigured. This ends with alien  traffic circulating on a given slice.  Data Plane Threats Control Plane Threats Application Plane Threats  Figure 5 - Threats of SDN reference architecture  Side channel attack: This threat involves extracting information on existing flow rules that are used by  network elements.  The threat can be realised by exploiting patterns of network operations (e.g. exploiting  the time required for establishing a network connection). Side channel attacks is a threat relating to network  elements of the data plane.  Flooding attack: Flooding attacks involve compromising a SDN component in order to make it flood other  components, which it interacts with. Flooding occurs through the transmission of data that can exhaust  component resources and lead to a reduction or complete shutdown of the service provided by the  component. Flooding attacks occur primarily for network components of the data plane. In such cases, the  threat involves compromising a network component in order to make it flood its controller with network  messages, and overload and eventually exhaust the controller’s resources. Flooding attacks can also occur  at the control plane. In such cases, a controller is flooded with messages from other (malicious) controllers  that can exhaust its resources causing a reduction or complete shutdown of the controller’s service.  Specific  to SDN are amplification flooding attacks where a small stream of requests with a faked sender elicits a  flooding large stream of response.  While protection from such attacks have been devised for many known  network protocol, the exposure of several network functions (NFV) by SDN controllers presents a whole new  landscape of threats.  Compromised EWBI  Compromised  Controller  Attacker  Compromised Application  Attacker  Compromised NE  Attacker  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  22  Software/firmware exploits: This threat involves exploiting vulnerabilities of the software/firmware in order  to cause some malfunction, reduction or disruption of service, eavesdrop data or destroy/compromise data.  Software/firmware exploits may occur in all layers of the SDN reference architecture, and depending on the  layer that they relate to they have been distinguished into network element software/firmware exploits,  controller software/firmware exploits, and SDN applications software/firmware exploits.  Software/firmware exploits of network elements and controllers cause the malfunction or even their  termination of operation. In the case of switches, for example, the exploited switches can drop, slow down,  clone or deviate network traffic. Exploited switches software/firmware can also create forged traffic in order  to exhaust other switches and/or the controllers the switches are connected to.  Denial of Service (DoS): This threat relates to attacks aimed at causing reduction or disruption of the SDN  service. DoS threats may occur in all layers of the SDN reference architecture. At the data plane, DoS can be  caused by attackers, which flood the bandwidth or resources of network elements. This arrack type in many  occasions originate by multiple compromised systems, such as botnets, which are flooding the targeted SDN  with traffic. At the control plane, a DoS can be caused by congesting controllers through a large number of  forged flow arrivals, causing network performance degradation and interruption. Traditional DoS defences’  approaches focus on protecting the data plane, and are therefore ineffective in the cases of SDN control  plane DoS attacks. DoS attacks may also appear at the application plane affecting, for example, network  management applications.  Identity spoofing: Identity spoofing is a threat where a threat agent successfully determines the identity of  a legitimate entity and then masquerades this entity in order to launch further attacks. Identity spoofing is  a threat that can affect any type of software component or human agents. In the case of SDN, identify  spoofing has been identified as an attack affecting mainly SDN controllers (SDN controller identity spoofing).  In this attack, the attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate controller and interacts with the network  elements controlled by the legitimate controller (i.e., elements of the data plane) in order to trigger several  other types of attacks (e.g., instantiate network flows, divert traffic etc.).  API exploitation: This threat involves exploiting the API of a software component in order to launch different  types of further attacks such as the unauthorised disclosure, compromise of integrity and/or destruction of  information, or the unauthorised destruction/degradation of service. In SDN, API exploitation may relate to  all the different types of APIs that may be found in an SDN. These include: (a) the Northbound API  (Northbound API exploitation) that facilitates the communication between SDN controllers and SDN  applications; (b) the Southbound API that facilitates the communication between SDN network elements  and SDN controllers (i.e., Southbound API exploitation), and (c) the Eastbound/Westbound API that  facilitates the communication between SDN controllers (i.e., Eastbound/Westbound API exploitation).  Memory scraping: This threat arises when an attacker scans the physical memory of a software component  in order to extract sensitive information that is it not authorised to have. Whilst in SDN, memory scrapping  can affect components of any layer, this type of threat has been primarily identified for SDN application  servers41. While the memory scrapping threat is exclusive to SDN, a core dump (e.g. as the result of malicious  software) can be used to exploit private data. Furthermore SDN reconfiguration may require reboots that  an attacker could use in order to attack the boot procedure. Once successfully performed, memory scrapping  can be used to extract sensitive SDN data (e.g., flow rules at the Northbound API).  41 J. Hizver, Taxonomic Modeling of Security Threats in Software Defined Networking, BlackHat Conference, August 5-6, 2015,  available from: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Hizver-Taxonomic-Modeling-Of-Security-Threats- In-Software-Defined-Networking-wp.pdf  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Hizver-Taxonomic-Modeling-Of-Security-Threats-In-Software-Defined-Networking-wp.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Hizver-Taxonomic-Modeling-Of-Security-Threats-In-Software-Defined-Networking-wp.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  23  Remote application exploitation: In this threat, an attacker gains access or obtains higher access privileges  to an SDN application by exploiting software vulnerabilities of it.  This can then be used to execute operations  illegitimately.  Traffic sniffing:  Traffic sniffing involves tapping data flows within a network. In SDN, traffic sniffing has been  identified primarily as an attack upon the communication link between an application at the SDN application  plane and a controller at the control plane in order to gain access to important controller configuration data  or application-level credentials. Traffic sniffing can be enabled by the use of weak or no encryption in the  relevant communication link. It should be noted that traffic sniffing might also be used for legitimate reasons  (e.g., for network monitoring and administration) and if used in this manner it should not be regarded as an  attack.  Network Virtualisation Threats  Network virtualisation threats42,43,44,45 are threats related to the underlying IT infrastructure used for  virtualising network operations. Such threats can be distinguished into:  Threats related to servers running virtualised network functions (virtualised host abuse): Virtualisation of  functions and their operation on virtual machines (e.g., a server that can be used as a network switch) is a  common practice in SDN. Therefore traditional security threats for servers running virtualised network  operations such as network monitoring, access control, network management etc. should be considered.46  Threats to data centres hosting SDN operations (Data centre threats): Many SDN systems are deployed  within data centres. Hence, security threats of data centres should be considered, similarly to the server  case. Moreover, data servers are using Data Centre Interconnect (DCI) protocols, which may lack  authentication and encryption to secure the packet contents. Thus an attacker could create spoofed traffic  in such a way that it traverses the DCI links or to create a DoS attack of the DCI connections.  Threats related to virtualization mechanism: (Network Virtualization bypassing): The use of the network  between different tenants need to assure that only legitimated traffic enters or leaves a network slice, but  also that any switching element checks and enforces the traffic isolation by installing legitimate flow rules  preventing slice trespassing.  42  Drutskoy, Dmitry, Eric Keller, and Jennifer Rexford. \"Scalable network virtualization in software-defined  networks.\" Internet Computing, IEEE 17.2 (2013): 20-27.,  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6362137  43  Pearce, Michael, Sherali Zeadally, and Ray Hunt. \"Virtualization: Issues, security threats, and solutions.\" ACM  Computing Surveys (CSUR) 45.2 (2013): 17., http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2431216  44  ETSI GS NFV-SEC 001 V1.1.1 (2014-10): Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV);NFV Security;Problem  Statement, http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf  45  ETSI GS NFV-SEC 003 V1.1.1 (2014-12): Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV);NFV Security;Security and  Trust Guidance, http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV- SEC003v010101p.pdf  46  Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV);NFV Security; Problem Statement,  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6362137 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2431216 http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC003v010101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC003v010101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  24  In reference to the taxonomy of threats outlined in Sect. 2, wireless medium threats fall under the general  category of “Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking”.  5G radio access threats  In SDNs there can also be threats arising due to the use of 5G technology47,48; in particular the use of  wireless communication in 5G. Such threats, as described in49  can be distinguished into:  User emulation: The wireless medium can be exploited by adversaries that mimic incumbent signals.  Nodes launching such attacks can be (i) Greedy mobile nodes that by transmitting fake incumbent signals  force all other users to vacate a specific band (spectrum hole) in order to acquire its exclusive use and (ii)  Malicious mobile nodes (adversaries) that mimic incumbent signals in order to cause Denial of Service  (DoS) attacks. Malicious nodes can cooperate and transmit fake incumbent signals in more than one band,  thus causing extensive DoS attacks making a radio hop from band to band, severely disrupting its  operation.  Spectrum sensing data falsification: The received signal power may enforced to become lower compared  to what path loss models have predicted due to transmission features such as signal fading, multi-path  propagation, etc., 50. This may lead to harmful interference due to undetected primary signals.  MAC layer attack: This category of attacks includes (i) MAC spoofing, where attackers send spurious  messages aiming to disrupt the operation of network(e.g. channel negotiation), (ii) Congestion attacks,  where attackers flood Common Control Channel in order to cause an extended DoS attack and (iii)  Jamming attacks, where attackers cause DoS attacks at this layer by creating interference.  In reference to the taxonomy of threats outlined in Sect. 2, Network Function Virtualization (NFV)51 threats  can be seen as threats under the “Nefarious Activity/Abuse” and “Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking”  categories.  Generic network infrastructure threats  Besides the pure telecommunication infrastructures, in SDN/5G there are interdependencies with other  computing infrastructures such as the cloud that may be used for network virtualisation.

ENISA has produced an extensive and comprehensive report for this  area52. In the following, we highlight the generic network infrastructure threats that should be considered  in addition to the SDN specific threats and the 5G specific threats.  Physical threats: This type of attack refers to actions (attacks) aimed at destroying, disabling, altering or  stealing physical ICT infrastructure assets. This type of threat applies to any network and computing  infrastructure, including SDN/5G infrastructures. Physical threats are very important due to the  virtualisation of networking functions, which may result in deploying such functions in remote servers and  data centres. Despite the existence of physical protection mechanisms (e.g., physical surveillance and  surveillance cameras, security locks, security guards), physical breaches and insider threat attacks still  occur53. Examples of such attacks include fraud, sabotage vandalism, theft, information leakage/sharing,  unauthorised physical access and terrorist attacks.  Damage/loss: This type of threats refers to intentional or unintentional destruction of ICT infrastructure. It  may be physical as for example the destruction of a server or take the form of a cyber damage as, for  example,  mixing-up information in a data centre due to maintenance errors or erroneous system  administration.  Failures/malfunctions: This type of threats refers to failures or insufficient functioning of network and  infrastructure subsystems. Examples of this threat type include failure or malfunctioning of devices  including network elements, controllers and network management applications, disruption of the  communication links, and/or failure of service providers.  Outages: This type of threats refers to the interruption or failure in the supply of a service. In the case of  SDN/5G networks, it includes interruption of support services such as Internet and electricity, the loss of  network connectivity either due to cable errors or the loss of (part of) a wireless network, or loss of human  (e.g. strike of employees of a network operator) or physical resources.  Disaster: A disaster is a sudden incident that interrupts the daily activities of the society. It can be  categorised in disasters caused by the intervention of human (environmental) or natural disasters such as  floods, earthquakes etc.  Legal: Since the 5G landscape is of multi-operator nature, where all operators will be interconnected to  each other, multi-operator related threats are very important. In this landscape, operators of the SDN  infrastructure that will not honestly stick to business agreements (SLAs) should be considered. Moreover,  measures for non-repudiation of SLAs between different operators should be considered.

These tables list SDN/NFV/5G specific threats  (Table 1 - SDN/5G Specific threats and assetsTable 1), and generic network threats (Table 2), respectively.  For each threat, the tables provide:  (a) A brief description of the threat (see “Threat” column), the main type of the threat in reference to  the taxonomy described in the ENISA report on “Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for  Internet Infrastructure”54 that has been overviewed in Sect. 2 of this report. In cases where a threat  falls under more than one categories in the ENISA taxonomy, the additional categories are identified  in the description of the threat.  (b) The assets that the threat affects (see column “Asset types”). This description refers to the asset  listing produced earlier as part of the project.  (c) The potential effect of the threat described in terms of the basic security properties that a threat  can compromise, i.e., confidentiality, integrity or availability (see column “Potential Effect”).  54 Enisa, “Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure”,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-

Threat Agents  According to ELT1455, a threat agent is “someone or something with decent capabilities, a clear intention to  manifest a threat and a record of past activities in this regard”.  ELT14 categorizes thread agents as follows:   Corporations   Hacktivists   Cyber criminals   Cyber terrorists   Script kiddies   Online social hackers   Employees   Nation states  Another categorization of threat agents in the case of SDN may be based on whether or not an agent has  legitimate access to the resources/assets of a network. According to this criterion, and similarly to 56  attackers may be distinguished into:   External attackers: These are attackers with no legitimate access to the SDN network and its  services, but they own appropriate network tools and in some occasions infrastructure that enable  then to interfere with the operation of the SDN network. In addition, these attackers may have  unsupervised access to servers that run virtualised SDN application and they have the ability to  modify the behaviour of these servers by installing rogue software on them. This is a broad category  of attackers including cybercriminals, hacktivists, terrorists, corporations and Nation States.   Internal attackers: These category refers to people that have inside access to the network operator  resources. They can be employees (staff) of the network operator and contractors.  o Dishonest customers: These can be misbehaving end-users that have legitimate/subscribed  access to the SDN network and its services and take advantage of their access to the network  in order to interfere with its operation or to gain illegal access to its services (e.g., by  impersonating another customer).  o Dishonest operators: These are telecom operators or service providers that their network  infrastructure is based on SDN, which attempt to gain competitive advantage over their  competing operators by not honestly sticking to their agreed business agreements (SLAs).  For the SDN landscape, it is crucial for asset owners to be aware of which threats can emerge from different  threat agent groups. The following table (Table 3) presents an overview of this based on the threat agent  categorization of ELT14.  55 “ENISA Threat Landscape 2014”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  56  Askoxylakis, I., et al. \"Securing multi‐operator‐based QoS‐aware mesh networks: requirements and  design options.\" Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 10.5 (2010): 622-646.

Good Practices  This section provides a review of existing techniques, tools and practices for threat mitigation in SDN/5G  that have been identified through literature search and discussion with an expert group convened by ENISA  for this purpose.  The underlying search that resulted in the identification of threat mitigation practices has also considered  established research programmes and large scale collaborative research and innovation projects, which have  already delivered or are expected to deliver techniques, tools and practices for SDN/5G security threat  mitigation, according to their work programme. To support and enhance the outcomes in this direction, the  expert group that was convened by ENISA involved representatives from Phase 1 of the funded projects of  5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership 57 (in short 5G PPP)58. 5G PPP was initiated by the EU Commission  and industry manufacturers, telecommunications operators, service providers, SMEs and researchers with  the aim of delivering solutions, architectures, technologies and standards for global next generation  communication infrastructures.  In the following, we first present threat mitigation practices arising from already developed SDN protection  technologies (Sect.7.1) and then mitigation practices, which are currently under development (Sect.7.2).  Existing threat mitigation practices  Existing threat mitigation practices have identified through a review of SDN protection techniques that have  been suggested in the literature and/or implemented in existing SDN tools. The tools that were considered  for this purpose are discussed next.  7.1.1 Overview of tools/techniques  Secure Architecture for the Networked Enterprise (SANE59): SANE is an architecture developed to protect  enterprise networks. SANE includes one logical controller for all packet forwarding rule decisions. This  controller is the only trusted component in the network and assigns an encrypted channel to every permitted  request. SANE supports natural policies (e.g. allow everyone in group accounting to connect to the web  server hosting documentation) that are autonomous of network topology and the used equipment.  Ethane60: Ethane is an architecture proposed for enterprise networks to provide strong security guarantees.  It is based in a Central Domain Controller (DC) that implements secure bindings by authenticating users,  hosts, services etc. DC contains the global security policy of the network and checks every new flow request  57  https://5g-ppp.eu/5g-ppp-phase-1-projects/  58  https://5g-ppp.eu/  59  M.

(Note: Ethane is no longer maintained, however, due to the importance in the evolution  of SDN has been included)  FlowNAC61: FlowNAC is network access control solution, based on flows, that permits granting the users  rights to access the network following a target service use request. Each set of flows functions as a service  that can be independently requested. Multiple services can be authorized at the same time. SDN offers the  granularity that is necessary for identifying services at the data plane as a set of flows, in order to enforce  suitable policy.  This is done in a dynamic fashion.  Panopticon62: An architecture proposal to realize incrementally deployment of SDN. Panopticon results in a  Hybrid SDN deployment. It introduces a mechanism called Solitary Confinement Tree, which using VLAN  functionality ensure that inbound traffic to switch ports of legacy devices passes through at least one SDN  switch. This topology is sufficient to ensure end-to-end network policy.  DefenceFlow63: DefenceFlow is a commercial application that detects and resolves DDoS attacks. Its  operation is based on pattern matching of traffic statistics of SND forwarding devices. In case of DDoS  detection it redirects traffic to the nearest mitigation device. A mitigation device devices can be placed in  any location in the network  HP Sentinel Security64: An SDN application that monitors the flow creation process in the network. As a flow  is identified, it is compared to a reputation database for IP Address and DNS names. If the lookup is positive,  traffic is dropped on the forwarding devices.  NOX65 : The NOX SDN controller has focussed on implementing traffic anomaly detection algorithms.  Rosemary66: Rosemary is an SDN controller that is based on the approach of spawning SDN applications in  an isolated pseudo network operating system. The result is network application containment and resilience  strategy.  FRESCO67: FRESCO is a security application development framework that is designed to enable rapid design  of detection and mitigation modules in the context of OpenFlow. FRESCO provides a scripting API enabling  the coding of security monitoring and threat detection logic as modular libraries.  FlowChecker68: FlowChecker is a tool that can identify intra switch misconfigurations. This tool can used to:  (a) verify the consistency of different switches and controllers across different SDN infrastructures using  OpenFLow, (b) validate the correctness of the FlowTable configurations of new deployed protocols and  61  J.

NICE69: NICE is a tool that can automate the testing of OpenFlow applications through a combination of  symbolic execution and model checking. NICE utilises model checking techniques and symbolic execution  for generating network traffic, which can be used to systematically explore the state space of the entire SDN  deployment (switches, controllers, hosts).  Veriflow70: Veriflow is a network troubleshooting tool that can be used to find erroneous forwarding rules  in an SDN deployment. In addition it can be utilised to prevent misbehaviour caused by such rules to the  network. Veriflow provides a layer between SDN controllers and switches that examines network-wide  invariant violations in real time as rule are inserted, deleted or modified in a switch.  FortNOX71: FortNOX is an extension of the NOX OpenFlow controller specializing in providing role-based  authorization and enforcing security constraints on the controller. FortNOX consists of a mediation service  that performs verification of OpenFlow Application rules against a set of network flow constraints that have  been defined by administrators or OpenFlow security applications. This mediation service cannot be  bypassed.  FLOVER72: FLOVER is a model checking system, which can be used to verify that flow policies deployed by an  OpenFlow application do not violate network security policies.  Se-Floodlight73: Security Enhanced (Se) Floodlight is an implementation of an OpenFlow security mediation  service for enforcing network security. It is similar to FRESCO except there is more functionality due to the  extensions set by the new OpenFlow specification.  FatTire74: FatTire is a programming language designed for writing fault resilient network application  programs. It utilizes n-regular expressions that allow programmers to exclusively specify sets of legal paths  through the network and fault resilient requirements for those paths.  AVANT-GUARD75: AVANT-GUARD is a data plane extension consisting of an actuating triggers and a  Connection migration module. AVANT-GUARD is designed to make SDN security applications more scalable  and consequently capable of tackling a dynamic range of network threats. The connection migration module  provides shielding to the control plane from saturation attacks to the interface between control and data  plane (SBI API). The actuating triggers module enables the data plane to asynchronously report network  69  M. Canini, et al. \"A NICE Way to Test OpenFlow Applications.\" NSDI. Vol. 12. 2012.  70  A. Khurshid, W.

In this way it helps the control plane to manage network flows without delay.  PermOF76: PermOF is a highly tuneable permission system that incorporates an as-needed customized  permission set and an advanced thread-based isolation mechanism. It can be used to define permissions to  control access of OpenFLow controllers from the application layer. Hence, effectively it provides an isolation  layer between the application and the control layer in the reference SDN architecture. Network operators  can use PermOF to define application permission policies at run time.  7.1.2 Mitigated SDN threats  Our initial analysis has shown that the techniques/tools overviewed above address some of the threats that  have been identified for SDN.  The following table (Table 4) shows, which SDN threats are addressed by each of the above techniques/tools.  PA in the table indicates that a technique/tool partially addresses the threat. An empty cell in the table  indicates that a threat is not addressed according to the initial analysis. It should be noted that the  information provided in Table 4 is based only on a review of the documentation of the reviewed tool and  has resulted from any form of tool/technique usage or testing.  76  Wen, Xitao, et al. \"Towards a secure controller platform for openflow applications.\" Proceedings of the  second ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Hot topics in software defined networking.

A Network Service Directory (NSD)  replaces classical DNS in SANE based deployments. NSD maintains an access control list for every  service.   Denial of Service (DoS): SANE includes capabilities for DDoS prevention. SANE hosts do not exchange  information with network elements but receive the so called “capabilities” for the domain controller,  which are constructed on–route.   Remote SDN application exploitation: SANE based networks require authentication of all principals  (hosts, switches etc.) using symmetric key encryption in order to ensure secure communication.   Unauthorized access, unauthorized administration of devices and systems: SANE addresses  unauthorized activities using the Access Control List (ACL) that it incorporates. To access network  resources in SANE, a host has to be authorized and have the required policies in the ACL that permit  requesting the so called network capabilities. In addition, encryption is used for the distribution of  network capabilities.   Traffic diversion: Routing in SANE is done by the domain controller that encrypts route information  (next hop) in a SANE header in every packet. In SANE, only the domain controller records and  maintains a complete view of the network topology.   Identity spoofing: SANE networks implement authorization and symmetric key encryption and an  access control list for every network node (host, switches etc.)   Man in the middle in NBI and SBI: SANE networks implement authorization and symmetric key  encryption and access control list for every network node (host, switches etc.)  Ethane provides mitigations for the following threats:   Manipulation of Information / Data forging: Ethane networks are based on a central controller.  Computes route information for the permitted flows by having knowledge of the network topology.  Ethane does not allow any communication between end hosts without explicit permission.   Denial of Service (DoS): Ethane networks allow initial data exchange only to the controller in order  to grant network access. Unauthorized packets are dropped by the switching elements.   Remote SDN application exploitation: Ethane establishes that a misbehaving node cannot  masquerade as the controller or a network element (switch or router) by utilizing authentication  with preconfigured credentials. Communication between the controller and the network element is  established only after authentication is successful. This communication is done via an encrypted  connection and it facilitates all communications between the controller and the network element.   Unauthorized access, unauthorized administration of devices and systems: Ethane establishes that a  misbehaving node cannot masquerade as the controller or a network element (switch or router) by  utilizing authentication with preconfigured credentials. Communication between the controller and  the network element is established only after authentication is successful. This communication is  done via an encrypted connection and it facilitates all communications between the controller and  the network element.   Traffic diversion: Routing is performed by the controller which has all the topology information of  the network. Only the controller can alter data flows by controlling the switching elements trough  encrypted links.   Identity spoofing: Authentication is mandatory to access network resources.   Man in the middle in NBI and SBI: Communications are encrypted with predefined keys.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  49  FlowNAC provides mitigations for the following threats:   Service provisioning exploitation: There is an authorization mechanism that checks every service  requested by a user.   Unauthorized activities: Users have to be authenticated and authorized for each individual service.  All frames coming from the user are individually evaluated and categorized in services. Afterwards,  an allow or deny judgment is enforced for each of these frames conditional on whether the  associated service is permitted or not.   Identity spoofing: Identity of every applicant that asks for a service is checked. This can be done on  the first access and periodically. This covers user and administration access.   Network Virtualization bypass, Unlawful network slice ingress and egress: No authenticated service  (or corresponding flow) is allowed to enter, or even leave, a slice.  Panopticon provides mitigations for the following threats:   Denial of Service (DoS): Panopticon proposes hybrid SDN – non SDN network architecture. As an  abstraction layer, Panopticon is responsible for hiding the legacy devices and acts as a “network  hypervisor” that maps the logical SDN abstraction to the underlying hardware, being able to prevent  or mitigate this kind of attacks.  DefenseFlow provides mitigations for the following threats:   Denial of Service (DoS): DefenseFlow incorporates a patented behavioural fuzzy logic detection  algorithm which is able to detect different types of network DDoS attacks.  HP  Sentinel security provides mitigations for the following threats:   Malicious software – Malware: HP Sentinel security incorporates detection capabilities for about  700,000 malicious malware, spyware, and botnet threats.   Virtualization threats: HP Sentinel security provides support for the Threat Protection System (see  below) in virtual environments. HP provide the Sentinel security application for HP Virtual  Application Networks SDN Controller.   Traffic sniffing: In an HP Sentinel security environment an SDN controller forwards new IP  connection requests to a Threat Protection System (TPS). TPS uses a reputation database to check  the requests and replies with a pass/fail request to the controller.   Interception of information – S/W interceptions, Memory Scrapping: HP Sentinel security provides  real-time threat detection and security policy enforcement at the edge of the deployed network.  Rosemary provides mitigations for the following threats:   Remote SDN application exploitation: Network applications are isolated from the core of the  Rosemary operating system. In addition, Rosemary utilizes sandboxing functionality to protect the  network operation system.   Unauthorized activities: Rosemary establishes whether an application has rights to access or modify  a data structure. If an application can not access the data structure, it will not be able to get the  necessary capability.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  50   Traffic diversion: To alter flow tables in a Rosemary Environment, an application has to gain access  permission from the NOS.   Software/firmware exploits - Controller: As discussed for the case of remote SDN application  exploitation, in Rosemary network applications are isolated from the core of the Rosemary  operating system. In addition, Rosemary utilizes sandboxing functionality to protect the network  operation system.   Traffic sniffing: To alter flow tables in a Rosemary Environment, an application has to gain access  permission from the NOS.  FRESCO provides mitigations for the following threats:   SBI exploitation: Fresco controllers must be authorized and use encryption to communicate with the  network switching elements.   Unauthorized activities, Memory scraping: Fresco uses a Security Enforcement Kernel (SEK).   Traffic diversion: When a conflict appears, the FRESCO Security Enforcement Kernel applies a  hierarchical authority model that provides the capability to replace an existing flow rule with a  candidate rule, if the digital signature of the source of the candidate rule possesses more authority  than the source of the existing rule.   Identity spoofing: FRESCO applications (aka modules) are created using a scripting language. FRESCO  incorporates a script-to-module translator, which automatically translates the scripts to modules,  creates instances of the modules, and validates and registers the modules using a registration API.  This API allows only authorized administrators to create FRESCO modules.   Controller firmware/software exploits: Applications in FRESCO access the SDN controller through the  Security Enforcement Kernel.   Traffic sniffing: The FRESCO Security Enforcement Kernel utilizes a trust model that empowers  FRESCO modules to digitally sign each candidate flow rule. This permits SEK to conclude whether a  candidate flow rule was produced by a FRESCO security module, an OpenFlow application, or a  network administrator.  FlowChecker provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations, Falsifications of configurations, Traffic diversion, Traffic sniffing: Flow  checker is able to validate the correctness of the flow tables and configuration of the SDN switching  devices.   Unauthorized administration of devices and systems: FlowChecker uses SSL to communicate with  the SDN controllers in the network.   SDN Identity spoofing: A controller has to subscribe to the FlowChecker (called master controller).  In addition there is the possibility that flow tables are stored in a Database with role based access  control.  NICE provides mitigations for the following threats:   Flooding attack: NICE is capable of checking for generic correctness properties such as no forwarding  loops or no black holes, and when required write additional application-specific correctness  properties. Python code snippets that make assertions about the global system state, can be utilized.   Traffic diversion, Traffic sniffing: NICE outputs property violations along with their traces so that  they can be deterministically reproduced.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  51  VeriFlow provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations, DNS manipulations: VeriFlow resides between the SDN applications  and SDN devices in order to capture and check every flow rule entering the network.   Falsifications of configurations: VeriFlow search for erroneous rules issued by SDN applications, and  when required, prevents them from reaching the SDN network and causing irregular network  behaviour or even damage.  FortNOX provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations: FortNOX has the ability to enforce network flow rules produced by  OF-enabled security applications that request to reprogram switches in response to potential  runtime operational threats.   Falsifications of configurations   Traffic engineering exploitation: FortNOX uses a rule conflict resolution for the flow rules with  authorization levels (rolls)   Unauthorised administration of devices and systems: FortNOX incorporates an authentication  mechanism.   Traffic diversion, Traffic Sniffing: Digital signature validation is performed for each flow rule  insertion request via a role-based source authentication module. This may lead to assignment of  appropriate priority to a candidate flow rule, or even the lowest priority in the event that no  signature is provided.   SDN Identity spoofing: FortNOX supports digital signatures for each flow rule inserted in the SDN  switching devices.  FLOVER provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations: Flow tables are sent to the switching elements over an encrypted  network link.   Flooding attack: FLOVER ensures consistency with the current network security policy for the flow  rules inserted in a switch’s flow table(s).   Traffic sniffing and Traffic diversion: FLOVER decomposes network security policies in sets of  assertions referred to as non-bypass properties. Non-bypass properties specify whether a certain  packet/flow matching a set of conditions should be forwarded to its destination or otherwise  dropped. Yices, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver, is used to check for non-bypass property  violations.  FatTire provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations: FatTire features logic that facilitates reasoning about the behaviour  of the system during periods of failure recovery. This enables verification of network-wide  invariants.   Denial of Service: FatTire incorporates modules (outcome) that on OF switches and can take  advantage of in-network fast-failover mechanisms.   Traffic diversion: The FatTire compiler generates rule tables and group tables that enable fault- tolerance while at the same time guaranteeing that traffic flows along the paths specified by the  program.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  52  AVANT-GUARD provides mitigations for the following threats:   Falsifications of configurations: Intelligence empowered connection mitigation, differentiates  sources that will complete TCP connections from sources that will not, at the data plane level.   Denial of Service: A classification stage performs connection mitigation which shields the control  plane from failed connection floods on the client-side. Such connections may be the product of  DoS attacks or reconnaissance activities.   Traffic diversion: AVANT-GUARD employs triggers that introduce conditional flow rule activation.  Security applications can predefine a set of actions and strategies for handling flows that appear  as a product certain network operating conditions that can be expressed through switch statistics.  PERMOF provides mitigations for the following threats:   Malicious Software: PermOF introduces a shim layer that is configured and controlled by the  controller kernel. This ensures isolation of and achieves zero interaction between the applications  and the OS. This feature is a product of modifying the dynamic library of the programming language  or the OS itself.   Remote SDN application exploitation: to ensure the application authenticity and integrity, PKI-based  authentication may be enforced.   Controller Software/firmware exploits, Memory scraping: An Isolation mechanism, including a  system permission set, is introduced by PERMOF. With PERMOF Third party SDN applications are  operating under minimized privileges   Man in the middle in NBI: When an API call is received from the application, a thread class  encapsulates the function call and passes it to kernel. This is done by utilizing the built-in inter-thread  communication facility. As the caller’s identity is attached on the API calls, the controller’s kernel  can easily perform permission control, based on a pre-configured policy.  Threat mitigation practices under development  In the following, we present practices for threat mitigation in SDN/5G that are under development. Several  good practices may relate and address more than one threat.  In the context of this report all 5G-PPP Phase  1 projects, that consist of fifteen Research and Innovation action projects and three Innovation action  projects of HORIZON 2020 in the area of Information and Communication Technologies77 have been asked  to provide their input.  7.2.1 Related 5G-PPP HORIZON 2020 projects  VirtuWind78 is aimed at developing an open, modular and secure framework to support intra-domain and  inter-domain scenarios in real wind parks based on SDN and NFV. The choice of the domain reflects the  emergence of wind energy as a mainstream form of sustainable energy generation. VirtuWind adopts a  security-by-design approach for the SDN and NFV ecosystem. This appears to be necessary as introducing  77  http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/information-and-communication- technologies  78  http://virtuwind.eu/  http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/information-and-communication-technologies http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/information-and-communication-technologies http://virtuwind.eu/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  53  revolutionary concepts like SDN and NFV for critical infrastructures requires a careful investigation of new  security risks, which have not been relevant in legacy systems. In this context, VirtuWind has the objective  of: (i) establishing a comprehensive threat and risk framework for industry-level SDN networks, (ii) defining  security mechanisms for north-/southbound and inter-controller interfaces, securing the controller (e.g.,  prevent DoS), (iii) developing mechanisms for network monitoring and intrusion detection for SDN  networks, (iv) developing Signed Virtual Network Functions, (v) developing accountability mechanisms for  SDN networks, and (vi) developing inter-domain incident detection mechanisms.  SUPERFLUIDITY79 is working on security verification of virtualized network functions, using symbolic  execution techniques. This is a technique (from SW compilers) which permits to automatically and  systematically explore paths, so as to verify what the security and policy implications are when running  certain (composition of) functionalities. In the past such techniques have been successfully applied to  specific middlebox functions80 (for instance, middleboxes that rely on the composition of standard Click  elements). The work in progress in SuperFluidity focuses on generalizing and extending these techniques  to a wider heterogeneous set of VNF (which in turns means a dedicated work devised to characterize the  I/O relation of such VNFs); cloud enabled VNFs; and support for heterogeneous/multi-operated settings.  CHARISMA81 As indicated in the project’s website77, CHARISMA proposes “an intelligent hierarchical  routing and paravirtualised architecture that unites two important concepts: devolved offload with  shortest path nearest to end-users and an end-to-end security service chain via virtualized open access  physical layer security (PLS).” The use of a cloud infrastructure in CHARISMA is aimed at achieving low- latency (“<1ms” according to the project consortium) and the security required for future 5G networking in  which wireless/wired communications converge. The project aims to deliver enhanced performance  targeting a “1000-fold increased in mobile data volume, 10-100 times higher data rates, 10-100 times  more connected devices” and 5-fold reduction of latency.  5G NORMA82 is aimed at developing a novel, adaptive mobile network architecture, capable of  accommodating 5G. The focus of this architecture will be to support network customisability whilst  ensuring high performance and security, and meeting specific cost and energy requirements. 5G NORMA is  also aimed at offering openness based on appropriate APIs.  5G ENSURE83  focuses on the development of a security architecture for 5G that would be acceptable to  and shareable by different 5G stakeholders. To realise this vision, 5G ENSURE has the goal of developing  security enablers for 5G and making them available in a shared testbed. The project aims to develop these  enablers driven by security use cases and scenarios in the areas of cybersecurity and aerospace.  CogNet84 aims to develop support for intelligent 5G Network Management whilst increasing dramatically  the extent of connected devices (the aim is to achieve connectivity of trillions of devices). This requires the  creation of highly optimised networks, are capable of making maximum use of available radio spectrum  and bandwidth. The same need arises due to the need to meet other QoS properties for such networks. To  achieve these requirements CogNet also aims to develop self-managed networks, based on machine  learning techniques that can address relevant organisation, configuration, security, and optimization  79  http://superfluidity.eu/  80  http://nets.cs.pub.ro/~costin/files/symnet.pdf  81  https://5g-ppp.eu/charisma/  82  https://5gnorma.5g-ppp.eu/  83  http://www.5gensure.eu/  84  http://www.cognet.5g-ppp.eu/  http://superfluidity.eu/ http://nets.cs.pub.ro/~costin/files/symnet.pdf https://5g-ppp.eu/charisma/ https://5gnorma.5g-ppp.eu/ http://www.5gensure.eu/ http://www.cognet.5g-ppp.eu/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  54  issues. Additional elements of CogNet’s vision are the use virtualisation (as a means for meet changing  resource demands) and energy efficiency.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  55  7.2.2 Other related EU funded projects  BEBA85 project aims to entail platform-agnostic programming of stateful flow/traffic processing logic  directly within network nodes, thus rescinding the today’s necessary reliance on external (slowpath)  controllers. Moreover, BEBA will provide the programmers with the ability to control, via the above  stateful behavioural descriptions, an extended set of actions and primitives specifically devised for the  monitoring and network security domain, so as to permit platform-agnostic programming of middle box- type network functions. In terms of security, BEBA project aims to mitigate DoS/latency attacks to the  control-data plane communication channel (concretely, the communication channel between centralized  controller and remote SDN devices).  NetIDE86 aims at delivering an integrated development environment that aims to support the whole  software development lifecycle of SDN applications in a vendor- and controller-independent fashion. The  NetIDE framework should represent a single point of entry to SDN software development and offer a  unified development environment following the ‘write once, execute anywhere’ paradigm. The project has  already delivered a first open source release of the framework which includes: (i) the NetIDE Development  Environment, an Eclipse-based integrated environment for developers; (ii) the NetIDE Network Engine, a  controller-agnostic environment where SDN applications for different controllers can be deployed on top  of the same infrastructure; (iii) a set of NetIDE Tools enabling developers to systematically test, profile, and  tune their network applications (logger, debugger, a wireshark dissector and many others). These tools are  designed to offer considerable benefits when troubleshooting in a productive environment after  application deployment.  FP7 UNIFY87 project considers that every Service Graph (SG) or Network Function - Function Graph (NF-FG)  deployment started by a Resource Orchestrator needs to be enforced in relation to a policy. This approach  assures not only that services are deployed only by principals according to a policy, but also that resources  (computing and network) are consumed in a policy compliant way. This eliminates resource starvation  attacks.  FLAMINGO88 is a European (ICT-FP7) Network of Excellence (NoE) investigating Network and Service  Management. As a NoE, FLAMINGO is based on a joint program of integrated research activities, whose  objective has been to investigate and address three challenges deemed important for the Future Internet  (FI). FLAMINGO identified these challenges as: (a) the development of scalable monitoring systems that  can effectively support the sharing of monitoring data the “knowledge plane” and decision algorithms of  the Future Internet; (b) the development of automated and self-management frameworks for managing  networks and their interconnected objects in a fully distributed and autonomic manner, and (c) the  investigation of “economic, legal, and regulative constraints” that arise in border management systems  and can affect FI.  In Table 5 below we give a summary of measures related to the  SDN threat landscape that the 5G PPP  H2020 and the other EU funded projects reviewed above have aimed to develop.  85  http://www.beba-project.eu/  86  http://www.netide.eu/  87  https://www.fp7-unify.eu/  88  http://www.fp7-flamingo.eu/  http://www.beba-project.eu/ http://www.netide.eu/ https://www.fp7-unify.eu/ http://www.fp7-flamingo.eu/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  56  Measures to be developed by Research and innovation  Projects  Related 5G-PPP Projects  Other EU funded  projects  V ir  tu W  in d  SU P  ER FL  U ID  IT Y  C H  A R  IS M  A  5 G  N o  rm a  5 G  E N  SU R  E  C o  gN et  B EB  A  N et  ID E  FP 7  U N  IF Y  FL A  M IN  G O  Threat analysis/assessment to be conducted x  Cryptographic and/or key management mechanisms x  Authentication/Access control mechanisms x  x  Data encryption mechanisms x  x  Secure communication mechanisms including VPN x  x  NBI security mechanisms x  EWBI security mechanisms x  SBI security mechanisms x  Hardware security mechanisms (controller/data  elements/mobile device)  x  Mobile device security mechanisms  Mechanisms for the protection of Virtual Network  Functions  x  x  Non-repudiation/audit/traceback mechanisms  x  Intrusion detection mechanisms x  x  Incident detection and response mechanisms x  Multi-operator cooperation mechanisms x  Wireless/Mobile Security (wireless medium)  mechanisms  x  Legal and business measures  Standardization measures x  Policy measures x  x x  Other (please specify, add additional rows in the table  if necessary)  Table 5 - Involvement of 5G-PPP HORIZON 2020 and other EU founded projects to the SDN threat landscape  Gap Analysis  Based on the SDN threat mitigation practices that have been developed in existing research or constitute  the target of on-going research projects, we have identified gaps that appear to require further research and  development effort in order to address 5G/SDN threats.  The outcome of this gap analysis is presented in  Table 6. The table provides also a summary of good practices and the assets covered by them and clusters  good practices, assets and gaps under the different types of threats that were introduced in Sect. 5.6.

SDN/5G Good practices and gaps  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  61  A more detailed account of the issues and stakeholders referenced in the gaps identified in Table 6 is  provided below:   System configuration: System configuration refers to the proper installation and configuration of  systems/devices and applications within the SDN infrastructure. In order to achieve desired levels  of variables such as performance, stability, proper function and security, industry as well as  community emerging guidelines must be utilized.   Security Policy: The definition, management, monitoring and enforcement of adequate security  policies is of paramount importance when it comes to operation and management of SDNs. Such  policies are needed to address important SDN operation and management activities including, for  example, authentication between SDN components or establishing the means for proper  authentication between humans and devices. Without carefully defined and orchestrated security  rules and procedures, it is impossible to imagine a functional and reliable SDN infrastructure. A key  related issue is also the provision of automated support for the short and long term evolution of  security policies.   Network configuration: In contrast to System configuration which refers to the setup of the SDN  components, Network configuration refers to the SDN specific configuration that is applied to each  of these components. Whether setting up or maintaining an SDN infrastructure, proper  configuration and ongoing tuning is of outmost importance in order to achieve proper function,  stability and performance. The SDN components affected are the SDN controllers and the SDN  network elements (switches and routers).   Credentials: While Security Policy is the most important aspect when it comes to laying the ground  rules for a secure SDN infrastructure, the importance of proper and protected Credentials is a must.  Credentials in the form of a password or a certificate are the gateway that can lead to accessing an  important system or network asset and in this case a functional component in the SDN  infrastructure. When applied properly and used carefully there can be no harm to the protected  assets. However, weak as well as improperly or poorly formed Credentials can lead to exploitation  and ultimately to a global infrastructure meltdown. The human factor is largely responsible as  Credentials can be leaked due to sharing with unauthorized individuals or theft as a result of  improper placement.   Comprehensive verification of absence software/firmware exploits: Verifying the absence of  potential exploits in software/firmware (e.g., buffer/stack/heap overflows) is an important  requirement for providing security assurance for SDN software/firmware89. So far, numerous  techniques have been used for this purpose, including static verification techniques that operate on  software specifications (typically including model checking, invariant checking and theorem  proving), static analysis of various forms of software/firmware code and testing. Static verification  techniques can check certain properties (e.g., satisfaction of access control policies, properties of  virtual and physical topologies such as desired traffic isolation) but not all. More specifically, certain  types of exploits, such as range errors and string vulnerabilities, cannot be easily expressed as  properties amenable to static verification techniques. Furthermore, such techniques are often  89 ITU-T, Requirements for Applying Formal Methods to Software Defined Networking,  Recommendation ITU-T  Y.3320, 08/2014, available from:  https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwjDqoSqjLjJAhXDMhoKHSJaA FIQFghCMAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itu.int%2Frec%2Fdologin_pub.asp%3Flang%3De%26id%3DT-REC-Y.3320- 201408-I!!PDF-E%26type%3Ditems&usg=AFQjCNFHJcb_4iCoKn1UDkyaleOn25ZPSw  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  62  incapable of verifying systems of non-trivial complexity due to scalability problems, and – even in  cases where they are successfully applied – they offer no guarantee that the implementation of the  specification analysed by them will preserve this specification and therefore that the desired  property. Static analysis techniques have been effective in detecting certain types of exploits (e.g.,  various types of overflows) but not all of them (e.g., string vulnerabilities and range errors).  Furthermore, they are implementation language specific (e.g., C and/or Java specific) and not all of  them scale up well to programs of significant size. Finally, testing cannot offer any guarantee of  completeness.   Operators: In addition to the Administrators, whose function is described above, the Operators’  function is as important as the deal with the day to day activities of maintaining the SDN ecosystem.  While Administrators will have to deal with low level support and configuration functions (such as  upgrades and enhancements), the Operators will have to perform day to day activities such as  monitoring, high level management and light configuration tasks. Because, similarly to the  Administrators, the Operators also require security clearance, caution should be used when utilizing  SDN Credentials.   Administrators: At the centre of a physical or virtual IT infrastructure are the Administrator teams  responsible for the setup, configuration and ongoing maintenance. Similarly to a conventional  infrastructure, the Administrators carry the responsibility of establishing an SDN infrastructure that  functions as per initial specifications. In addition, performance and security are two important  factors that must be addressed from the beginning. Administrators require full security clearance in  order to perform low level SDN support and therefore caution should be used when accessing the  SDN components.   Developers: SDN depends on Software in order to deliver all the benefits and advantages over a  conventional Network infrastructure. It relies on a collection of software pieces that talk to each  other through carefully planned interfaces and APIs. The developers responsible for writing these  pieces of software carry the responsibility of delivering as per spec, functional, efficient and secure  code that will ensure proper function of the SDN device without jeopardizing the SDN ecosystem.  This becomes particularly important when upgrading SDN components of on already existing  infrastructure.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  63  8. Recommendations  Technical recommendations  Recommendation 1 (for Network providers): Mandate encryption and authentication in NBI, SBI and  EWBI. In SDN deployments, Application Programming Interfaces (API) for the communication between  controllers and switching elements (Southbound Interface - SBI) and between controllers and network  applications (Northbound Interface – NBI) are utilized. In addition, although SDN uses centralized control of  the network (controller) this is a logical architecture that can be distributed into several systems (multiple  controller architecture). Communication between SDN controllers is achieved through the East/Westbound  Interface (EWBI). Utilizing encryption and advanced authentication in these interfaces is not mandatory for  standard implementations. However, network providers should consider deploying encryption and  authentication techniques (e.g. TLS) to all SDN APIs.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  System  Configuration, Security policy, Administrators   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking:  Security policy, Credentials, Administration  Recommendation 2 (for Network providers): Identify and monitor exposed functionalities of SDN  controllers. SDN controllers provide northbound APIs (NBIs) that enable network applications to be  deployed on top of a unified abstract network layer. These APIs expose the SDN network state to applications  and enable applications to dynamically and automatically program the network. Malicious applications can  gain access of the network resources by exploiting NBI capabilities. Network providers should be aware of  the exposed functionalities of the installed controllers in their deployments. In addition, vulnerable  functionalities need to be exposed by sophisticated ways of monitoring the usage of the NBI.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  Developers, Administrators, System configuration   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking:  Developers, Administrators  Recommendation 3 (for Network and Service providers): Control and monitor running application  resources. The SDN paradigm allows the differentiation of network policies for individual SDN applications.  This is important in order to achieve meaningful multi-tenancy in the SDN ecosystem, especially for network  providers and even more importantly for service providers. Moreover, SDN introduces a new business model  associated to the network and service provisioning (e.g. security as a service). Controlling and monitoring  the network resources allocation is a practice that can harden SDN deployments against several threats.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  Developers, Administrators   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking:  Developers, Administrators  Recommendation 4 (for Network, Service providers and End users): Holistic Support for Security policies.  In the complex SDN ecosystem it is important for service providers to operate based on comprehensive  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  64  security policies. Although the sophistication and scope of such policies may vary depending on the size and  nature of the organization in question, the underlying need for operating on the basis of security policy in  all levels of the SDN reference architecture is irrefutable. Having a well-written policy that covers all  important areas (e.g. system access, user credentials use and good practises), not only supresses a number  of risks but also helps recover from most situations in minimal time. To be effective in terms of security,  policies need to have holistic support, i.e., support for their specified, verification, monitoring and  enforcement to the maximum possible extend.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  Developers, Administrators, Operators, Security Policy   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking: Developers, Administrators, Operators, Security Policy  Recommendation 5 (for Administrators): Access control, Credentials, System updates: The SDN ecosystem  consists of several components (e.g. controllers, servers, switching elements). These components may be  either virtualized or physical systems and need to communicate with each other. Restrictions of access based  on access control lists could harden overall system security. In addition, SDN system and network  administrators should enforce a minimum level of security in the system security policies.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Security Policy, Administrators   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking: Operators, Credentials  Recommendation 6 (for Developers): Sandboxing, Application Isolation. Logically centralized control of the  SDN makes it possible for developers to develop custom network applications that perform complex tasks.  SDN offers a high level of abstraction to the programmers. When applications are developed caution is  required to protect the network operation against application misbehaviour and bugs. To do so techniques  such as Sandboxing, application-Kernel isolation and application permission policy enforcement should be  utilized.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Developers, Administrators, System configuration   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: Operators  Organisational recommendations  Recommendation 7 (for Service providers): Develop incident response capabilities and information  sharing practices among telecom operators. It is advisable that Telecom Operators develop incident  response capabilities by creating (and in case of existing,  enhancing) in-house Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT), that will be  technologically aware of evolving networking technologies, with a particular focus on SDN and NFV. It would  be advisable that an assembly or an informal association of Telecom Operator CERTs/CSIRTs is established,  as they could function as an information sharing catalyst for Telecom Operators. ENISA could play an  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  65  instrumental role in this direction90. Cooperation with other incident response bodies such as Terena’s Task  Force CSIRT (TF-CSIRT)91 and the European Government CERT Group92 as well as participation in international  communities such as the global Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams-FIRST93 would be highly  advisable for every Telecom Operator.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Security Policy   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: Security Policy  Recommendation 8 (for Administrators): Keep systems up to date. As SDN moves many of the networking  functionalities in a software environment it is of paramount importance that used systems (Servers, Virtual  servers, Network operating systems, Authentication and encryption mechanism etc.) are continuously  updated with the latest releases (e.g. Security patches). To do so system and network administrators should  schedule periodic system maintenances. During maintenance service availability should not be decreased so  redundancy in the network architecture should be taken into account.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: System configuration, Network configuration   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: System configuration, Network configuration  Recommendation 9 (for Network and Service providers): Use adequate security methods. Network and  service providers should maintain a high level of security in their systems. Specialized software and hardware  solutions are available and should be taken into account. In addition SDN provides the capability of security  as a service, allowing network and service providers to outsource security to specialized third party vendors.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Administrators, Security Policy   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: Operators, Security Policy  90 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support  91 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  92 http://www.egc-group.org/  93 http://www.first.org/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  66  9. Conclusions  SDN/5G brings a brand new level of innovation to arena of networking.  Key attributes such as Logically  Centralized Intelligence, Programmability and Network Abstraction pave the way to the communications of  tomorrow. While significant improvements may be achieved in network security by centralization and  programmability, these two great attributes will undoubtedly attract a new level of treats and attacks.  Security within the SDN paradigm will arguably be a challenge, as all layers, sub-layers and components will  need to communicate according to strict security policies. In this report, we have attempted to create  awareness by identifying key valuable assets of the SDN infrastructure that are needed in order to ensure  proper network function and interoperability. As these assets may, however, become the target of attacks,  they can also become the main driver of a threat analysis targeted at securing SDNs.

Despite the significant debate on  the technical specifications and the technological maturity of 5G, which are under discussion in various fora3,  5G is expected to affect positively and significantly several industry sectors ranging from ICT to industry  sectors such as car and other manufacturing, health and agriculture in the period up to and beyond 2020.  5G will be driven by the influence of software on network functions, known as Software Defined Networking  (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The key concept that underpins SDN is the logical  centralization of network control functions by decoupling the control and packet forwarding functionality of  the network. NFV complements this vision through the virtualization of these functionalities based on recent  advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualization. Considering the technological maturity of the  technologies that 5G can leverage on, SDN is the one that is moving faster from development to production.  To realize the business potential of SDN/5G, a number of technical issues related to the design and operation  of Software Defined Networks need to be addressed. Amongst them, SDN/5G security is one of the key  issues, that needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to avoid missing the business opportunities  arising from SDN/5G.  In this report, we review threats and potential compromises related to the security of SDN/5G networks.  More specifically, this report contains a review of the emerging threat landscape of 5G networks with  particular focus on Software Defined Networking. It also considers security of NFV and radio network access.  To provide a comprehensive account of the emerging threat SDN/5G landscape, this report has identified  related network assets and the security threats, challenges and risks arising for these assets.  Driven by the  identified threats and risks, this report has also reviewed and identified existing security mechanisms and  good practices for SDN/5G/NFV, and based on these it has analysed gaps and provided technical, policy and  organizational recommendations for proactively enhancing the security of SDN/5G.  This report proposes 6 technical recommendations and 3 organizational recommendations:   Technical Recommendations  o Recommendation 1 (for Network providers): Mandate encryption and authentication in  NBI, SBI and EWBI.  o Recommendation 2 (for Network providers): Identify and monitor exposed  functionalities of SDN controllers.  o Recommendation 3 (for Network and Service providers): Control and monitor running  application resources.  o Recommendation 4 (for Network, Service providers and End users): Holistic Support for  Security policies.  o Recommendation 5 (for Administrators): Access control and Credentials enforcement  o Recommendation 6 (for Developers): Application Isolation and Sandboxing.  1 www.5g-ppp.eu/roadmaps  2 http://ioeassessment.cisco.com/  3 http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1734-ran_5g  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  07   Organisational Recommendations  o Recommendation 7 (for Service providers): Develop incident response capabilities and  information sharing practices among telecom operators.  o Recommendation 8 (for Administrators): Keep systems up to date  o Recommendation 9 (for Network and Service providers): Use adequate security  methods  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  08  1. Introduction  Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new network paradigm moving rapidly from development to  production environments. The key concept of the new paradigm is the decoupling of the control and packet  forwarding functionality of the network. In classic networks, these two functionalities were the responsibility  of the forwarding devices of the network. In SDN, these two functionalities have been separated into two  functionality planes: the control plane and the data plane. The separation of these two functionality planes  in SDNs has two significant consequences: (a) it reduces the difficulty in the configuration and alteration of  the control functions of the network, as this functionality has no longer the responsibility of the forwarding  devices of the network that tend to have proprietary implementations (e.g., operating systems), and (b) it  enables the implementation of more consistent control policies through fewer and uniformly accessible  controllers.  The concept of SDN has been around for many years having its roots in “active programmable networking”  in academic research and the research literature4.  In contrast to the early incarnations of SDN, the “modern”  SDN realisation paradigm completely separates the Control and Data planes for increased functionality,  control and programmability.  The potential benefits of SDN have attracted the interest of the wider IT community with many parties  realigning the still “cloudy” concept of SDN, to fit their purposes. A large number of research and scientific  reports, which are discussed in this report, have already been published reciting the architecture of SDN and  the potentially benefits on simple and complex network Infrastructures. In summary, SDN is seen as a means  of providing a more efficient, extremely flexible, cost effective, and potentially fully automated holistic  network management and provisioning.  Policy Context  The value of threat analysis and emerging trends in cyber security is prioritized in the Cyber Security Strategy  for the EU5. The ENISA Threat Landscape is aligned with this EU strategy and aims to contribute by identifying  emerging trends in cyber-threats and analysing the evolution of cyber-crime (see ENISA’s report on  Understanding the Importance of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe6).  Moreover, in the new ENISA regulation7  the need of analysing current and emerging risks is highlighted. The  new ENISA regulation stipulates that “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate,  4  Psounis, Konstantinos. \"Active networks: Applications, security, safety, and architectures.\" Communications  Surveys, IEEE 2.1 (1999): 2-16.  5  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  6  ENISA, “Understanding the Importance of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe”,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines- for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks  7  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  09  with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. More specifically, it is stated that it should  “enable effective responses to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  Therefore it is evident that the ENISA Threat Landscape makes a significant contribution to the EU Cyber  Security Strategy, as it streamlines and consolidates available information on cyber-threats and their  evolution.  This study on “Software Defined Networks Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide” is one of the  deliverables (“WPK1.1-D2: Risk Assessment on two emerging technology/application areas” that focuses on  SDN/5G) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 20158, which aims to provide a contribution in the  assessment of the exposure to cyber threats of the envisioned 5G networks with particular focus on their  backbone networking technology represented by Software Defined Networking. As such, it contributes in  the definition of the current state of the art as far as cyber security is concerned in this domain and it directly  contributes to the cyber security assessment by addressing industry concerns in the area.  Scope  This report contributes to the definition of a threat landscape, which is an overview of current and emerging  threats applicable to the SDN/5G technologies and their associated trends. Since 5G is a general term that  integrates various networking technologies with different technological maturity, this study focuses on  backbone network operation technologies, i.e., Software Defined Networking. Around these core  technologies, other integral components of 5G, including radio access and NFV are also discussed. This  discussion, however, is scoped by the relation of these other 5G components to SDN.  The goal is to identify threats and needs for enhancing the security of 5G networks with particular focus on  SDN, and to provide good practices and recommendations for threats that are considered important.  Target Audience  This report can be useful to carry out detailed threat analyses and risk assessments for telecom operators  and service providers according to their particular needs and mandate (e.g., protect specific based on asset  impact analysis, respond to specific vulnerabilities with customized mitigation measures etc.). The threat  exposure of SDN/5G that is presented in this study may be deepened by telecom operators through their  own further threat analysis and risk assessment. Where this is necessary, the aim of this report is to provide  a generic, yet comprehensive, set of asset and threat details that can serve as a starting point for further  analysis. Deeper analysis may also be informed by the assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and impact  statements of this report in as far as they are relevant to the concrete assets deployed by the particular  telecom operators.  Moreover, the SDN/5G threat landscape presented in this report may be useful to policy-makers for  understanding the current state of threats and respective mitigation practices and measures. The threat  8 “ENISA Work Programme 2015”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/amending-work- programme-2015  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/amending-work-programme-2015 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/amending-work-programme-2015  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  10  landscape identified in this report may support policy actions in the areas of 5G networks, SDN, NFV, cyber  security, critical infrastructure protection, Internet of Things9 and Industrial Internet.  Furthermore, the SDN/5G security and threat research and technology reports collected and analysed by  this study provide a comprehensive collection of information regarding related cyber security threats. To  this end, this report targets also individual researchers, who might want to obtain access to these identified  sources in order to use them for their own research purposes.  Structure of this document  The remainder of this report is organised as follows:  Chapter 2 gives insight into the methodology adopted for conducting this study.  Chapter 3 presents the architectural framework of SDN and describes the separation of control and  forwarding functions, logically centralized network control elements and programmable interfaces at  multiple levels.  Chapter 4 presents the SDN/5G asset types identified in our study by giving an overview of them and  identifying their dependencies in the form of a mind map.  Chapter 5 presents a taxonomy of the threat types that our analysis has shown for the identified assets.  Interrelated threats have been grouped to form a taxonomy that is presented as mind map.  Chapter 6 introduces the threat agents of SDN/5G.  Chapter 7 reviews existing and emerging (i.e., under development) practices for mitigating the identified  threats. It also identifies and analyses the gaps identified in addressing current and emerging threats.  Chapter 8 provides technical and organisational recommendations arising in the context of our study.  Finally, Chapter 9 provides concluding remarks.  The report includes also three annexes, containing more detailed information on SDN/5G assets (Annex A)  and their taxonomy (Annex B), and SDN/5G threats (Annex C).  The provision of more detailed material as  annexes was necessary  in order to keep the size of the report within reasonable boundaries, and at the  same time give to interested stakeholders access to more comprehensive lists of SDN/5G assets and threats.  A general note that is important to make prior to the rest of this report is that all material, which has been  referenced by a URL in footnotes was last accessed on the day of publication of this study.  9  Petroulakis, Nikolaos E., et al. \"A privacy-level model of user-centric cyber-physical systems.\" Human Aspects  of Information Security, Privacy, and Trust.

Methodology  The methodology adopted in this study is in line with the methodology introduced in the ENISA’s Cyber  Threat Landscape.10 According to this methodology, someone has first to identify valuable assets and then  perform a risk assessment, which identifies the necessary protection levels for these assets. Subsequently,  security measures that can achieve the required protection levels by mitigating fully or partly the assessed  risks are identified. Any risks, which are not addressed by these measures, might be transferred or accepted.  The elements of risk are graphically depicted in Figure 1.  Threats have a key role in defining the risk assessment especially when considering the components of risks.  ISO 27005, the widely adopted standard in the area defines that risks emerge when: “Threats abuse  vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”.  Following this methodology, we have identified assets, threats, existing and emerging security measures for  SDN/5G. These constitute the core of the SDN Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide (STL) presented  in this report. Based on this core, we have also identified gaps that originate from non-mitigated threats and  provided relevant recommendations. An additional key element of our methodology is that identification  and analysis has been based on a study of the related literature, without attempting any experimental or  other form of validation of the claims made within this literature.  Figure 1 - Elements of risks  Furthermore, this study does not consider the use of any specific SDN equipment or the operational  processes and services. Thus, it has not been possible to make a detailed and quantitative assessment of the  impact and vulnerabilities of assets. Such activities could only be performed by asset owners and would  probably require supporting tools for carrying out more comprehensive risk assessments in complex  environments.  10  “ENISA Threat Landscape 2014”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  Assets  Vulnerabilities  Measures  Threat  Attacker  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  12  3. SDN/5G Architecture  SDN Architecture  The main principle that underpins an SDN’s architecture can be summarized as the separation of control and  forwarding functions, logically centralized network control elements and programmable interfaces at  multiple levels.  Figure 2 - Typical SDN Architecture Topology  The typical architecture of SDNs according to the Open Networking Foundation11 is shown in Figure 2. As  shown in the figure, this architecture involves three separate functionality planes:   The Data Plane – i.e., the plane responsible for the data forwarding functionality of the network.  The functionality of this plane is realized through a set of physical network devices (network  elements).   The Control Plane – i.e., the plane responsible for the control functionality of the network. The  functionality of this plane is realized through a set of controllers and devices that facilitate the  creation and destruction of network flows and paths. In an SDN, different controllers have control  responsibility over disjoint subsets of forwarding devices. Through these forwarding devices, they  11  Open Networking Foundation, https://www.opennetworking.org/  https://www.opennetworking.org/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  13  control different parts of the SDN. Typical SDN Controllers include OpenDaylight12, NSX13, Nuage14,  OpenContrail15, ONOS16, Beacon17, Floodlight18, NOX19, ONIX20, POX21 and Maestro22.   The Application Plane – i.e., the plane responsible for generic network management auditing, and  reporting functionalities (e.g., SDN management, monitoring and security). The functionality of this  plane is realized through different network management applications (e.g. Network visualization).  The SDN architecture defines also the key interfaces between the different components in it. These  interfaces are:   The East/West bound API –  This interface is implemented by the different controllers of the SDN  and is used to facilitate communications between them. Representative examples of such APIs are  ALTO23 and Hyperflow24.   The Southbound API – This interface is implemented by the different forwarding devices in the SDN  to enable the communication between these devices and the controllers of the network.  Representative examples of such APIs are OpenFlow25, ForCES26, PCEP27, NetConf28 and IRS29.  12  OpenDaylight: open platform for programmable networks, https://www.opendaylight.org/  13  NSX: Vmware network virtualization platform, http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx  14  Nuage: Nuage Networks network virtualization platform,  http://www.nuagenetworks.net/products/virtualized-services-platform/  15  OpenContrail: open source network virtualization platform for the cloud, http://www.opencontrail.org/  16  ONOS: open carrier-grade SDN network operating system designed, http://onosproject.org/  17  Beacon: cross-platform and modular Java-based OpenFlow controller,  https://openflow.stanford.edu/display/Beacon/Home  18  Floodlight: open enterprise-class SDN controller, http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/  19  NOX: open c++ based SDN development controller platform, http://www.noxrepo.org/  20  Koponen, Teemu, et al. \"Onix: A Distributed Control Platform for Large-scale Production Networks.\" OSDI.

Representative examples of such APIs are FML30, Procera31, Frenetic32, Maple33 and RESTful34.  The final purpose of separating the network’s control and forwarding planes is to provide various benefits;  as simplified administration, automated reconfiguration and performance improvements, however it can  also introduces some significant challenges in network security. In addition this approach reduces the CAPital  EXpenditure (CAPEX), the initial money investment of a company as well as the OPerating EXpenditure  (OPEX) that is the ongoing cost of the investment.  In the following, we identify the key assets in an SDN that  may become the source of security risks for it.  5G Design Principles  The fifth generation of mobile technology known as 5G is positioned to address the demands and business  of the future internet. Whether the need is to download multimedia content, provide content for robots and  autonomous cars or enable distant healthcare, 5G will be the technology behind the scenes and will be on  the forefront of all consumer and business applications. Experts speculate that 5G will be in place by the end  of the decade.  At the time of writing this report, there is no standardized architecture for 5G access. An illustration of the  5G architecture as envisioned by the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN)35 alliance is depicted in  Figure 3.  30  Katta, Naga Praveen, Jennifer Rexford, and David Walker. \"Logic programming for software-defined  networks.\" Workshop on Cross-Model Design and Validation (XLDI).

As such, the 5G architecture is a native SDN/ NFV  architecture covering aspects ranging from devices, (mobile/ fixed) infrastructure, network functions, value  enabling capabilities and all the management functions to orchestrate the 5G system. The architecture  comprises three layers and an E2E management and orchestration entity.”36  The infrastructure resource layer contains any physical device including mobile devices, Internet of Things  (IoT) devices etc. (5G devices), as well as fixed networking devices (networking nodes, cloud nodes, access  nodes etc.). This layer utilizes the SDN/NFV programmability as well as the configurability of 5G devices in  order to meet the 5G design specifications (e.g. bandwidth, capacity latency).  The business enablement layer contains all the necessary functions for the 5G converged network in the  form of modular architecture building blocks. These blocks along with configuration parameters can be  evoked from a common repository upon request depending on the use case.  The E2E management and orchestration entity has access to manage and orchestrate the above mentioned  architectural blocks. In addition, it defines network slices for each use case, interconnects the relevant  functions of the network, assigns the proper configuration to meet E2E specifications and maps all these to  the network entities of the infrastructure resource layer.  The business application layer contains applications and services of the 5G network operators or other  enterprises that use the network. An interface to the E2E management and orchestration entity can be used  to map an application to existing network slices, or to create new slices for the applications.  36 “NGMN 5G white paper”, https://www.ngmn.org/5g-white-paper/5g-white-paper.html  Business Application Layer Use cases,  Business models  and Value proposition  Business Enablement Layer Library of modular network  functions& value enabling capabilities  Infrastructure Resources Layer Cloud, Networking  and Radio Access E2  E  m  an ag  em en  t  an  d  o  rc hi  st ra  to r  5G  https://www.ngmn.org/5g-white-paper/5g-white-paper.html  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  16  4. SDN/5G Assets  Methodological conventions  As commonly defined, in our study, an asset is anything that has value and therefore requires protection.  Due to their value, assets become the targets of threat agents. Threat agents are human or software agents,  which may wish to abuse, compromise and/or damage assets. Threat agents may perform attacks, which  create threats that pose risks to assets.  In a typical ICT system, assets can be: (a) hardware, software and communication components; (b)  communication links between them; (c) data that control the function of the system, are produced and/or  consumed by it, or flow within it; (d) the physical and organizational infrastructure within which the ICT  system is deployed, and (e) the human agents who interact with the system and may affect its operation  (e.g., users, system administrators etc.).  In the overview of SDN assets that we provide in the remainder of this report, we have categorized assets  into the above categories. Furthermore, we have grouped assets according to their position within the  typical SDN architecture, i.e., into data plane, control plane and application plane assets.  Another important consideration has been the inter-domain multi-operator landscape, which refers to the  interconnection of several network operators through specific SLAs.  In the current, non-SDN-based network  model, a network operator is only capable to request network resources from a neighbouring network  operator based on static and agreed SLAs. This is not flexible and requires high negotiation efforts to  facilitate end-to-end QoS through multiple operator networks. Moreover, in contemporary multi-operator  ecosystems, QoS provisioning, as required by industrial applications is not manageable due to different QoS  levels that operators are able to provide37. SDN technology addresses these issues, by providing mechanisms  that enable and allow to access the network infrastructure in different operator domains and provide path- level QoS across different operator domains.  It should be noted that, due to the emerging nature of SDNs, there is no commonly accepted detailed  architecture of data and software components below the 3 architectural layers indicated in Figure 2. Hence,  to provide a thorough asset analysis, we have identified the different types of functionalities, which have  been suggested in the literature for each of the different SDN architecture layers, and mapped them onto  logical functional SDN components, which we, subsequently, refer to as assets. Clearly, these “logical”  software assets may be realized through different groups of actual software components in different SDN  implementations. Nevertheless, we believe that, as a first step towards a security threats analysis, the  reference to “logical” software assets is sufficient.  37 ETICS White paper (2013), https://www.ict-etics.eu/fileadmin/documents/news/ETICS_white_paper_final.pdf  https://www.ict-etics.eu/fileadmin/documents/news/ETICS_white_paper_final.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  17  Categories of SDN Assets  In this part valuable assets of an SDN network infrastructure are presented that are commonly found in the  literature in a hierarchical manner. Based on a single first top layer classification these SDN assets are  distinguished into:   Data Plane Assets:  This asset group includes all assets of the SDN network deployments that include  the physical instances of the network such as switching devices (Switches/Routers) and the  communication medium (wired or wireless). Data plane assets include both hardware and software  (e.g. Firmware, or a more or less full-fledged operating system and software switch) of the so called  network elements.   Control plane Assets: This asset group includes any SDN assets related to the control plane of the  SDN. Such assets include both the hardware (e.g. controllers and Interfaces) and software used to  realize SDN control (e.g. protocols for the controller communication), along with system  configuration and control data.   Application plane Assets: This asset group includes software applications that are used to  implement any network explicitly, directly. Applications can communicate their network  requirements and desired network behaviour to the SDN Controllers via APIs. Application plane  assets include also hardware that is used to run these applications (e.g. Servers)   SDN Users: This asset group includes any User that is using equipment attached to the Data plane  of an SDN deployment. Service-level agreements and regulations can be considered as SDN user  assets as well.   Service provider IT Infrastructure Assets: This asset group includes any component of an IT  infrastructure that is used by or belong to any service provider in the SDN from a billing system to  stored data of an end user in a cloud.   Network service provider physical infrastructure Assets: This asset group includes physical assets  of the network service providers including every construction (e.g. Buildings, data centres etc.),  machinery as well as the power supply networks   Human Assets: This asset group includes any human in the SDN ecosystem from system and network  administrators to simple end users.  A mind map presenting the above taxonomy is shown in Figure 4. A more detailed taxonomy of assets  categorised in deeper taxonomic levels is also provided in Annex A.Annex A:  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  18  Figure 4 - SDN assets threat landscape  It should be noted that the SDN network infrastructure and its respective components/assets, assumed by  our analysis, may belong either to a single network operator (intra-domain case) or to multiple network  operators (inter-domain case).

SDN Threats  SDN brings significant innovation to networking.  Key concepts associated with SDN such as Logically  Centralized Intelligence, Programmability and Network Abstraction establish a basis for future  communications. While significant improvements may be achieved in network security by centralization and  programmability, these two concepts can also attract a new level of threats and attacks.  Security within the SDN paradigm is a challenge, as all layers, sub-layers and components need to  communicate according to strict security policies. In this report, we have attempted to increase awareness  by identifying key valuable assets of the SDN infrastructure that are needed in order to ensure proper  network function and interoperability. As these assets may, however, become the target of attacks, they  become naturally the main driver of threat analysis aimed at securing SDNs.  Taxonomy of SDN/5G Threats  The identification of SDN/5G threats has been based on a study of the related literature, which indicates not  only SDN threats but also generic taxonomies that could be used for classifying them.  One of these taxonomies has been documented in the ENISA report “ENISA Threat Landscape 2014”38  (ETL14). Although this taxonomy has not been developed for SDN/5G threats, our view is that it is generic  enough to be used for classification of such threats. This is because of the similarity of the respective  landscapes, i.e., the Internet Infrastructure and the SDN/5G landscape, which renders the taxonomic  classification presented in ELT14 broadly applicable to the SDN/5G landscape. Furthermore, the adoption of  this taxonomy can make the understanding of the SDN/5G threat landscape easier for the reader.  Based on ETL14, the general categories of threats for the SDN/5G landscape are:   Nefarious activity/abuse (NAA): This threat category is defined as “intended actions that target ICT  systems, infrastructure, and/or networks by means of malicious acts with the aim to either steal,  alter, or destroy a specified target”34   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking (EIH):  This threat category is defined as “actions aiming to  listen, interrupt, or seize control of a third party communication without consent”34   Physical attacks (PA): This threat category is defined as “actions which aim to destroy, expose, alter,  disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to physical assets such as infrastructure, hardware, or  interconnection”34   Damage (DAM): This threat category is defined as intentional actions aimed at causing “ destruction,  harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or reduction in usefulness”34   Unintentional Damage (UD): This threat category is defined as unintentional actions aimed at  causing “ destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or reduction in  usefulness ”34  38 ENISA Threat Landscape 2013, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  20   Failures or malfunctions (FM): This threat category is defined as “insufficient functioning of an  (Internet infrastructure) asset”34. In the case of SDN/5G the assets include those defined in the asset  list.   Outages (OUT): This threat category is defined as “unexpected disruptions of service or decrease in  quality falling below a required level “34   Disaster (DIS): This threat category is defined as “serious disruption of the functioning of a society”34   Legal (LEG): This threat category is defined as “legal actions of third parties (contracting or  otherwise), in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on applicable law” 34  In addition to the above general taxonomy, we also categorise threats depending on whether their source  is an SDN element, a 5G element or a generic network element. Based on this criterion, threats can be further  categorised into:   SDN specific threats39: These are threats related to the elements of the SDN architecture. These  threats fall under the categories “Nefarious activity/abuse” and “Eavesdropping/Interception/  Hijacking”. SDN specific threats are described in detail in Sect. 5.2.   Network Virtualisation threats: These are threats related to the underlying IT infrastructure used for  virtualising network operations. Network Virtualisation specific threats are described in more detail  in Sect. 5.3.   5G/Radio access threats40: These are threats related to the 5G landscape but not specific to the SDN  infrastructure. 5G specific threats include threats related to the wireless medium, the virtualisation  of functions and the multi-operator environment. Threats of the wireless medium are mostly related  to “Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking”; threats on virtualisation are related to “Nefarious  activity/abuse” and “Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking”. 5G specific threats are described in  more detail in Sect. 5.4.   Generic network infrastructure threats: These are threats that any network infrastructure faces  without reference to the 5G and/or SDN landscape. Generic network infrastructure threats fall under  the categories “Physical attacks”, “Damage or loss of equipment”, “Equipment failures or  malfunctions”, “Outages”, “Disaster” and “Legal and business”. Generic network infrastructure  threats are described in more detail in Sect. 5.5.  SDN specific Threats  In the following, we present types of threats that are specific to SDN. Such threats may relate to different  assets in the reference SDN architecture, as shown in Figure 5. For the listed threats, we also identify the  layer of the reference SDN architecture that these threats are primarily related to according to the literature  if relevant.  Data forging: This threat involves compromising an SDN element (e.g., controller, router, switch) in order to  forge network data and launch other attacks (e.g., DOS). Whilst data forging may, in principle, relate to data  39  SDNSecurity.org, “An Overview of Misuse / Attack Cases”, http://sdnsecurity.org/project_SDN-Security- Vulnerbility-attack-list.html  40  Ericsson White paper, “5G Security”, Uen 284 23-3269 | June 2015,  http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/whitepapers/wp-5g-security.pdf  http://sdnsecurity.org/project_SDN-Security-Vulnerbility-attack-list.html http://sdnsecurity.org/project_SDN-Security-Vulnerbility-attack-list.html http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/whitepapers/wp-5g-security.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  21  held by any component of an SDN (e.g., network switches, controllers and/or SDN applications), a threat  specific to SDN consists in forging requests from accessible low level SDN controllers to upper level ones, in  order to drive their decisions on how to redefine large parts of the network. In the literature it has been  identified as a threat related to components in the data plane and the controller plane.  Traffic diversion: This threat involves compromising a network element in order to divert traffic flows and  to enable eavesdropping. Traffic diversion is a threat relating to network elements of the data plane. A  specific kind of traffic diversion that is available in virtualized networks is network slice trespassing. This  occurs when the mandatory isolation between slices is compromised in any active node or when the  enforcing access to a slice in the edge equipment is either bypassed or misconfigured. This ends with alien  traffic circulating on a given slice.  Data Plane Threats Control Plane Threats Application Plane Threats  Figure 5 - Threats of SDN reference architecture  Side channel attack: This threat involves extracting information on existing flow rules that are used by  network elements.  The threat can be realised by exploiting patterns of network operations (e.g. exploiting  the time required for establishing a network connection). Side channel attacks is a threat relating to network  elements of the data plane.  Flooding attack: Flooding attacks involve compromising a SDN component in order to make it flood other  components, which it interacts with. Flooding occurs through the transmission of data that can exhaust  component resources and lead to a reduction or complete shutdown of the service provided by the  component. Flooding attacks occur primarily for network components of the data plane. In such cases, the  threat involves compromising a network component in order to make it flood its controller with network  messages, and overload and eventually exhaust the controller’s resources. Flooding attacks can also occur  at the control plane. In such cases, a controller is flooded with messages from other (malicious) controllers  that can exhaust its resources causing a reduction or complete shutdown of the controller’s service.  Specific  to SDN are amplification flooding attacks where a small stream of requests with a faked sender elicits a  flooding large stream of response.  While protection from such attacks have been devised for many known  network protocol, the exposure of several network functions (NFV) by SDN controllers presents a whole new  landscape of threats.  Compromised EWBI  Compromised  Controller  Attacker  Compromised Application  Attacker  Compromised NE  Attacker  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  22  Software/firmware exploits: This threat involves exploiting vulnerabilities of the software/firmware in order  to cause some malfunction, reduction or disruption of service, eavesdrop data or destroy/compromise data.  Software/firmware exploits may occur in all layers of the SDN reference architecture, and depending on the  layer that they relate to they have been distinguished into network element software/firmware exploits,  controller software/firmware exploits, and SDN applications software/firmware exploits.  Software/firmware exploits of network elements and controllers cause the malfunction or even their  termination of operation. In the case of switches, for example, the exploited switches can drop, slow down,  clone or deviate network traffic. Exploited switches software/firmware can also create forged traffic in order  to exhaust other switches and/or the controllers the switches are connected to.  Denial of Service (DoS): This threat relates to attacks aimed at causing reduction or disruption of the SDN  service. DoS threats may occur in all layers of the SDN reference architecture. At the data plane, DoS can be  caused by attackers, which flood the bandwidth or resources of network elements. This arrack type in many  occasions originate by multiple compromised systems, such as botnets, which are flooding the targeted SDN  with traffic. At the control plane, a DoS can be caused by congesting controllers through a large number of  forged flow arrivals, causing network performance degradation and interruption. Traditional DoS defences’  approaches focus on protecting the data plane, and are therefore ineffective in the cases of SDN control  plane DoS attacks. DoS attacks may also appear at the application plane affecting, for example, network  management applications.  Identity spoofing: Identity spoofing is a threat where a threat agent successfully determines the identity of  a legitimate entity and then masquerades this entity in order to launch further attacks. Identity spoofing is  a threat that can affect any type of software component or human agents. In the case of SDN, identify  spoofing has been identified as an attack affecting mainly SDN controllers (SDN controller identity spoofing).  In this attack, the attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate controller and interacts with the network  elements controlled by the legitimate controller (i.e., elements of the data plane) in order to trigger several  other types of attacks (e.g., instantiate network flows, divert traffic etc.).  API exploitation: This threat involves exploiting the API of a software component in order to launch different  types of further attacks such as the unauthorised disclosure, compromise of integrity and/or destruction of  information, or the unauthorised destruction/degradation of service. In SDN, API exploitation may relate to  all the different types of APIs that may be found in an SDN. These include: (a) the Northbound API  (Northbound API exploitation) that facilitates the communication between SDN controllers and SDN  applications; (b) the Southbound API that facilitates the communication between SDN network elements  and SDN controllers (i.e., Southbound API exploitation), and (c) the Eastbound/Westbound API that  facilitates the communication between SDN controllers (i.e., Eastbound/Westbound API exploitation).  Memory scraping: This threat arises when an attacker scans the physical memory of a software component  in order to extract sensitive information that is it not authorised to have. Whilst in SDN, memory scrapping  can affect components of any layer, this type of threat has been primarily identified for SDN application  servers41. While the memory scrapping threat is exclusive to SDN, a core dump (e.g. as the result of malicious  software) can be used to exploit private data. Furthermore SDN reconfiguration may require reboots that  an attacker could use in order to attack the boot procedure. Once successfully performed, memory scrapping  can be used to extract sensitive SDN data (e.g., flow rules at the Northbound API).  41 J. Hizver, Taxonomic Modeling of Security Threats in Software Defined Networking, BlackHat Conference, August 5-6, 2015,  available from: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Hizver-Taxonomic-Modeling-Of-Security-Threats- In-Software-Defined-Networking-wp.pdf  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Hizver-Taxonomic-Modeling-Of-Security-Threats-In-Software-Defined-Networking-wp.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Hizver-Taxonomic-Modeling-Of-Security-Threats-In-Software-Defined-Networking-wp.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  23  Remote application exploitation: In this threat, an attacker gains access or obtains higher access privileges  to an SDN application by exploiting software vulnerabilities of it.  This can then be used to execute operations  illegitimately.  Traffic sniffing:  Traffic sniffing involves tapping data flows within a network. In SDN, traffic sniffing has been  identified primarily as an attack upon the communication link between an application at the SDN application  plane and a controller at the control plane in order to gain access to important controller configuration data  or application-level credentials. Traffic sniffing can be enabled by the use of weak or no encryption in the  relevant communication link. It should be noted that traffic sniffing might also be used for legitimate reasons  (e.g., for network monitoring and administration) and if used in this manner it should not be regarded as an  attack.  Network Virtualisation Threats  Network virtualisation threats42,43,44,45 are threats related to the underlying IT infrastructure used for  virtualising network operations. Such threats can be distinguished into:  Threats related to servers running virtualised network functions (virtualised host abuse): Virtualisation of  functions and their operation on virtual machines (e.g., a server that can be used as a network switch) is a  common practice in SDN. Therefore traditional security threats for servers running virtualised network  operations such as network monitoring, access control, network management etc. should be considered.46  Threats to data centres hosting SDN operations (Data centre threats): Many SDN systems are deployed  within data centres. Hence, security threats of data centres should be considered, similarly to the server  case. Moreover, data servers are using Data Centre Interconnect (DCI) protocols, which may lack  authentication and encryption to secure the packet contents. Thus an attacker could create spoofed traffic  in such a way that it traverses the DCI links or to create a DoS attack of the DCI connections.  Threats related to virtualization mechanism: (Network Virtualization bypassing): The use of the network  between different tenants need to assure that only legitimated traffic enters or leaves a network slice, but  also that any switching element checks and enforces the traffic isolation by installing legitimate flow rules  preventing slice trespassing.  42  Drutskoy, Dmitry, Eric Keller, and Jennifer Rexford. \"Scalable network virtualization in software-defined  networks.\" Internet Computing, IEEE 17.2 (2013): 20-27.,  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6362137  43  Pearce, Michael, Sherali Zeadally, and Ray Hunt. \"Virtualization: Issues, security threats, and solutions.\" ACM  Computing Surveys (CSUR) 45.2 (2013): 17., http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2431216  44  ETSI GS NFV-SEC 001 V1.1.1 (2014-10): Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV);NFV Security;Problem  Statement, http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf  45  ETSI GS NFV-SEC 003 V1.1.1 (2014-12): Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV);NFV Security;Security and  Trust Guidance, http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV- SEC003v010101p.pdf  46  Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV);NFV Security; Problem Statement,  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6362137 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2431216 http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC003v010101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC003v010101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC001v010101p.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  24  In reference to the taxonomy of threats outlined in Sect. 2, wireless medium threats fall under the general  category of “Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking”.  5G radio access threats  In SDNs there can also be threats arising due to the use of 5G technology47,48; in particular the use of  wireless communication in 5G. Such threats, as described in49  can be distinguished into:  User emulation: The wireless medium can be exploited by adversaries that mimic incumbent signals.  Nodes launching such attacks can be (i) Greedy mobile nodes that by transmitting fake incumbent signals  force all other users to vacate a specific band (spectrum hole) in order to acquire its exclusive use and (ii)  Malicious mobile nodes (adversaries) that mimic incumbent signals in order to cause Denial of Service  (DoS) attacks. Malicious nodes can cooperate and transmit fake incumbent signals in more than one band,  thus causing extensive DoS attacks making a radio hop from band to band, severely disrupting its  operation.  Spectrum sensing data falsification: The received signal power may enforced to become lower compared  to what path loss models have predicted due to transmission features such as signal fading, multi-path  propagation, etc., 50. This may lead to harmful interference due to undetected primary signals.  MAC layer attack: This category of attacks includes (i) MAC spoofing, where attackers send spurious  messages aiming to disrupt the operation of network(e.g. channel negotiation), (ii) Congestion attacks,  where attackers flood Common Control Channel in order to cause an extended DoS attack and (iii)  Jamming attacks, where attackers cause DoS attacks at this layer by creating interference.  In reference to the taxonomy of threats outlined in Sect. 2, Network Function Virtualization (NFV)51 threats  can be seen as threats under the “Nefarious Activity/Abuse” and “Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking”  categories.  Generic network infrastructure threats  Besides the pure telecommunication infrastructures, in SDN/5G there are interdependencies with other  computing infrastructures such as the cloud that may be used for network virtualisation.

ENISA has produced an extensive and comprehensive report for this  area52. In the following, we highlight the generic network infrastructure threats that should be considered  in addition to the SDN specific threats and the 5G specific threats.  Physical threats: This type of attack refers to actions (attacks) aimed at destroying, disabling, altering or  stealing physical ICT infrastructure assets. This type of threat applies to any network and computing  infrastructure, including SDN/5G infrastructures. Physical threats are very important due to the  virtualisation of networking functions, which may result in deploying such functions in remote servers and  data centres. Despite the existence of physical protection mechanisms (e.g., physical surveillance and  surveillance cameras, security locks, security guards), physical breaches and insider threat attacks still  occur53. Examples of such attacks include fraud, sabotage vandalism, theft, information leakage/sharing,  unauthorised physical access and terrorist attacks.  Damage/loss: This type of threats refers to intentional or unintentional destruction of ICT infrastructure. It  may be physical as for example the destruction of a server or take the form of a cyber damage as, for  example,  mixing-up information in a data centre due to maintenance errors or erroneous system  administration.  Failures/malfunctions: This type of threats refers to failures or insufficient functioning of network and  infrastructure subsystems. Examples of this threat type include failure or malfunctioning of devices  including network elements, controllers and network management applications, disruption of the  communication links, and/or failure of service providers.  Outages: This type of threats refers to the interruption or failure in the supply of a service. In the case of  SDN/5G networks, it includes interruption of support services such as Internet and electricity, the loss of  network connectivity either due to cable errors or the loss of (part of) a wireless network, or loss of human  (e.g. strike of employees of a network operator) or physical resources.  Disaster: A disaster is a sudden incident that interrupts the daily activities of the society. It can be  categorised in disasters caused by the intervention of human (environmental) or natural disasters such as  floods, earthquakes etc.  Legal: Since the 5G landscape is of multi-operator nature, where all operators will be interconnected to  each other, multi-operator related threats are very important. In this landscape, operators of the SDN  infrastructure that will not honestly stick to business agreements (SLAs) should be considered. Moreover,  measures for non-repudiation of SLAs between different operators should be considered.

These tables list SDN/NFV/5G specific threats  (Table 1 - SDN/5G Specific threats and assetsTable 1), and generic network threats (Table 2), respectively.  For each threat, the tables provide:  (a) A brief description of the threat (see “Threat” column), the main type of the threat in reference to  the taxonomy described in the ENISA report on “Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for  Internet Infrastructure”54 that has been overviewed in Sect. 2 of this report. In cases where a threat  falls under more than one categories in the ENISA taxonomy, the additional categories are identified  in the description of the threat.  (b) The assets that the threat affects (see column “Asset types”). This description refers to the asset  listing produced earlier as part of the project.  (c) The potential effect of the threat described in terms of the basic security properties that a threat  can compromise, i.e., confidentiality, integrity or availability (see column “Potential Effect”).  54 Enisa, “Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure”,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-

Threat Agents  According to ELT1455, a threat agent is “someone or something with decent capabilities, a clear intention to  manifest a threat and a record of past activities in this regard”.  ELT14 categorizes thread agents as follows:   Corporations   Hacktivists   Cyber criminals   Cyber terrorists   Script kiddies   Online social hackers   Employees   Nation states  Another categorization of threat agents in the case of SDN may be based on whether or not an agent has  legitimate access to the resources/assets of a network. According to this criterion, and similarly to 56  attackers may be distinguished into:   External attackers: These are attackers with no legitimate access to the SDN network and its  services, but they own appropriate network tools and in some occasions infrastructure that enable  then to interfere with the operation of the SDN network. In addition, these attackers may have  unsupervised access to servers that run virtualised SDN application and they have the ability to  modify the behaviour of these servers by installing rogue software on them. This is a broad category  of attackers including cybercriminals, hacktivists, terrorists, corporations and Nation States.   Internal attackers: These category refers to people that have inside access to the network operator  resources. They can be employees (staff) of the network operator and contractors.  o Dishonest customers: These can be misbehaving end-users that have legitimate/subscribed  access to the SDN network and its services and take advantage of their access to the network  in order to interfere with its operation or to gain illegal access to its services (e.g., by  impersonating another customer).  o Dishonest operators: These are telecom operators or service providers that their network  infrastructure is based on SDN, which attempt to gain competitive advantage over their  competing operators by not honestly sticking to their agreed business agreements (SLAs).  For the SDN landscape, it is crucial for asset owners to be aware of which threats can emerge from different  threat agent groups. The following table (Table 3) presents an overview of this based on the threat agent  categorization of ELT14.  55 “ENISA Threat Landscape 2014”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  56  Askoxylakis, I., et al. \"Securing multi‐operator‐based QoS‐aware mesh networks: requirements and  design options.\" Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 10.5 (2010): 622-646.

Good Practices  This section provides a review of existing techniques, tools and practices for threat mitigation in SDN/5G  that have been identified through literature search and discussion with an expert group convened by ENISA  for this purpose.  The underlying search that resulted in the identification of threat mitigation practices has also considered  established research programmes and large scale collaborative research and innovation projects, which have  already delivered or are expected to deliver techniques, tools and practices for SDN/5G security threat  mitigation, according to their work programme. To support and enhance the outcomes in this direction, the  expert group that was convened by ENISA involved representatives from Phase 1 of the funded projects of  5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership 57 (in short 5G PPP)58. 5G PPP was initiated by the EU Commission  and industry manufacturers, telecommunications operators, service providers, SMEs and researchers with  the aim of delivering solutions, architectures, technologies and standards for global next generation  communication infrastructures.  In the following, we first present threat mitigation practices arising from already developed SDN protection  technologies (Sect.7.1) and then mitigation practices, which are currently under development (Sect.7.2).  Existing threat mitigation practices  Existing threat mitigation practices have identified through a review of SDN protection techniques that have  been suggested in the literature and/or implemented in existing SDN tools. The tools that were considered  for this purpose are discussed next.  7.1.1 Overview of tools/techniques  Secure Architecture for the Networked Enterprise (SANE59): SANE is an architecture developed to protect  enterprise networks. SANE includes one logical controller for all packet forwarding rule decisions. This  controller is the only trusted component in the network and assigns an encrypted channel to every permitted  request. SANE supports natural policies (e.g. allow everyone in group accounting to connect to the web  server hosting documentation) that are autonomous of network topology and the used equipment.  Ethane60: Ethane is an architecture proposed for enterprise networks to provide strong security guarantees.  It is based in a Central Domain Controller (DC) that implements secure bindings by authenticating users,  hosts, services etc. DC contains the global security policy of the network and checks every new flow request  57  https://5g-ppp.eu/5g-ppp-phase-1-projects/  58  https://5g-ppp.eu/  59  M.

(Note: Ethane is no longer maintained, however, due to the importance in the evolution  of SDN has been included)  FlowNAC61: FlowNAC is network access control solution, based on flows, that permits granting the users  rights to access the network following a target service use request. Each set of flows functions as a service  that can be independently requested. Multiple services can be authorized at the same time. SDN offers the  granularity that is necessary for identifying services at the data plane as a set of flows, in order to enforce  suitable policy.  This is done in a dynamic fashion.  Panopticon62: An architecture proposal to realize incrementally deployment of SDN. Panopticon results in a  Hybrid SDN deployment. It introduces a mechanism called Solitary Confinement Tree, which using VLAN  functionality ensure that inbound traffic to switch ports of legacy devices passes through at least one SDN  switch. This topology is sufficient to ensure end-to-end network policy.  DefenceFlow63: DefenceFlow is a commercial application that detects and resolves DDoS attacks. Its  operation is based on pattern matching of traffic statistics of SND forwarding devices. In case of DDoS  detection it redirects traffic to the nearest mitigation device. A mitigation device devices can be placed in  any location in the network  HP Sentinel Security64: An SDN application that monitors the flow creation process in the network. As a flow  is identified, it is compared to a reputation database for IP Address and DNS names. If the lookup is positive,  traffic is dropped on the forwarding devices.  NOX65 : The NOX SDN controller has focussed on implementing traffic anomaly detection algorithms.  Rosemary66: Rosemary is an SDN controller that is based on the approach of spawning SDN applications in  an isolated pseudo network operating system. The result is network application containment and resilience  strategy.  FRESCO67: FRESCO is a security application development framework that is designed to enable rapid design  of detection and mitigation modules in the context of OpenFlow. FRESCO provides a scripting API enabling  the coding of security monitoring and threat detection logic as modular libraries.  FlowChecker68: FlowChecker is a tool that can identify intra switch misconfigurations. This tool can used to:  (a) verify the consistency of different switches and controllers across different SDN infrastructures using  OpenFLow, (b) validate the correctness of the FlowTable configurations of new deployed protocols and  61  J.

NICE69: NICE is a tool that can automate the testing of OpenFlow applications through a combination of  symbolic execution and model checking. NICE utilises model checking techniques and symbolic execution  for generating network traffic, which can be used to systematically explore the state space of the entire SDN  deployment (switches, controllers, hosts).  Veriflow70: Veriflow is a network troubleshooting tool that can be used to find erroneous forwarding rules  in an SDN deployment. In addition it can be utilised to prevent misbehaviour caused by such rules to the  network. Veriflow provides a layer between SDN controllers and switches that examines network-wide  invariant violations in real time as rule are inserted, deleted or modified in a switch.  FortNOX71: FortNOX is an extension of the NOX OpenFlow controller specializing in providing role-based  authorization and enforcing security constraints on the controller. FortNOX consists of a mediation service  that performs verification of OpenFlow Application rules against a set of network flow constraints that have  been defined by administrators or OpenFlow security applications. This mediation service cannot be  bypassed.  FLOVER72: FLOVER is a model checking system, which can be used to verify that flow policies deployed by an  OpenFlow application do not violate network security policies.  Se-Floodlight73: Security Enhanced (Se) Floodlight is an implementation of an OpenFlow security mediation  service for enforcing network security. It is similar to FRESCO except there is more functionality due to the  extensions set by the new OpenFlow specification.  FatTire74: FatTire is a programming language designed for writing fault resilient network application  programs. It utilizes n-regular expressions that allow programmers to exclusively specify sets of legal paths  through the network and fault resilient requirements for those paths.  AVANT-GUARD75: AVANT-GUARD is a data plane extension consisting of an actuating triggers and a  Connection migration module. AVANT-GUARD is designed to make SDN security applications more scalable  and consequently capable of tackling a dynamic range of network threats. The connection migration module  provides shielding to the control plane from saturation attacks to the interface between control and data  plane (SBI API). The actuating triggers module enables the data plane to asynchronously report network  69  M. Canini, et al. \"A NICE Way to Test OpenFlow Applications.\" NSDI. Vol. 12. 2012.  70  A. Khurshid, W.

In this way it helps the control plane to manage network flows without delay.  PermOF76: PermOF is a highly tuneable permission system that incorporates an as-needed customized  permission set and an advanced thread-based isolation mechanism. It can be used to define permissions to  control access of OpenFLow controllers from the application layer. Hence, effectively it provides an isolation  layer between the application and the control layer in the reference SDN architecture. Network operators  can use PermOF to define application permission policies at run time.  7.1.2 Mitigated SDN threats  Our initial analysis has shown that the techniques/tools overviewed above address some of the threats that  have been identified for SDN.  The following table (Table 4) shows, which SDN threats are addressed by each of the above techniques/tools.  PA in the table indicates that a technique/tool partially addresses the threat. An empty cell in the table  indicates that a threat is not addressed according to the initial analysis. It should be noted that the  information provided in Table 4 is based only on a review of the documentation of the reviewed tool and  has resulted from any form of tool/technique usage or testing.  76  Wen, Xitao, et al. \"Towards a secure controller platform for openflow applications.\" Proceedings of the  second ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Hot topics in software defined networking.

A Network Service Directory (NSD)  replaces classical DNS in SANE based deployments. NSD maintains an access control list for every  service.   Denial of Service (DoS): SANE includes capabilities for DDoS prevention. SANE hosts do not exchange  information with network elements but receive the so called “capabilities” for the domain controller,  which are constructed on–route.   Remote SDN application exploitation: SANE based networks require authentication of all principals  (hosts, switches etc.) using symmetric key encryption in order to ensure secure communication.   Unauthorized access, unauthorized administration of devices and systems: SANE addresses  unauthorized activities using the Access Control List (ACL) that it incorporates. To access network  resources in SANE, a host has to be authorized and have the required policies in the ACL that permit  requesting the so called network capabilities. In addition, encryption is used for the distribution of  network capabilities.   Traffic diversion: Routing in SANE is done by the domain controller that encrypts route information  (next hop) in a SANE header in every packet. In SANE, only the domain controller records and  maintains a complete view of the network topology.   Identity spoofing: SANE networks implement authorization and symmetric key encryption and an  access control list for every network node (host, switches etc.)   Man in the middle in NBI and SBI: SANE networks implement authorization and symmetric key  encryption and access control list for every network node (host, switches etc.)  Ethane provides mitigations for the following threats:   Manipulation of Information / Data forging: Ethane networks are based on a central controller.  Computes route information for the permitted flows by having knowledge of the network topology.  Ethane does not allow any communication between end hosts without explicit permission.   Denial of Service (DoS): Ethane networks allow initial data exchange only to the controller in order  to grant network access. Unauthorized packets are dropped by the switching elements.   Remote SDN application exploitation: Ethane establishes that a misbehaving node cannot  masquerade as the controller or a network element (switch or router) by utilizing authentication  with preconfigured credentials. Communication between the controller and the network element is  established only after authentication is successful. This communication is done via an encrypted  connection and it facilitates all communications between the controller and the network element.   Unauthorized access, unauthorized administration of devices and systems: Ethane establishes that a  misbehaving node cannot masquerade as the controller or a network element (switch or router) by  utilizing authentication with preconfigured credentials. Communication between the controller and  the network element is established only after authentication is successful. This communication is  done via an encrypted connection and it facilitates all communications between the controller and  the network element.   Traffic diversion: Routing is performed by the controller which has all the topology information of  the network. Only the controller can alter data flows by controlling the switching elements trough  encrypted links.   Identity spoofing: Authentication is mandatory to access network resources.   Man in the middle in NBI and SBI: Communications are encrypted with predefined keys.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  49  FlowNAC provides mitigations for the following threats:   Service provisioning exploitation: There is an authorization mechanism that checks every service  requested by a user.   Unauthorized activities: Users have to be authenticated and authorized for each individual service.  All frames coming from the user are individually evaluated and categorized in services. Afterwards,  an allow or deny judgment is enforced for each of these frames conditional on whether the  associated service is permitted or not.   Identity spoofing: Identity of every applicant that asks for a service is checked. This can be done on  the first access and periodically. This covers user and administration access.   Network Virtualization bypass, Unlawful network slice ingress and egress: No authenticated service  (or corresponding flow) is allowed to enter, or even leave, a slice.  Panopticon provides mitigations for the following threats:   Denial of Service (DoS): Panopticon proposes hybrid SDN – non SDN network architecture. As an  abstraction layer, Panopticon is responsible for hiding the legacy devices and acts as a “network  hypervisor” that maps the logical SDN abstraction to the underlying hardware, being able to prevent  or mitigate this kind of attacks.  DefenseFlow provides mitigations for the following threats:   Denial of Service (DoS): DefenseFlow incorporates a patented behavioural fuzzy logic detection  algorithm which is able to detect different types of network DDoS attacks.  HP  Sentinel security provides mitigations for the following threats:   Malicious software – Malware: HP Sentinel security incorporates detection capabilities for about  700,000 malicious malware, spyware, and botnet threats.   Virtualization threats: HP Sentinel security provides support for the Threat Protection System (see  below) in virtual environments. HP provide the Sentinel security application for HP Virtual  Application Networks SDN Controller.   Traffic sniffing: In an HP Sentinel security environment an SDN controller forwards new IP  connection requests to a Threat Protection System (TPS). TPS uses a reputation database to check  the requests and replies with a pass/fail request to the controller.   Interception of information – S/W interceptions, Memory Scrapping: HP Sentinel security provides  real-time threat detection and security policy enforcement at the edge of the deployed network.  Rosemary provides mitigations for the following threats:   Remote SDN application exploitation: Network applications are isolated from the core of the  Rosemary operating system. In addition, Rosemary utilizes sandboxing functionality to protect the  network operation system.   Unauthorized activities: Rosemary establishes whether an application has rights to access or modify  a data structure. If an application can not access the data structure, it will not be able to get the  necessary capability.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  50   Traffic diversion: To alter flow tables in a Rosemary Environment, an application has to gain access  permission from the NOS.   Software/firmware exploits - Controller: As discussed for the case of remote SDN application  exploitation, in Rosemary network applications are isolated from the core of the Rosemary  operating system. In addition, Rosemary utilizes sandboxing functionality to protect the network  operation system.   Traffic sniffing: To alter flow tables in a Rosemary Environment, an application has to gain access  permission from the NOS.  FRESCO provides mitigations for the following threats:   SBI exploitation: Fresco controllers must be authorized and use encryption to communicate with the  network switching elements.   Unauthorized activities, Memory scraping: Fresco uses a Security Enforcement Kernel (SEK).   Traffic diversion: When a conflict appears, the FRESCO Security Enforcement Kernel applies a  hierarchical authority model that provides the capability to replace an existing flow rule with a  candidate rule, if the digital signature of the source of the candidate rule possesses more authority  than the source of the existing rule.   Identity spoofing: FRESCO applications (aka modules) are created using a scripting language. FRESCO  incorporates a script-to-module translator, which automatically translates the scripts to modules,  creates instances of the modules, and validates and registers the modules using a registration API.  This API allows only authorized administrators to create FRESCO modules.   Controller firmware/software exploits: Applications in FRESCO access the SDN controller through the  Security Enforcement Kernel.   Traffic sniffing: The FRESCO Security Enforcement Kernel utilizes a trust model that empowers  FRESCO modules to digitally sign each candidate flow rule. This permits SEK to conclude whether a  candidate flow rule was produced by a FRESCO security module, an OpenFlow application, or a  network administrator.  FlowChecker provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations, Falsifications of configurations, Traffic diversion, Traffic sniffing: Flow  checker is able to validate the correctness of the flow tables and configuration of the SDN switching  devices.   Unauthorized administration of devices and systems: FlowChecker uses SSL to communicate with  the SDN controllers in the network.   SDN Identity spoofing: A controller has to subscribe to the FlowChecker (called master controller).  In addition there is the possibility that flow tables are stored in a Database with role based access  control.  NICE provides mitigations for the following threats:   Flooding attack: NICE is capable of checking for generic correctness properties such as no forwarding  loops or no black holes, and when required write additional application-specific correctness  properties. Python code snippets that make assertions about the global system state, can be utilized.   Traffic diversion, Traffic sniffing: NICE outputs property violations along with their traces so that  they can be deterministically reproduced.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  51  VeriFlow provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations, DNS manipulations: VeriFlow resides between the SDN applications  and SDN devices in order to capture and check every flow rule entering the network.   Falsifications of configurations: VeriFlow search for erroneous rules issued by SDN applications, and  when required, prevents them from reaching the SDN network and causing irregular network  behaviour or even damage.  FortNOX provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations: FortNOX has the ability to enforce network flow rules produced by  OF-enabled security applications that request to reprogram switches in response to potential  runtime operational threats.   Falsifications of configurations   Traffic engineering exploitation: FortNOX uses a rule conflict resolution for the flow rules with  authorization levels (rolls)   Unauthorised administration of devices and systems: FortNOX incorporates an authentication  mechanism.   Traffic diversion, Traffic Sniffing: Digital signature validation is performed for each flow rule  insertion request via a role-based source authentication module. This may lead to assignment of  appropriate priority to a candidate flow rule, or even the lowest priority in the event that no  signature is provided.   SDN Identity spoofing: FortNOX supports digital signatures for each flow rule inserted in the SDN  switching devices.  FLOVER provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations: Flow tables are sent to the switching elements over an encrypted  network link.   Flooding attack: FLOVER ensures consistency with the current network security policy for the flow  rules inserted in a switch’s flow table(s).   Traffic sniffing and Traffic diversion: FLOVER decomposes network security policies in sets of  assertions referred to as non-bypass properties. Non-bypass properties specify whether a certain  packet/flow matching a set of conditions should be forwarded to its destination or otherwise  dropped. Yices, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver, is used to check for non-bypass property  violations.  FatTire provides mitigations for the following threats:   Routing table manipulations: FatTire features logic that facilitates reasoning about the behaviour  of the system during periods of failure recovery. This enables verification of network-wide  invariants.   Denial of Service: FatTire incorporates modules (outcome) that on OF switches and can take  advantage of in-network fast-failover mechanisms.   Traffic diversion: The FatTire compiler generates rule tables and group tables that enable fault- tolerance while at the same time guaranteeing that traffic flows along the paths specified by the  program.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  52  AVANT-GUARD provides mitigations for the following threats:   Falsifications of configurations: Intelligence empowered connection mitigation, differentiates  sources that will complete TCP connections from sources that will not, at the data plane level.   Denial of Service: A classification stage performs connection mitigation which shields the control  plane from failed connection floods on the client-side. Such connections may be the product of  DoS attacks or reconnaissance activities.   Traffic diversion: AVANT-GUARD employs triggers that introduce conditional flow rule activation.  Security applications can predefine a set of actions and strategies for handling flows that appear  as a product certain network operating conditions that can be expressed through switch statistics.  PERMOF provides mitigations for the following threats:   Malicious Software: PermOF introduces a shim layer that is configured and controlled by the  controller kernel. This ensures isolation of and achieves zero interaction between the applications  and the OS. This feature is a product of modifying the dynamic library of the programming language  or the OS itself.   Remote SDN application exploitation: to ensure the application authenticity and integrity, PKI-based  authentication may be enforced.   Controller Software/firmware exploits, Memory scraping: An Isolation mechanism, including a  system permission set, is introduced by PERMOF. With PERMOF Third party SDN applications are  operating under minimized privileges   Man in the middle in NBI: When an API call is received from the application, a thread class  encapsulates the function call and passes it to kernel. This is done by utilizing the built-in inter-thread  communication facility. As the caller’s identity is attached on the API calls, the controller’s kernel  can easily perform permission control, based on a pre-configured policy.  Threat mitigation practices under development  In the following, we present practices for threat mitigation in SDN/5G that are under development. Several  good practices may relate and address more than one threat.  In the context of this report all 5G-PPP Phase  1 projects, that consist of fifteen Research and Innovation action projects and three Innovation action  projects of HORIZON 2020 in the area of Information and Communication Technologies77 have been asked  to provide their input.  7.2.1 Related 5G-PPP HORIZON 2020 projects  VirtuWind78 is aimed at developing an open, modular and secure framework to support intra-domain and  inter-domain scenarios in real wind parks based on SDN and NFV. The choice of the domain reflects the  emergence of wind energy as a mainstream form of sustainable energy generation. VirtuWind adopts a  security-by-design approach for the SDN and NFV ecosystem. This appears to be necessary as introducing  77  http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/information-and-communication- technologies  78  http://virtuwind.eu/  http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/information-and-communication-technologies http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/information-and-communication-technologies http://virtuwind.eu/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  53  revolutionary concepts like SDN and NFV for critical infrastructures requires a careful investigation of new  security risks, which have not been relevant in legacy systems. In this context, VirtuWind has the objective  of: (i) establishing a comprehensive threat and risk framework for industry-level SDN networks, (ii) defining  security mechanisms for north-/southbound and inter-controller interfaces, securing the controller (e.g.,  prevent DoS), (iii) developing mechanisms for network monitoring and intrusion detection for SDN  networks, (iv) developing Signed Virtual Network Functions, (v) developing accountability mechanisms for  SDN networks, and (vi) developing inter-domain incident detection mechanisms.  SUPERFLUIDITY79 is working on security verification of virtualized network functions, using symbolic  execution techniques. This is a technique (from SW compilers) which permits to automatically and  systematically explore paths, so as to verify what the security and policy implications are when running  certain (composition of) functionalities. In the past such techniques have been successfully applied to  specific middlebox functions80 (for instance, middleboxes that rely on the composition of standard Click  elements). The work in progress in SuperFluidity focuses on generalizing and extending these techniques  to a wider heterogeneous set of VNF (which in turns means a dedicated work devised to characterize the  I/O relation of such VNFs); cloud enabled VNFs; and support for heterogeneous/multi-operated settings.  CHARISMA81 As indicated in the project’s website77, CHARISMA proposes “an intelligent hierarchical  routing and paravirtualised architecture that unites two important concepts: devolved offload with  shortest path nearest to end-users and an end-to-end security service chain via virtualized open access  physical layer security (PLS).” The use of a cloud infrastructure in CHARISMA is aimed at achieving low- latency (“<1ms” according to the project consortium) and the security required for future 5G networking in  which wireless/wired communications converge. The project aims to deliver enhanced performance  targeting a “1000-fold increased in mobile data volume, 10-100 times higher data rates, 10-100 times  more connected devices” and 5-fold reduction of latency.  5G NORMA82 is aimed at developing a novel, adaptive mobile network architecture, capable of  accommodating 5G. The focus of this architecture will be to support network customisability whilst  ensuring high performance and security, and meeting specific cost and energy requirements. 5G NORMA is  also aimed at offering openness based on appropriate APIs.  5G ENSURE83  focuses on the development of a security architecture for 5G that would be acceptable to  and shareable by different 5G stakeholders. To realise this vision, 5G ENSURE has the goal of developing  security enablers for 5G and making them available in a shared testbed. The project aims to develop these  enablers driven by security use cases and scenarios in the areas of cybersecurity and aerospace.  CogNet84 aims to develop support for intelligent 5G Network Management whilst increasing dramatically  the extent of connected devices (the aim is to achieve connectivity of trillions of devices). This requires the  creation of highly optimised networks, are capable of making maximum use of available radio spectrum  and bandwidth. The same need arises due to the need to meet other QoS properties for such networks. To  achieve these requirements CogNet also aims to develop self-managed networks, based on machine  learning techniques that can address relevant organisation, configuration, security, and optimization  79  http://superfluidity.eu/  80  http://nets.cs.pub.ro/~costin/files/symnet.pdf  81  https://5g-ppp.eu/charisma/  82  https://5gnorma.5g-ppp.eu/  83  http://www.5gensure.eu/  84  http://www.cognet.5g-ppp.eu/  http://superfluidity.eu/ http://nets.cs.pub.ro/~costin/files/symnet.pdf https://5g-ppp.eu/charisma/ https://5gnorma.5g-ppp.eu/ http://www.5gensure.eu/ http://www.cognet.5g-ppp.eu/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  54  issues. Additional elements of CogNet’s vision are the use virtualisation (as a means for meet changing  resource demands) and energy efficiency.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  55  7.2.2 Other related EU funded projects  BEBA85 project aims to entail platform-agnostic programming of stateful flow/traffic processing logic  directly within network nodes, thus rescinding the today’s necessary reliance on external (slowpath)  controllers. Moreover, BEBA will provide the programmers with the ability to control, via the above  stateful behavioural descriptions, an extended set of actions and primitives specifically devised for the  monitoring and network security domain, so as to permit platform-agnostic programming of middle box- type network functions. In terms of security, BEBA project aims to mitigate DoS/latency attacks to the  control-data plane communication channel (concretely, the communication channel between centralized  controller and remote SDN devices).  NetIDE86 aims at delivering an integrated development environment that aims to support the whole  software development lifecycle of SDN applications in a vendor- and controller-independent fashion. The  NetIDE framework should represent a single point of entry to SDN software development and offer a  unified development environment following the ‘write once, execute anywhere’ paradigm. The project has  already delivered a first open source release of the framework which includes: (i) the NetIDE Development  Environment, an Eclipse-based integrated environment for developers; (ii) the NetIDE Network Engine, a  controller-agnostic environment where SDN applications for different controllers can be deployed on top  of the same infrastructure; (iii) a set of NetIDE Tools enabling developers to systematically test, profile, and  tune their network applications (logger, debugger, a wireshark dissector and many others). These tools are  designed to offer considerable benefits when troubleshooting in a productive environment after  application deployment.  FP7 UNIFY87 project considers that every Service Graph (SG) or Network Function - Function Graph (NF-FG)  deployment started by a Resource Orchestrator needs to be enforced in relation to a policy. This approach  assures not only that services are deployed only by principals according to a policy, but also that resources  (computing and network) are consumed in a policy compliant way. This eliminates resource starvation  attacks.  FLAMINGO88 is a European (ICT-FP7) Network of Excellence (NoE) investigating Network and Service  Management. As a NoE, FLAMINGO is based on a joint program of integrated research activities, whose  objective has been to investigate and address three challenges deemed important for the Future Internet  (FI). FLAMINGO identified these challenges as: (a) the development of scalable monitoring systems that  can effectively support the sharing of monitoring data the “knowledge plane” and decision algorithms of  the Future Internet; (b) the development of automated and self-management frameworks for managing  networks and their interconnected objects in a fully distributed and autonomic manner, and (c) the  investigation of “economic, legal, and regulative constraints” that arise in border management systems  and can affect FI.  In Table 5 below we give a summary of measures related to the  SDN threat landscape that the 5G PPP  H2020 and the other EU funded projects reviewed above have aimed to develop.  85  http://www.beba-project.eu/  86  http://www.netide.eu/  87  https://www.fp7-unify.eu/  88  http://www.fp7-flamingo.eu/  http://www.beba-project.eu/ http://www.netide.eu/ https://www.fp7-unify.eu/ http://www.fp7-flamingo.eu/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  56  Measures to be developed by Research and innovation  Projects  Related 5G-PPP Projects  Other EU funded  projects  V ir  tu W  in d  SU P  ER FL  U ID  IT Y  C H  A R  IS M  A  5 G  N o  rm a  5 G  E N  SU R  E  C o  gN et  B EB  A  N et  ID E  FP 7  U N  IF Y  FL A  M IN  G O  Threat analysis/assessment to be conducted x  Cryptographic and/or key management mechanisms x  Authentication/Access control mechanisms x  x  Data encryption mechanisms x  x  Secure communication mechanisms including VPN x  x  NBI security mechanisms x  EWBI security mechanisms x  SBI security mechanisms x  Hardware security mechanisms (controller/data  elements/mobile device)  x  Mobile device security mechanisms  Mechanisms for the protection of Virtual Network  Functions  x  x  Non-repudiation/audit/traceback mechanisms  x  Intrusion detection mechanisms x  x  Incident detection and response mechanisms x  Multi-operator cooperation mechanisms x  Wireless/Mobile Security (wireless medium)  mechanisms  x  Legal and business measures  Standardization measures x  Policy measures x  x x  Other (please specify, add additional rows in the table  if necessary)  Table 5 - Involvement of 5G-PPP HORIZON 2020 and other EU founded projects to the SDN threat landscape  Gap Analysis  Based on the SDN threat mitigation practices that have been developed in existing research or constitute  the target of on-going research projects, we have identified gaps that appear to require further research and  development effort in order to address 5G/SDN threats.  The outcome of this gap analysis is presented in  Table 6. The table provides also a summary of good practices and the assets covered by them and clusters  good practices, assets and gaps under the different types of threats that were introduced in Sect. 5.6.

SDN/5G Good practices and gaps  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  61  A more detailed account of the issues and stakeholders referenced in the gaps identified in Table 6 is  provided below:   System configuration: System configuration refers to the proper installation and configuration of  systems/devices and applications within the SDN infrastructure. In order to achieve desired levels  of variables such as performance, stability, proper function and security, industry as well as  community emerging guidelines must be utilized.   Security Policy: The definition, management, monitoring and enforcement of adequate security  policies is of paramount importance when it comes to operation and management of SDNs. Such  policies are needed to address important SDN operation and management activities including, for  example, authentication between SDN components or establishing the means for proper  authentication between humans and devices. Without carefully defined and orchestrated security  rules and procedures, it is impossible to imagine a functional and reliable SDN infrastructure. A key  related issue is also the provision of automated support for the short and long term evolution of  security policies.   Network configuration: In contrast to System configuration which refers to the setup of the SDN  components, Network configuration refers to the SDN specific configuration that is applied to each  of these components. Whether setting up or maintaining an SDN infrastructure, proper  configuration and ongoing tuning is of outmost importance in order to achieve proper function,  stability and performance. The SDN components affected are the SDN controllers and the SDN  network elements (switches and routers).   Credentials: While Security Policy is the most important aspect when it comes to laying the ground  rules for a secure SDN infrastructure, the importance of proper and protected Credentials is a must.  Credentials in the form of a password or a certificate are the gateway that can lead to accessing an  important system or network asset and in this case a functional component in the SDN  infrastructure. When applied properly and used carefully there can be no harm to the protected  assets. However, weak as well as improperly or poorly formed Credentials can lead to exploitation  and ultimately to a global infrastructure meltdown. The human factor is largely responsible as  Credentials can be leaked due to sharing with unauthorized individuals or theft as a result of  improper placement.   Comprehensive verification of absence software/firmware exploits: Verifying the absence of  potential exploits in software/firmware (e.g., buffer/stack/heap overflows) is an important  requirement for providing security assurance for SDN software/firmware89. So far, numerous  techniques have been used for this purpose, including static verification techniques that operate on  software specifications (typically including model checking, invariant checking and theorem  proving), static analysis of various forms of software/firmware code and testing. Static verification  techniques can check certain properties (e.g., satisfaction of access control policies, properties of  virtual and physical topologies such as desired traffic isolation) but not all. More specifically, certain  types of exploits, such as range errors and string vulnerabilities, cannot be easily expressed as  properties amenable to static verification techniques. Furthermore, such techniques are often  89 ITU-T, Requirements for Applying Formal Methods to Software Defined Networking,  Recommendation ITU-T  Y.3320, 08/2014, available from:  https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwjDqoSqjLjJAhXDMhoKHSJaA FIQFghCMAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itu.int%2Frec%2Fdologin_pub.asp%3Flang%3De%26id%3DT-REC-Y.3320- 201408-I!!PDF-E%26type%3Ditems&usg=AFQjCNFHJcb_4iCoKn1UDkyaleOn25ZPSw  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  62  incapable of verifying systems of non-trivial complexity due to scalability problems, and – even in  cases where they are successfully applied – they offer no guarantee that the implementation of the  specification analysed by them will preserve this specification and therefore that the desired  property. Static analysis techniques have been effective in detecting certain types of exploits (e.g.,  various types of overflows) but not all of them (e.g., string vulnerabilities and range errors).  Furthermore, they are implementation language specific (e.g., C and/or Java specific) and not all of  them scale up well to programs of significant size. Finally, testing cannot offer any guarantee of  completeness.   Operators: In addition to the Administrators, whose function is described above, the Operators’  function is as important as the deal with the day to day activities of maintaining the SDN ecosystem.  While Administrators will have to deal with low level support and configuration functions (such as  upgrades and enhancements), the Operators will have to perform day to day activities such as  monitoring, high level management and light configuration tasks. Because, similarly to the  Administrators, the Operators also require security clearance, caution should be used when utilizing  SDN Credentials.   Administrators: At the centre of a physical or virtual IT infrastructure are the Administrator teams  responsible for the setup, configuration and ongoing maintenance. Similarly to a conventional  infrastructure, the Administrators carry the responsibility of establishing an SDN infrastructure that  functions as per initial specifications. In addition, performance and security are two important  factors that must be addressed from the beginning. Administrators require full security clearance in  order to perform low level SDN support and therefore caution should be used when accessing the  SDN components.   Developers: SDN depends on Software in order to deliver all the benefits and advantages over a  conventional Network infrastructure. It relies on a collection of software pieces that talk to each  other through carefully planned interfaces and APIs. The developers responsible for writing these  pieces of software carry the responsibility of delivering as per spec, functional, efficient and secure  code that will ensure proper function of the SDN device without jeopardizing the SDN ecosystem.  This becomes particularly important when upgrading SDN components of on already existing  infrastructure.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  63  8. Recommendations  Technical recommendations  Recommendation 1 (for Network providers): Mandate encryption and authentication in NBI, SBI and  EWBI. In SDN deployments, Application Programming Interfaces (API) for the communication between  controllers and switching elements (Southbound Interface - SBI) and between controllers and network  applications (Northbound Interface – NBI) are utilized. In addition, although SDN uses centralized control of  the network (controller) this is a logical architecture that can be distributed into several systems (multiple  controller architecture). Communication between SDN controllers is achieved through the East/Westbound  Interface (EWBI). Utilizing encryption and advanced authentication in these interfaces is not mandatory for  standard implementations. However, network providers should consider deploying encryption and  authentication techniques (e.g. TLS) to all SDN APIs.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  System  Configuration, Security policy, Administrators   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking:  Security policy, Credentials, Administration  Recommendation 2 (for Network providers): Identify and monitor exposed functionalities of SDN  controllers. SDN controllers provide northbound APIs (NBIs) that enable network applications to be  deployed on top of a unified abstract network layer. These APIs expose the SDN network state to applications  and enable applications to dynamically and automatically program the network. Malicious applications can  gain access of the network resources by exploiting NBI capabilities. Network providers should be aware of  the exposed functionalities of the installed controllers in their deployments. In addition, vulnerable  functionalities need to be exposed by sophisticated ways of monitoring the usage of the NBI.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  Developers, Administrators, System configuration   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking:  Developers, Administrators  Recommendation 3 (for Network and Service providers): Control and monitor running application  resources. The SDN paradigm allows the differentiation of network policies for individual SDN applications.  This is important in order to achieve meaningful multi-tenancy in the SDN ecosystem, especially for network  providers and even more importantly for service providers. Moreover, SDN introduces a new business model  associated to the network and service provisioning (e.g. security as a service). Controlling and monitoring  the network resources allocation is a practice that can harden SDN deployments against several threats.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  Developers, Administrators   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking:  Developers, Administrators  Recommendation 4 (for Network, Service providers and End users): Holistic Support for Security policies.  In the complex SDN ecosystem it is important for service providers to operate based on comprehensive  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  64  security policies. Although the sophistication and scope of such policies may vary depending on the size and  nature of the organization in question, the underlying need for operating on the basis of security policy in  all levels of the SDN reference architecture is irrefutable. Having a well-written policy that covers all  important areas (e.g. system access, user credentials use and good practises), not only supresses a number  of risks but also helps recover from most situations in minimal time. To be effective in terms of security,  policies need to have holistic support, i.e., support for their specified, verification, monitoring and  enforcement to the maximum possible extend.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse:  Developers, Administrators, Operators, Security Policy   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking: Developers, Administrators, Operators, Security Policy  Recommendation 5 (for Administrators): Access control, Credentials, System updates: The SDN ecosystem  consists of several components (e.g. controllers, servers, switching elements). These components may be  either virtualized or physical systems and need to communicate with each other. Restrictions of access based  on access control lists could harden overall system security. In addition, SDN system and network  administrators should enforce a minimum level of security in the system security policies.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Security Policy, Administrators   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking: Operators, Credentials  Recommendation 6 (for Developers): Sandboxing, Application Isolation. Logically centralized control of the  SDN makes it possible for developers to develop custom network applications that perform complex tasks.  SDN offers a high level of abstraction to the programmers. When applications are developed caution is  required to protect the network operation against application misbehaviour and bugs. To do so techniques  such as Sandboxing, application-Kernel isolation and application permission policy enforcement should be  utilized.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Developers, Administrators, System configuration   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: Operators  Organisational recommendations  Recommendation 7 (for Service providers): Develop incident response capabilities and information  sharing practices among telecom operators. It is advisable that Telecom Operators develop incident  response capabilities by creating (and in case of existing,  enhancing) in-house Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) or Computer Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT), that will be  technologically aware of evolving networking technologies, with a particular focus on SDN and NFV. It would  be advisable that an assembly or an informal association of Telecom Operator CERTs/CSIRTs is established,  as they could function as an information sharing catalyst for Telecom Operators. ENISA could play an  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  65  instrumental role in this direction90. Cooperation with other incident response bodies such as Terena’s Task  Force CSIRT (TF-CSIRT)91 and the European Government CERT Group92 as well as participation in international  communities such as the global Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams-FIRST93 would be highly  advisable for every Telecom Operator.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Security Policy   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: Security Policy  Recommendation 8 (for Administrators): Keep systems up to date. As SDN moves many of the networking  functionalities in a software environment it is of paramount importance that used systems (Servers, Virtual  servers, Network operating systems, Authentication and encryption mechanism etc.) are continuously  updated with the latest releases (e.g. Security patches). To do so system and network administrators should  schedule periodic system maintenances. During maintenance service availability should not be decreased so  redundancy in the network architecture should be taken into account.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: System configuration, Network configuration   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: System configuration, Network configuration  Recommendation 9 (for Network and Service providers): Use adequate security methods. Network and  service providers should maintain a high level of security in their systems. Specialized software and hardware  solutions are available and should be taken into account. In addition SDN provides the capability of security  as a service, allowing network and service providers to outsource security to specialized third party vendors.  This recommendation addresses the following gaps:   Nefarious Activity/Abuse: Administrators, Security Policy   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking: Operators, Security Policy  90 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support  91 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  92 http://www.egc-group.org/  93 http://www.first.org/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  December 2015  66  9. Conclusions  SDN/5G brings a brand new level of innovation to arena of networking.  Key attributes such as Logically  Centralized Intelligence, Programmability and Network Abstraction pave the way to the communications of  tomorrow. While significant improvements may be achieved in network security by centralization and  programmability, these two great attributes will undoubtedly attract a new level of treats and attacks.  Security within the SDN paradigm will arguably be a challenge, as all layers, sub-layers and components will  need to communicate according to strict security policies. In this report, we have attempted to create  awareness by identifying key valuable assets of the SDN infrastructure that are needed in order to ensure  proper network function and interoperability. As these assets may, however, become the target of attacks,  they can also become the main driver of a threat analysis targeted at securing SDNs.

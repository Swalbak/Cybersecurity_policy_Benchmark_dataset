ENISA and CERT-EU remain confident that, by applying this set of recommendations in a  consistent, systematic manner, organisations in the EU will be able to substantially improve  their cybersecurity posture and enhance their overall attack resilience.  Best practices  The following best practices may complement but do not replace guidance issued by your  national or governmental cybersecurity authority. They are provided in no particular order.  Organisations should prioritise their actions according to their specific business needs.  1. Ensure remotely accessible services require multi-factor authentication (MFA).  These include, but are not limited to, VPN services, external facing corporate portals  (extranets) and email access (e.g. OWA or Exchange Online). If possible, avoid using  SMS and voice calls to provide one-time codes and consider deploying phishing  resistant tokens such as smart cards and FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online) security keys.  2. Ensure users do not re-use passwords, encourage users to use Multiple Factor  Authentication (MFA) whenever supported by an application (on social media for  instance)  Joint Publication  Structured Cooperation between CERT-EU and ENISA  TLP:WHITE | 14/02/2022 | JP-22-01  Page 2 of 5  Threat actors often compromise organisations by performing credential stuffing  attacks. These attacks use credentials obtained from previous data breaches, such as  leaked user names and passwords, against another unrelated service. These attacks  are made possible because users tend to re-use the same username/password  combination. Users are therefore encouraged to never reuse a password. In addition,  users are advised to use trusted leak checkers to see if their personal email addresses  are present in any known data breach and to change immediately any compromised  password on the relevant websites and/or applications. The use of a corporate  password manager should be encouraged whenever possible.  3. Ensure all software is up-to-date  Updates addressing known vulnerabilities should be prioritised. Reengineering  vulnerability management processes is also needed and recommended in order to  deploy high and critical severity patches as quickly as possible.  Ensure all actions related to patching of endpoints and servers have been completed  (e.g. system reboots).  Remember to strongly encourage your users to patch their personal systems at home  and as regularly as possible (e.g. computers, smartphones, tablets, connected devices  like TV sets, videogame consoles, home routers, etc.).  4. Tightly control third party access to your internal networks and systems.  This will improve your ability to prevent and detect potential attacks should a third  party be compromised and used as a beachhead to breach your organisation.  5. Pay special attention to hardening your cloud environments before moving critical  loads to the Cloud.  Use the strong security controls available on cloud platforms and separate cloud  system management from on-premise system management to ensure threat actors  Joint Publication  Structured Cooperation between CERT-EU and ENISA  TLP:WHITE | 14/02/2022 | JP-22-01  Page 3 of 5  cannot jump from one environment to the other because of discrepancies in security  controls.  6. Review your data backup strategy and use the so-called 3-2-1 rule approach  Addressed to organisations, the rule consists in keeping three complete copies of  their data, with two of them locally stored but on different types of media, and at least  one copy stored off-site. Your organisation’s backup strategy should be fully aligned  with your business needs by setting explicit recovery time (RTOs) and recovery point  objectives (RPOs).  Ensure access to backups is controlled, limited and logged.  Confirm your restore procedures are well documented and tested regularly.  Given the proliferation of ransomware attacks, it is strongly recommended to increase  the frequency of backups for critical data. The latest storage technologies facilitate  rapid backups of almost any data set in a matter of minutes.  Users should be trained to save data only on storage devices allowed by your  cybersecurity policy or, if applicable, on the corporate cloud storage and not on their  workstations. In addition, you should ensure that your backup software itself is up to  date.  7. Change all default credentials and disable protocols that do not support multi-factor  authentication or use weak authentication (e.g. cleartext passwords, or outdated and  vulnerable authentication or encryption protocols).  8. Employ appropriate network segmentation and restrictions to limit access and utilise  additional attributes (such as device information, environment and access paths) when  making access decisions.  9. Conduct regular training to ensure that IT and system administrators have a solid  understanding of your organisation’s security policy and associated procedures.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/securesme/cyber-tips/strengthen-technical-measures/secure-backups  Joint Publication  Structured Cooperation between CERT-EU and ENISA  TLP:WHITE | 14/02/2022 | JP-22-01  Page 4 of 5  Vigilantly monitoring the misuse of sysadmin tools can help you prevent attackers from  breaching your network and moving laterally.  10. Create a resilient email security environment by enabling antispam filtering, adding a  secure email gateway configured to automatically follow field-tested policies and  playbooks designed to prevent malicious emails from reaching mailboxes.  11. Organise regular cyber awareness events to train your users on common phishing  techniques (e.g. identifying spoofed/suspicious messages) and the effects of phishing  attacks.  12. Protect your web assets from denial-of-service attacks.  Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) will expand your web assets’ footprint across  multiple servers or use the native high-availability features of cloud platforms.  Automate the disaster recovery runbooks for on-premise systems and ensure that you  can move workloads to the disaster recovery site with a single click if possible.  13. Block or severely limit internet access for servers or other devices that are seldom  rebooted, as they are coveted by threat actors for establishing backdoors and creating  persistent beacons to Command and Control (C2) infrastructure.  14. Make sure you have the procedures to reach out and swiftly communicate with your  CSIRT. Contact details can be found on the matching websites available via  https://csirtsnetwork.eu/.

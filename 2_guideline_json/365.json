The creation, verification, validation and preservation of electronic  signatures or electronic seals relies (among others) on standards specifying formats of  electronic signatures and seals to guarantee interoperability and their general usability within  the Member States and across borders.  The scope of this document is to assess the suitability of the recently published European  Norms (hereafter ENs) on advanced signatures formats (based on CMS, XML and PDF, and for  Associated signature and seal containers) to fulfil the eIDAS Regulation requirements, and to  describe the differences with the previous Technical Specifications (hereafter TSs), in view of a  possible update of the list of standards referenced in the Commission Decisions in force. It also  aims at evaluating the consequences of such update and defines the timeline for a possible  transition to the exclusive usage of the new ENs.  The updated set of ENs, published by ETSI in April 2016, has a much higher stability and value  in the standardization document hierarchy than TSs and guarantee that no other national  standard can be developed or adopted overlapping these ones. The validation process included  a public review (in addition to the enquiry stage already part of the ETSI process) and specific  tests that led to the improvement of interoperability (also improving the text where it was not  interpreted unambiguously by implementors), elimination of technical flaws and provision of  new features proposed during the drafting and the approval process of the ENs. The extensive  experience of ETSI TC ESI in developing standards for electronic signatures is also a  guarantee for the quality of the standards and for their sustainability and maintenance.  In order to reduce the impact of updating the references,  the European Commission should  consider defining, with the Member States, an appropriate update path. The process could be  stimulated with specific funding measures, such as CEF3, during the adoption of the CEF  eSignature building block. This should be possible until the end of 2020 when the CEF initiative  is expected to terminate.  The update path should be adopted in a way should avoid any discontinuity and minimize the  impact on provision of services by allowing enough time to implement the changes but also  foreseeing a period of time of parallel use of the new ENs with the previous TSs.  It should be noted that ETSI will not deprecate the previous TSs unless serious flaws are  identified. This is not likely to happen given that these standards where tested during a long  time and are currently widely adopted.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910  2 See Annex A.  3 Connecting Europe Facility, https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  5  1. INTRODUCTION  The Regulation (EU) No 910/20144 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation5) provides the regulatory  framework in the EU for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market.  The creation, verification, validation and preservation of electronic  signatures or electronic seals relies (among others) on standards specifying formats of  electronic signatures and seals to guarantee interoperability and their general usability within  the Member States and across borders.  The eIDAS Regulation in recital 64 says: “When addressing formats of advanced electronic  signatures and seals, the Commission should build on existing practices, standards and  legislation […]” and sets the ground for Article 27 “Electronic signatures in public services”  where the paragraph 5 reads: “By 18 September 2015, and taking into account existing  practices, standards and Union legal acts, the Commission shall, by means of implementing  acts, define reference formats of advanced electronic signatures […]”. Mutatis mutandis Article  37 “Electronic seals in public services” and its paragraph 5 requires the same for electronic  seals. On this basis the Commission has published the Commission Implementing Decision  (EU) 2015/15066 laying down specifications relating to the format of advanced electronic  signatures and seals, defining the minimum requirements in terms of advanced electronic  signatures and seals format recognition for the public sector.  The above mentioned Decision specifies in its Article 1 that the Member States shall recognize  XML, CMS or PDF advanced electronic signatures based on the formats respectively named  XAdES7, CAdES8 or PAdES9, or associated signature containers based on ASiC10 if they  comply with the ETSI technical specifications (TSs) listed in the Decision Annex. The article 3  requires the same formats for electronic seals. It should be noted that the standards referenced  are the same as in the Commission Decision 2011/130/EU11, “establishing minimum  requirements for the cross-border processing of documents signed electronically by competent  authorities under Directive 2006/123/EC” (“on services in the internal market” or “Services  Directive”12).  Some years after the publication of the technical specifications referenced in the mentioned  Decisions, ETSI has published a set of European standards (ENs) taking into account the  eIDAS Regulation requirements and addressing a number of issues that have been identified,  based on the feedback received from the stakeholders, for example during  CAdES/XAdES/PAdES/ASiC ETSI Plugtests™ events. These ENs are not listed in the  mentioned Decisions, thus a consideration should be given for their update.  The scope of this document is to assess the suitability of the recently published ENs to fulfil the  eIDAS Regulation requirements, and to describe the differences with the previous TSs, in view  4 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910  5 See Annex A.  6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015D1506  7 XML Advanced Electronic Signature  8 CMS Advanced Electronic Signature  9 PDF Advanced Electronic Signature  10 Associated Signature Container  11 This document refers to Decision 2011/130/EU (available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011D0130) as amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2014/148/EU  (available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014D0148).

It also aims at  evaluating the consequences of such update and defines the timeline for a possible transition to  the exclusive usage of the new ENs.  The standards affected are those mentioned in the Annex of the Commission Decision  2011/130/EU and Commission Implementing Decision 2015/1506/EU:   For XML advanced electronic signatures and seals the specification currently  referenced is the XAdES baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 171, which is now  specified as “XAdES baseline signatures” in clause 6 of ETSI EN 319 132-1.   For CMS advanced electronic signatures and seals the specification currently  referenced is the CAdES baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 173, which is now  specified as “CAdES baseline signatures” in clause 6 of ETSI EN 319 122-1.   For PDF advanced electronic signatures and seals the specification currently  referenced is the PAdES baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 172, which is now  specified as “PAdES baseline signatures” in clause 6 of ETSI EN 319 142-1.   For associated signature and seal container the specification currently referenced is  the ASiC baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 174, which is now specified as  “ASiC baseline containers” in clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 162-1.  In this document (as well as in TR 119 112, see 3.1) the set of “old” technical specifications (i.e.  ETSI TS 103 171/2/3/4) is collectively referenced as “previous TSs” while the “new” European  Norms (i.e. ETSI EN 319 122/132/142/162) are collectively referenced as “AdES/ASiC ENs”.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  7  2. OVERVIEW OF THE ADVANCED  ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AND SEAL  FORMAT STANDARDS  This chapter gives an overview of electronic signature standards and some background  information on what underpinned their development.  The Directive 1999/93/EC13, known as the “Electronic Signatures Directive”, was in force before  the eIDAS Regulation. The European legislative framework presented a continuous challenge  for European standards bodies to address the needs of both, the public and private sectors,  while keeping as much as possible the interoperability with global standards, when they exist.  Since the introduction of the Electronic Signatures Directive, the standards on digital signatures  and related trust services, i.e. the main technologies supporting electronic signatures and seals,  are developed by the ETSI Technical Committee “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures”14  (ETSI TC ESI hereafter). In parallel, CEN developed standard protection profiles supporting  certification of related products, such as qualified signature and seal creation devices, not in  scope of this document.  2.1 FIRST SET OF TSS SPECIFYING ADVANCED ELECTRONIC  SIGNATURES FORMAT  The ETSI ESI TC started the development of the signature format TSs when the Electronic  Signatures Directive entered into force, based on the use of public key infrastructure (PKI)  technology to produce digital signatures:   ETSI TS 101 73315 “CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)” that  specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on the IETF RFC  565216 “Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)”;   ETSI TS 101 90317 “XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)” that  specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on the W3C  Recommendation \"XML Signature Syntax and Processing”18 (XMLDSig);   ETSI TS 102 778 “PDF Advanced Electronic Signature Profiles” (PAdES) a  multipart standard (more specifically ETSI TS 102 778-319 and ETSI TS 102 778- 420 are the basis for the PAdES Baseline Profile, see 2.2) that specifies formats  for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on ISO-32000-1 \"Document  management - Portable document format\"21 (PDF);   ETSI TS 102 91822“Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)” that specifies the  use of container structures to bind together one or more signed objects with  13 Available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31999L0093  14 For more information see https://www.etsi.org/committee/esi  15 All the references to ETSI TS 101 733 in this document refer to version 2.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101700_101799/101733/02.02.01_60/  16 Available at: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652  17 All references to ETSI TS 101 903 in this document refer to version1.4.2 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101900_101999/101903/01.04.02_60/  18 Available at: https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-xmldsig-core1-20130411/  19 All references to ETSI TS 102 778-3 in this document refer to version 1.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/10277803/01.02.01_60/  20 All references to ETSI TS 102 778-4 in this document refer to version 1.1.2 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/10277804/01.01.02_60/  21 Available at: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf  22 Available at: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102900_102999/102918/01.03.01_60/  http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  8  either advanced electronic signatures or time-stamp tokens into one single digital  container using package formats based on ZIP.  The first CAdES standard was published in 2000, the first XAdES in 2002, the first PAdES in  2009 and the first ASiC in 2011.  CMS, XMLDSig and PDF digital signatures are the formats for digital signatures most  commonly used globally, but it was necessary to specify additional attributes to support the  requirements of advanced electronic signatures as defined in the Electronic Signatures  Directive, in force at that time.  The main gap identified in global standards was the lack of a consistent support for validation of  the electronic signatures over long term, to protect them against key compromised or weakened  algorithms. The signature validity evidence in case of disputes between signers and verifiers  may occur many years after the signature creation. These issues were addressed in the global  standards while keeping the basic compliance with them, i.e. using extension mechanisms that  did not break the syntactical rules of the formats defined in the global standards. A number of  successive versions were published as part of regular maintenance of the standards, to fix  identified issues, support the business needs that were progressively emerging and to keep the  suitability of the standards to support the evolving legal framework.  This led to the standards containing various options addressing long term protection but lacking  a fully coherent approach to the different signature formats. This requirement emerged with the  need to support the operation of Points of single contact, introduced with the Services  Directive23, and was addressed in the publication of the set of electronic signature profiles, as  described in the next paragraph.  2.2 PUBLICATION OF A SET OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE BASELINE  PROFILES (“PREVIOUS TSS”)  The Services Directive required for the first time the cross border interoperability of advanced  electronic signature formats to allow competent authorities24 in each Member State to process  electronic signatures created by competent authorities in another Member State. It was noted  that they “may face technical difficulties due to the variety of signature formats used”, as  recognized in recital 3 of Commission Decision 2011/130/EU25.  This led to the need to rationalize the different forms of signatures defined for each signature  format (similar but not really equivalent) and develop and group a minimal number of sets of  common properties to support the same features for long time validation, independently from  the specific signature format.  In a similar way – when compared to the Services Directive – the eIDAS Regulation introduced  in the article 27 “Electronic signatures in public services” (and article 37 for electronic seals) an  obligation for the Member States, when they require advanced electronic signatures or seals, to  support the standards referenced by the Decision 2015/1506 in their public services.  In addition, the eIDAS Regulation has introduced the electronic seals (i.e. signature by a legal  persons), and, in article 37, the same obligations for member States as in the article 27 for  advanced electronic signatures. The digital signature technology can support both electronic  signatures and seals, and the standards developed for the advanced electronic signature  23 Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal  market, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32006L0123  24 As defined in the Services Directive, i.e. any body or authority which has a supervisory or regulatory role in a Member  State in relation to service activities  25 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0130  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32006L0123 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0130  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  9  formats work perfectly also for electronic seals. Only the certificates supporting signatures and  seals have different content, to reflect the different nature of the subject to which the certificate  is issued. In fact, the current version of the Decision 2015/1506 reference the same signature  format standards specified in Decision 2011/130/EU.  In order to tackle the requirements of the Services Directive, ETSI has developed and  published, in the scope the European Commission Mandate M/46026, a set of Technical  Specifications specifying Baseline Profiles for all the Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES,  XAdES, PAdES) and for Associated Signature Containers (ASiC). These, correspond to the  minimum requirements specified in Decision 2011/130/EU, and provide the same basic features  with a minimal number of options. The same set of specification were found applicable by the  Commission for the eIDAS Regulation and, specifically, for the purposes of the Decision  2015/1506.  Each profile specifies common set of options aiming at maximising interoperability and  supporting not only the requirements of the Services Directive, but also a wide range of  business and governmental use cases for electronic procedures and communications,  applicable to a wide range of communities and across borders.  The Baseline Profile TSs, profiling the formats described in 2.1, are:  1. ETSI TS 103 17127 “XAdES Baseline Profile”,  2. ETSI TS 103 17228 “PAdES Baseline Profile”,  3. ETSI TS 103 17329 “CAdES Baseline Profile”,  4. ETSI TS 103 17430 “ASiC Baseline Profile”.  Each profile defines four different conformance levels addressing incremental requirements to  maintain the validity of the signatures over the long term:  1. B-Level, for basic conformance, profiling a number of basic properties incorporated when  the signature is generated;  2. T-Level, for Trusted time for signature existence conformance, profiling the generation, for  an existing signature, of a trusted token allowing to prove that the signature itself actually  existed at a certain date and time;  3. LT-Level, for Long Term conformance, profiling the incorporation of all the material required  for validating the signature, to tackle the long term availability of such validation material;  4. LTA-Level, for Long Term with Archive time-stamps conformance, profiling the  incorporation of time-stamp tokens that allow validation of the signature long time after its  generation, to tackle the long term availability and integrity of the validation material.  All the requirements addressed at a certain level are always addressed also by the levels  above. Each level requires the presence of certain properties, specified in each profile TS to  reduce as much as possible the optionality. All the properties used in a signature profile for a  given signature format are specified in the TS listed in 2.1 that specifies that format.  The specific level to be used depends on the period of time after signature creation for which  technical validity of signature has to be preserved, taking into account certificate expiration,  revocation and/or algorithm obsolescence. Each signature conformance level should be  26 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/mandates/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.detail&id=442  27 All references to ETSI TS 103 171 in this document refer to version 2.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103171/02.01.01_60/  28 All references to ETSI TS 103 172 in this document refer to version 2.2.2 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103172/02.02.02_60/  29 All references to ETSI TS 103 173 in this document refer to version 2.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103173/02.02.01_60  30 All references to ETSI TS 103 174 in this document refer to version 2.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103174/02.02.01_60  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/mandates/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.detail&id=442  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  10  increased as needed to guarantee that the relying parties can always trust the signature. This  process in called “signature augmentation”.  2.3 PUBLICATION OF THE ADES/ASIC ENS  The requirements for electronic signatures in the Signatures Directive and in the eIDAS  Regulation are very similar. The difference between advanced electronic signatures and seals  in the Regulation did not put any additional technical requirements on formats31. As part of the  rationalization of the electronic signature standards, requested by the mandate M/460 published  by the European Commission, all the technical specifications were restructured, and a set of  European Standards (ENs) were developed. The aim of this exercise was to replace the  previous Technical Specifications (TSs) limiting as much as possible the foreseen impact on  existing implementations of the adoption of the new standards.  The development of ENs had a number of implications and resulted in:   better guarantee of taking into account the market needs: a TS is approved in ETSI  with a procedure that involves only the relevant Technical Committee, while an EN has  additional steps, including one or more enquiry and weighted votes by the EU National  Standardization Organizations (NSOs), guaranteeing a wider stakeholder involvement  through national mirror committees. The AdES/ASiC ENs had undergone also a public  review, required by the European Commission as part of mandate m/460, where all  the stakeholders had the possibility to comment on the drafts. Reaching approval took  significantly more time, as an EN should be published only when its content is mature  enough, and, because of its nature, it does not require frequent changes;   better support of the Digital Single Market: no national standard can be drafted by an  European NSO if an EN exists or is under development on the same topic (i.e. the  “standstill” applies). When the EN is approved, the existing national standards must be  withdrawn.  AdES/ASiC ENs have been published by ETSI after throughful considerations, which included  involved a far bigger representation of stakeholders than while drafting the previous TSs,  approved at ETSI ESI TC level only. They reached unanimous approval at their final vote. It  should also be noted that ETSI run regular Plugtests™, interoperability events conducted  remotely, in order to prove interoperability of implementations and enhance standards  robustness, either on CAdES/XAdES/PAdES/ASiC and on signature validation. Plugtests™  events use a dedicated portal developed by the ETSI independent testing unit CTI (Centre for  Testing and Interoperability)32.  Each EN in the signature format set of standards is divided into two parts, as follows:   EN 319 122 “CAdES digital signatures”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and CAdES baseline signatures”33  o Part 2: “Extended CAdES signatures”34   EN 319 132 “XAdES digital signatures”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and XAdES baseline signatures” 35  31 See clause A.3 of this document for a short overview on advanced electronic signature and seal requirements  32 See https://portal.etsi.org/Services/CentreforTestingInteroperability.aspx  33 All references to ETSI EN 319 122-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31912201/01.01.01_60/  34 All references to ETSI EN 319 122-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31912202/01.01.01_60/  35 All references to ETSI EN 319 132-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31913201/01.01.01_60/  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  11  o Part 2: “Extended XAdES signatures”36   EN 319 142 “PAdES digital signatures”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and PAdES baseline signatures” 37  o Part 2: “Extended PAdES signatures” 38   EN 319 162 “Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and ASiC baseline containers” 39  o Part 2: “Additional ASiC containers” 40  All the AdES/ASiC ENs clearly delimit their scope to the technological level, i.e. digital  signatures supported by PKI and public key certificates.  This approach allows keeping the legal details apart from the scope of a technical standard, to  target the applicable technical requirements stemming from the eIDAS Regulation for both  advanced electronic signatures and seals. In general, avoiding to have a strict link with  legislation aims to make the standards more easily usable for the international community.  More specifically, the AdES/ASiC ENs aim at supporting electronic signatures, advanced  electronic signatures, qualified electronic signatures, electronic seals, advanced electronic  seals, and qualified electronic seals as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.  This approach is fully in line with the eIDAS Regulation and its technical neutrality: in fact, the  link between the Regulation and specific technologies that fulfil the requirements specified  therein, is established only by the implementing acts.  Each first part the of the AdES/ASiC ENs specifies the “building blocks” for that signature  format, then defines four levels of baseline signatures addressing incremental requirements to  maintain the validity of the signatures over the long term, in a way that a given level always  addresses all the requirements addressed at levels that are below.  Each level requires the presence of certain attributes, defined in the “building blocks” section,  profiled for reducing any optionality as much as possible to maximise interoperability.  Each first part the of the AdES/ASiC ENs is then self-contained, including both –  the basic  information that was available in each format specifications (the ones listed in 2.1), and the  baseline content that was specified in in the previous TSs. For example, in the current version  of the Commission implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506, a reference to ETSI TS 103 173 is  given for the CMS advanced electronic signatures and seals. Then ETSI TS 103 173  references the ETSI TS 101 733 for the format itself, i.e. the parts that in EN 319 122-1 are  specified for CAdES in the building blocks section. This allows an easier implementation, as all  the required information for CAdES can be found in a single document, which helps avoiding  mistakes in using the right version of the format specification.  All the second parts of the standards include the former additional forms present in the  signature format TSs (listed in 2.1). Unless otherwise specified, in this document only the first  Parts for each signature format EN are referenced.  36 All references to ETSI EN 319 132-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31913202/01.01.01_60/  37 All references to ETSI EN 319 142-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31914201/01.01.01_60/  38 All references to ETSI EN 319 142-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31914202/01.01.01_60/  39 All references to ETSI EN 319 162-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31916201/01.01.01_60/  40 All references to ETSI EN 319 162-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31916202/01.01.01_60/  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  12  3. MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN ADES/ASIC ENS AND  PREVIOUS TSS  As explained in Section 2.3, the eIDAS Regulation relies on implementing acts to specify  standards that complies with the requirements specified therein.  The repealed Electronic Signatures Directive did not use this mechanism, therefore the  previous TSs had to reference explicitly the advanced electronic signatures, while the  AdES/ASiC ENs can, more correctly, reference the specific technology (i.e. digital signature) on  which they are based.  Below are listed the most important differences between each signature format standards and  the corresponding previous TSs.  3.1 ETSI TR 119 112  ETSI published a Technical Report (ETSI TR 119 112) on “Most significant differences between  AdES/ASiC ENs and previous TSs” that has been used to compile the paragraphs from 3.2 to  3.5 and covers specifically the technical differences between the formats specified in the  previous TSs and the ones specified in the  AdES/ASiC ENs. This is, in fact, an important  element to consider to assess the impact of introducing the new standards and in defining a  strategy to possibly replace the previous TSs, minimizing the impact on implementations.  Only the relevant parts of ETSI TR 119 112 were considered: as explained in 2.3, only first  parts of each EN specifie the baseline signatures, which corresponds to the “baseline profiles”  described in 2.2 and are referenced in the Decisions published by the Commission. As  explained in the section dedicated to ASiC, in case of associated signatures and seals  containers some of the baseline profiles present in ETSI TS 103 174 are not present in EN 319  162-1 but in EN 319 162-2, for this reason also the latter were taken into account.  3.2 XADES DIGITAL SIGNATURES  This paragraph uses the URI namespaces and the prefixes associated to these XML  namespaces listed in Table 1.  Table 1: Namespaces with constant prefixes  XML Namespace URI Prefix  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig# ds  http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2# xades  http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.4.1# xadesv141  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig%23 http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2%23 http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.4.1%23  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  13  The main differences of ETSI EN 319 132-1 in comparison to ETSI TS 101 903 and ETSI TS  103 171 are:   Specification of the new qualifying properties for them to replace in the future the  qualifying properties that had been specified by ETSI TSs.   Specification of the new qualifying properties, with semantics that none of the  qualifying properties already specified by ETSI TSs did not offer.   Clarification of the semantics of certain qualifying properties already specified within  the different ETSI TSs.   Definition of a new set of signature levels specified in ETSI EN 319 132-1 that comes  from the revision of the baseline signatures defined in ETSI TS 103 171.   Redistribution of material:  o ETSI EN 319 132-1 contains the definition of the semantics and the syntax of  the new set of XAdES qualifying properties, and the specification of the  XAdES baseline signature levels.  o ETSI TS 101 903 contains the definition of the semantics and the syntax of all  the previous set of XAdES qualifying properties.  o ETSI TS 103 171 contains the specification of levels for XAdES baseline  signatures old formats.  The following clauses will provide further details on some of the aforementioned changes.  3.2.1 New qualifying properties substituting previously defined ones  The XML Signature W3C Recommendation, which specifies the semantics and syntax of XML  signatures, on which XAdES signatures are built, deprecated an element which was used in  ETSI TS 101 903 and ETSI TS 103 171, namely the ds:X509IssuerSerial element, due to  reported problems by XML validators when dealing with very high integer values. Indeed, the  problem was not related to the specification of the element, but a problem of implementations of  certain XML validators.  As has been mentioned, a number of qualifying properties specified in ETSI TS 101 903  contained the aforementioned element.  ETSI TC ESI decided not to keep in its new specifications an element that XML Signature W3C  Recommendation had labelled as deprecated. This forced to define new XAdES qualifying  properties for substituting:  1) all the previously defined ones containing the ds:X509IssuerSerial element; and  2) any previously defined qualifying property whose semantics depended on the properties  included in bullet 1).  Table 2 shows the XAdES qualifying properties specified in the ETSI TS 101 903 and the new  ones specified by ETSI EN 319 132-1.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  14  Table 2: ETSI EN 319 132-1 new qualifying XAdES properties replacing ETSI TS 101 903  XAdES qualifying properties due to deprecation of ds:X509IssuerSerial in XML Signature W3C  Recommendation  New XAdES qualifying properties specified  in ETSI EN 319 132-1  XAdES qualifying properties specified  in ETSI TS 101 903 replaced by the former ones  xades:SigningCertificateV2 xades:SigningCertificate  xadesv141:CompleteCertificateRefsV2 xades:CompleteCertificateRefs  xadesv141:AttributeCertificateRefsV2 xades:AttributeCertificateRefs  xadesv141:SigAndRefsTimeStampV2 xades:SigAndRefsTimeStamp  xadesv141:RefsOnlyTimeStampV2 xades:RefsOnlyTimeStamp  xades:SignatureProductionPlaceV2 xades:SignatureProductionPlace  Qualifying properties xades:SigningCertificate, xades:CompleteCertificateRefs,  and xades:AttributeCertificateRefs included ds:X509IssuerSerial as  component.  In these components, the deprecated ds:X509IssuerSerial element was replaced by the  so-called xades:IssuerSerialV2 element, which contains the base-64 encoding of one  DER-encoded instance of type IssuerSerial type defined in IETF RFC 5035. In essence it  contains the same information than the ds:X509IssuerSerial but in its original encoding  within the X509 certificate, which first, keeps the information, and second, avoids any problem  appearing by the conversion of a Distinguished Name into a String.  In addition to this, ETSI EN 319 132-1 clearly specifies that this new element is \"only a hint, that  can help to identify the certificate whose digest matches the value present in the reference. But  the binding information is the digest of the certificate\", which clearly states that applications  cannot rely on this value for matching a reference to the purportedly referenced certificate.  Instead, they are required to use the digest value. This was not stated in ETSI TS 101 903 nor  in ETSI TS 103 171.  Qualifying properties xades:SigAndRefsTimeStamp and xades:RefsOnlyTimeStamp  depended on some of the properties in the list before.  Table 3 shows new XAdES qualifying properties specified in ETSI EN 319 132-1, some of  which replace already existing XAdES qualifying properties specified in ETSI TS 101 903, for  the reasons explained in the table, others just allow to incorporate new features into the XAdES  signatures.

This property forces the computation of the  digest of such objects with a different  algorithm to the one that is suspected to be  broken soon.  3.2.2 Clarification of qualifying properties semantics  The semantics of a number of qualifying properties (listed in Table 4) have been clarified. Most  of these properties either contained validation material (certificates, CRLs, OCSP responses),  or references to this kind of validation material.  In most cases the clarification consisted in describing which specific validation values, or  references to the validation values, may be present in each qualifying property.

This is achieved by computing  digests on octets \"resulting from  concatenating the  Attribute.attrType field and one of  the instances of AttributeValue within  the Attribute.attrValues within the  unsignedAttrs field\". It is worth to  mention that ats-hash-index attribute  is not used in any of the signature profiles  that are mentioned in the Commission  Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506.  SigPolicyQualifierInfo  in signature-policy- identifier  SigPolicyQualifierInfo  in signature-policy- identifier  A third and new qualifier for the signature  policy have been identified so far: an  identifier of the technical specification that  defines the syntax used for producing the  signature policy document (an element of  type SPDocSpecification).  3.3.2 Clarification of attributes semantics  A relevant effort was made by the ETSI TC ESI in clarifying the semantics of a number of  attributes. Most of these properties either contained validation material (certificates, CRLs,  OCSP responses) or references to this kind of validation material.  In most cases the clarification consisted in describing which specific validation values, or  references to which validation values may be present in each attribute.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  18  It is worth mentioning that none of the attributes listed in Table 7 is used in any of the levels that  were mentioned in the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506.

In addition to this ETSI EN 319 122-1 clearly specifies that its IssuerSerial component of  ESS signing-certificate-v2 attribute is \"only a hint, that can help to identify the  certificate whose digest matches the value present in the reference. But the binding information  is the digest of the certificate\", which clearly states that applications cannot rely on this value for  matching a reference to the purportedly referenced certificate; instead, they are required to use  the digest value.

Most of these properties either contained information provided by  the signer to enable a recipient to identify or contact the signer itself, or explained the reasons  for the signing or properties that contain validation material (certificates, CRLs, OCSP  responses).

OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  22  3.5.1 New set of container levels  ETSI EN 319 162-1 defines a set of baseline container levels replacing a subset of container  profiles specified in ETSI TS 103 174 as indicated in Table 14. ETSI TS 103 174 is referenced  by the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506.  It should be noted that ETSI TS 103 174 specifies baseline profiles also for ASiC-S with Time  stamp token, ASiC-E with CAdES and ASiC-E with Time stamp token that have no  correspondence in ETSI EN 319 162-1 but are present as extended containers in ETSI EN 319  162-2.  In case of the containers meant to associate data with time-stamp tokens (ASiC-S with Time  stamp token and ASiC-E with Time stamp token) they cannot be considered as associated  electronic signature or seal containers and therefore they are out of scope of the decisions  2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU. In the case of ASiC-E with CAdES, given the feedback received  during the consultations that was in the direction to simplify and reduce the number of  containers, ETSI ESI TC decided to not include it among the baseline containers.

Evidence records are also supported in ASiC manifest files allowing to specify the data  object(s) to which the evidence records apply.  Evidence records are not used in ASiC baseline containers specified in ETSI EN 319 162-1.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  23  3.5.3 New ASiC Manifest files for long term availability  ASiCArchiveManifest was added to protect long term time stamp tokens and  ASiCEvidenceRecordManifest was added to reference a set of files to which an evidence  record applies, allowing an LTA equivalent level also for ASiC containers with time assertions.  ASiC Manifest files are not used in ASiC baseline containers specified in ETSI EN 319 162-1.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  24  4. CONCLUSIONS  4.1 OPPORTUNITY AND SUITABILITY TO REFERENCE THE ADES/ASIC  ENS  The signature format TSs were introduced when the Electronic Signatures Directive was in  force. Given the similar requirements for the signature formats in the Directive and in the  Regulation, and for both, advanced electronic signatures and seals, the profiles published by  ETSI in 2012 (i.e. the previous TSs) are still usable today.  In April 2016 ETSI has published an updated set of European standards (the AdES/ASiC ENs).  The European Norms have a much higher stability and value in the standardization document  hierarchy and they guarantee that no other national standard can be developed or adopted  overlapping the ones developed by ETSI for electronic signature and seal formats based on  CMS, XML and PDF and for Associated signature and seal containers. As explained in 2.3 the  process included a public review (in addition to the enquiry stage already part of the ETSI  process) and Plugtests™ that led to changes that improved interoperability (also improving the  text where it could not be interpreted unambiguously by implementors), eliminated technical  flaws and provided new features proposed during the drafting and the approval process of the  ENs.  The extensive experience of ETSI TC ESI in developing standards for electronic signatures is  also a guarantee for the quality of the standards, and for their sustainability and maintenance.  It should also be noted that even if the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506  applies only to the public sector, the standards listed become a reference also for the private  sector: this is an additional reason for updating the Decision, otherwise also the private sector  adoption of the standards could be compromised. ETSI TC ESI in fact developed a  comprehensive framework of standards supporting electronic signatures and seals and eIDAS  trust services: it is therefore important that the referenced standards take into account the  evolution of the framework, to maximize the benefits for all the actors involved. Signature format  standards are in fact cross referenced by many other standards.  Moreover, the CEF e-signature building block is based on the AdES/ASiC ENs41 and funded  already a number of projects that implemented it. This means on one hand that a number of  implementations based on the AdES/ASiC ENs already exist and the public and private sector  organizations that participated (or are participating) to CEF projects are ready to use the new  AdES/ASiC ENs. On the other hand there is a risk that the positive effect expected from these  funding measures is reduced, in case the references to the signature format standards are not  updated.  Also the Commission Decision 2011/130/EU should be considered for update. In fact the recital  8 of the eIDAS Regulation says that “Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of  the Council (5) requires Member States to establish ‘points of single contact’ (PSCs) to ensure  that all procedures and formalities relating to access to a service activity and to the exercise  thereof can be easily completed, at a distance and by electronic means, through the  appropriate PSC with the appropriate authorities. Many online services accessible through  PSCs require electronic identification, authentication and signature.” Keeping the Decisions  41 See https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignature+standards for more information  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignature+standards  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  25  2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU not aligned would result in additional complexity,especially for the  public sector.  The Commission Decision 2011/130/EU is also referenced in the article 22(6)(c)(i) of the  Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement42, in case a contracting entity requires advanced  electronic signatures supported by a qualified certificate for the electronic transmission and  receipt of tenders, and for the electronic receipt of requests to participate. Lack of alignment of  the Decisions 2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU can introduce additional costs to both, the private  and he public sectors.  Specific consideration is reserved to the ASiC. As explained in 3.5.1, ETSI EN 319 162-1  clause 5 does not include some of the profiles specified in TS 103 174, referenced by decisions  2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU, namely:   ASiC-S Time stamp token and ASiC-E Time stamp token, as these were not  specifying associated signature or seal but associate containers with time-stamp  tokens;   ASiC-E CAdES, as there was no evidence for its adoption and this was considered to  be in contrast with the principle of maximum reduction of options present in the  mandate.  In case it is agreed to include also these containers in the update of decisions 2015/1506  and/or 2011/130/EU, then specific clauses of ETSI EN 319 162-2 can be introduced according  to the specific need. In order to avoid putting excessive requirements on the public services, it  is however recommended to avoid or to limit referencing the ETSI EN 319 162-2 unless there is  a clear evidence that the containers now moved in this part of the standard have been adopted  by a high number of public services, and to deprecate the creation of ASiC containers compliant  with the profiles listed above.  The European Commission is then advised to revise its Decisions 2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU,  referencing the new ENs and taking into account a transition period to allow to update the  software involved and to migrate the applications, as proposed in the next paragraph.  Reference should be made to ETSI EN 319 122-1 clause 6, ETSI EN 319 132-1 clause 6, ETSI  EN 319 142-1 clause 6 where the baseline signatures are specified and ETSI EN 319 162-1  clause 5 where baseline containers are specified.  4.2 POSSIBLE WAY FORWARD MINIMIZING IMPACT  The previous paragraph is focused on the reasons for updating decisions 2015/1506 and  2011/130/EU. This has of course an impact that needs to be minimized.  The following measures should be considered by the Commission to reduce the impact of  updating the references:   defining, with member States, an appropriate update path. Some advice is given  hereafter;   stimulate the process with specific funding measures, such as CEF, the adoption of  the CEF eSignature building blocks. This should be possible until the end of 2020  when the CEF initiative is expected to terminate;  42 Available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  26   take benefit from the execution of ETSI Plugtests™: the next edition for electronic  signature validation is foreseen in November 2019.  The update path to be adopted should avoid any discontinuity and minimize the impact on  provision of services by allowing enough  time to implement the changes, but also to foresee a  period of time of parallel use of the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards with the previous TSs.  The number of technical differences is quite limited and new attributes are designed in a way  that they can be implemented in parallel with the old ones.  Therefore, a possible way forward could be:   To establish a first deadline to:  o mandate acceptance of the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards, in parallel with  the previous TSs;  o recommend the use the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards to create signatures.   Optionally, to establish a second deadline to deprecate the creation of signatures with  the previous TSs;   To establish a final deadline, after which previous TSs shall not be accepted any more.  This final deadline should be chosen by balancing the time needed to introduce the  new standards when creating signatures and the cost of maintaining implementations  supporting both the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards and the previous TSs.  It should be noted that ETSI will not deprecate the previous TSs, unless serious flaws are  identified. This situation is not likely to happen, given the long time when the standards where  tested and widely adopted.  ETSI could give a “historical” status to the previous TSs after the last deadline is passed, as it  was the case for other standards changed or replaced in frame of the mandate M/460. This  would give a clear message to the market and all the stakeholders to use only the new  AdES/ASiC ENs standards.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  27  ANNEX A: BASIC CONCEPTS  A.1 GENERAL CONTEXT: THE EIDAS REGULATION AND TRUST  SERVICES  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification  (eID) and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation  is about trust, seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal  proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or  other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because  they are electronic but have to assess these electronic tools in the same way they would do for  their paper equivalent.  Figure 15: Trustworthy-Convenient-Cross-Border-Seamless  Whether you are a large company, a SME or a citizen trying to complete an electronic  transaction in another EU country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in  another EU Member State (MS), besides reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation  ensure cross-border recognition of electronic trust services supporting your electronic  transaction.  Since 1 July 2016, the eIDAS Regulation provisions related to trust services are directly  applicable in all the EU Member States overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It  provides legal certainty and fosters the usage of electronic trust services for online transactions  at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation creates an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by  ensuring their recognition and workability across borders and are considered equivalent to  traditional paper-based processes.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  28  A.2 TRUST SERVICES DEFINED BY THE EIDAS REGULATION  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally  provided for remuneration, which consists of:   the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or  electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related  to those services, or   the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or   the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  A.3 ADVANCED ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES AND SEALS  An advanced electronic signature meets the requirements specified in article 26 of the eIDAS  Regulation, namely:   it is uniquely linked to the signatory;   it is capable of identifying the signatory;   it is created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high  level of confidence, use under his sole control; and   it is linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in  the data is detectable.  It should be noted that the requirements on advanced electronic signatures in the eIDAS  Regulation does not introduce new requirements in terms of format with regard to the former  Electronic Signatures Directive43. For this reason, the previous TSs, developed while the  Directive was in force, continued to be usable without change when the eIDAS Regulation  become applicable.  An advanced electronic seal meets the requirements specified in article 36 of the eIDAS  Regulation, namely:   it is uniquely linked to the creator of the seal;   it is capable of identifying the creator of the seal;   it is created using electronic seal creation data that the creator of the seal can, with a  high level of confidence under its control, use for electronic seal creation; and   it is linked to the data to which it relates in such a way that any subsequent change in  the data is detectable.  The requirements in terms of signature/seal format are part of points a, b and d (for both the  lists above) and remained unchanged from the Electronic Signatures Directive.  All the ETSI signatures and seal format standards (old and new) are based on PKI, a specific  technology. This is not the only possible technical way to achieve the advanced electronic  signature or seal level, but it is the only technology that allow full interoperability thanks to a  complete set of standards. Electronic signatures and seals based on different technologies and  on commonly recognized standards are therefore not presently possible. Moreover, no other  technology is known to achieve the qualified level for advanced electronic signatures and seals.  43 Directive 1999/93/EC, article 2(2) reads: \"advanced electronic signature\" means an electronic signature which meets the  following requirements:  (a) it is uniquely linked to the signatory;  (b) it is capable of identifying the signatory;  (c) it is created using means that the signatory can maintain under his sole control; and  (d) it is linked to the data to which it relates in such a manner that any subsequent change of the data is detectable;  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  29  However, in case this will change in the future, the eIDAS Regulation is technologically neutral  and foresee the possibility, by updating the implementing acts, to reference new standards  implementing technologies that could emerge in the future.

INTRODUCTION  The Regulation (EU) No 910/20144 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation5) provides the regulatory  framework in the EU for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market.  The creation, verification, validation and preservation of electronic  signatures or electronic seals relies (among others) on standards specifying formats of  electronic signatures and seals to guarantee interoperability and their general usability within  the Member States and across borders.  The eIDAS Regulation in recital 64 says: “When addressing formats of advanced electronic  signatures and seals, the Commission should build on existing practices, standards and  legislation […]” and sets the ground for Article 27 “Electronic signatures in public services”  where the paragraph 5 reads: “By 18 September 2015, and taking into account existing  practices, standards and Union legal acts, the Commission shall, by means of implementing  acts, define reference formats of advanced electronic signatures […]”. Mutatis mutandis Article  37 “Electronic seals in public services” and its paragraph 5 requires the same for electronic  seals. On this basis the Commission has published the Commission Implementing Decision  (EU) 2015/15066 laying down specifications relating to the format of advanced electronic  signatures and seals, defining the minimum requirements in terms of advanced electronic  signatures and seals format recognition for the public sector.  The above mentioned Decision specifies in its Article 1 that the Member States shall recognize  XML, CMS or PDF advanced electronic signatures based on the formats respectively named  XAdES7, CAdES8 or PAdES9, or associated signature containers based on ASiC10 if they  comply with the ETSI technical specifications (TSs) listed in the Decision Annex. The article 3  requires the same formats for electronic seals. It should be noted that the standards referenced  are the same as in the Commission Decision 2011/130/EU11, “establishing minimum  requirements for the cross-border processing of documents signed electronically by competent  authorities under Directive 2006/123/EC” (“on services in the internal market” or “Services  Directive”12).  Some years after the publication of the technical specifications referenced in the mentioned  Decisions, ETSI has published a set of European standards (ENs) taking into account the  eIDAS Regulation requirements and addressing a number of issues that have been identified,  based on the feedback received from the stakeholders, for example during  CAdES/XAdES/PAdES/ASiC ETSI Plugtests™ events. These ENs are not listed in the  mentioned Decisions, thus a consideration should be given for their update.  The scope of this document is to assess the suitability of the recently published ENs to fulfil the  eIDAS Regulation requirements, and to describe the differences with the previous TSs, in view  4 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910  5 See Annex A.  6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015D1506  7 XML Advanced Electronic Signature  8 CMS Advanced Electronic Signature  9 PDF Advanced Electronic Signature  10 Associated Signature Container  11 This document refers to Decision 2011/130/EU (available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011D0130) as amended by the Commission Implementing Decision 2014/148/EU  (available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014D0148).

It also aims at  evaluating the consequences of such update and defines the timeline for a possible transition to  the exclusive usage of the new ENs.  The standards affected are those mentioned in the Annex of the Commission Decision  2011/130/EU and Commission Implementing Decision 2015/1506/EU:   For XML advanced electronic signatures and seals the specification currently  referenced is the XAdES baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 171, which is now  specified as “XAdES baseline signatures” in clause 6 of ETSI EN 319 132-1.   For CMS advanced electronic signatures and seals the specification currently  referenced is the CAdES baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 173, which is now  specified as “CAdES baseline signatures” in clause 6 of ETSI EN 319 122-1.   For PDF advanced electronic signatures and seals the specification currently  referenced is the PAdES baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 172, which is now  specified as “PAdES baseline signatures” in clause 6 of ETSI EN 319 142-1.   For associated signature and seal container the specification currently referenced is  the ASiC baseline profile, specified in ETSI TS 103 174, which is now specified as  “ASiC baseline containers” in clause 5 of ETSI EN 319 162-1.  In this document (as well as in TR 119 112, see 3.1) the set of “old” technical specifications (i.e.  ETSI TS 103 171/2/3/4) is collectively referenced as “previous TSs” while the “new” European  Norms (i.e. ETSI EN 319 122/132/142/162) are collectively referenced as “AdES/ASiC ENs”.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  7  2. OVERVIEW OF THE ADVANCED  ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AND SEAL  FORMAT STANDARDS  This chapter gives an overview of electronic signature standards and some background  information on what underpinned their development.  The Directive 1999/93/EC13, known as the “Electronic Signatures Directive”, was in force before  the eIDAS Regulation. The European legislative framework presented a continuous challenge  for European standards bodies to address the needs of both, the public and private sectors,  while keeping as much as possible the interoperability with global standards, when they exist.  Since the introduction of the Electronic Signatures Directive, the standards on digital signatures  and related trust services, i.e. the main technologies supporting electronic signatures and seals,  are developed by the ETSI Technical Committee “Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures”14  (ETSI TC ESI hereafter). In parallel, CEN developed standard protection profiles supporting  certification of related products, such as qualified signature and seal creation devices, not in  scope of this document.  2.1 FIRST SET OF TSS SPECIFYING ADVANCED ELECTRONIC  SIGNATURES FORMAT  The ETSI ESI TC started the development of the signature format TSs when the Electronic  Signatures Directive entered into force, based on the use of public key infrastructure (PKI)  technology to produce digital signatures:   ETSI TS 101 73315 “CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)” that  specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on the IETF RFC  565216 “Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)”;   ETSI TS 101 90317 “XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)” that  specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on the W3C  Recommendation \"XML Signature Syntax and Processing”18 (XMLDSig);   ETSI TS 102 778 “PDF Advanced Electronic Signature Profiles” (PAdES) a  multipart standard (more specifically ETSI TS 102 778-319 and ETSI TS 102 778- 420 are the basis for the PAdES Baseline Profile, see 2.2) that specifies formats  for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on ISO-32000-1 \"Document  management - Portable document format\"21 (PDF);   ETSI TS 102 91822“Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)” that specifies the  use of container structures to bind together one or more signed objects with  13 Available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31999L0093  14 For more information see https://www.etsi.org/committee/esi  15 All the references to ETSI TS 101 733 in this document refer to version 2.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101700_101799/101733/02.02.01_60/  16 Available at: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652  17 All references to ETSI TS 101 903 in this document refer to version1.4.2 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101900_101999/101903/01.04.02_60/  18 Available at: https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-xmldsig-core1-20130411/  19 All references to ETSI TS 102 778-3 in this document refer to version 1.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/10277803/01.02.01_60/  20 All references to ETSI TS 102 778-4 in this document refer to version 1.1.2 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102700_102799/10277804/01.01.02_60/  21 Available at: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf  22 Available at: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102900_102999/102918/01.03.01_60/  http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  8  either advanced electronic signatures or time-stamp tokens into one single digital  container using package formats based on ZIP.  The first CAdES standard was published in 2000, the first XAdES in 2002, the first PAdES in  2009 and the first ASiC in 2011.  CMS, XMLDSig and PDF digital signatures are the formats for digital signatures most  commonly used globally, but it was necessary to specify additional attributes to support the  requirements of advanced electronic signatures as defined in the Electronic Signatures  Directive, in force at that time.  The main gap identified in global standards was the lack of a consistent support for validation of  the electronic signatures over long term, to protect them against key compromised or weakened  algorithms. The signature validity evidence in case of disputes between signers and verifiers  may occur many years after the signature creation. These issues were addressed in the global  standards while keeping the basic compliance with them, i.e. using extension mechanisms that  did not break the syntactical rules of the formats defined in the global standards. A number of  successive versions were published as part of regular maintenance of the standards, to fix  identified issues, support the business needs that were progressively emerging and to keep the  suitability of the standards to support the evolving legal framework.  This led to the standards containing various options addressing long term protection but lacking  a fully coherent approach to the different signature formats. This requirement emerged with the  need to support the operation of Points of single contact, introduced with the Services  Directive23, and was addressed in the publication of the set of electronic signature profiles, as  described in the next paragraph.  2.2 PUBLICATION OF A SET OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE BASELINE  PROFILES (“PREVIOUS TSS”)  The Services Directive required for the first time the cross border interoperability of advanced  electronic signature formats to allow competent authorities24 in each Member State to process  electronic signatures created by competent authorities in another Member State. It was noted  that they “may face technical difficulties due to the variety of signature formats used”, as  recognized in recital 3 of Commission Decision 2011/130/EU25.  This led to the need to rationalize the different forms of signatures defined for each signature  format (similar but not really equivalent) and develop and group a minimal number of sets of  common properties to support the same features for long time validation, independently from  the specific signature format.  In a similar way – when compared to the Services Directive – the eIDAS Regulation introduced  in the article 27 “Electronic signatures in public services” (and article 37 for electronic seals) an  obligation for the Member States, when they require advanced electronic signatures or seals, to  support the standards referenced by the Decision 2015/1506 in their public services.  In addition, the eIDAS Regulation has introduced the electronic seals (i.e. signature by a legal  persons), and, in article 37, the same obligations for member States as in the article 27 for  advanced electronic signatures. The digital signature technology can support both electronic  signatures and seals, and the standards developed for the advanced electronic signature  23 Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal  market, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32006L0123  24 As defined in the Services Directive, i.e. any body or authority which has a supervisory or regulatory role in a Member  State in relation to service activities  25 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0130  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32006L0123 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0130  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  9  formats work perfectly also for electronic seals. Only the certificates supporting signatures and  seals have different content, to reflect the different nature of the subject to which the certificate  is issued. In fact, the current version of the Decision 2015/1506 reference the same signature  format standards specified in Decision 2011/130/EU.  In order to tackle the requirements of the Services Directive, ETSI has developed and  published, in the scope the European Commission Mandate M/46026, a set of Technical  Specifications specifying Baseline Profiles for all the Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES,  XAdES, PAdES) and for Associated Signature Containers (ASiC). These, correspond to the  minimum requirements specified in Decision 2011/130/EU, and provide the same basic features  with a minimal number of options. The same set of specification were found applicable by the  Commission for the eIDAS Regulation and, specifically, for the purposes of the Decision  2015/1506.  Each profile specifies common set of options aiming at maximising interoperability and  supporting not only the requirements of the Services Directive, but also a wide range of  business and governmental use cases for electronic procedures and communications,  applicable to a wide range of communities and across borders.  The Baseline Profile TSs, profiling the formats described in 2.1, are:  1. ETSI TS 103 17127 “XAdES Baseline Profile”,  2. ETSI TS 103 17228 “PAdES Baseline Profile”,  3. ETSI TS 103 17329 “CAdES Baseline Profile”,  4. ETSI TS 103 17430 “ASiC Baseline Profile”.  Each profile defines four different conformance levels addressing incremental requirements to  maintain the validity of the signatures over the long term:  1. B-Level, for basic conformance, profiling a number of basic properties incorporated when  the signature is generated;  2. T-Level, for Trusted time for signature existence conformance, profiling the generation, for  an existing signature, of a trusted token allowing to prove that the signature itself actually  existed at a certain date and time;  3. LT-Level, for Long Term conformance, profiling the incorporation of all the material required  for validating the signature, to tackle the long term availability of such validation material;  4. LTA-Level, for Long Term with Archive time-stamps conformance, profiling the  incorporation of time-stamp tokens that allow validation of the signature long time after its  generation, to tackle the long term availability and integrity of the validation material.  All the requirements addressed at a certain level are always addressed also by the levels  above. Each level requires the presence of certain properties, specified in each profile TS to  reduce as much as possible the optionality. All the properties used in a signature profile for a  given signature format are specified in the TS listed in 2.1 that specifies that format.  The specific level to be used depends on the period of time after signature creation for which  technical validity of signature has to be preserved, taking into account certificate expiration,  revocation and/or algorithm obsolescence. Each signature conformance level should be  26 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/mandates/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.detail&id=442  27 All references to ETSI TS 103 171 in this document refer to version 2.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103171/02.01.01_60/  28 All references to ETSI TS 103 172 in this document refer to version 2.2.2 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103172/02.02.02_60/  29 All references to ETSI TS 103 173 in this document refer to version 2.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103173/02.02.01_60  30 All references to ETSI TS 103 174 in this document refer to version 2.2.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103100_103199/103174/02.02.01_60  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/mandates/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.detail&id=442  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  10  increased as needed to guarantee that the relying parties can always trust the signature. This  process in called “signature augmentation”.  2.3 PUBLICATION OF THE ADES/ASIC ENS  The requirements for electronic signatures in the Signatures Directive and in the eIDAS  Regulation are very similar. The difference between advanced electronic signatures and seals  in the Regulation did not put any additional technical requirements on formats31. As part of the  rationalization of the electronic signature standards, requested by the mandate M/460 published  by the European Commission, all the technical specifications were restructured, and a set of  European Standards (ENs) were developed. The aim of this exercise was to replace the  previous Technical Specifications (TSs) limiting as much as possible the foreseen impact on  existing implementations of the adoption of the new standards.  The development of ENs had a number of implications and resulted in:   better guarantee of taking into account the market needs: a TS is approved in ETSI  with a procedure that involves only the relevant Technical Committee, while an EN has  additional steps, including one or more enquiry and weighted votes by the EU National  Standardization Organizations (NSOs), guaranteeing a wider stakeholder involvement  through national mirror committees. The AdES/ASiC ENs had undergone also a public  review, required by the European Commission as part of mandate m/460, where all  the stakeholders had the possibility to comment on the drafts. Reaching approval took  significantly more time, as an EN should be published only when its content is mature  enough, and, because of its nature, it does not require frequent changes;   better support of the Digital Single Market: no national standard can be drafted by an  European NSO if an EN exists or is under development on the same topic (i.e. the  “standstill” applies). When the EN is approved, the existing national standards must be  withdrawn.  AdES/ASiC ENs have been published by ETSI after throughful considerations, which included  involved a far bigger representation of stakeholders than while drafting the previous TSs,  approved at ETSI ESI TC level only. They reached unanimous approval at their final vote. It  should also be noted that ETSI run regular Plugtests™, interoperability events conducted  remotely, in order to prove interoperability of implementations and enhance standards  robustness, either on CAdES/XAdES/PAdES/ASiC and on signature validation. Plugtests™  events use a dedicated portal developed by the ETSI independent testing unit CTI (Centre for  Testing and Interoperability)32.  Each EN in the signature format set of standards is divided into two parts, as follows:   EN 319 122 “CAdES digital signatures”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and CAdES baseline signatures”33  o Part 2: “Extended CAdES signatures”34   EN 319 132 “XAdES digital signatures”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and XAdES baseline signatures” 35  31 See clause A.3 of this document for a short overview on advanced electronic signature and seal requirements  32 See https://portal.etsi.org/Services/CentreforTestingInteroperability.aspx  33 All references to ETSI EN 319 122-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31912201/01.01.01_60/  34 All references to ETSI EN 319 122-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31912202/01.01.01_60/  35 All references to ETSI EN 319 132-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31913201/01.01.01_60/  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  11  o Part 2: “Extended XAdES signatures”36   EN 319 142 “PAdES digital signatures”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and PAdES baseline signatures” 37  o Part 2: “Extended PAdES signatures” 38   EN 319 162 “Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)”  o Part 1: “Building blocks and ASiC baseline containers” 39  o Part 2: “Additional ASiC containers” 40  All the AdES/ASiC ENs clearly delimit their scope to the technological level, i.e. digital  signatures supported by PKI and public key certificates.  This approach allows keeping the legal details apart from the scope of a technical standard, to  target the applicable technical requirements stemming from the eIDAS Regulation for both  advanced electronic signatures and seals. In general, avoiding to have a strict link with  legislation aims to make the standards more easily usable for the international community.  More specifically, the AdES/ASiC ENs aim at supporting electronic signatures, advanced  electronic signatures, qualified electronic signatures, electronic seals, advanced electronic  seals, and qualified electronic seals as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.  This approach is fully in line with the eIDAS Regulation and its technical neutrality: in fact, the  link between the Regulation and specific technologies that fulfil the requirements specified  therein, is established only by the implementing acts.  Each first part the of the AdES/ASiC ENs specifies the “building blocks” for that signature  format, then defines four levels of baseline signatures addressing incremental requirements to  maintain the validity of the signatures over the long term, in a way that a given level always  addresses all the requirements addressed at levels that are below.  Each level requires the presence of certain attributes, defined in the “building blocks” section,  profiled for reducing any optionality as much as possible to maximise interoperability.  Each first part the of the AdES/ASiC ENs is then self-contained, including both –  the basic  information that was available in each format specifications (the ones listed in 2.1), and the  baseline content that was specified in in the previous TSs. For example, in the current version  of the Commission implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506, a reference to ETSI TS 103 173 is  given for the CMS advanced electronic signatures and seals. Then ETSI TS 103 173  references the ETSI TS 101 733 for the format itself, i.e. the parts that in EN 319 122-1 are  specified for CAdES in the building blocks section. This allows an easier implementation, as all  the required information for CAdES can be found in a single document, which helps avoiding  mistakes in using the right version of the format specification.  All the second parts of the standards include the former additional forms present in the  signature format TSs (listed in 2.1). Unless otherwise specified, in this document only the first  Parts for each signature format EN are referenced.  36 All references to ETSI EN 319 132-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31913202/01.01.01_60/  37 All references to ETSI EN 319 142-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31914201/01.01.01_60/  38 All references to ETSI EN 319 142-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31914202/01.01.01_60/  39 All references to ETSI EN 319 162-1 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31916201/01.01.01_60/  40 All references to ETSI EN 319 162-2 in this document refer to version 1.1.1 available at:  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31916202/01.01.01_60/  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  12  3. MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN ADES/ASIC ENS AND  PREVIOUS TSS  As explained in Section 2.3, the eIDAS Regulation relies on implementing acts to specify  standards that complies with the requirements specified therein.  The repealed Electronic Signatures Directive did not use this mechanism, therefore the  previous TSs had to reference explicitly the advanced electronic signatures, while the  AdES/ASiC ENs can, more correctly, reference the specific technology (i.e. digital signature) on  which they are based.  Below are listed the most important differences between each signature format standards and  the corresponding previous TSs.  3.1 ETSI TR 119 112  ETSI published a Technical Report (ETSI TR 119 112) on “Most significant differences between  AdES/ASiC ENs and previous TSs” that has been used to compile the paragraphs from 3.2 to  3.5 and covers specifically the technical differences between the formats specified in the  previous TSs and the ones specified in the  AdES/ASiC ENs. This is, in fact, an important  element to consider to assess the impact of introducing the new standards and in defining a  strategy to possibly replace the previous TSs, minimizing the impact on implementations.  Only the relevant parts of ETSI TR 119 112 were considered: as explained in 2.3, only first  parts of each EN specifie the baseline signatures, which corresponds to the “baseline profiles”  described in 2.2 and are referenced in the Decisions published by the Commission. As  explained in the section dedicated to ASiC, in case of associated signatures and seals  containers some of the baseline profiles present in ETSI TS 103 174 are not present in EN 319  162-1 but in EN 319 162-2, for this reason also the latter were taken into account.  3.2 XADES DIGITAL SIGNATURES  This paragraph uses the URI namespaces and the prefixes associated to these XML  namespaces listed in Table 1.  Table 1: Namespaces with constant prefixes  XML Namespace URI Prefix  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig# ds  http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2# xades  http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.4.1# xadesv141  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig%23 http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.3.2%23 http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.4.1%23  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  13  The main differences of ETSI EN 319 132-1 in comparison to ETSI TS 101 903 and ETSI TS  103 171 are:   Specification of the new qualifying properties for them to replace in the future the  qualifying properties that had been specified by ETSI TSs.   Specification of the new qualifying properties, with semantics that none of the  qualifying properties already specified by ETSI TSs did not offer.   Clarification of the semantics of certain qualifying properties already specified within  the different ETSI TSs.   Definition of a new set of signature levels specified in ETSI EN 319 132-1 that comes  from the revision of the baseline signatures defined in ETSI TS 103 171.   Redistribution of material:  o ETSI EN 319 132-1 contains the definition of the semantics and the syntax of  the new set of XAdES qualifying properties, and the specification of the  XAdES baseline signature levels.  o ETSI TS 101 903 contains the definition of the semantics and the syntax of all  the previous set of XAdES qualifying properties.  o ETSI TS 103 171 contains the specification of levels for XAdES baseline  signatures old formats.  The following clauses will provide further details on some of the aforementioned changes.  3.2.1 New qualifying properties substituting previously defined ones  The XML Signature W3C Recommendation, which specifies the semantics and syntax of XML  signatures, on which XAdES signatures are built, deprecated an element which was used in  ETSI TS 101 903 and ETSI TS 103 171, namely the ds:X509IssuerSerial element, due to  reported problems by XML validators when dealing with very high integer values. Indeed, the  problem was not related to the specification of the element, but a problem of implementations of  certain XML validators.  As has been mentioned, a number of qualifying properties specified in ETSI TS 101 903  contained the aforementioned element.  ETSI TC ESI decided not to keep in its new specifications an element that XML Signature W3C  Recommendation had labelled as deprecated. This forced to define new XAdES qualifying  properties for substituting:  1) all the previously defined ones containing the ds:X509IssuerSerial element; and  2) any previously defined qualifying property whose semantics depended on the properties  included in bullet 1).  Table 2 shows the XAdES qualifying properties specified in the ETSI TS 101 903 and the new  ones specified by ETSI EN 319 132-1.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  14  Table 2: ETSI EN 319 132-1 new qualifying XAdES properties replacing ETSI TS 101 903  XAdES qualifying properties due to deprecation of ds:X509IssuerSerial in XML Signature W3C  Recommendation  New XAdES qualifying properties specified  in ETSI EN 319 132-1  XAdES qualifying properties specified  in ETSI TS 101 903 replaced by the former ones  xades:SigningCertificateV2 xades:SigningCertificate  xadesv141:CompleteCertificateRefsV2 xades:CompleteCertificateRefs  xadesv141:AttributeCertificateRefsV2 xades:AttributeCertificateRefs  xadesv141:SigAndRefsTimeStampV2 xades:SigAndRefsTimeStamp  xadesv141:RefsOnlyTimeStampV2 xades:RefsOnlyTimeStamp  xades:SignatureProductionPlaceV2 xades:SignatureProductionPlace  Qualifying properties xades:SigningCertificate, xades:CompleteCertificateRefs,  and xades:AttributeCertificateRefs included ds:X509IssuerSerial as  component.  In these components, the deprecated ds:X509IssuerSerial element was replaced by the  so-called xades:IssuerSerialV2 element, which contains the base-64 encoding of one  DER-encoded instance of type IssuerSerial type defined in IETF RFC 5035. In essence it  contains the same information than the ds:X509IssuerSerial but in its original encoding  within the X509 certificate, which first, keeps the information, and second, avoids any problem  appearing by the conversion of a Distinguished Name into a String.  In addition to this, ETSI EN 319 132-1 clearly specifies that this new element is \"only a hint, that  can help to identify the certificate whose digest matches the value present in the reference. But  the binding information is the digest of the certificate\", which clearly states that applications  cannot rely on this value for matching a reference to the purportedly referenced certificate.  Instead, they are required to use the digest value. This was not stated in ETSI TS 101 903 nor  in ETSI TS 103 171.  Qualifying properties xades:SigAndRefsTimeStamp and xades:RefsOnlyTimeStamp  depended on some of the properties in the list before.  Table 3 shows new XAdES qualifying properties specified in ETSI EN 319 132-1, some of  which replace already existing XAdES qualifying properties specified in ETSI TS 101 903, for  the reasons explained in the table, others just allow to incorporate new features into the XAdES  signatures.

Most  of these properties either contained validation material (certificates, CRLs, OCSP responses),  or references to this kind of validation material.  In most cases the clarification consisted in describing which specific validation values, or  references to the validation values, may be present in each qualifying property.

The following clauses provide further details on some of the aforementioned changes.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  17  3.3.1 New attributes substituting previously defined ones  Table 6 shows new CAdES attributes specified in ETSI EN 319 122-1: some of them also  replace already existing CAdES attributes specified in ETSI TS 101 733, for the reasons  explained in the table, others just allow to incorporate new features into the CAdES signatures.

For self-contained long-lasting signatures  in prevision of difficulties to access to the  signature policy location.  ats-hash-index-v3 ats-hash-index Allow or addition of a value within the set  of values in Attribute.attrValues  field within a certain attribute after the  already present values within the  aforementioned set had been time- stamped by a former archive-time- stamp-v3. This is achieved by computing  digests on octets \"resulting from  concatenating the  Attribute.attrType field and one of  the instances of AttributeValue within  the Attribute.attrValues within the  unsignedAttrs field\". It is worth to  mention that ats-hash-index attribute  is not used in any of the signature profiles  that are mentioned in the Commission  Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506.  SigPolicyQualifierInfo  in signature-policy- identifier  SigPolicyQualifierInfo  in signature-policy- identifier  A third and new qualifier for the signature  policy have been identified so far: an  identifier of the technical specification that  defines the syntax used for producing the  signature policy document (an element of  type SPDocSpecification).  3.3.2 Clarification of attributes semantics  A relevant effort was made by the ETSI TC ESI in clarifying the semantics of a number of  attributes. Most of these properties either contained validation material (certificates, CRLs,  OCSP responses) or references to this kind of validation material.  In most cases the clarification consisted in describing which specific validation values, or  references to which validation values may be present in each attribute.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  18  It is worth mentioning that none of the attributes listed in Table 7 is used in any of the levels that  were mentioned in the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506.

In addition to this ETSI EN 319 122-1 clearly specifies that its IssuerSerial component of  ESS signing-certificate-v2 attribute is \"only a hint, that can help to identify the  certificate whose digest matches the value present in the reference. But the binding information  is the digest of the certificate\", which clearly states that applications cannot rely on this value for  matching a reference to the purportedly referenced certificate; instead, they are required to use  the digest value. This was not stated in ETSI TS 101 733 nor ETSI TS 103 173.  3.3.3 Deprecated attributes  Table 8 shows the attributes deprecated by ETSI EN 319 122-1.

Its content was not  included in ETSI EN 319 142.  The following clauses provide further details on some of the aforementioned changes.  3.4.1 New attributes substituting previously defined ones  Table10 shows a new attribute whose usage is specified in ETSI EN 319 142-1. It replaces an  already existing CAdES attribute specified in ETSI TS 101 733.

Most of these properties either contained information provided by  the signer to enable a recipient to identify or contact the signer itself, or explained the reasons  for the signing or properties that contain validation material (certificates, CRLs, OCSP  responses).  Most of the times the clarification consisted in describing when specific attributes may be  present in the PAdES signature.

See clause 3.3 of this document for  specific information about differences related to CAdES standards.   Updated reference to ETSI EN 319 132-1 instead of ETSI TS 101 903  and ETSI TS  103 171 for ASiC containers based on XAdES. See clause 3.2 of this document for  specific information about differences related to XAdES standards.   Definition of a new set of baseline container levels specified in ETSI EN 319 162-1  from the revision of a subset of ASiC profiles defined in ETSI TS 103 174; the ASiC  profiles that were not included among the ASiC baseline containers have been  specified in ETSI EN 319 162-2 as additional profiles   Support of IETF RFC 4998 and IETF RFC 6283 evidence records in ETSI EN 319  162-1 building blocks (this affects only additional profiles specified in ETSI EN 319  162-2).   Introduction of new specific Manifest files for long term availability for containers types  where this feature cannot be achieved with direct use of signature or time assertion  formats attributes/qualifying properties (this affects only additional profiles specified in  ETSI EN 319 162-2).   Clarification of text to eliminate ambiguities.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  22  3.5.1 New set of container levels  ETSI EN 319 162-1 defines a set of baseline container levels replacing a subset of container  profiles specified in ETSI TS 103 174 as indicated in Table 14. ETSI TS 103 174 is referenced  by the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506.  It should be noted that ETSI TS 103 174 specifies baseline profiles also for ASiC-S with Time  stamp token, ASiC-E with CAdES and ASiC-E with Time stamp token that have no  correspondence in ETSI EN 319 162-1 but are present as extended containers in ETSI EN 319  162-2.  In case of the containers meant to associate data with time-stamp tokens (ASiC-S with Time  stamp token and ASiC-E with Time stamp token) they cannot be considered as associated  electronic signature or seal containers and therefore they are out of scope of the decisions  2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU. In the case of ASiC-E with CAdES, given the feedback received  during the consultations that was in the direction to simplify and reduce the number of  containers, ETSI ESI TC decided to not include it among the baseline containers.

Evidence records are also supported in ASiC manifest files allowing to specify the data  object(s) to which the evidence records apply.  Evidence records are not used in ASiC baseline containers specified in ETSI EN 319 162-1.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  23  3.5.3 New ASiC Manifest files for long term availability  ASiCArchiveManifest was added to protect long term time stamp tokens and  ASiCEvidenceRecordManifest was added to reference a set of files to which an evidence  record applies, allowing an LTA equivalent level also for ASiC containers with time assertions.  ASiC Manifest files are not used in ASiC baseline containers specified in ETSI EN 319 162-1.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  24  4. CONCLUSIONS  4.1 OPPORTUNITY AND SUITABILITY TO REFERENCE THE ADES/ASIC  ENS  The signature format TSs were introduced when the Electronic Signatures Directive was in  force. Given the similar requirements for the signature formats in the Directive and in the  Regulation, and for both, advanced electronic signatures and seals, the profiles published by  ETSI in 2012 (i.e. the previous TSs) are still usable today.  In April 2016 ETSI has published an updated set of European standards (the AdES/ASiC ENs).  The European Norms have a much higher stability and value in the standardization document  hierarchy and they guarantee that no other national standard can be developed or adopted  overlapping the ones developed by ETSI for electronic signature and seal formats based on  CMS, XML and PDF and for Associated signature and seal containers. As explained in 2.3 the  process included a public review (in addition to the enquiry stage already part of the ETSI  process) and Plugtests™ that led to changes that improved interoperability (also improving the  text where it could not be interpreted unambiguously by implementors), eliminated technical  flaws and provided new features proposed during the drafting and the approval process of the  ENs.  The extensive experience of ETSI TC ESI in developing standards for electronic signatures is  also a guarantee for the quality of the standards, and for their sustainability and maintenance.  It should also be noted that even if the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506  applies only to the public sector, the standards listed become a reference also for the private  sector: this is an additional reason for updating the Decision, otherwise also the private sector  adoption of the standards could be compromised. ETSI TC ESI in fact developed a  comprehensive framework of standards supporting electronic signatures and seals and eIDAS  trust services: it is therefore important that the referenced standards take into account the  evolution of the framework, to maximize the benefits for all the actors involved. Signature format  standards are in fact cross referenced by many other standards.  Moreover, the CEF e-signature building block is based on the AdES/ASiC ENs41 and funded  already a number of projects that implemented it. This means on one hand that a number of  implementations based on the AdES/ASiC ENs already exist and the public and private sector  organizations that participated (or are participating) to CEF projects are ready to use the new  AdES/ASiC ENs. On the other hand there is a risk that the positive effect expected from these  funding measures is reduced, in case the references to the signature format standards are not  updated.  Also the Commission Decision 2011/130/EU should be considered for update. In fact the recital  8 of the eIDAS Regulation says that “Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of  the Council (5) requires Member States to establish ‘points of single contact’ (PSCs) to ensure  that all procedures and formalities relating to access to a service activity and to the exercise  thereof can be easily completed, at a distance and by electronic means, through the  appropriate PSC with the appropriate authorities. Many online services accessible through  PSCs require electronic identification, authentication and signature.” Keeping the Decisions  41 See https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignature+standards for more information  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignature+standards  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  25  2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU not aligned would result in additional complexity,especially for the  public sector.  The Commission Decision 2011/130/EU is also referenced in the article 22(6)(c)(i) of the  Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement42, in case a contracting entity requires advanced  electronic signatures supported by a qualified certificate for the electronic transmission and  receipt of tenders, and for the electronic receipt of requests to participate. Lack of alignment of  the Decisions 2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU can introduce additional costs to both, the private  and he public sectors.  Specific consideration is reserved to the ASiC. As explained in 3.5.1, ETSI EN 319 162-1  clause 5 does not include some of the profiles specified in TS 103 174, referenced by decisions  2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU, namely:   ASiC-S Time stamp token and ASiC-E Time stamp token, as these were not  specifying associated signature or seal but associate containers with time-stamp  tokens;   ASiC-E CAdES, as there was no evidence for its adoption and this was considered to  be in contrast with the principle of maximum reduction of options present in the  mandate.  In case it is agreed to include also these containers in the update of decisions 2015/1506  and/or 2011/130/EU, then specific clauses of ETSI EN 319 162-2 can be introduced according  to the specific need. In order to avoid putting excessive requirements on the public services, it  is however recommended to avoid or to limit referencing the ETSI EN 319 162-2 unless there is  a clear evidence that the containers now moved in this part of the standard have been adopted  by a high number of public services, and to deprecate the creation of ASiC containers compliant  with the profiles listed above.  The European Commission is then advised to revise its Decisions 2015/1506 and 2011/130/EU,  referencing the new ENs and taking into account a transition period to allow to update the  software involved and to migrate the applications, as proposed in the next paragraph.  Reference should be made to ETSI EN 319 122-1 clause 6, ETSI EN 319 132-1 clause 6, ETSI  EN 319 142-1 clause 6 where the baseline signatures are specified and ETSI EN 319 162-1  clause 5 where baseline containers are specified.  4.2 POSSIBLE WAY FORWARD MINIMIZING IMPACT  The previous paragraph is focused on the reasons for updating decisions 2015/1506 and  2011/130/EU. This has of course an impact that needs to be minimized.  The following measures should be considered by the Commission to reduce the impact of  updating the references:   defining, with member States, an appropriate update path. Some advice is given  hereafter;   stimulate the process with specific funding measures, such as CEF, the adoption of  the CEF eSignature building blocks. This should be possible until the end of 2020  when the CEF initiative is expected to terminate;  42 Available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  26   take benefit from the execution of ETSI Plugtests™: the next edition for electronic  signature validation is foreseen in November 2019.  The update path to be adopted should avoid any discontinuity and minimize the impact on  provision of services by allowing enough  time to implement the changes, but also to foresee a  period of time of parallel use of the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards with the previous TSs.  The number of technical differences is quite limited and new attributes are designed in a way  that they can be implemented in parallel with the old ones.  Therefore, a possible way forward could be:   To establish a first deadline to:  o mandate acceptance of the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards, in parallel with  the previous TSs;  o recommend the use the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards to create signatures.   Optionally, to establish a second deadline to deprecate the creation of signatures with  the previous TSs;   To establish a final deadline, after which previous TSs shall not be accepted any more.  This final deadline should be chosen by balancing the time needed to introduce the  new standards when creating signatures and the cost of maintaining implementations  supporting both the new AdES/ASiC ENs standards and the previous TSs.  It should be noted that ETSI will not deprecate the previous TSs, unless serious flaws are  identified. This situation is not likely to happen, given the long time when the standards where  tested and widely adopted.  ETSI could give a “historical” status to the previous TSs after the last deadline is passed, as it  was the case for other standards changed or replaced in frame of the mandate M/460. This  would give a clear message to the market and all the stakeholders to use only the new  AdES/ASiC ENs standards.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  27  ANNEX A: BASIC CONCEPTS  A.1 GENERAL CONTEXT: THE EIDAS REGULATION AND TRUST  SERVICES  eIDAS is the acronym used to refer to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic identification  (eID) and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The eIDAS Regulation  is about trust, seamless user experience and convenience in online cross-border transactions.  It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal  proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or  other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because  they are electronic but have to assess these electronic tools in the same way they would do for  their paper equivalent.  Figure 15: Trustworthy-Convenient-Cross-Border-Seamless  Whether you are a large company, a SME or a citizen trying to complete an electronic  transaction in another EU country, e.g. submit a call for tender or register as a student in  another EU Member State (MS), besides reducing time and costs, the eIDAS Regulation  ensure cross-border recognition of electronic trust services supporting your electronic  transaction.  Since 1 July 2016, the eIDAS Regulation provisions related to trust services are directly  applicable in all the EU Member States overcoming problems of fragmented national regimes. It  provides legal certainty and fosters the usage of electronic trust services for online transactions  at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation creates an EU wide internal market for electronic trust services by  ensuring their recognition and workability across borders and are considered equivalent to  traditional paper-based processes.  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  28  A.2 TRUST SERVICES DEFINED BY THE EIDAS REGULATION  In its Art.3.16, the eIDAS Regulation defines a ‘trust service’ as an electronic service normally  provided for remuneration, which consists of:   the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or  electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related  to those services, or   the creation, verification and validation of certificates for website authentication; or   the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  A.3 ADVANCED ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES AND SEALS  An advanced electronic signature meets the requirements specified in article 26 of the eIDAS  Regulation, namely:   it is uniquely linked to the signatory;   it is capable of identifying the signatory;   it is created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high  level of confidence, use under his sole control; and   it is linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in  the data is detectable.  It should be noted that the requirements on advanced electronic signatures in the eIDAS  Regulation does not introduce new requirements in terms of format with regard to the former  Electronic Signatures Directive43. For this reason, the previous TSs, developed while the  Directive was in force, continued to be usable without change when the eIDAS Regulation  become applicable.  An advanced electronic seal meets the requirements specified in article 36 of the eIDAS  Regulation, namely:   it is uniquely linked to the creator of the seal;   it is capable of identifying the creator of the seal;   it is created using electronic seal creation data that the creator of the seal can, with a  high level of confidence under its control, use for electronic seal creation; and   it is linked to the data to which it relates in such a way that any subsequent change in  the data is detectable.  The requirements in terms of signature/seal format are part of points a, b and d (for both the  lists above) and remained unchanged from the Electronic Signatures Directive.  All the ETSI signatures and seal format standards (old and new) are based on PKI, a specific  technology. This is not the only possible technical way to achieve the advanced electronic  signature or seal level, but it is the only technology that allow full interoperability thanks to a  complete set of standards. Electronic signatures and seals based on different technologies and  on commonly recognized standards are therefore not presently possible. Moreover, no other  technology is known to achieve the qualified level for advanced electronic signatures and seals.  43 Directive 1999/93/EC, article 2(2) reads: \"advanced electronic signature\" means an electronic signature which meets the  following requirements:  (a) it is uniquely linked to the signatory;  (b) it is capable of identifying the signatory;  (c) it is created using means that the signatory can maintain under his sole control; and  (d) it is linked to the data to which it relates in such a manner that any subsequent change of the data is detectable;  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS  December 2019  29  However, in case this will change in the future, the eIDAS Regulation is technologically neutral  and foresee the possibility, by updating the implementing acts, to reference new standards  implementing technologies that could emerge in the future.

    "abstract": "The scope of this document is to assess the suitability of the recently published ENs to fulfil the eIDAS Regulation requirements, and to describe the differences with the previous TSs, in view of a possible update of the list of standards referenced in the Decisions in force. It also aims at evaluating the consequences of such update and defines the timeline for a possible transition to the exclusive usage of the new ENs."

Cybersecurity in the EU  In the last few years, there have been many new developments in the cyber world. We continue to  witnessthe digitalisation of our daily lives, the development of new technologies, new threats and new  stakeholders. The words cybersecurity, cyber warfare, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber defence  are increasingly referred to in daily conversation by our citizens and politicians. Some new concepts that  have emerged in the last few years include fake news, cyber ethics, cyber diplomacy and digital  sovereignty.  The ENISA Threat Landscape Report of 2017 highlighted the growth in the traditional cyber challenges  where we have witnessed the increased complexity of cyber incidents, the monetisation of cybercrime  such as growth in ransomware, cyber espionage, advanced persistent threats and attacks on critical  infrastructure.  Are we prepared to address the challenges arising from new threats and the new hybrid threat  landscape in cyber space? To name a few, we are witnessing development and deployment of new  technologies such as Robotics, growth in Artificial Intelligence. From a technical perspective, we have new  technologies changing the cyber landscape. The Internet of Things/ Internet of people is now being  deployed with an estimated 20 Billion devices expected to be operational before 2020. Industry 4.0,  Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and BlockChain technologies are emerging as disruptive technologies and  are beginning to affect our daily lives. These technologies will have a significant societal impact. Europe  and its digital single market needs to be ready to adopt, explore and apply the benefits from these  technologies in a safe and secure cyber environment. Traditional approaches to security will have to be  adapted in order to cope with issues of scalability and modified timelines.  EU cybersecurity market grows slower than other regions in the world.  In 2016, the EU cybersecurity market was estimated at €20.1bn and compares favourably with the  cybersecurity market of other global regions. The CompoundAnnual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the EU market  however is 6%, whereas the average growth rate is around 8%, and is growing slower than all other major  regions.  We see an increase in monetisation of cyber crime, crime as a service and of targeted attacks.  Targeted attacks, like ransomware, entered the top ENISA 2016 cyber threats. According to the ENISA  Threat landscape, in 2016, ransomware was the primary element for the manifestation of monetization of  the activities of cyber-criminals, with an estimated loss of one billion US $ for the entire year 2016. More  recently, the WannaCry ransomware campaign caused chaos due to its massive distribution, affecting  more than 150 countries and infecting over 230,000 systems. Next to ransomware, information theft is the  main area of ‘malware innovation’ in 2016. Targets affected included political organisations and  democratic institutions.  We become more aware that our rights online and even our democracy are at risk.  The scandal of hacked emails in the US election in 2016 and the measures taken in Europe to prevent  interferences in elections cannot be ignored and are other examples that show us that there is more to be  done to address the continuous changing landscape of threats and challenges in cyber space.  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  03  Small devices, which we sometimes forget are connected to Internet, are used to build very large cyber  attacks affecting targeted businesses and infrastructures. In October 2016, the Mirai botnet  compromised IoT devices and household routers, where cases are documented that life was at risk  because normal emergency telephone calls were not accessible. This raises the question of who is liable in  such events.  Cyber space can be used for sabotage, espionage and warfare.  Hybrid warfare (adding cyberwarfare to conventional and unconventional warfare tools) is evolving  without necessarily using the word ‘war’ in describing the attacks. Some countries are already taking steps  to combat these threats. We see specialized institutions and bodies investing in activities related to  cybersecurity. I would say that  at this time, at least at the institutional level there is a relatively good understanding of the need for strong  cybersecurity. However, given the limited resources and budgets a coordinated approach is required to  make sure we do not fail in our mission. Now it is a good moment to ask ourselves some questions, and  based on the replies to see how we can improve the context and go to the next stage/level of  preparedness and readiness to address the emerging challenges.  Cooperation and exchange of information  In the majority of countries, private companies own critical infrastructure and critical services are provided  by the private sector. Therefore, a high degree of communication and cooperation can be an effective way  for governments to understand the needs and challenges of private companies, but also to ensure that the  necessary measures are implemented to achieve a sufficient degree of cybersecurity. For this reason,  public-private partnership (PPPs), information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) and cyber security  exercises can be an effective tools to ensure that a nation’s essential industries have the best protection  possible.  ENISA has worked towards this direction offering incentives and actual recommendations on how to setup  and run PPPs and ISACs. Moreover, ENISA organises cybersecurity exercises like Cyber Europe, which are  simulations of large-scale cybersecurity incidents that escalate to become cyber crises.  More specifically:   For PPPs, trust has been recognised as the basic element between public and private sector in order to  have the best possible protection between them. PPPs can cover topics like policy making, funding and  collaboration options and best practices on cybersecurity.   For ISACs, open communication and knowledge sharing is the corner stone for building collaboration  between the private sector stakeholders. The government can act as a facilitator bring all key players  together.   Cyber security exercises enable competent authorities to test existing emergency plans, target specific  weaknesses, increase cooperation between different sectors, identify interdependencies, stimulate  improvements in continuity planning, and generate a culture of cooperative effort to boost resilience.  Cyber exercises are important tools to assess preparedness of a community against natural disasters,  technology failures, cyber-attacks and emergencies.  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  04  2. Cybersecurity Taxonomy  Cybersecurity operates on many different levels and one of the functions of the strategy should be to  address coherently all the different levels of cybersecurity needs.  The following image draws on the Maslow’s Pyramid of needs approach to categorising cyber space and  cybersecurity needs in a hierarchical way. Any EU strategy must cover all aspects of the cybersecurity to  ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing the cyber challenges of tomorrow.  Figure 1: Layers of cybersecurity needs.  Figure 1 presents ENISA’s perspective on cybersecurity needs, starting with EU core values at the top, and,  working the way down, to the basic citizens’ needs. The following paragraphs provide a short description  of the pyramid and the layers as cybersecurity requirements.  Layer 1. Basic security protection. Safety and security of citizens in cyber space is not a matter of  debate. Under no circumstances, the safety of users should be at risk due to actions in cyber space.  Furthermore, preventive measures should be applied; education, awareness and cyber hygiene are very  important. As you wash your hands to protect your health, or lock the door of you home to protect your  properties, in the cyber space, you also have to be aware of the risks.  Thus, every user should be aware  and should be using minimum-security protection actions: firewalls, malware detection, apply updates and  patches to safeguard devices and IT systems.  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  05  Layer 2. Critical asset protection. The Network and Information Security (NIS) directive brings new security  requirements for protecting essential services and digital services in the EU. These requirements are the  most recent ones; since past decade, several communications addressed the need for Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). The implementation of NIS directive is an important step in protecting EU  CIIP, the cooperation of CSIRTs via the CSIRTs network, the improvement of EU collaboration via the  Cooperation Group, etc. Secure infrastructures in sectors like energy, transport, banking etc. provide bases  for the society to function and for economy to grow.  Layer 3. Digital single market protection. The cyber space and technology evolution provide many  opportunities for business development. Besides critical infrastructures, all business needs to be protected  as their reliance on cyber space is increasing. The exposure to cyber space related threats like cyber  attacks, cyber crime, cyber sabotage and/or cyber espionage becomes more visible every day and is visible  in media almost daily. Security measures should be deployed and an EU approach is needed to address and  support business in general and SMEs in particular in their cybersecurity needs.  Layer 4. Global stability protection. Espionage and war have millenniums of history. Cyber space  associated terms are already in place; several actions during the past decade were assessed as cyber war,  cyber espionage etc. There are several discussions on the need for cyber norms and cyber diplomacy.  Cyber defence activities are funded and developed across the globe. Given the nature of cyber space,  adequate measures and international agreements need to be in place to guarantee global stability in front  of risks. The EEAS activities, the Tallinn manual, etc. are good examples of activities at this level that need  to be supported and extended.  Layer 5. Democracy and human rights protection. Safety vs security balance is changing in the  global physical world. Some emerging technologies (autonomous vehicles, etc.) – require new discussions  on the ethical aspects. Human rights protection online is not an easy objective to achieve. Protection of  the core EU values online needs to be guaranteed in the cyber space. Impact of new technologies,  products and services needs to be assessed and adequate measures should be in place – i.e. any new  technology should preserve rights, liberties and democracy. There are interdependencies between the  layers described above. Protection of the critical assets, i.e. critical information infrastructures provides a  good base for other businesses, part of the digital single market, to flourish while supporting citizens’  needs as well. Cybersecurity for citizens, infrastructures and business, in current context, cannot be  achieved without addressing the challenges associated with globalisation. In the globalized context, cyber  diplomacy needs to be in place, as well as the means to prevent, defend and protect the EU, its citizens,  infrastructures and businesses. Furthermore, it should be noted that core EU values and norms, ethics,  need to be applied to all levels in the cyber space: to all products and services available for EU customers,  independent of their place of production/development in the world.  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  06  3. EU Legislation  In 2009, the European Commission published the Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure  Protection (CIIP)1. In the following years, COM launched several strategic level documents that address  challenges of the cybersecurity domain:    the EU  Cybersecurity strategy in 2013, introducing a directive on security of network and information  systems;   the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market (eIDAS regulation) in 2014;   the European Agenda on Security2 in 2015, the Digital Market Strategy, and the Directive on payment  services in the internal market (PSD2)3.  In 2016, a Joint Framework on countering hybrid threats was published and the cPPP initiative was  launched.  In 2016 the European Parliament and Council adopted the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR), Law Enforcement Authorities (LEA) data protection Directive, the Passenger Name Records  Directive and the Directive on security of network and information systems (the  NIS Directive).  The NIS Directive is the first piece of legislation at the EU level that addresses network and information  systems and the essential services playing a vital role in society, from ensuring the supply of electricity and  water, to the provision of healthcare and transportation.  These initiatives demonstrate that political  awareness results in political action.  Furthermore, a connected Digital Single Market has been identified as one of the top priorities in the  roadmap for a More United, Stronger and More Democratic European Union. The Cyber-Security package  was announced by the President of the European Commission Mr Jean-Claude Juncker at the State of the  Union letter of intent to the European Parliament on 13 September 2017.4  The Cyber-Security package sets concrete measures to respond to the changed cyber-threats landscape  including:   a proposal to strengthen the EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), including a  proposal to harmonise cybersecurity certification approaches at the European Union level;   an implementation toolkit for the Network and Information Security Directive;   a blueprint for effective response in case of cyber-attacks affecting several Member States;   enhancing the Union's strategic autonomy by boosting research capacity and building effective cyber- defence, cyber-hygiene and the right skills both inside Europe and with partners worldwide, including  NATO.  In addition to the above, it should be noted that several proposals are being discussed between the  European Parliament and the Council that address cybersecurity issues:    Proposal for a regulation Cybersecurity act COM(2017)0447 final/2;  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  2 https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/basic- documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf  3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2366  4 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/letter-of-intent-2017_en.pdf  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/basic-documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/basic-documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2366 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/letter-of-intent-2017_en.pdf  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  07   Proposal for a Directive establishing the European Electronic Communications Code COM/2016/0590  final;   Proposal for ePrivacy Regulation and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC COM(2017)10final;   Proposal for a regulation on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union  COM(2017) 495 final;   Proposal for directive on copyright in the digital single market COM(2016) 593 final.  On the implementation side, the EU agency for Network and Information security (ENISA) was established  in 2004 to support the security of network and information systems across the EU, and its mandate was  renewed in 2009 and 2013 respectively.  Even with its limited resources, of about €11 million/year, ENISA has published and covered nearly every  upcoming topic relevant for cybersecurity and cyber space. Examples of published reports include the  ENISA Threat Landscape, pan European cybersecurity exercises, reports on Smart Airports, Smart cities,  eHealth, to name a few.  It is known that any cyber security incident could have a cross boarder effect on Member States. To  improve preparedness of the EU to cyber attack, in July 2016 the Directive on Security of network and  information systems (the NIS Directive) has been adopted giving Member States 21 months to implement  the Directive into their respective national laws.  The NIS Directive aims to raise levels of the overall  security and resilience of network and information systems across the EU.  In amongst other measures, the NIS Directive requires the EU Member States to adopt and implement a  national strategy on the security of network and information systems (national NIS strategy). On this task,  the Directive requires ENISA to support Member States by providing expertise and advice and by  facilitating the exchange of good practice.  Since 2012 ENISA has supported Member States creating their national NIS strategy through so called  Article 14 requests5 and indirectly through sharing of good practices. ENISA has also developed guidelines  to support the individual objectives of the strategies (the most highly implemented objectives of the EU  strategies are Critical information infrastructure protection, establishing public-private partnerships,  addressing cybercrime, establishing incident reporting mechanisms, organising cyber security exercises,  establishing cyber response capability and engaging in international cooperation).  Currently all 28 MS have a National NIS Strategy. With the adoption of the NIS Directive, many Member  States realised that their strategy needs to be updated to reflect the specific requirements of the Directive.  In September 2017, the European Commission proposed the Cybersecurity act6, a Regulation that aims at  further increasing EU cyber resilience, deterrence and defence. The Regulation proposal, which is currently  under discussion at the Council and the Parliament, builds on two pillars:  1. A permanent and stronger mandate for ENISA to assist Member States in effectively preventing and  responding to cyber-attacks; and  2. The creation of a European cybersecurity certification framework to ensure that cybersecurity  products, services, and possibly processes meet certain cybersecurity requirements.  Further analyses on the new proposal are made available in Chapter 5 of this document.  5 Article 14 of the Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  6 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:0477:FIN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:0477:FIN  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  08  4. Challenges ahead  1. How do we adapt current security approaches to deal with the timescales and scale of deployment  of new technologies such as IoT?  2. Are our human rights respected online? Are we as citizens protected enough?  3. Are our critical infrastructures well prepared for the threats in cyber space?  4. Do we have enough human and financial capacity to address the threats to the digital single market? The  EU’s access to the cybersecurity skills is limited since a shortage of 350.000 professionals have been  reported by the industry.  5. Programs should be put in place, at the earliest opportunity, to prepare and assess the likely impact  of new disruptive technologies. Specific assessments need to be made in respect of each technology  from a technical, political and societal perspective. Following these assessments, the need for new  policies and legislative initiatives needs to be addressed.  European industry, governments and citizens should have access to competitive secure and trustworthy  products and services that allow data and service portability and do not depend on single (monopolistic)  service providers.  6. Member States should further invest in security awareness training and cyber hygiene. This includes  promoting cybersecurity as a career choice in schools and universities, encouraging industry to develop  cybersecurity training schemes that are aligned with established career paths and encouraging the  retraining of adults and long life learning programs in this area.  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  09  5. Cybersecurity act: A proposal to harmonise cybersecurity  certification approaches at the European Union level  Harmonising cybersecurity certification approaches at European level can increase the transparency of  information on the security level of ICT products, processes and services in the digital single market for all  its participants.  The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set  of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will rely on agreement at EU level for the  evaluation of the security properties of specific ICT-based products, services or even processes.  By  undergoing a certification process, we will be able to attest that ICT products and services meet specific  cybersecurity requirements.  The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade  across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of products and services. Should  these cybersecurity requirements are based on internationally accepted standards, the resulting certificate  would also provide a certain level of assurance outside EU.  ENISA is expected to contribute to the emerging EU framework for the certification of products and  services and carry out the drawing up of certification schemes in line with the Cybersecurity Act providing  stakeholders with a sound service that leads to efficiencies and value in the EU.  Under its 2018 programming document7, the Agency seeks to explore how existing schemes could be  transposed to the European cybersecurity certification framework proposal while also collect high-level  requirements for an industry-led lightweight certification scheme or labelling.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-2018-2020  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-2018-2020  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Heraklion Office  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  1 Vasilissis Sofias Str, Maroussi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9711  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu",

The Cyber-Security package  was announced by the President of the European Commission Mr Jean-Claude Juncker at the State of the  Union letter of intent to the European Parliament on 13 September 2017.4  The Cyber-Security package sets concrete measures to respond to the changed cyber-threats landscape  including:   a proposal to strengthen the EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), including a  proposal to harmonise cybersecurity certification approaches at the European Union level;   an implementation toolkit for the Network and Information Security Directive;   a blueprint for effective response in case of cyber-attacks affecting several Member States;   enhancing the Union's strategic autonomy by boosting research capacity and building effective cyber- defence, cyber-hygiene and the right skills both inside Europe and with partners worldwide, including  NATO.  In addition to the above, it should be noted that several proposals are being discussed between the  European Parliament and the Council that address cybersecurity issues:    Proposal for a regulation Cybersecurity act COM(2017)0447 final/2;  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  2 https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/basic- documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf  3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2366  4 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/letter-of-intent-2017_en.pdf  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/basic-documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/basic-documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2366 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/letter-of-intent-2017_en.pdf  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  07   Proposal for a Directive establishing the European Electronic Communications Code COM/2016/0590  final;   Proposal for ePrivacy Regulation and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC COM(2017)10final;   Proposal for a regulation on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union  COM(2017) 495 final;   Proposal for directive on copyright in the digital single market COM(2016) 593 final.  On the implementation side, the EU agency for Network and Information security (ENISA) was established  in 2004 to support the security of network and information systems across the EU, and its mandate was  renewed in 2009 and 2013 respectively.  Even with its limited resources, of about €11 million/year, ENISA has published and covered nearly every  upcoming topic relevant for cybersecurity and cyber space. Examples of published reports include the  ENISA Threat Landscape, pan European cybersecurity exercises, reports on Smart Airports, Smart cities,  eHealth, to name a few.  It is known that any cyber security incident could have a cross boarder effect on Member States. To  improve preparedness of the EU to cyber attack, in July 2016 the Directive on Security of network and  information systems (the NIS Directive) has been adopted giving Member States 21 months to implement  the Directive into their respective national laws.  The NIS Directive aims to raise levels of the overall  security and resilience of network and information systems across the EU.  In amongst other measures, the NIS Directive requires the EU Member States to adopt and implement a  national strategy on the security of network and information systems (national NIS strategy). On this task,  the Directive requires ENISA to support Member States by providing expertise and advice and by  facilitating the exchange of good practice.  Since 2012 ENISA has supported Member States creating their national NIS strategy through so called  Article 14 requests5 and indirectly through sharing of good practices. ENISA has also developed guidelines  to support the individual objectives of the strategies (the most highly implemented objectives of the EU  strategies are Critical information infrastructure protection, establishing public-private partnerships,  addressing cybercrime, establishing incident reporting mechanisms, organising cyber security exercises,  establishing cyber response capability and engaging in international cooperation).  Currently all 28 MS have a National NIS Strategy. With the adoption of the NIS Directive, many Member  States realised that their strategy needs to be updated to reflect the specific requirements of the Directive.  In September 2017, the European Commission proposed the Cybersecurity act6, a Regulation that aims at  further increasing EU cyber resilience, deterrence and defence. The Regulation proposal, which is currently  under discussion at the Council and the Parliament, builds on two pillars:  1. A permanent and stronger mandate for ENISA to assist Member States in effectively preventing and  responding to cyber-attacks; and  2. The creation of a European cybersecurity certification framework to ensure that cybersecurity  products, services, and possibly processes meet certain cybersecurity requirements.  Further analyses on the new proposal are made available in Chapter 5 of this document.  5 Article 14 of the Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  6 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:0477:FIN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:0477:FIN  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  08  4. Challenges ahead  1. How do we adapt current security approaches to deal with the timescales and scale of deployment  of new technologies such as IoT?  2. Are our human rights respected online? Are we as citizens protected enough?  3. Are our critical infrastructures well prepared for the threats in cyber space?  4. Do we have enough human and financial capacity to address the threats to the digital single market? The  EU’s access to the cybersecurity skills is limited since a shortage of 350.000 professionals have been  reported by the industry.  5. Programs should be put in place, at the earliest opportunity, to prepare and assess the likely impact  of new disruptive technologies. Specific assessments need to be made in respect of each technology  from a technical, political and societal perspective. Following these assessments, the need for new  policies and legislative initiatives needs to be addressed.  European industry, governments and citizens should have access to competitive secure and trustworthy  products and services that allow data and service portability and do not depend on single (monopolistic)  service providers.  6. Member States should further invest in security awareness training and cyber hygiene. This includes  promoting cybersecurity as a career choice in schools and universities, encouraging industry to develop  cybersecurity training schemes that are aligned with established career paths and encouraging the  retraining of adults and long life learning programs in this area.  International Perspectives on Cybersecurity  Potsdam, Germany  |  June 2018  09  5. Cybersecurity act: A proposal to harmonise cybersecurity  certification approaches at the European Union level  Harmonising cybersecurity certification approaches at European level can increase the transparency of  information on the security level of ICT products, processes and services in the digital single market for all  its participants.  The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set  of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will rely on agreement at EU level for the  evaluation of the security properties of specific ICT-based products, services or even processes.  By  undergoing a certification process, we will be able to attest that ICT products and services meet specific  cybersecurity requirements.  The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade  across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of products and services. Should  these cybersecurity requirements are based on internationally accepted standards, the resulting certificate  would also provide a certain level of assurance outside EU.  ENISA is expected to contribute to the emerging EU framework for the certification of products and  services and carry out the drawing up of certification schemes in line with the Cybersecurity Act providing  stakeholders with a sound service that leads to efficiencies and value in the EU.  Under its 2018 programming document7, the Agency seeks to explore how existing schemes could be  transposed to the European cybersecurity certification framework proposal while also collect high-level  requirements for an industry-led lightweight certification scheme or labelling.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-2018-2020  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-document-2018-2020  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Heraklion Office  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  1 Vasilissis Sofias Str, Maroussi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9711  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu",

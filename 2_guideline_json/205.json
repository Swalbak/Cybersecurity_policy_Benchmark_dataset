Qualified trust  services (QTS), as defined in the regulation, are the core of the framework establishing trust  between businesses, EU Member States and individuals. Not only has eIDAS established trust  in the EU, but also opened a new market for trust service providers (TSPs). With over 200  companies listed in the EU trusted list of service providers, the market is developing constantly,  changing and adapting to its environment.  Clouds and cloud computing nowadays are a commonly used platform for sharing and storing  data. They can be used for many purposes and are often an inherent part of large, small and  medium-sized enterprises. The benefits of using clouds are flexibility, cost effectiveness, the  easy transfer of data and the availability to extend services as usage grows. In recent years,  TSPs have been moving their services to the cloud in order to take advantage of these benefits.  Many providers have already moved all or parts of their services to the cloud. Cloud providers  have realised their market goals for this transition and conformity assessment bodies (CABs)  are investigating the means to audit trust services from the cloud.  This report includes a detailed analysis on the different technical requirements that must be  addressed considering the relevant standards. It also gives an overview of practical experiences  on the move of trust services to the cloud, based on the results of a survey conducted with over  120 participants. The report finds that there are many existing requirements on the TSP side  that can be considered and potentially applied to cloud service providers (CSPs). The two most  important standards against which conformance is often assessed by CSPs and which have  much in common with the standards for trust services are:  • ISO/IEC 27017: Code of practice for information security controls, based on ISO/IEC  27002 for cloud services;  • ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management systems.  The results of the survey have shown that trust services are moving to the cloud. The findings of  the comparison of standards adopted by CSPs and TSPs in the theoretical part of this report  show that there are mostly minor disparities. The trust services that stakeholders consider most  appropriate to be operated on a cloud are:  • qualified certificates for electronic signature;  • qualified validation for electronic signature;  • qualified certificates for electronic seals;  • provision of revocation status information.  From the audit perspective, the survey results have particularly shown that there is still  insecurity and open questions when it comes to auditing the trust services remotely. While there  are standards which CABs recognise as supporting compliance audits of TSPs providing  services in the cloud (ISO 27017, ISO 27701, EU cloud cyber certification), most CABs think  that the terms and conditions of CSPs contain adequate clauses allowing access for auditors to  (1) https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv %3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  7  perform TSP assessments. While some impediments from the audit perspective exist, the  survey results have shown that CABs can already perform audits on many trust services.  Moving trust services to the cloud must be understood as an ongoing process that has to be  followed step by step. While some services – such as the validation of signatures, registered  delivery, time stamp or signature preservation – are moved rather quickly, other services – such  as the issuance of certificates and remote control over the signing device – require in-depth  analysis and preparation. The transition of data to the cloud has to be secure at all times and, in  the best case, must remain in the data centre of the TSP. Some services might not be suitable  for operation on the cloud. This report gives a detailed overview of the issues to be addressed  for such transitions, along with the related challenges and opportunities.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  8  1. INTRODUCTION TO eIDAS,  TSPs AND THE CLOUD  1.1.  eIDAS TRUST SERVICES  The eIDAS regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market provides a regulatory environment for the electronic identification of natural  and legal persons and a framework for electronic trust services. The regulation repeals Directive  1999/93/EC. Under the eIDAS regulation, it is possible to use trust services and electronic  documents as evidence in legal proceedings across all Member States that contribute to their  cross-border use.  As of 1 July 2016, all provisions relating to trust services of the eIDAS regulation are directly  applicable in the 27 Member States and do not need to be transposed into national law. The  eIDAS regulation facilitates seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses  across Member States and establishes a climate of trust when it comes to online and digital  transactions in the EU.  One objective of this regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust service  provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating their compliance with the eIDAS high-level security  requirements and obligations. A QTSP is a TSP that has been granted a qualified status and is  supervised by its national supervisory body (SB).  Therefore, when a TSP intends to start providing QTS, it shall submit to the SB a notification of  its intention, together with a conformity assessment report issued by an eIDAS-accredited  conformity assessment body (CAB). National accreditation bodies (NAB) contribute to the  quality assurance of the whole process by being responsible to accredit a CAB that will perform  the conformity assessment audits to the TSP.  In June 2021 the European Commission proposed a revision of the eIDAS regulation  (COM/2021/281) (2), also known as eIDAS 2.0, which not only suggests the establishment of a  European digital identity wallet, but also proposes four new QTS: issuing of electronic  attestations of attributes, provision of electronic archiving services, electronic ledgers and  management of remote electronic signature and seal creation devices. eIDAS 2.0 is still under  development and the requirements of these new services have yet to be defined. This report will  focus on the existing technical standards of current eIDAS trust services and will not further  consider the proposed new trust services.  In recent years, TSPs have been interested in moving their services to the cloud for the  mentioned benefits. Many providers have already moved all or parts of their services to the  cloud. Cloud providers have realised their market opportunity for this transition and CABs are  investigating means to audit trust services from the cloud. This report considers the issues  involved in moving to the cloud, both from a theoretical viewpoint based on a comparison of  standards and from a practical viewpoint based on the experiences of stakeholders in this area.

STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  Section 1 of this report introduces the concepts and services provided by TSPs and CSPs. The  other sections cover the following topics.  • Section 2. An analysis of the provisions of security standards commonly adopted by  cloud services compared with the general requirements of standards for trust services.  • Section 3. An analysis of the specific requirements of trust services and their  components against the ability of cloud services to support those requirements.  • Section 4. Consideration of the issues with the evaluation of trust services in the  cloud.  • Section 5. Conclusion of the report.  • Annex. Statistics of the survey.  For this report, a survey for four different stakeholders was conducted. The different  questionnaires were sent out to TSPs, CABs, national authorities / supervisory bodies (NA/SBs)  and providers of solutions to TSPs. In total there were 128 participants. The results will be  referenced throughout this report and analysed in depth in Sections 3 and 4.  1.3.  WHAT IS IN THE CLOUD  Since a few years, clouds have been an inherent part of the digital world. Especially in the  business sector, clouds are used for many different purposes such as sharing and storing data  and developing products and business models. The following will briefly describe the definition  of cloud computing and its general purpose.  1.3.1.  CLOUD COMPUTING  For the definition of cloud computing, this report refers to ISO/IEC 177883, which describes  cloud computing as a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of  shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on  demand. Thus, cloud services are functions offered through cloud computing and used via a  specific interface. In simple terms, cloud computing allows data, services, programs and  applications to be accessed on a device-independent basis over the internet.  A cloud service customer (CSC) is a party in a business relationship for the purpose of using  cloud services. A CSP is the party which makes cloud services available. A cloud service user is  a natural person or a legal entity which acts on behalf of the cloud services customer of cloud  services.  The following sections provide further details on the types of cloud services that can be  provided and their features. This report indicates the applicability of the different types of cloud  services to trust services.  1.3.2.  GENERAL PURPOSE OF CLOUD PLATFORMS  There are many benefits in using cloud platforms. Apart from the data storage aspect described  above, they offer ways to interact and share data with third parties. The data is accessible from  all over the world but, at the same time, data access can be restricted as it would be using  hardware-based storage. A big advantage of using cloud services is that the provider takes over  the physical security and maintenance of the hardware, which leads to savings in costs and  time. In addition, CSPs use a scalable economy model that gives small businesses the  opportunity to obtain better IT solutions at lower prices.  3 At the time of writing, ISO/IEC 17788 was under review and due to be replaced by ISO/IEC 22123-1:2023 and ISO/IEC  FDIS 22123-2 in the course of 2023  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  10  By using cloud services, significant savings can be made in the hardware and software  infrastructure needed to support trust services. Many of the overhead costs in ensuring security  are provided. Furthermore, as the infrastructure requirements of a TSP change, the use of  shared cloud services can be easily adapted to their changing needs.  The following section explores the common provisions of cloud services and the standards  generally adopted by CSPs.  1.4.  USE OF CLOUD SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF TRUST SERVICES  This report analyses the potential of moving QTSs to the cloud. In the eIDAS regulation, nine  types of QTS are mentioned:  • provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures;  • provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals;  • provision of qualified certificates for website authentication;  • qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures;  • qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals;  • qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures;  • qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals;  • qualified time-stamping service;  • qualified electronic registered delivery service (ERDS).  The QTS can be grouped into five main categories:  • issuance of certificates;  • validation of signatures or seals based on those certificates;  • preservation of those signatures or seals;  • time stamps.  ERDS is also performed with the mentioned certificates.  1.4.1.  MAIN CLOUD SERVICE PROVISIONS  In order to provide the basis of the analysis of the use of general cloud service platforms, this  section provides an outline of the services and associated features commonly provided by  CSPs.  This is based on documentation provided online by the major cloud providers offering publicly  available services. Other ways of providing cloud services exist, such as private cloud services,  hybrid public and private cloud services and community-based cloud services. However, when  looking at the move of eIDAS trust services to the cloud, the support for public clouds is  considered to be the most appropriate basis for the analysis. This is where most savings can be  made and the provisions of the public cloud service are aimed at the general needs of an open  community based around open standards, whereas privately operated clouds are aimed at  specific security concerns supporting a closed user community with specific security concerns.  Furthermore, the majority of respondents to the survey used public cloud services.  1.4.1.1. Types of CSPs  (1) Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) Service offering a virtual computing environment  (2) Platform as a service (PaaS). Service offering a platform for developing and running  applications on the cloud.  (3) Software as a service. Service based on applications located in the cloud.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  11  The major CSPs offer infrastructure as a service (IaaS) services using virtual environments that  provide separation between customer software (4). They also offer a range of services to  support the development of websites and customer applications (PaaS), including Kubernetes.  There is a range of different applications that all three types of CSPs support. Finally, CSPs  commonly offer file/object storage and relational and other types of databases to support the  storage of their customers’ data.  Often, CSPs cannot be clearly assigned to one of the abovementioned types. For example,  providers of IaaS services often offer development platforms for applications associated with  PaaS, along with the isolation provided by virtual environments associated with IaaS. Also,  other categories of cloud-based services exist which do not fit neatly into any of these three  main classifications, for example cloud services in support of mobile-based applications.  A cloud service may be operated in the following ways:  (1) As a public cloud service, available to any customer.  (2) As a private cloud service, supporting a specific community of users. With a private  cloud, greater security and integrity may be maintained by prohibiting use outside the  community while sharing the benefits of a cloud service within the user community.  (3) As a hybrid cloud, offering a mixed computing, storage and services environment  made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services and a public cloud.  (4) As a multi-cloud, using multiple cloud services from different vendors. This may be  done to use different providers for different aspects of a user’s service or to use  multiple providers as alternatives to provide the same service, in order to avoid  reliance on a single provider.  1.4.1.2. Security  All of the major CSPs offer a range of tools to support the security of their services, including:  • identity and access management;  • continuous monitoring of the cloud service to defend against external attacks and  ensure compliance with security policy;  • maintenance of audit logs which may be used for monitoring;  • provision of security alerts, event management and incident response;  • network security and firewalls;  • secure web and email services;  • protection of private and other sensitive data, for example using encryption:  o management of cryptographic keys including certificate management,  o public key infrastructure (PKI),  o identity management and authentication services.  Furthermore, most CSPs have settings and configurations defined according to specific  frameworks. This way the customer can choose to apply a specific control (e.g. to comply with  an ISO standard) and the tool will suggest which settings and policies to implement.  1.4.1.3. Hardware security module and key management  A hardware security module (HSM) is a specialised device used to protect cryptographic keys  and support cryptographic functions, such as the creation of digital signatures and encryption.  HSMs are commonly placed in a secure data centre, supporting the cryptographic requirements  of servers through a local network.  (4) Further information about cloud services can be found in the ENISA report Security Aspects in Virtualization,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  12  HSMs are used for trust services to sign statements (e.g. public key certificates) issued by the  TSP.  FIPS 140-2 is an American federal standard for HSMs which is globally accepted as the basis  for demonstrating the security of such devices. FIPS 140-2 identifies three levels of security.  • Level 1. Requires that production-grade equipment and externally tested algorithms be  used.  • Level 2. Requires physical tamper-evidence and role-based authentication for  hardware.  • Level 3. Hardware must feature physical tamper resistance and identity-based  authentication.  In Europe, an alternative standard has been defined for HSMs, the European Committee for  Normalization (CEN) standard EN 419 221-5. This is extended to support remote signing  services in EN 419 241-2.  The major CSPs offer tools for secure management of keys based around HSMs. These are  often provided at two levels.  • General purpose key management tools, which can be based on FIPS 140-2 level 2  HSM or even software-managed keys.  • Customer HSM instances, offering full FIPS 140-2 level 3 isolation of keys between  customers. This can be done using customer-supplied HSMs which are:  o remotely managed by the customer but held in cloud service data centres; or  o ‘single-tenant’ HSMs, which are operated by the CSP but ensure isolation  between use of the HSMs by customers with only a single customer-owned set of  keys in the HSM at any one time.  No public cloud service is known to support the EU standard for HSMs (EN 419 221-5), nor is  there support for the use of HSMs to support remote signing as defined in EN 419 241-2.  Currently, FIPS 140-2 level 3 is accepted but preference is given to EN 419 221-5. For remote  signing at the qualified level, EN 419 241-2 is necessary and this is based on the use of EN 419  221-5 HSM.  1.4.1.4. Time synchronisation  Regarding time synchronisation, some CSPs use a recognised Universal Time Coordinated  (UTC) source with a satellite/GPS source that is linked to atomic clocks. However, many CSPs  do not give a clear statement regarding the synchronisation of time with a recognised UTC time  source.  1.4.1.5. Compliance  The major CSPs comply with several different schemes to ensure different aspects of their  security. These commonly include the following types of conformity assessment schemes.  • ISO/IEC 27001, to certify security management and the use of generally accepted  controls as defined in ISO/IEC 27002.  • ISO/IEC 27017, to certify the application of security controls specifically necessary for  building cloud-based services on ISO/IEC 27002.  • ISO/IEC 27018: General code of practice, to provide data protection such as required  by the general data protection regulation (GDPR).  • ISO/IEC 27701 privacy extension to ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management  and ISO/IEC 27002: Security controls.  • CSA STAR certifications, to meet practices generally considered as required by the  cloud providers.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  13  • Other schemes specifically aimed at the GDPR.  According to the results of the survey, 75 % of the CSPs stated that they already provide or plan  to provide conformity assessments relating to ISO 27017, ISO 27001 and the European  cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services (EUCS) (5).

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  APPLICABLE TO TSPs AND  CSPs  This section provides an overview of the general requirements for TSPs and analyses the  security standards commonly adopted by cloud services.  2.1.  OVERVIEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUST SERVICES  TSPs build their systems and services so that security is ensured, as defined in Article 24(2) of  the eIDAS regulation. Most TSPs base their safety organisation on the implementation of  technical standards defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),  more specifically as defined in ETSI EN 319 401. For the areas of TSP operations and  management, the ETSI EN 319 401 requirements are based on the international standard  ISO/IEC 27002: Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – information security  controls. Policy requirements for specific trust services are also based on requirements defined  in ETSI EN 319 401.  Figure 1: TSP policy requirements  As mentioned in Section 1, trust services can be grouped into different categories. The following  tables show the requirements that apply for the different categories of trust services according  to various ETSI EN standards.  Certificate issuance  All trust services which involve the issuance of public key certificates   Issuance of qualified and non-qualified certificates for electronic  signatures.   Issuance of qualified and non-qualified certificates for electronic seals.   Issuance of qualified and non-qualified certificates for website  authentication.  Requirements for the issuance of certificates are specified in ETSI EN 319 411-1:  Policy requirements for TSPs issuing certificates and ETSI EN 319 411-2: Policy  requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates.  These standards build on the general requirements for trust services specified in  EN 319 401, as described above.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  15  Qualified signature/seal creation device support  The signatory (or creator of the seal) entrusts qualified signature creation  devices (QSCDs) to the care of a third party, provided that appropriate  mechanisms and procedures are implemented to ensure that the signatory (or  creator of the seal) has sole control over the use of their electronic signature /  seal creation data, and that the qualified electronic signature / seal requirements  are met by the use of the device (eIDAS regulation recital 51).  As stated in eIDAS recital 52, in order to ensure that such electronic  signatures/seals receive the same legal recognition as electronic signature/seals  created in an entirely user-managed environment, remote electronic signature  service providers should:  (1) apply specific management and administrative security procedures; and  (2) use trustworthy systems and products.  Regarding the first point, eIDAS requires that the remote electronic signature  creation environment is managed by a QTSP on behalf of the signatory, even if  this type of service is not a QTS per se. The security measures proposed in ETSI  EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN 319 411-2 also apply to QTSPs  providing remote QSCD services. Additionally, ETSI released TS 119 431-1  proposing ‘Policy and security requirements for TSPs; Part 1: TSP service  components operating a remote QSCD/SCDev’.  Concerning the second point, in order to ensure their trustworthiness, systems  and products must implement appropriate technical measures to manage the  risks posed to their security. Annex II of eIDAS made some of these security  measures mandatory and also, pursuant to Articles 30(1) and 39(2) of eIDAS,  made the certification against these security measures mandatory. The security  framework of such systems and products are provided in CEN EN 419 241-2 and  CEN EN 419 221-5.  Time stamps  All trust services issuing qualified and non-qualified time stamps   Time-stamping provision which generates time stamps.   Time-stamping management which monitors and controls the operation  of the time.  Requirements for issuing time stamps are specified in ETSI EN 319 421: Policy  and security requirements for TSPs issuing time stamps.  This standard builds on the general requirements for trust services specified in  EN 319 401, as described in the previous section.  Registered E-delivery services  Delivery of electronic registered mail  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in ETSI EN 319  521: Policy and security requirements for ERDS providers and ETSI EN 319 531:  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  16  Policy and security requirements for registered electronic mail service providers  (REMS).  Following the guidance in EN 319 401 as the general policy requirements for all  types of TSPs, this document sets out general requirements specific for those  TSPs providing ERDS and REMS.  The general requirements for ERDS are stated in EN 319 521 and then extended  for REMS in EN 319 531.  Signature Preservation services  Preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates relating to these  services  Requirements for preservation services as specified in TS 119 511: Policy and  security requirements for TSPs providing long-term preservation of digital  signatures or general data using digital signature techniques.  As with other TSP standards, this document makes reference to requirements in  EN 319 401 for general requirements for TSPs.  Signature validation  Validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps  Security and policy requirements for signature validation services are specified in  ETSI TS 119 441: Policy requirements for TSPs providing signature validation  services.  As with other TSP standards, this document refers to requirements in EN 319  401 for general requirements for TSPs.  2.2.  INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF CLOUD SERVICES  In a cloud computing environment, the main security assets (data and processes) of CSCs are  stored, transmitted and processed by the cloud service. Therefore, CSC information security  depends upon the information security of the CSP. Before entering into supplier relationships  with cloud services providers, CSCs should be able to assess possible gaps between their own  and the providers’ information security systems.  2.2.1.  ISO STANDARDS  • ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management systems. ISO/IEC 27001 provides  requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). The standard is  supported by several standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family. Other standards for the security  of cloud services, including ISO/IEC 27017 and CSA STAR, are built on ISO 27001  • ISO/IEC 27002: Information security controls. This provides a reference set of information  security controls and implementation guidance supporting ISO/IEC 27001. ISO/IEC 27002 is a  basis for requirements defined for TSPs and in the operation clause of ETSI EN 319 401 and  covers all the general areas of security management required for trust services.  • ISO/IEC 27017: Code of practice for information security controls, based on ISO/IEC  27002 for cloud services. This standard provides additional cloud-specific implementation  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  17  guidance for relevant controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002. It also provides new controls with  implementation guidance relating to cloud services and defines a CSP as a supplier under the  ‘supplier relationship’ defined in clause 15 of ISO/IEC 27002. In the standard, requirements  are defined and guidance for both CSPs and CSCs is provided. Both parties should manage  their risk and apply cloud-specific controls. ISO/IEC 27017 requires both CSP and CSC  information management systems to be established and maintained. The standard extends  controls provided by ISO 27002 for both CSPs and CSCs. Some controls are separate and  take into account roles in the information system, while others are common for both CSPs and  CSCs.  Figure 2: ISO standard dependency  Figure 3: CSC and CSP requirements based on ISO/IEC 27017  This standard addresses the following areas:  • asset ownership;  • recovery plans;  • disposal of assets containing sensitive information;  • segregation and storage of data;  • alignment of security management for virtual and physical networks.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  18  Furthermore, it requires establishing a risk management process and refers to guidance in  ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27005. Annex B of the standard presents references on  information security risks related to cloud computing.  • ISO/IEC 27018: Code of practice for protection of personally identifiable information  (PII) in public cloud acting as PII processors. CSPs that process private data of trust  service customers need to operate their services in ways that allow both TSPs and CSPs to  meet the requirements of the GDPR. The requirements and the way in which the requirements  are divided between the CSP and the TSP vary according to legal jurisdictions and the terms  of the contract between them. The purpose of the ISO/IEC 27018 standard, when used in  conjunction with the information security objectives and controls in ISO/IEC 27002, is to  provide a common set of security controls that can be implemented by a public cloud  computing service provider acting as a private data processor. The implementation and  maintenance of ISO/IEC 27018 requirements confirm that users of cloud services keep control  over the use of their data, have information about their geographic location and that personal  data is processed only in accordance with the customer’s requirements. However, it does not  prevent third-country authorities from accessing the data.  Compliance with the standard ensures transparency of the rules for the processing, transfer  and deletion of personal data stored in cloud databases; customer data will be protected and  used only for the purpose approved by the customer. The standard imposes restrictions on  the handling of data transmission and storage on memory media. The standard also indicates  the appropriate data recovery and restoration processes.  • ISO/IEC 27701: Privacy information management. This standard is an extension to the  ISO/IEC 27002 controls and is expected to be audited as part of the ISO 27001 certificate.  Like ISO/IEC 27018, it is concerned with protecting privacy but directed more at the general  management of privacy, rather than controls aimed at PII.  2.2.2.  CLOUD SECURITY ALLIANCE STAR SELF-ASSESSMENT AND  CERTIFICATION  The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR (security, trust, assurance and risk) (6) programme is  dedicated to defining and raising awareness of best practices to help ensure a secure cloud  computing environment. It encompasses three levels of assessment (self-assessment, third- party conformity assessment and continuous auditing) and is specifically geared towards  supporting and evaluating CSPs for two levels of assurance (STAR Level 1 and STAR Level 2).  Third-party conformity assessment is only provided for STAR Level 2. Over 100 CSPs are  certified to STAR Level 2, which builds on existing ISO 27001 (or AICPA SOC2 or Chinese  equivalents) audits, adding cloud-specific controls. ISO 27017 is intended to businesses  moving data to the cloud and/or sharing data in the cloud, including CSPs. STAR is more  comprehensive and targeted at CSPs.  STAR is based on a cloud controls matrix, a cybersecurity control framework for cloud  computing. It is a spreadsheet that lists 16 domains covering all key aspects of cloud  technology. Each domain is broken up into 133 control objectives. It can be used as a tool to  systematically assess cloud implementation, by providing guidance on which security controls  should be implemented by which actor within the cloud supply chain. The controls framework is  aligned to the CSA’s security guidance v4 and is currently considered a de facto standard for  cloud security assurance and compliance.  The domains covered by the cloud controls matrix are:  • application and interface security;  (6) https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/.  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  19  • audit and assurance;  • business continuity management and operational resilience;  • change control and configuration management;  • data security and privacy life cycle management;  • data centre security;  • cryptography, encryption and key management;  • governance, risk management and compliance;  • human resources security;  • identity and access management;  • security infrastructure and virtualisation;  • interoperability and portability;  • universal endpoint management;  • security incident management, e-discovery and cloud forensics;  • supply chain management, transparency and accountability;  • threat and vulnerability management;  • logging and monitoring;  • CSA STAR Level 2 (independent audit).  2.2.3.  EU CLOUD CERTIFICATION SCHEME  In December 2020, ENISA published a draft proposal of a European cybersecurity certification  scheme for cloud services (EUCS) (7). Its aim is to improve the internal market conditions and  enhance the level of security for cloud services and the overall infrastructure around them. The  scheme addresses CSPs, CSCs and regulatory authorities. The scheme proposes three  different assurance levels to describe the level of security required and provided: basic,  substantial and high.  The basic level provides limited assurance that the cloud service is built and operated in  accordance with the procedures and mechanisms that minimise the known basic threats of  incidents and cyberattacks. The aim of the basic level is to ensure that cloud services are  designed to meet common service security requirements for non-critical data and systems.  The substantial level ensures, through the CAB’s assessment, that the cloud service is built and  operated using procedures and mechanisms that minimise known cybersecurity threats and the  risk of incidents and cyberattacks by entities with typical skills and resources. An assessment  covers whether the CSP has assessed this risk and has implemented appropriate controls that,  if operated effectively, minimise this risk and meet the relevant security requirements for a  specified period of time. The substantial level should be appropriate for cloud services designed  to meet common security requirements for business-critical data and systems.  The high level provides reasonable assurance, again through the CAB’s assessment, that the  cloud service is built and operated using procedures and mechanisms that minimise the risk of  advanced cyberattacks by entities with considerable skills and resources. The audit covers  whether the CSP has assessed this risk and has implemented appropriate control measures  that effectively minimise the risk and meet the relevant security requirements for a specified  period. The high level should be appropriate for cloud services designed to meet specific  security requirements for mission-critical data and systems.  All CABs carrying out assessments in the context of EUCS should be accredited to ISO 17065  and meet the additional requirements specified for EUCS. Additional requirements define  several profiles corresponding to different roles in conformity assessment. The technical  competence requirements related to accreditation are sufficient to perform the basic and  (7) For more information on EUCS, visit: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  20  substantial conformity assessments. However, advanced competencies are required to conduct  a conformity assessment for the high level.  2.2.4.  EU GDPR  Two schemes have been defined for conformity assessment against GDPR-based  requirements: the CISPE code of conduct and the EU cloud code of conduct.  Compliance with the CISPE code of conduct (8) is verified by independent, external auditors  accredited as ‘monitoring bodies’ by the competent European data protection authority. These  bodies strengthen the level of assurance provided by services declared under the code. The  code was approved by the European Data Protection Board on 19 May 2021.  The EU cloud code of conduct (9) consists of requirements for CSPs that wish to adhere to the  code and a governance section that is designed to support the effective and transparent  implementation, management and evolution of the code. The code is a voluntary instrument,  allowing a CSP to evaluate and demonstrate its adherence to the code’s requirements, either  through self-evaluation and self-declaration of compliance and/or through a third-party  conformity assessment. The code has been developed to cover GDPR requirements and,  following the positive opinion issued by the European Data Protection Board, was officially  approved by the Belgian data protection authority in May 2021.  2.2.5. NIS 2 DIRECTIVE  The implications of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (the NIS 2 directive) (10) for trust services are still  subject to investigation within ETSI (11). However, the use of cloud services in support of trust  services could have direct implications for European cybersecurity. In particular, if the provision  of cloud services becomes an important part of the supply chain for trust services, this could be  relevant to the national cybersecurity strategy under Article 5 of NIS 2 and may need to be  considered as part of the EU coordinated risk assessments of critical supply chains.

PROVISION OF SPECIFIC  TRUST SERVICES IN THE  CLOUD  This section provides a comparison of the general requirements for trust services (as presented  in Section 2) against the ability of cloud services to support those requirements. This analysis is  summarised in a table that shows the different responsibilities for TSPs and CSPs. In addition, a  more detailed analysis of how to operate trust services in the cloud is given. Therefore, the  requirements of each type of trust service are examined to identify where concerns of the  provisions of CSPs particularly need to be considered. In a last step, practical examples are  given by analysing the results from the survey.  3.1.  COMPARISON OF GENERAL CSP STANDARDS WITH GENERAL TSP  REQUIREMENTS  Section 3.1.1 describes the ISO/IEC 27017 requirements for CSPs and CSCs. The security  model in the standard requires that both parties comply with the requirements. A TSP using  CSP services becomes its client, so it should comply with the requirements for cloud service  clients and use cloud services that are compliant with the ISO/IEC 27017 standard. As a result,  the set of requirements for TSPs using cloud services is a combination of requirements for  TSPs and requirements for CSCs.  Figure 4: Requirements for TSPs, CSCs and CSPs  3.1.1.  INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT  There is much in common between the requirements placed by the application of information  security management standards for CSPs and those required for TSPs. This is particularly  apparent when considering the requirements of ISO/IEC 27017: Code of practice for information  security controls, based on ISO/IEC 27002 for cloud services, against the requirements of ETSI  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  22  EN 319 401: General policy and security requirements for the provision of trust services. A more  detailed depiction can be found in section 3.2 of this report.  Section 3.2 also includes a table specifying the requirements that any TSP/QTSP has to meet  according to the eIDAS regulation and the EN 319 401 standard. The following points are  covered in the table.  • Domains and specific requirements.  • Who is responsible for implementation. It should be noted that the responsibility  towards third parties always lies with the TSP/QTSP and that this section of the table  refers to the division of contractual responsibilities between the TSP/QTSP and its  supplier.  • Controls usually implemented by the CSP. This column lists the controls that large  cloud providers usually have in place. It will depend in each case on the services that  the TSP/QTSP has contracted.  • Activities that have to be carried out by the TSP/QTSP, either by parameterising the  services provided by the CPS or by implementing its own controls.  • Mapping of controls against ISO/IEC 27002.  3.1.2.  PRIVACY  The provision of privacy under the GDPR is not directly addressed by either ISO/IEC 27017 or  EN 319 401. However, for cloud services providers it is commonly addressed through ISO/IEC  27018 or the practices specifically aimed at the GDPR.  Generally, compliance with the GDPR is the responsibility of the TSP. However, if private  information is held in the cloud, there are implications for the CSP. In general, the information  security provisions of CSPs are probably sufficient to meet the requirements of trust services.  However, the legal requirements of the placement of private data outside the control of  countries not recognising the GDPR need to be considered.  3.1.3.  RISK ASSESSMENT AND POLICY AND SECURITY  REQUIREMENTS  In Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, TSPs must take appropriate technical and organisational  measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide.  ENISA has developed guidelines for TSPs focusing on a secure framework (12), discussing the  minimal security levels to be maintained by the TSPs and covering all eIDAS articles where trust  and risks were included in the updated version.  (Q)TSPs are required to provide trust services with the appropriate trust within a secure  framework and manage all potential risks to minimise and mitigate the impact of having security  incidents. This applies to the trust services offered from cloud providers complying with ETSI EN  319 401 and the corresponding policy requirement standard applicable to the trust service.  For the purpose of this document, the risk assessment phases defined in ISO/IEC 27005 are  considered valid for assessing cloud providers, because they take the following into account:  • risk identification: scope, assets, threats and vulnerabilities;  • risk analysis: risk level based on impact;  • risk evaluation.  (12) See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp1-framework.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp1-framework  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  23  CSPs may be reluctant to provide information on the results of their own risk management  regime.  3.2.  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  There is significant overlap between the requirements of CSPs following ISO/IEC 27017 and the  requirements of TSPs, as both are based around ISO/IEC 27002. If private information is to be  placed in the cloud, the implications for legal recognition of any application of privacy controls  outside the EU need to be taken into account.  The following table summarises the existing information security management requirements that  CSPs and TSPs have to fulfil in order to either provide services for TSP or operate trust  services in a cloud. It is important to note that these requirements only address general  scenarios. For a detailed report about the specific requirements that have to be met, each use  case needs to be examined individually. Not all requirements may be necessary for every use  case.

It can be understood as a general guideline or checklist  that must be considered when intending to offer any kind of trust service in the cloud. The table  shows the different responsibilities that TSPs and CSPs have in their roles. However, it does not  provide information on the specific requirements that apply for each of the different categories of  trust services. It also does not give information on how to audit these services. Both aspects will  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  26  be analysed more closely in the following sections of this report. Practical examples from the  survey will be presented, in order to compare and confirm the mentioned requirements with  assessments of stakeholders in this field.  3.3.  OPERATING TRUST SERVICES IN THE CLOUD  The previous section identified the general requirements that apply for the different categories  of trust services. The following section provides an analysis of more specific requirements when  operating trust services in the cloud. Therefore the respective clauses in the standards that  apply will be presented. The section will show where concerns of the provision of CSPs in  particular need to be considered. While the table above gave an overall overview of the general  requirements and responsibilities for TSPs and CSPs, the following section will also look at  specific scenarios for each category of trust services.  3.3.1.  CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE  The following section presents the different requirements that apply for the issuance of  certificates, depending on the individual scenario.  3.3.1.1. General  Practice statements need to clearly state where use is made of third-party services, such as a  CSP. In particular, the TSP practice statement should provide details on whether a CSP is  involved in supporting the use and management of certification authority (CA) keys, for example  using CSP provided HSM or key management software, and should clearly state how this  involves the CSP in supporting key management.  A TSP provides certificates to subscribers and subjects after the subjects’ consent to relying  parties. Additionally, a TSP is required to provide the terms and conditions regarding the use of  the certificate. This could be addressed by the use of CSP cloud storage services and other  services using the cloud for data distribution.  Trust services issuing certificates can be broken down into a number of individual component  services, each with their own specific functions and security requirements. The requirements of  each component in the cloud is considered in its own right.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3 specifies requirements for management of life cycle of certificates:  certificate application, issuance, acceptance, usage, renewal, revocation and suspension.  Under certain conditions, this could be met by a TSP’s own certificate software running on a  CSP IaaS platform. EN 319 411-2 clauses 6.4.1–6.4.6 and 6.4.9 specify requirements for  QTSPs to maintain information covered by audit logs as necessary to meet legal requirements  beyond the termination of the TSP. This follows the requirement of Article 24(2), point (h) of the  eIDAS regulation to record and keep accessible for an appropriate period, including after the  activities of the QTSP have ceased, all relevant information concerning data issued and  received by the QTSP (in particular for the purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings  and for the purpose of ensuring continuity of the service). Such recording may be done  electronically and this needs to be addressed when a TSP operates with the use of CSP.  EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.4.1–6.4.6 specify requirements relating to infrastructure management  related to certificate generation and revocation. This infrastructure should operate in an  environment that protects services from being compromised by unauthorised access to systems  or data. It requires entry control to physically protected zones and registration of entrances and  exits. Clearly defined security zones must be established for certificate generation and  revocation management. Any parts of the premises shared with other organisations shall be  outside the perimeter of the certificate generation and revocation management services. The  standard requires the implementation of physical and environmental security controls to protect  resources. All of these requirements require special treatment when using the CSP. EN 319  50 % of TSPs  already operate  their services on  the cloud or plan  to do so.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  27  411-1 clause 6.4.7 specifies requirements for a TSP to establish data backup and recovery  systems necessary to resume CA operations. A TSP business continuity plan is required to  address the compromise, loss or suspected compromise of a CA private key as a disaster.  These additional requirements need to be addressed when CSP is used. The use of Cloud  Services to provide isolated virtual platforms assure a degree of separation from other web  based services but whether it can provide the same assurance of physical separation requires  further investigation.  EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.5.5–6.5.7 specify requirements relating to computer security and  access control. This requires keeping network components in a physically and logically secure  environment, periodic checks, multifactor authentication and network and systems security.  These topics are covered by EN 319 401, as discussed in Section 2. Additional controls are  required for maintaining and protecting all CA systems in at least a secure zone and  implementing and configuring security procedures that protect systems and communications  between systems inside secure zones and high-security zones. The TSP is required to  configure all systems by removing or disabling all accounts, applications, services, protocols  and ports that are not used in the CA operations. The TSP grants access to secure and high- security zones only to trusted roles. All of these items must be covered by CSP practices and  certifications but may require additional checking.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.7 specifies requirements relating to the establishment of compliance  audits and is subject to assessment. This is addressed in Section 4.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.8 specifies requirements relating to other business and legal matters.  Privacy requirements should be met by the appropriate certification (ISO/IEC 27018, ISO/IEC  27701, GDPR).  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.9 specifies requirements relating to other provisions. The parts of the  TSP concerned with certificate generation and revocation management are required to be  independent of other organisations for its decisions relating to the establishing, provisioning and  maintaining and suspending of services in conformance with the applicable certificate policies.  These requirements are a matter for the TSP business operations.  3.3.1.2. Trust service component specific requirements  In order to more effectively further analyse the requirements of trust services and how they can  be met, other requirement for the issuance of certificates must be considered in relation to  component services. ETSI EN 319 411-1 and EN 319 411-2 for the provisioning of (qualified)  certificates provide an example of how to break down the whole trust service into different  component services (Figure 2).  • Registration service. Verifies the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a  subject. The results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service.  • Certificate generation service. Creates and signs certificates based on the identity  and other attributes verified by the registration service. This can include key  generation.  • Dissemination service. Disseminates certificates to subjects and, if the subject  consents, makes them available to relying parties.  • Revocation management service. Processes requests and reports relating to  revocation to determine the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service  are distributed through the revocation status service.  • Revocation status service. Provides certificate revocation status information to  relying parties.  • Subject device provision service (optional). Prepares and provides, or simply  provides, secure cryptographic devices or other secure devices to subjects.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  28  Figure 5: Different components needed for the provision of issuing certificates  These components or assets are also applicable to cloud providers, as they also use HSMs to  manage keys and need to allow access to those keys to specific people or roles who run a  specific software following a specific document. That means that the corresponding security  requirements and risks assessments that must be performed on local providers are also valid  for cloud providers. The assets to be protected are the same as the risks posed in every asset.  An additional important trust service component, which in future revisions of eIDAS could be  considered as a trust service itself, is the management of a remote signature / seal creation  device (QSCD) which provides the secure basis of remote signing service. In this service, the  user’s signing key is secured using an HSM under the remote control of an authenticated user  to provide a remote QSCD.  • Registration services. The registration of customers is an important part of several trust  services, notably for TSPs issuing certificates under EN 319 411-1 clause 6.2, and registered  electronic delivery services and REMS as defined in clause 5.2 of EN 319 521 and EN 319  531 respectively.  The registration requirements can be further detailed using TS 119 461: Policy and security  requirements for trust service components providing identity proofing of trust service subjects.  TS 119 461 gives policy and security requirements for trust service components providing  identity proofing of trust service subjects. Such identity proofing can be provided by the TSP  itself as an integral part of the trust service, or by a specialised identity proofing service  provider acting as a subcontractor to the TSP.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  29  Registration requirements could be met by a TSP’s own registration software running on a  CSP platform (IaaS, PaaS – see Section 1.4.1). Where such services bind an authentication  means to the registration, special attention needs to be given to any authentication services  provided by the CSP, to ensure that they match the assurance requirements for electronic  identification, such as defined in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) CIR 2015/1502.  The functionality of registration services is the responsibility of the TSP.  • Subject device provision service. In EN 319 411-1, subject device provisioning is  considered to be part of registration and identity proofing, as specified in clause 6.2.2.  Provisioning of user signing devices is part of the operation of the registration service under  control of the TSP outside the cloud services.  EN 319 411-2 clause 6.3 gives specific requirements for the issuance of qualified certificates  when the QSCD is managed for the subject. In this case, the private key must not be used for  signing, except within a QSCD and only under the subject’s sole control. Generally, this is the  responsibility of the TSP.  The management of a remote signature / seal creation device (QSCD), while it may be  considered as a special case of subject device provisioning, is addressed as a separate trust  service below.  • Certificate generation. EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.3.1–6.3.8 cover the general requirements for  generating certificates, including issuance, renewal, re-key and modification. In addition, when  a certificate is issued, it has to be signed by the TSP using a key managed in an HSM in  accordance with clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4.  The requirements covered in EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.3.1–6.3.9 are generally covered by the  TSP software.  EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4 specify requirements relating to key pair generation. The  subsequent certification of the public key shall be undertaken in a physically secure  environment by personnel in trusted roles. The key pair used for signing certificates shall be  created under at least dual control. The number of personnel authorised to carry out CA key  pair generation must be kept to a minimum. These requirements cannot be addressed by  using a ‘shared HSM’ provided by the CSP. If a single-tenant HSM is provided by the CSP,  checks will need to be made to ensure that these requirements are met, in particular regarding  aspects that require at least dual control by trusted personnel. CSPs generally only support  FIPS 140-2 level 3 HSMs and preference is given to the European standard EN 419 221-5.  The use by CSPs of FIPS 140-2 level 2 HSM is not sufficient for most trust services.  • Revocation management. Requirements for revocation (and suspension) management are  specified in EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3.9 and EN 319 411-2 clause 6.3.9. The requirements for  revocation management in these clauses are generally procedural and can be implemented  by the TSP. As long as the CSP provides true separation of uses and secure management of  code, this is the responsibility of the TSP.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.6 specifies requirements relating to profiles of certificates, certificate  revocation lists and Online Certificate Status Protocols (OCSPs). The profile is a matter of  configuring the TSP’s own certificate software.  • Certificate revocation status service. EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3.10 specifies requirements  for providing information on the revocation status of certificates, using certificate revocation  lists or OCSPs. In addition, when issuing information on certificate status, this has to be  signed by the TSP using a key managed in an HSM in accordance with clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  30  ETSI EN 319 411-2 in section 6.3.10 also adds additional requirements for qualified  certificates which are eIDAS compliant.  The requirements specified in EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3.10 are generally procedural and can  be implemented by the TSP. As long as the CSP provides true separation of uses and secure  management of code, this is a responsibility of the TSP.  The requirements for managing the TSP keys in accordance with clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4 cannot  be addressed by using a shared HSM provided by the CSP. This requires at least an HSM  provided by the TSP, hosted by the CSP and with remote HSM management. If a single- tenant HSM is provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to ensure that these  requirements are met, in particular regarding aspects that require at least dual control by  trusted personnel.  3.3.1.3. TSP issuing certificates – general conclusions  Most of the aspects of these policy requirements are likely to be met by CSPs, particularly those  offering a virtual infrastructure (IaaS – see Section 1.4.1). Nevertheless, before this can be  confirmed, detailed checks on provisions of a particular CSP against the EN 319 411-1 and EN  319 411-2 policy requirements are required. The use of cryptographic services and HSMs  require particular attention. The assurance of dual control of the management of the TSP  signing keys held in an HSM is a particular concern. This is best met using a TSP-provided  HSM, where the keys are managed remotely by the TSP personnel. Detailed investigation of  the provision of some CSPs called single-tenant HSMs is necessary to see whether this  provides the appropriate level of control of the TSP’s signing keys.  3.3.2.  REMOTE SIGNING SERVICE USING CLOUD SERVICES  Two critical elements of the remote signing service are: (i) the use of a specialised HSM, which  ensures that the use of the signing key is, with a high level of confidentiality, under the control of  the signatory; and (ii) the means used for authentication and identification of the signer. For the  signing device to be considered as a remote QSCD, the signature activation module in the  specialised secure devices (e.g. an HSM) has to be certified under EN 419 241-2 and EN 419  221-5. This device has to be under the direct control of the TSP. Thus, it is not considered that  this service could be provided by a CSP, unless very special arrangements are made to give the  TSP sole control of the specialised HSM device.  The authentication and identification means are required to meet the requirements specified in  Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 at a ‘substantial’ or ‘high’ level. Thus, unless the CSP  can demonstrate that their authentication meets these requirements, specific steps have to be  taken by the TSP to meet this regulatory requirement.  3.3.3. TIME STAMPING  EN 319 421 clause 5 specifies requirements related to a time stamp policy called ‘best practices  time-stamp policy for TSAs issuing time stamps’. This policy is supported by public key  certificates. The policies and general requirements deal mainly with matters relating to TSP  management of policies outside the scope of a CSP. A time-stamping service provider is  required to manage their own practice statement. The general requirements for policy  management are outside the scope of the CSP. The certification practice statement needs to  cover the practice statement requirements defined in EN 319 401 and identify the obligations of  all external organisations supporting the TSP services, including the applicable policies and  practices.  EN 319 421 clauses 7.6.2 and 7.6.3 specify requirements relating to time-stamping unit (TSU)  key generation and key protection. Provision of time-stamping services requires the use of  HSMs with keys generated by trusted personnel under dual control. If a single-tenant HSM is  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  31  provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to ensure these requirements are met, in  particular regarding aspects that require at least dual control by trusted personnel.  EN 319 421 clause 7.6.6 specifies requirements relating to specific controls over life cycle  management of signing cryptographic hardware. This ensures that the HSM is shipped, stored  and retired securely. If a TSP-provided HSM is not a CSP issue but for single-tenant HSMs,  checks will need to be made on the CSP procedures for the management of HSMs. This also  includes requirements for dual control of activation of the TSU key, which require particular  checks, as for key generation (see clause 7.6.2 above).  EN 319 421 clause 7.6.7 specifies requirements relating to the expiration date of TSU keys.  This generally concerns management of the TSU key lifetime, which is a TSP issue. However, it  also includes requirements for the destruction of private signing keys at the end of lifetime,  which would require specific checks on CSP operations in the case of single-tenant HSMs.  EN 319 421 clause 7.7 specifies requirements relating to TSU time issuance and clock  synchronisation with UTC within 1 second. The time stamps are required to be issued securely  and include the correct time. Time stamps are required to conform to the time-stamp profile as  defined in ETSI EN 319 422. Apart from the use of a compliant time-stamp profile, this is  concerned with ensuring synchronisation of time with UTC. This should be possible with most  CSPs but requires specific checks on the tracing of time synchronisation back to a trusted UTC  source.  EN 319 421 clause 7.8 specifies requirements relating to physical security. The time-stamping  management facilities are required to be operated in an environment which physically and  logically protects the services from compromise through unauthorised access to systems or  data. Every entry to the physically secure area has to be authorised and logged. Physical  protection is achieved through the creation of clearly defined security perimeters around the  time-stamping management facilities. Any parts of the premises shared with other organisations  have to be outside this perimeter. Physical and environmental security controls have to protect  the facility that houses system resources, the system resources themselves and the facilities  used to support their operation. The TSA’s physical and environmental security policy for  systems concerned with time-stamping management has to address, at a minimum, physical  access control, natural disaster protection, fire safety factors, failure of supporting utilities (e.g.  power, telecommunications), structure collapse, plumbing leaks, protection against theft,  breaking and entering and disaster recovery. Controls must protect against equipment,  information, media and software relating to the time-stamping services being taken off-site  without authorisation. All of this needs to be covered by CSP statements of practice and  conformity assessment. The use of Cloud Services to provide isolated virtual platforms assure a  degree of separation from other web based services but whether it can provide the same  assurance of physical separation requires further investigation.  EN 319 421 clause 7.9 specifies requirements relating to system planning, as part of  operational security. Capacity demand is required to be monitored and projections of future  capacity requirements must be made, to ensure that adequate processing power and storage  are available. Those requirements need specific checks on CSP operations.  EN 319 421 clause 7.10 specifies requirements relating to maintenance and protection of all  TSU systems in a secure zone. Configurations of all TSU systems require removing or disabling  all accounts, applications, services, protocols and ports that are not used in the TSA’s  operations. Only trusted roles are allowed to access secure zones and high-security zones. All  this must be covered by CSP practices and certifications but may require additional checking.  EN 319 421 clause 7.12 specifies requirements relating to the collection of evidence. Following  requirements in EN 319 401, the TSP is required to record and keep accessible for an  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  32  appropriate period of time, including after the activities of the TSP have ceased, all relevant  information concerning data issued and received by the TSP. On top of general controls, EN  319 421 specifies requirements to record all relevant information concerning all events relating  to the life cycles of TSU keys and TSU certificates. Additionally, all events relating to the  synchronisation of a TSU’s clock to UTC and the detection of loss of synchronisation is required  to be logged. If a CSP provides services related to securing event logs, this requires special  treatment in relevant policies and agreements.  EN 319 421 clause 7.13 specifies requirements relating to business continuity. The TSA  disaster recovery plan should include a violation or suspected violation of TSU private signing  keys or loss of TSU clock calibration that may have affected the issued time stamps. In the  event of compromise or suspected compromise or loss of calibration when issuing a time stamp,  the TSA must provide all subscribers and relying parties with a description of the compromise.  This includes specific requirements for handling compromises, which would be managed by the  TSP.  EN 319 421 clause 7.14 specifies requirements relating to termination of the service. The TSA  is required to revoke the TSU’s certificates. Specific requirements for revocation of certificates  can be a matter for the TSP.  3.3.4.  E-DELIVERY SERVICES  EN 319 521 clause 4 specifies requirements relating to general provisions on policies and  practices, which build on EN 319 401 (general requirements for trust service practices and  policies). The practice statement and policy are managed by the TSP and hence outside the  scope of the CSP. However, the practice statement needs to clearly state where use is made of  third-party services such as a CSP. The ERDS practice statement includes a description of how  the ERDS provision ensures the security of transmission against any risk of loss, theft, damage  or any unauthorised alterations, and that it needs to involve the CSP if applicable.  EN 319 521 clause 5.1 specifies requirements relating to content integrity and confidentiality,  including the use of digital signatures or other mechanisms to protect content. The TSP protects  the integrity of user content and associated metadata in transmissions, especially when  exchanged with the sender/recipient or between distributed ERDS system components, and in  storage. This should be generally met by security and privacy controls of the CSP, although  checks will be needed against the specific requirements.  EN 319 521 clause 5.2 specifies requirements relating to user Identification and authentication.  This generally concerns identity checks on the ERDS/REMS user and user authentication. If the  identification of the recipient for the qualified service is based on an internal process, the TSP  conducts the whole process in a secured and controlled environment; the TSP gathers and  protects all evidence of identification and consignment or handover process. This is mainly  covered by the TSP software, hardware and procedures, but specific checks will be necessary  according to provision by the CSP of the environment and protection of evidence.  EN 319 521 clause 5.3 specifies requirements relating to time reference. In the case of a  qualified service, a qualified time stamp must be used, which is a matter for the TSP. Otherwise,  no specific requirements on time synchronisation are stated for non-qualified services.  EN 319 521 clause 5.4 specifies requirements relating to events and evidence and specifies the  information to be recorded relating to events, which is a matter for the TSP. It also requires the  CSP to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability logs, which are important for checking  the CSP against privacy and security controls (see also EN 319 421 clause 7.10).  EN 319 521 clause 5.5 specifies requirements relating to interoperability. This is a matter for the  TSP-provided software.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  33  EN 319 521 clause 6 specifies requirements relating to risk assessment and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401.  EN 319 521 clauses 7.1–7.4 specify requirements relating to organisation, human resources,  asset management and access control. These requirements are covered by general EN 319  401 requirements, with the addition of specific TSP procedures.  EN 319 521 clause 7.5 specifies requirements relating to cryptographic controls. It requires the  use of a secure cryptographic device but does not require the use of a certified HSM. If CSP  cryptographic services are used, these will need to be checked against the specific  requirements. In particular, there is a requirement for dual control of trusted persons for backup,  storage and recovery of the service provider’s private signing keys.  EN 319 521 clause 7.6 specifies requirements relating to physical and environmental security  and addresses physical access control, natural disaster protection, fire safety factors, failure of  supporting utilities, structure collapse, plumbing leaks, protection against theft, breaking and  entering and disaster recovery. The TSP is required to implement controls to protect against  equipment, information, media and software relating to the provision of the ERDS being taken  off-site without authorisation. Additionally, the TSP is required to protect facility housing system  resources, the system resources themselves and the facilities used to support their operation.  All this must be covered by CSP practices and certifications but may require additional  checking.  EN 319 521 clause 7.7 specifies requirements relating to operational security and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401.  EN 319 521 clause 7.8 specifies requirements relating to network security, which follow the  requirements of EN 319 401. In addition, the clause requires projections of future capacity  requirements to ensure that adequate processing power and storage are available. The TSP is  also required to use state-of-the-art protocols and algorithms for encryption on the transport  layer level. Additional requirements would need to be checked but are expected to be  addressed by general CSP provisions.  EN 319 521 clause 7.9 specifies requirements relating to incident management and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401.  EN 319 521 clause 7.10 specifies requirements relating to collection of evidence. The TSP is  required to log all security events, including changes relating to the security policy, system start- up and shutdown, system crashes and hardware failures, firewall and router activities and PKI  system access attempts. The TSP is also required to define at least a 2-year retention period for  security logs. Specific requirements are the responsibility of the TSP, but CSP practices may  require additional checking.  EN 319 521 clause 7.11 specifies requirements relating to business continuity and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401. There are specific requirements for backup and storage in safe  places that are suitable to allow the TSP to quickly return to operations in case of  incidents/disasters. The TSP is required to provide adequate recovery facilities to ensure that all  essential information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure and to  set up regular tests to ensure that the facilities meet the requirements of business continuity  plans. If a CSP is involved in providing facilities enabling business continuity, the CSP practices  may require additional checking.  EN 319 521 clause 7.12 specifies requirements relating to termination plans and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401. Additional requirements to keep the collected evidence for the  national statutory time may need to be implemented by the TSP software.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  34  Most of the aspects of these policy requirements are likely to be met by CSPs, particularly those  offering a virtual infrastructure (IaaS). Nevertheless, before this can be confirmed, detailed  checks on provisions of a particular CSP against the EN 319 521 policy requirements are  required. The use of cryptographic services and HSMs requires particular attention, but the  standard does not impose any requirements on the certification of HSMs.  3.3.5.  SIGNATURE PRESERVATION SERVICES  ETSI TS 119 511 clauses 5 and 6 specify requirements for risk analysis and management of the  policies and practices of TSPs. These are outside the scope of the CSP.  Much of ETSI TS 119 441-clause 7 (other than clause 7.5 on cryptographic controls) includes  general requirements on the operation of the validation service, building on EN 319 401. This  would be generally covered by the CSP’s practices and certifications, but checks would be  necessary against the requirements of the TSP, as applied to the validation services.  EN 319 421 clause 7.5 on cryptographic controls provides requirements for the time-stamping  authority that is used in support of preservation services. Thus, the assessment given in  Section 3.3.3 applies to this aspect of preservation services. In the case that the preservation  service signs preservation evidence, as with other TSP cryptographic services issuing signed  data, these requirements cannot be addressed by using a shared HSM provided by the CSP. If  a single-tenant HSM is provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to ensure these  requirements are met, especially regarding aspects that require at least dual control by trusted  personnel.  3.3.6.  SIGNATURE VALIDATION  ETSI TS 119 441 clauses 5 and 6 specify requirements for risk analysis and management of the  policies and practices of TSPs. These are outside the scope of the CSP.  Much of ETSI TS 119 441 clause 7 (other than clause 7.5 on cryptographic controls) include  general requirements on the operation of the validation service, building on EN 319 401. This  would be generally covered by the CSPs practices and certifications, but checks would be  necessary against the requirements of the TSP as applied to the validation services.  ETSI TS 119 441 clause 7.5 includes similar requirements on the cryptographic controls applied  to the signing of validation reports. As with other TSP cryptographic services issuing signed  data, these requirements cannot be addressed by using a shared HSM provided by the CSP.  This requires at least an HSM provided by the TSP, hosted by the CSP and with remote HSM  management. If a single-tenant HSM is provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to  ensure these requirements are met, regarding aspects that require at least dual control by  trusted personnel.  The technical requirements in ETSI TS 119 441 clause 8 specify requirements on the operation  of the validation service in a correct manner, aligned with the referenced standards. Provided  that the CSP provides true separation of uses and secure management of code, this is just a  concern of the TSP.  3.4.  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES  The previous sections analysed multiple standards for the move of trust services to the cloud. A  detailed overview was given on the requirements that both sides (TSP and CSP) have to fulfil in  order to implement the services on a cloud platform. The following section presents practical  experiences and considerations of TSPs, CSPs, NA/SBs, CABs and providers of solutions to  TSPs regarding the transition of trust services to the cloud. The findings come from a survey  that was conducted during the creation of this report, with over 120 participants from over 29  countries in the EU and globally.  Survey details  Participation of over  120 stakeholders  from over 29  countries in the EU  and globally.  50 % of the TSPs  that participated in  the survey already  operate or plan to  operate at least parts  of their trust services  in the cloud.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  35  The survey results have shown that there is a high interest in operating trust services in the  cloud. 50 % of the TSPs who participated in the survey already operate or plan to operate at  least parts of their trust services in the cloud. This number clearly shows that TSPs are moving  their services to the cloud. In comparison, only 12 % stated that they do not consider it at all.  This trend is also reflected in the responses from the NA/SBs: 39 % of them have stated that  they have direct experience with TSPs operating their services on a cloud. From the perspective  of NA/SBs, the use of trust services on a cloud has already been adopted to a large extent.  11 % stated that TSPs have asked them to consider TSPs using cloud services. 15 % of the  NA/SBs do not see the move of trust services to the cloud as a requirement or do not consider it  practical.  In the following section, a detailed analysis of the survey results will be given. TSPs and  solution providers to TSPs were the most represented stakeholder group in the survey results.  Together they made up more 75 % of the respondents. For the analysis of the results this has  no impact, as each stakeholder received their respective survey. In total, five different  questionnaires were created. The results were analysed individually and put into context where  appropriate, as the following section will show.  Figure 6: Types of stakeholders that participated in the survey  All stakeholders were asked which trust services could in their opinion be operated on the  cloud. TSPs and technical solution providers had different response options due to their  differing offer in services. Furthermore, the CABs were asked about the possibility of an audit of  the services, which will be further discussed in Section 4. The following table shows the services  that were mostly chosen by TSPs, NA/SBs and CSPs.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  36  Figure 7: Trust services that are mostly considered to be operated on a cloud platform by  TSPs, NA/SBs and CSPs  The figure shows that there are some differences among the TSPs, NA/SBs and CSPs. The  revocation status information and the preservation of seals and signatures were not considered  at all by CSPs. The survey also contained many more response options that were selected in  lower percentages.  It is noticeable that services such as time stamping or e-delivery are not among the most  chosen services. As explained in earlier sections, the necessary requirements and standards to  operate these services on the cloud already exist. However, when comparing the overall  services offered by TSPs according to the EU trusted list, neither of them are usually in the  portfolio of trust services.  We can say that the results reflect the current landscape of services that TSPs usually offer.  The management of user keys is the service mostly chosen by CSPs, whereas NA/SBs  consider this less likely to be operated on the cloud. Apart from the management of user keys,  qualified time stamps, qualified electronic signatures and validation services were each chosen  equally by 50 % of the providers that participated in the survey.  As mentioned above, the services offered by technical solution providers differ from those  offered by TSPs, which is why the results will be presented in a separate figure. The survey  showed that 48 % of the solution providers to TSPs already provide solutions for trust services  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  37  on a cloud platform and another 24 % plan to do so. In comparison, 16 % stated that they do  not consider providing solutions for TSPs on a cloud platform. All results can be found in the  Annex of this report.  The figure below shows the solutions or parts of solutions that could be placed on a cloud  platform.  Figure 8: Solutions mostly chosen to be operated on a cloud platform by technical solution  providers  When asked about the specific elements of the solutions that could be placed in the cloud,  event logs, data, backups and access control were the most selected responses. With regards  to trust services, the providers were asked to state the PKI-related parts of their solution that  could be placed in the cloud. Signature validation and a shared PKI service were selected most  often. Apart from that, time stamping, signature creation, revocation and certificate issuance  and renewal were the most chosen services. This assessment is consistent with the responses  from the trust services and NA/SBs.  In Section 1, the main cloud service provisions were described. The following figure illustrates  the preferred type of cloud by TSPs.  Figure 9: Preferred type of cloud by TSPs  While big global providers are most dominant in the market, the preference for a local cloud  solution is comparably high. Depending on security and infrastructure measures, some services  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  38  require a localised HSM under the control of a TSP. Thus, when it comes to the type of cloud  that is preferred by TSPs, many of them chose a hybrid solution of public and local clouds.  Some CSPs see perceived regulatory obstacles for cloud services from Member States. Most  CSPs support international certifications, which in their view are better suited to ensure  customer and CSP security needs.  The following figure illustrates the adoption of the main standards by CSPs identified in  Section 2.3. The ‘Other’ option includes global and regional certifications. The numbers show  the percentages of CSPs stating that they had adopted or planned to adopt the respective  standards.  Figure 10: Security and privacy standards that CSPs have adopted or plan to adopt in the  future  Before having a closer look at the benefits of moving trust services to the cloud, the  impediments that were mentioned by the survey participants will be presented. When  implementing eIDAS trust services in a cloud or when intending to do so, compliance with EU  standards in particular is crucial. CSPs that have implemented the transition have experienced  a lack of appropriately conformity-assessed CSPs. Fulfilling the requirements of ETSI EN 319  401 is a core precondition. This result goes along with the earlier sections describing  requirements for CSPs. One of the main reasons as to why coherence with EU standards is so  important is the set of auditing requirements. In Section 4, further details on the evaluation of  trust services in the cloud will be given.  Apart from the audit, the security requirements of the CSPs might not match those of some  Member States (such as Italy). Typical cloud providers offer ‘basic’ security whereas TSPs need  ‘high’ levels to fulfil eIDAS requirements. Apart from the defined security requirements, other  measures that go along with the security concept of the providers might differ, which can lead to  a lack in transparency, for example regarding the geographic positioning of services and related  data centres.  The considerations and possible impediments that have been stated by solution providers  mainly refer to the risk of non-EU entities accessing data and processes that are operated in a  cloud. The lack of standardisation for clouds could lead to privacy and security-related  problems.  From the perspective of NA/SBs, the increase in complexity, the loss of control of information  (user information, privacy, GDPR) and a potential lack of knowledge about how to handle these  trust services were all stated as possible impediments or reasons to not use trust services  operated in the cloud. However, its practical use is recognised.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  39  Figure 11: Impediments mentioned by TSPs, TSP solution providers, NA/SBs and CABs  While there are still some hurdles and open questions regarding trust services in the cloud, the  numbers clearly show a trend towards this transition. There are several benefits in providing  trust services or components in the cloud. The flexibility of choice of the platform is one of them.  This implies greater scalability and adaptation to changing environments. Another benefit is the  cost-saving aspect that results in flexibility. A TSP can easily change to another CSP. Another  big advantage of using cloud services is the set of recovery services and backup systems that  can work from the same CSP or from another CSP. Changes in structure, system or languages  are thus implemented quicker and more safely.  Figure 12: Benefits mentioned by TSPs, TSP solution providers, NA/SBs and CABs  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  40  All of these benefits can lead to an extension of services, as there is growth in usage. Moving  trust services to the cloud can thus help achieve business objectives and play an important role  in their success.  3.5.  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  Most of the aspects of the policy requirements for the trust services considered in this section  are likely to be met by CSPs, particularly those offering a virtual infrastructure (IaaS – see  Section 1.4.1). Nevertheless, before this can be confirmed, detailed checks on provisions of a  particular CSP against the specific policy requirements of the particular trust services to be  supported are required.  The use of cryptographic services and HSMs requires particular attention. The assurance of  dual control of the management of the TSP signing keys held in an HSM is a particular concern.  This is best met using a TSP-provided HSM, where the keys are managed remotely by the TSP  personnel. Detailed investigation of the provision of some CSPs called single-tenant HSMs is  necessary to see whether this provides the appropriate level of control of the TSP signing keys.  CSPs generally only support FIPS 140-2 level 3 HSMs and preference is given to the European  standard EN 419 221-5. The use by CSPs of FIPS 140-2 level 2 HSM is not sufficient for most  trust services.  Certificate generation and revocation management services, and time-stamping services are  required to use security zones and to be physically isolated from any other organisation's  services.  It remains to be seen whether the same security isolation can be achieved using  virtual platforms provided by cloud services.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  41  4. EVALUATION OF TRUST  SERVICES IN THE CLOUD  This section considers the issues with the evaluation and audit of trust services in the cloud.  4.1.  ACCREDITATION AND CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT SCHEME  UNDER eIDAS  A key policy choice made by the eIDAS regulation is that in order to be granted a qualified  status by a national supervisory authority, TSPs must first demonstrate that they and the QTSs  they plan to provide meet the functional requirements of the regulation. This implies that TSPs  and the QTSs they intend to provide need to undergo a specific process and receive approval  from a competent national SB to attest to their conformity with the requirements. If successful,  this process leads to their inclusion in the national trusted list attesting their qualified status.  As part of this process, the prospective QTSP/QTS must be audited by an eIDAS-accredited  CAB to confirm, through a conformity assessment (audit) report, that they meet the  requirements of the eIDAS regulation. The CAB needs to be accredited by an NAB in line with  Regulation (EU) 765/2008, based on a suitable eIDAS conformity assessment scheme and the  CAB’s competence for assessing the compliance QTSPs and the QTSs they provide (hereafter  QTSPs/QTSs) with the eIDAS requirements.  The requirements on the CAB and the conformity assessment report referred to in Articles 20(1)  and 21(1) are further specified by Article 3(18) of the eIDAS regulation. Article 20(1) of the  eIDAS regulation requires that ‘the purpose of the audit shall be to confirm that the [QTSP] and  the [QTS] provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in this Regulation.’ Consequently,  the resulting conformity assessment report must include a formal conformity statement  confirming, when applicable, that the audited QTSP/QTS meets all of the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS regulation.  The accreditation of the CAB under eIDAS must ensure that the conformity assessment  activities used by such an independent body are such that there is a justifiable trust that the  QTSPs/QTSs meet the requirements laid down in the eIDAS regulation.  Neither the business nor the technical model can be imposed upon the QTSPs, nor a specific  standard to be followed for the QTS it provides. (Q)TSP/(Q)TS have to demonstrate their  compliance (building upon standards if it is deemed appropriate) with the requirements of the  eIDAS regulation, while the SB cannot refuse to grant the qualified status solely on the grounds  that the proposed model does not comply with a given standard or a given business or technical  model. However, in practical terms, supervisory and accreditation authorities have built the  scheme on the ETSI standards referred to above.  When using cloud services in support of a trust service the overall conformity assessment of the  trust service(s) is the responsibility of the trust service provider.  Inevitably there will be aspects  of the trust service, such as management of the operation of the trust service by trusted  personnel, which will not be met by the CSP.  It is the responsibility of the TSP to provide its  auditor with evidence that it meets all the operational and technical requirements of the trust  service.  This will require the TSP to provide evidence that requirements of the services of the  CSP, on which the TSP depends, are met for example by the CSP through certifications with  more detailed information as considered necessary by the auditor.  89 % of the CABs  stated that the  terms and  conditions of CSPs  do not contain  adequate clauses  allowing access for  auditors to perform  TSP assessments.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  42  4.2.  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES  A significant number of TSPs – not only CAs but also qualified certified electronic delivery or  time-stamping services – are migrating to or establishing their services directly in the cloud. The  level of integration with CSPs varies, but in general the service is hosted and operated from the  cloud by the provider’s staff on their premises.  This poses a number of challenges in implementing TSPs requirements and in auditing them  when they provide the trust service from the cloud. Some of the main problems encountered in  carrying out the compliance assessment are shown below.  • Inability to access data centres to assess physical security and other location-related  aspects. Large CSPs do not allow entry to CAB auditors or those appointed by the  providers themselves for various reasons, including business secrecy, impossibility of  handling such a large number of audits, location of data centres in another jurisdiction  and virtualisation of the service.  • Difficulty in accessing the CSP audit reports, which makes it impossible to verify the  work done by other auditors with other scopes and the total or partial overlap with the  scope of the trusted service.  • Difficulty in determining the contractual responsibility for the implementation of each of  the requirements and therefore in the review during the evaluation, always bearing in  mind that the responsibility for compliance with all the requirements always lies with  the TSP.  To solve these issues, a Spanish CAB has initiated a project with a CSP to identify the  responsibility for each control, i.e. to determine whether the controls implemented by the  provider on other accredited schemes fully or partially overlap with those required of the TSP  and its service(s). Using this information, it is possible to establish an audit time with greater  precision, to improve the analysis of the evaluation of the TSPs hosted by that CSP and to  reduce the time required to request and evaluate documents.  However, there is still the problem that the assessment of the controls that the TSP has  contractually outsourced to the cloud provider can only be done in a documentary manner,  which reduces the quality of the audit. This problem needs to be addressed.  Figure 13: Standards CABs recognise as supporting compliance audits of TSPs providing  services in the cloud (%)  Other  standards  There is a limitation  about the recognition  of other standards in  the sense of  accepting them  instead of performing  an own assessment.  It would be helpful to  get clear normative  and legal regulations  supporting the reuse  of assessments/audit  results/certifications  of other parties.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  43  5. CONCLUSIONS  The current report has examined the potential of moving trust services as defined in the eIDAS  regulation to the cloud. The applied method focused on analysing existing standards and the  technical requirements which have to be addressed for such movement to occur. In this report,  the current landscape of technical EU requirements that include a possibility for a move of trust  services to the cloud was presented and the survey results showed that there is interest from  TSPs to provide services from a cloud and from cloud providers to offer a platform for such  service. However, each specific case requires a detailed analysis to meet security and privacy  needs, as the individual requirements and the processes of offering trust services on the cloud  also highly depend on the CSPs and their requirements and capabilities.  The assessments of this report are based on the assumption that CSPs already follow the  mentioned standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002). Above all, there are existing EU  regulations that cloud services providers need to comply with, especially regarding privacy  issues and the GDPR, where private data is held in the cloud. Looking at these requirements, it  can be stated that a requirement for moving trust services to the cloud is that the cloud services  are provided from within the EU. The implications of the application of NIS 2 to trust services  which operate on the cloud require further study.  This report has identified the role of the HSM and the control over it as important aspects to be  addressed when planning to move trust services to the cloud. To ensure security, it is  indispensable that the TSP retains the control over the keys held in the HSM and their use in  signing. There are some cloud providers (even big global players) that allow the TSP to install  their own HSM and retain control over the keys. Others allow only temporary control over the  keys, which is called ‘temporary tenants’ or ‘multi-tenants’. From the perspective of the HSM  provider, the provision of key attestations, the knowledge of the cryptographic capacity and  when its limits are reached and the backup of data when using a remote HSM need to be  addressed. Preference is given to the use of HSMs certified under European standards EN 419  221-5 and EN 419 241-2.  Certain aspects of trust services are required by existing standards to use security zones and to  be physically isolated from any other organisation's services.  It remains to be seen whether the  same security isolation can be achieved using virtual platforms provided by cloud services.  From the audit perspective, the survey results have particularly shown that there is still  insecurity and open questions when it comes to auditing trust services remotely. While there are  standards which CABs recognise as supporting compliance audits of TSPs providing services in  the cloud (ISO 27017, ISO 27701, EU cloud cyber certification), most CABs think that the terms  and conditions of CSPs contain adequate clauses allowing access for auditors to perform TSP  assessments. Auditing TSPs that offer their services on a cloud requires the cooperation of  CSPs. This can take the form of physical access to the cloud service premises to perform the  compliance assessment of the TSP’s requirements, remote access to its system or the provision  of all necessary documentation for the TSP’s evaluation. However, the latter was evaluated by  the CABs who answered the survey as insufficient when generic cloud service is used in  support of a TSP. While some impediments from the audit perspective exist, the survey results  have shown that CABs can already perform audits on many trust services. It is important to note  that CABs carrying out assessments in the context of EUCS should be accredited to ISO 17065  and meet the additional requirements specified for EUCS.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  44  All in all, moving trust services to the cloud must be understood as an ongoing process that has  to be followed on a step-by-step basis. While some services – such as the validation of  signatures, delivery, time stamp or preservation – are moved rather quickly, other services –  such as the issuance of certificates and remote control over the signing device – require in- depth analysis and preparation. This also applies to the different components of trust services.  Either way, during the time of the move, the communication between the CSP and the data  centre needs to be secured and protected from attacks. The transition of data to the cloud has  to be secured at all times and, in the best case, remain in the data centre of the TSP. Some  services might not be suitable for operating on the cloud.  There are multiple benefits to moving trust services to the cloud. The main ones identified in this  report are the ability to extend services, cost savings and more choice and flexibility in choosing  the platform. 50 % of the TSPs who participated in the survey already operate or plan to operate  at least parts of their trust services in the cloud. This number clearly shows that TSPs are  moving their services to the cloud. This development is ongoing and we can expect more TSPs  to move their services to the cloud. This report has given a detailed overview of the issues to be  addressed for such a transition, including the related challenges and opportunities.

Qualified trust  services (QTS), as defined in the regulation, are the core of the framework establishing trust  between businesses, EU Member States and individuals. Not only has eIDAS established trust  in the EU, but also opened a new market for trust service providers (TSPs). With over 200  companies listed in the EU trusted list of service providers, the market is developing constantly,  changing and adapting to its environment.  Clouds and cloud computing nowadays are a commonly used platform for sharing and storing  data. They can be used for many purposes and are often an inherent part of large, small and  medium-sized enterprises. The benefits of using clouds are flexibility, cost effectiveness, the  easy transfer of data and the availability to extend services as usage grows. In recent years,  TSPs have been moving their services to the cloud in order to take advantage of these benefits.  Many providers have already moved all or parts of their services to the cloud. Cloud providers  have realised their market goals for this transition and conformity assessment bodies (CABs)  are investigating the means to audit trust services from the cloud.  This report includes a detailed analysis on the different technical requirements that must be  addressed considering the relevant standards. It also gives an overview of practical experiences  on the move of trust services to the cloud, based on the results of a survey conducted with over  120 participants. The report finds that there are many existing requirements on the TSP side  that can be considered and potentially applied to cloud service providers (CSPs). The two most  important standards against which conformance is often assessed by CSPs and which have  much in common with the standards for trust services are:  • ISO/IEC 27017: Code of practice for information security controls, based on ISO/IEC  27002 for cloud services;  • ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management systems.  The results of the survey have shown that trust services are moving to the cloud. The findings of  the comparison of standards adopted by CSPs and TSPs in the theoretical part of this report  show that there are mostly minor disparities. The trust services that stakeholders consider most  appropriate to be operated on a cloud are:  • qualified certificates for electronic signature;  • qualified validation for electronic signature;  • qualified certificates for electronic seals;  • provision of revocation status information.  From the audit perspective, the survey results have particularly shown that there is still  insecurity and open questions when it comes to auditing the trust services remotely. While there  are standards which CABs recognise as supporting compliance audits of TSPs providing  services in the cloud (ISO 27017, ISO 27701, EU cloud cyber certification), most CABs think  that the terms and conditions of CSPs contain adequate clauses allowing access for auditors to  (1) https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv %3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  7  perform TSP assessments. While some impediments from the audit perspective exist, the  survey results have shown that CABs can already perform audits on many trust services.  Moving trust services to the cloud must be understood as an ongoing process that has to be  followed step by step. While some services – such as the validation of signatures, registered  delivery, time stamp or signature preservation – are moved rather quickly, other services – such  as the issuance of certificates and remote control over the signing device – require in-depth  analysis and preparation. The transition of data to the cloud has to be secure at all times and, in  the best case, must remain in the data centre of the TSP. Some services might not be suitable  for operation on the cloud. This report gives a detailed overview of the issues to be addressed  for such transitions, along with the related challenges and opportunities.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  8  1. INTRODUCTION TO eIDAS,  TSPs AND THE CLOUD  1.1.  eIDAS TRUST SERVICES  The eIDAS regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market provides a regulatory environment for the electronic identification of natural  and legal persons and a framework for electronic trust services. The regulation repeals Directive  1999/93/EC. Under the eIDAS regulation, it is possible to use trust services and electronic  documents as evidence in legal proceedings across all Member States that contribute to their  cross-border use.  As of 1 July 2016, all provisions relating to trust services of the eIDAS regulation are directly  applicable in the 27 Member States and do not need to be transposed into national law. The  eIDAS regulation facilitates seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses  across Member States and establishes a climate of trust when it comes to online and digital  transactions in the EU.  One objective of this regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust service  provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating their compliance with the eIDAS high-level security  requirements and obligations. A QTSP is a TSP that has been granted a qualified status and is  supervised by its national supervisory body (SB).  Therefore, when a TSP intends to start providing QTS, it shall submit to the SB a notification of  its intention, together with a conformity assessment report issued by an eIDAS-accredited  conformity assessment body (CAB). National accreditation bodies (NAB) contribute to the  quality assurance of the whole process by being responsible to accredit a CAB that will perform  the conformity assessment audits to the TSP.  In June 2021 the European Commission proposed a revision of the eIDAS regulation  (COM/2021/281) (2), also known as eIDAS 2.0, which not only suggests the establishment of a  European digital identity wallet, but also proposes four new QTS: issuing of electronic  attestations of attributes, provision of electronic archiving services, electronic ledgers and  management of remote electronic signature and seal creation devices. eIDAS 2.0 is still under  development and the requirements of these new services have yet to be defined. This report will  focus on the existing technical standards of current eIDAS trust services and will not further  consider the proposed new trust services.  In recent years, TSPs have been interested in moving their services to the cloud for the  mentioned benefits. Many providers have already moved all or parts of their services to the  cloud. Cloud providers have realised their market opportunity for this transition and CABs are  investigating means to audit trust services from the cloud. This report considers the issues  involved in moving to the cloud, both from a theoretical viewpoint based on a comparison of  standards and from a practical viewpoint based on the experiences of stakeholders in this area.

STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  Section 1 of this report introduces the concepts and services provided by TSPs and CSPs. The  other sections cover the following topics.  • Section 2. An analysis of the provisions of security standards commonly adopted by  cloud services compared with the general requirements of standards for trust services.  • Section 3. An analysis of the specific requirements of trust services and their  components against the ability of cloud services to support those requirements.  • Section 4. Consideration of the issues with the evaluation of trust services in the  cloud.  • Section 5. Conclusion of the report.  • Annex. Statistics of the survey.  For this report, a survey for four different stakeholders was conducted. The different  questionnaires were sent out to TSPs, CABs, national authorities / supervisory bodies (NA/SBs)  and providers of solutions to TSPs. In total there were 128 participants. The results will be  referenced throughout this report and analysed in depth in Sections 3 and 4.  1.3.  WHAT IS IN THE CLOUD  Since a few years, clouds have been an inherent part of the digital world. Especially in the  business sector, clouds are used for many different purposes such as sharing and storing data  and developing products and business models. The following will briefly describe the definition  of cloud computing and its general purpose.  1.3.1.  CLOUD COMPUTING  For the definition of cloud computing, this report refers to ISO/IEC 177883, which describes  cloud computing as a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of  shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on  demand. Thus, cloud services are functions offered through cloud computing and used via a  specific interface. In simple terms, cloud computing allows data, services, programs and  applications to be accessed on a device-independent basis over the internet.  A cloud service customer (CSC) is a party in a business relationship for the purpose of using  cloud services. A CSP is the party which makes cloud services available. A cloud service user is  a natural person or a legal entity which acts on behalf of the cloud services customer of cloud  services.  The following sections provide further details on the types of cloud services that can be  provided and their features. This report indicates the applicability of the different types of cloud  services to trust services.  1.3.2.  GENERAL PURPOSE OF CLOUD PLATFORMS  There are many benefits in using cloud platforms. Apart from the data storage aspect described  above, they offer ways to interact and share data with third parties. The data is accessible from  all over the world but, at the same time, data access can be restricted as it would be using  hardware-based storage. A big advantage of using cloud services is that the provider takes over  the physical security and maintenance of the hardware, which leads to savings in costs and  time. In addition, CSPs use a scalable economy model that gives small businesses the  opportunity to obtain better IT solutions at lower prices.  3 At the time of writing, ISO/IEC 17788 was under review and due to be replaced by ISO/IEC 22123-1:2023 and ISO/IEC  FDIS 22123-2 in the course of 2023  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  10  By using cloud services, significant savings can be made in the hardware and software  infrastructure needed to support trust services. Many of the overhead costs in ensuring security  are provided. Furthermore, as the infrastructure requirements of a TSP change, the use of  shared cloud services can be easily adapted to their changing needs.  The following section explores the common provisions of cloud services and the standards  generally adopted by CSPs.  1.4.  USE OF CLOUD SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF TRUST SERVICES  This report analyses the potential of moving QTSs to the cloud. In the eIDAS regulation, nine  types of QTS are mentioned:  • provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures;  • provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals;  • provision of qualified certificates for website authentication;  • qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures;  • qualified validation service for qualified electronic seals;  • qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures;  • qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals;  • qualified time-stamping service;  • qualified electronic registered delivery service (ERDS).  The QTS can be grouped into five main categories:  • issuance of certificates;  • validation of signatures or seals based on those certificates;  • preservation of those signatures or seals;  • time stamps.  ERDS is also performed with the mentioned certificates.  1.4.1.  MAIN CLOUD SERVICE PROVISIONS  In order to provide the basis of the analysis of the use of general cloud service platforms, this  section provides an outline of the services and associated features commonly provided by  CSPs.  This is based on documentation provided online by the major cloud providers offering publicly  available services. Other ways of providing cloud services exist, such as private cloud services,  hybrid public and private cloud services and community-based cloud services. However, when  looking at the move of eIDAS trust services to the cloud, the support for public clouds is  considered to be the most appropriate basis for the analysis. This is where most savings can be  made and the provisions of the public cloud service are aimed at the general needs of an open  community based around open standards, whereas privately operated clouds are aimed at  specific security concerns supporting a closed user community with specific security concerns.  Furthermore, the majority of respondents to the survey used public cloud services.  1.4.1.1. Types of CSPs  (1) Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) Service offering a virtual computing environment  (2) Platform as a service (PaaS). Service offering a platform for developing and running  applications on the cloud.  (3) Software as a service. Service based on applications located in the cloud.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  11  The major CSPs offer infrastructure as a service (IaaS) services using virtual environments that  provide separation between customer software (4). They also offer a range of services to  support the development of websites and customer applications (PaaS), including Kubernetes.  There is a range of different applications that all three types of CSPs support. Finally, CSPs  commonly offer file/object storage and relational and other types of databases to support the  storage of their customers’ data.  Often, CSPs cannot be clearly assigned to one of the abovementioned types. For example,  providers of IaaS services often offer development platforms for applications associated with  PaaS, along with the isolation provided by virtual environments associated with IaaS. Also,  other categories of cloud-based services exist which do not fit neatly into any of these three  main classifications, for example cloud services in support of mobile-based applications.  A cloud service may be operated in the following ways:  (1) As a public cloud service, available to any customer.  (2) As a private cloud service, supporting a specific community of users. With a private  cloud, greater security and integrity may be maintained by prohibiting use outside the  community while sharing the benefits of a cloud service within the user community.  (3) As a hybrid cloud, offering a mixed computing, storage and services environment  made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services and a public cloud.  (4) As a multi-cloud, using multiple cloud services from different vendors. This may be  done to use different providers for different aspects of a user’s service or to use  multiple providers as alternatives to provide the same service, in order to avoid  reliance on a single provider.  1.4.1.2. Security  All of the major CSPs offer a range of tools to support the security of their services, including:  • identity and access management;  • continuous monitoring of the cloud service to defend against external attacks and  ensure compliance with security policy;  • maintenance of audit logs which may be used for monitoring;  • provision of security alerts, event management and incident response;  • network security and firewalls;  • secure web and email services;  • protection of private and other sensitive data, for example using encryption:  o management of cryptographic keys including certificate management,  o public key infrastructure (PKI),  o identity management and authentication services.  Furthermore, most CSPs have settings and configurations defined according to specific  frameworks. This way the customer can choose to apply a specific control (e.g. to comply with  an ISO standard) and the tool will suggest which settings and policies to implement.  1.4.1.3. Hardware security module and key management  A hardware security module (HSM) is a specialised device used to protect cryptographic keys  and support cryptographic functions, such as the creation of digital signatures and encryption.  HSMs are commonly placed in a secure data centre, supporting the cryptographic requirements  of servers through a local network.  (4) Further information about cloud services can be found in the ENISA report Security Aspects in Virtualization,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  12  HSMs are used for trust services to sign statements (e.g. public key certificates) issued by the  TSP.  FIPS 140-2 is an American federal standard for HSMs which is globally accepted as the basis  for demonstrating the security of such devices. FIPS 140-2 identifies three levels of security.  • Level 1. Requires that production-grade equipment and externally tested algorithms be  used.  • Level 2. Requires physical tamper-evidence and role-based authentication for  hardware.  • Level 3. Hardware must feature physical tamper resistance and identity-based  authentication.  In Europe, an alternative standard has been defined for HSMs, the European Committee for  Normalization (CEN) standard EN 419 221-5. This is extended to support remote signing  services in EN 419 241-2.  The major CSPs offer tools for secure management of keys based around HSMs. These are  often provided at two levels.  • General purpose key management tools, which can be based on FIPS 140-2 level 2  HSM or even software-managed keys.  • Customer HSM instances, offering full FIPS 140-2 level 3 isolation of keys between  customers. This can be done using customer-supplied HSMs which are:  o remotely managed by the customer but held in cloud service data centres; or  o ‘single-tenant’ HSMs, which are operated by the CSP but ensure isolation  between use of the HSMs by customers with only a single customer-owned set of  keys in the HSM at any one time.  No public cloud service is known to support the EU standard for HSMs (EN 419 221-5), nor is  there support for the use of HSMs to support remote signing as defined in EN 419 241-2.  Currently, FIPS 140-2 level 3 is accepted but preference is given to EN 419 221-5. For remote  signing at the qualified level, EN 419 241-2 is necessary and this is based on the use of EN 419  221-5 HSM.  1.4.1.4. Time synchronisation  Regarding time synchronisation, some CSPs use a recognised Universal Time Coordinated  (UTC) source with a satellite/GPS source that is linked to atomic clocks. However, many CSPs  do not give a clear statement regarding the synchronisation of time with a recognised UTC time  source.  1.4.1.5. Compliance  The major CSPs comply with several different schemes to ensure different aspects of their  security. These commonly include the following types of conformity assessment schemes.  • ISO/IEC 27001, to certify security management and the use of generally accepted  controls as defined in ISO/IEC 27002.  • ISO/IEC 27017, to certify the application of security controls specifically necessary for  building cloud-based services on ISO/IEC 27002.  • ISO/IEC 27018: General code of practice, to provide data protection such as required  by the general data protection regulation (GDPR).  • ISO/IEC 27701 privacy extension to ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management  and ISO/IEC 27002: Security controls.  • CSA STAR certifications, to meet practices generally considered as required by the  cloud providers.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  13  • Other schemes specifically aimed at the GDPR.  According to the results of the survey, 75 % of the CSPs stated that they already provide or plan  to provide conformity assessments relating to ISO 27017, ISO 27001 and the European  cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services (EUCS) (5).

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  APPLICABLE TO TSPs AND  CSPs  This section provides an overview of the general requirements for TSPs and analyses the  security standards commonly adopted by cloud services.  2.1.  OVERVIEW OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUST SERVICES  TSPs build their systems and services so that security is ensured, as defined in Article 24(2) of  the eIDAS regulation. Most TSPs base their safety organisation on the implementation of  technical standards defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),  more specifically as defined in ETSI EN 319 401. For the areas of TSP operations and  management, the ETSI EN 319 401 requirements are based on the international standard  ISO/IEC 27002: Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – information security  controls. Policy requirements for specific trust services are also based on requirements defined  in ETSI EN 319 401.  Figure 1: TSP policy requirements  As mentioned in Section 1, trust services can be grouped into different categories. The following  tables show the requirements that apply for the different categories of trust services according  to various ETSI EN standards.  Certificate issuance  All trust services which involve the issuance of public key certificates   Issuance of qualified and non-qualified certificates for electronic  signatures.   Issuance of qualified and non-qualified certificates for electronic seals.   Issuance of qualified and non-qualified certificates for website  authentication.  Requirements for the issuance of certificates are specified in ETSI EN 319 411-1:  Policy requirements for TSPs issuing certificates and ETSI EN 319 411-2: Policy  requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates.  These standards build on the general requirements for trust services specified in  EN 319 401, as described above.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  15  Qualified signature/seal creation device support  The signatory (or creator of the seal) entrusts qualified signature creation  devices (QSCDs) to the care of a third party, provided that appropriate  mechanisms and procedures are implemented to ensure that the signatory (or  creator of the seal) has sole control over the use of their electronic signature /  seal creation data, and that the qualified electronic signature / seal requirements  are met by the use of the device (eIDAS regulation recital 51).  As stated in eIDAS recital 52, in order to ensure that such electronic  signatures/seals receive the same legal recognition as electronic signature/seals  created in an entirely user-managed environment, remote electronic signature  service providers should:  (1) apply specific management and administrative security procedures; and  (2) use trustworthy systems and products.  Regarding the first point, eIDAS requires that the remote electronic signature  creation environment is managed by a QTSP on behalf of the signatory, even if  this type of service is not a QTS per se. The security measures proposed in ETSI  EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN 319 411-2 also apply to QTSPs  providing remote QSCD services. Additionally, ETSI released TS 119 431-1  proposing ‘Policy and security requirements for TSPs; Part 1: TSP service  components operating a remote QSCD/SCDev’.  Concerning the second point, in order to ensure their trustworthiness, systems  and products must implement appropriate technical measures to manage the  risks posed to their security. Annex II of eIDAS made some of these security  measures mandatory and also, pursuant to Articles 30(1) and 39(2) of eIDAS,  made the certification against these security measures mandatory. The security  framework of such systems and products are provided in CEN EN 419 241-2 and  CEN EN 419 221-5.  Time stamps  All trust services issuing qualified and non-qualified time stamps   Time-stamping provision which generates time stamps.   Time-stamping management which monitors and controls the operation  of the time.  Requirements for issuing time stamps are specified in ETSI EN 319 421: Policy  and security requirements for TSPs issuing time stamps.  This standard builds on the general requirements for trust services specified in  EN 319 401, as described in the previous section.  Registered E-delivery services  Delivery of electronic registered mail  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in ETSI EN 319  521: Policy and security requirements for ERDS providers and ETSI EN 319 531:  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  16  Policy and security requirements for registered electronic mail service providers  (REMS).  Following the guidance in EN 319 401 as the general policy requirements for all  types of TSPs, this document sets out general requirements specific for those  TSPs providing ERDS and REMS.  The general requirements for ERDS are stated in EN 319 521 and then extended  for REMS in EN 319 531.  Signature Preservation services  Preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates relating to these  services  Requirements for preservation services as specified in TS 119 511: Policy and  security requirements for TSPs providing long-term preservation of digital  signatures or general data using digital signature techniques.  As with other TSP standards, this document makes reference to requirements in  EN 319 401 for general requirements for TSPs.  Signature validation  Validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic time  stamps  Security and policy requirements for signature validation services are specified in  ETSI TS 119 441: Policy requirements for TSPs providing signature validation  services.  As with other TSP standards, this document refers to requirements in EN 319  401 for general requirements for TSPs.  2.2.  INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF CLOUD SERVICES  In a cloud computing environment, the main security assets (data and processes) of CSCs are  stored, transmitted and processed by the cloud service. Therefore, CSC information security  depends upon the information security of the CSP. Before entering into supplier relationships  with cloud services providers, CSCs should be able to assess possible gaps between their own  and the providers’ information security systems.  2.2.1.  ISO STANDARDS  • ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management systems. ISO/IEC 27001 provides  requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). The standard is  supported by several standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family. Other standards for the security  of cloud services, including ISO/IEC 27017 and CSA STAR, are built on ISO 27001  • ISO/IEC 27002: Information security controls. This provides a reference set of information  security controls and implementation guidance supporting ISO/IEC 27001. ISO/IEC 27002 is a  basis for requirements defined for TSPs and in the operation clause of ETSI EN 319 401 and  covers all the general areas of security management required for trust services.  • ISO/IEC 27017: Code of practice for information security controls, based on ISO/IEC  27002 for cloud services. This standard provides additional cloud-specific implementation  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  17  guidance for relevant controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002. It also provides new controls with  implementation guidance relating to cloud services and defines a CSP as a supplier under the  ‘supplier relationship’ defined in clause 15 of ISO/IEC 27002. In the standard, requirements  are defined and guidance for both CSPs and CSCs is provided. Both parties should manage  their risk and apply cloud-specific controls. ISO/IEC 27017 requires both CSP and CSC  information management systems to be established and maintained. The standard extends  controls provided by ISO 27002 for both CSPs and CSCs. Some controls are separate and  take into account roles in the information system, while others are common for both CSPs and  CSCs.  Figure 2: ISO standard dependency  Figure 3: CSC and CSP requirements based on ISO/IEC 27017  This standard addresses the following areas:  • asset ownership;  • recovery plans;  • disposal of assets containing sensitive information;  • segregation and storage of data;  • alignment of security management for virtual and physical networks.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  18  Furthermore, it requires establishing a risk management process and refers to guidance in  ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27005. Annex B of the standard presents references on  information security risks related to cloud computing.  • ISO/IEC 27018: Code of practice for protection of personally identifiable information  (PII) in public cloud acting as PII processors. CSPs that process private data of trust  service customers need to operate their services in ways that allow both TSPs and CSPs to  meet the requirements of the GDPR. The requirements and the way in which the requirements  are divided between the CSP and the TSP vary according to legal jurisdictions and the terms  of the contract between them. The purpose of the ISO/IEC 27018 standard, when used in  conjunction with the information security objectives and controls in ISO/IEC 27002, is to  provide a common set of security controls that can be implemented by a public cloud  computing service provider acting as a private data processor. The implementation and  maintenance of ISO/IEC 27018 requirements confirm that users of cloud services keep control  over the use of their data, have information about their geographic location and that personal  data is processed only in accordance with the customer’s requirements. However, it does not  prevent third-country authorities from accessing the data.  Compliance with the standard ensures transparency of the rules for the processing, transfer  and deletion of personal data stored in cloud databases; customer data will be protected and  used only for the purpose approved by the customer. The standard imposes restrictions on  the handling of data transmission and storage on memory media. The standard also indicates  the appropriate data recovery and restoration processes.  • ISO/IEC 27701: Privacy information management. This standard is an extension to the  ISO/IEC 27002 controls and is expected to be audited as part of the ISO 27001 certificate.  Like ISO/IEC 27018, it is concerned with protecting privacy but directed more at the general  management of privacy, rather than controls aimed at PII.  2.2.2.  CLOUD SECURITY ALLIANCE STAR SELF-ASSESSMENT AND  CERTIFICATION  The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR (security, trust, assurance and risk) (6) programme is  dedicated to defining and raising awareness of best practices to help ensure a secure cloud  computing environment. It encompasses three levels of assessment (self-assessment, third- party conformity assessment and continuous auditing) and is specifically geared towards  supporting and evaluating CSPs for two levels of assurance (STAR Level 1 and STAR Level 2).  Third-party conformity assessment is only provided for STAR Level 2. Over 100 CSPs are  certified to STAR Level 2, which builds on existing ISO 27001 (or AICPA SOC2 or Chinese  equivalents) audits, adding cloud-specific controls. ISO 27017 is intended to businesses  moving data to the cloud and/or sharing data in the cloud, including CSPs. STAR is more  comprehensive and targeted at CSPs.  STAR is based on a cloud controls matrix, a cybersecurity control framework for cloud  computing. It is a spreadsheet that lists 16 domains covering all key aspects of cloud  technology. Each domain is broken up into 133 control objectives. It can be used as a tool to  systematically assess cloud implementation, by providing guidance on which security controls  should be implemented by which actor within the cloud supply chain. The controls framework is  aligned to the CSA’s security guidance v4 and is currently considered a de facto standard for  cloud security assurance and compliance.  The domains covered by the cloud controls matrix are:  • application and interface security;  (6) https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/.  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  19  • audit and assurance;  • business continuity management and operational resilience;  • change control and configuration management;  • data security and privacy life cycle management;  • data centre security;  • cryptography, encryption and key management;  • governance, risk management and compliance;  • human resources security;  • identity and access management;  • security infrastructure and virtualisation;  • interoperability and portability;  • universal endpoint management;  • security incident management, e-discovery and cloud forensics;  • supply chain management, transparency and accountability;  • threat and vulnerability management;  • logging and monitoring;  • CSA STAR Level 2 (independent audit).  2.2.3.  EU CLOUD CERTIFICATION SCHEME  In December 2020, ENISA published a draft proposal of a European cybersecurity certification  scheme for cloud services (EUCS) (7). Its aim is to improve the internal market conditions and  enhance the level of security for cloud services and the overall infrastructure around them. The  scheme addresses CSPs, CSCs and regulatory authorities. The scheme proposes three  different assurance levels to describe the level of security required and provided: basic,  substantial and high.  The basic level provides limited assurance that the cloud service is built and operated in  accordance with the procedures and mechanisms that minimise the known basic threats of  incidents and cyberattacks. The aim of the basic level is to ensure that cloud services are  designed to meet common service security requirements for non-critical data and systems.  The substantial level ensures, through the CAB’s assessment, that the cloud service is built and  operated using procedures and mechanisms that minimise known cybersecurity threats and the  risk of incidents and cyberattacks by entities with typical skills and resources. An assessment  covers whether the CSP has assessed this risk and has implemented appropriate controls that,  if operated effectively, minimise this risk and meet the relevant security requirements for a  specified period of time. The substantial level should be appropriate for cloud services designed  to meet common security requirements for business-critical data and systems.  The high level provides reasonable assurance, again through the CAB’s assessment, that the  cloud service is built and operated using procedures and mechanisms that minimise the risk of  advanced cyberattacks by entities with considerable skills and resources. The audit covers  whether the CSP has assessed this risk and has implemented appropriate control measures  that effectively minimise the risk and meet the relevant security requirements for a specified  period. The high level should be appropriate for cloud services designed to meet specific  security requirements for mission-critical data and systems.  All CABs carrying out assessments in the context of EUCS should be accredited to ISO 17065  and meet the additional requirements specified for EUCS. Additional requirements define  several profiles corresponding to different roles in conformity assessment. The technical  competence requirements related to accreditation are sufficient to perform the basic and  (7) For more information on EUCS, visit: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  20  substantial conformity assessments. However, advanced competencies are required to conduct  a conformity assessment for the high level.  2.2.4.  EU GDPR  Two schemes have been defined for conformity assessment against GDPR-based  requirements: the CISPE code of conduct and the EU cloud code of conduct.  Compliance with the CISPE code of conduct (8) is verified by independent, external auditors  accredited as ‘monitoring bodies’ by the competent European data protection authority. These  bodies strengthen the level of assurance provided by services declared under the code. The  code was approved by the European Data Protection Board on 19 May 2021.  The EU cloud code of conduct (9) consists of requirements for CSPs that wish to adhere to the  code and a governance section that is designed to support the effective and transparent  implementation, management and evolution of the code. The code is a voluntary instrument,  allowing a CSP to evaluate and demonstrate its adherence to the code’s requirements, either  through self-evaluation and self-declaration of compliance and/or through a third-party  conformity assessment. The code has been developed to cover GDPR requirements and,  following the positive opinion issued by the European Data Protection Board, was officially  approved by the Belgian data protection authority in May 2021.  2.2.5. NIS 2 DIRECTIVE  The implications of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (the NIS 2 directive) (10) for trust services are still  subject to investigation within ETSI (11). However, the use of cloud services in support of trust  services could have direct implications for European cybersecurity. In particular, if the provision  of cloud services becomes an important part of the supply chain for trust services, this could be  relevant to the national cybersecurity strategy under Article 5 of NIS 2 and may need to be  considered as part of the EU coordinated risk assessments of critical supply chains.

(11) See the ETSI work item at: https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=66935.  Even if a CSP  follows the Code  of Conduct, an  arrangement with  the EU or a  bilateral contract  with a Member  State is necessary  to ensure GDPR  compliance.  https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/ https://eucoc.cloud/en/home https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/11/28/eu-decides-to-strengthen-cybersecurity-and-resilience-across-the-union-council-adopts-new-legislation/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/11/28/eu-decides-to-strengthen-cybersecurity-and-resilience-across-the-union-council-adopts-new-legislation/ https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=66935  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  21  3. PROVISION OF SPECIFIC  TRUST SERVICES IN THE  CLOUD  This section provides a comparison of the general requirements for trust services (as presented  in Section 2) against the ability of cloud services to support those requirements. This analysis is  summarised in a table that shows the different responsibilities for TSPs and CSPs. In addition, a  more detailed analysis of how to operate trust services in the cloud is given. Therefore, the  requirements of each type of trust service are examined to identify where concerns of the  provisions of CSPs particularly need to be considered. In a last step, practical examples are  given by analysing the results from the survey.  3.1.  COMPARISON OF GENERAL CSP STANDARDS WITH GENERAL TSP  REQUIREMENTS  Section 3.1.1 describes the ISO/IEC 27017 requirements for CSPs and CSCs. The security  model in the standard requires that both parties comply with the requirements. A TSP using  CSP services becomes its client, so it should comply with the requirements for cloud service  clients and use cloud services that are compliant with the ISO/IEC 27017 standard. As a result,  the set of requirements for TSPs using cloud services is a combination of requirements for  TSPs and requirements for CSCs.  Figure 4: Requirements for TSPs, CSCs and CSPs  3.1.1.  INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT  There is much in common between the requirements placed by the application of information  security management standards for CSPs and those required for TSPs. This is particularly  apparent when considering the requirements of ISO/IEC 27017: Code of practice for information  security controls, based on ISO/IEC 27002 for cloud services, against the requirements of ETSI  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  22  EN 319 401: General policy and security requirements for the provision of trust services. A more  detailed depiction can be found in section 3.2 of this report.  Section 3.2 also includes a table specifying the requirements that any TSP/QTSP has to meet  according to the eIDAS regulation and the EN 319 401 standard. The following points are  covered in the table.  • Domains and specific requirements.  • Who is responsible for implementation. It should be noted that the responsibility  towards third parties always lies with the TSP/QTSP and that this section of the table  refers to the division of contractual responsibilities between the TSP/QTSP and its  supplier.  • Controls usually implemented by the CSP. This column lists the controls that large  cloud providers usually have in place. It will depend in each case on the services that  the TSP/QTSP has contracted.  • Activities that have to be carried out by the TSP/QTSP, either by parameterising the  services provided by the CPS or by implementing its own controls.  • Mapping of controls against ISO/IEC 27002.  3.1.2.  PRIVACY  The provision of privacy under the GDPR is not directly addressed by either ISO/IEC 27017 or  EN 319 401. However, for cloud services providers it is commonly addressed through ISO/IEC  27018 or the practices specifically aimed at the GDPR.  Generally, compliance with the GDPR is the responsibility of the TSP. However, if private  information is held in the cloud, there are implications for the CSP. In general, the information  security provisions of CSPs are probably sufficient to meet the requirements of trust services.  However, the legal requirements of the placement of private data outside the control of  countries not recognising the GDPR need to be considered.  3.1.3.  RISK ASSESSMENT AND POLICY AND SECURITY  REQUIREMENTS  In Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, TSPs must take appropriate technical and organisational  measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide.  ENISA has developed guidelines for TSPs focusing on a secure framework (12), discussing the  minimal security levels to be maintained by the TSPs and covering all eIDAS articles where trust  and risks were included in the updated version.  (Q)TSPs are required to provide trust services with the appropriate trust within a secure  framework and manage all potential risks to minimise and mitigate the impact of having security  incidents. This applies to the trust services offered from cloud providers complying with ETSI EN  319 401 and the corresponding policy requirement standard applicable to the trust service.  For the purpose of this document, the risk assessment phases defined in ISO/IEC 27005 are  considered valid for assessing cloud providers, because they take the following into account:  • risk identification: scope, assets, threats and vulnerabilities;  • risk analysis: risk level based on impact;  • risk evaluation.  (12) See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp1-framework.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp1-framework  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  23  CSPs may be reluctant to provide information on the results of their own risk management  regime.  3.2.  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  There is significant overlap between the requirements of CSPs following ISO/IEC 27017 and the  requirements of TSPs, as both are based around ISO/IEC 27002. If private information is to be  placed in the cloud, the implications for legal recognition of any application of privacy controls  outside the EU need to be taken into account.  The following table summarises the existing information security management requirements that  CSPs and TSPs have to fulfil in order to either provide services for TSP or operate trust  services in a cloud. It is important to note that these requirements only address general  scenarios. For a detailed report about the specific requirements that have to be met, each use  case needs to be examined individually. Not all requirements may be necessary for every use  case.

It can be understood as a general guideline or checklist  that must be considered when intending to offer any kind of trust service in the cloud. The table  shows the different responsibilities that TSPs and CSPs have in their roles. However, it does not  provide information on the specific requirements that apply for each of the different categories of  trust services. It also does not give information on how to audit these services. Both aspects will  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  26  be analysed more closely in the following sections of this report. Practical examples from the  survey will be presented, in order to compare and confirm the mentioned requirements with  assessments of stakeholders in this field.  3.3.  OPERATING TRUST SERVICES IN THE CLOUD  The previous section identified the general requirements that apply for the different categories  of trust services. The following section provides an analysis of more specific requirements when  operating trust services in the cloud. Therefore the respective clauses in the standards that  apply will be presented. The section will show where concerns of the provision of CSPs in  particular need to be considered. While the table above gave an overall overview of the general  requirements and responsibilities for TSPs and CSPs, the following section will also look at  specific scenarios for each category of trust services.  3.3.1.  CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE  The following section presents the different requirements that apply for the issuance of  certificates, depending on the individual scenario.  3.3.1.1. General  Practice statements need to clearly state where use is made of third-party services, such as a  CSP. In particular, the TSP practice statement should provide details on whether a CSP is  involved in supporting the use and management of certification authority (CA) keys, for example  using CSP provided HSM or key management software, and should clearly state how this  involves the CSP in supporting key management.  A TSP provides certificates to subscribers and subjects after the subjects’ consent to relying  parties. Additionally, a TSP is required to provide the terms and conditions regarding the use of  the certificate. This could be addressed by the use of CSP cloud storage services and other  services using the cloud for data distribution.  Trust services issuing certificates can be broken down into a number of individual component  services, each with their own specific functions and security requirements. The requirements of  each component in the cloud is considered in its own right.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3 specifies requirements for management of life cycle of certificates:  certificate application, issuance, acceptance, usage, renewal, revocation and suspension.  Under certain conditions, this could be met by a TSP’s own certificate software running on a  CSP IaaS platform. EN 319 411-2 clauses 6.4.1–6.4.6 and 6.4.9 specify requirements for  QTSPs to maintain information covered by audit logs as necessary to meet legal requirements  beyond the termination of the TSP. This follows the requirement of Article 24(2), point (h) of the  eIDAS regulation to record and keep accessible for an appropriate period, including after the  activities of the QTSP have ceased, all relevant information concerning data issued and  received by the QTSP (in particular for the purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings  and for the purpose of ensuring continuity of the service). Such recording may be done  electronically and this needs to be addressed when a TSP operates with the use of CSP.  EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.4.1–6.4.6 specify requirements relating to infrastructure management  related to certificate generation and revocation. This infrastructure should operate in an  environment that protects services from being compromised by unauthorised access to systems  or data. It requires entry control to physically protected zones and registration of entrances and  exits. Clearly defined security zones must be established for certificate generation and  revocation management. Any parts of the premises shared with other organisations shall be  outside the perimeter of the certificate generation and revocation management services. The  standard requires the implementation of physical and environmental security controls to protect  resources. All of these requirements require special treatment when using the CSP. EN 319  50 % of TSPs  already operate  their services on  the cloud or plan  to do so.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  27  411-1 clause 6.4.7 specifies requirements for a TSP to establish data backup and recovery  systems necessary to resume CA operations. A TSP business continuity plan is required to  address the compromise, loss or suspected compromise of a CA private key as a disaster.  These additional requirements need to be addressed when CSP is used. The use of Cloud  Services to provide isolated virtual platforms assure a degree of separation from other web  based services but whether it can provide the same assurance of physical separation requires  further investigation.  EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.5.5–6.5.7 specify requirements relating to computer security and  access control. This requires keeping network components in a physically and logically secure  environment, periodic checks, multifactor authentication and network and systems security.  These topics are covered by EN 319 401, as discussed in Section 2. Additional controls are  required for maintaining and protecting all CA systems in at least a secure zone and  implementing and configuring security procedures that protect systems and communications  between systems inside secure zones and high-security zones. The TSP is required to  configure all systems by removing or disabling all accounts, applications, services, protocols  and ports that are not used in the CA operations. The TSP grants access to secure and high- security zones only to trusted roles. All of these items must be covered by CSP practices and  certifications but may require additional checking.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.7 specifies requirements relating to the establishment of compliance  audits and is subject to assessment. This is addressed in Section 4.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.8 specifies requirements relating to other business and legal matters.  Privacy requirements should be met by the appropriate certification (ISO/IEC 27018, ISO/IEC  27701, GDPR).  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.9 specifies requirements relating to other provisions. The parts of the  TSP concerned with certificate generation and revocation management are required to be  independent of other organisations for its decisions relating to the establishing, provisioning and  maintaining and suspending of services in conformance with the applicable certificate policies.  These requirements are a matter for the TSP business operations.  3.3.1.2. Trust service component specific requirements  In order to more effectively further analyse the requirements of trust services and how they can  be met, other requirement for the issuance of certificates must be considered in relation to  component services. ETSI EN 319 411-1 and EN 319 411-2 for the provisioning of (qualified)  certificates provide an example of how to break down the whole trust service into different  component services (Figure 2).  • Registration service. Verifies the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a  subject. The results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service.  • Certificate generation service. Creates and signs certificates based on the identity  and other attributes verified by the registration service. This can include key  generation.  • Dissemination service. Disseminates certificates to subjects and, if the subject  consents, makes them available to relying parties.  • Revocation management service. Processes requests and reports relating to  revocation to determine the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service  are distributed through the revocation status service.  • Revocation status service. Provides certificate revocation status information to  relying parties.  • Subject device provision service (optional). Prepares and provides, or simply  provides, secure cryptographic devices or other secure devices to subjects.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  28  Figure 5: Different components needed for the provision of issuing certificates  These components or assets are also applicable to cloud providers, as they also use HSMs to  manage keys and need to allow access to those keys to specific people or roles who run a  specific software following a specific document. That means that the corresponding security  requirements and risks assessments that must be performed on local providers are also valid  for cloud providers. The assets to be protected are the same as the risks posed in every asset.  An additional important trust service component, which in future revisions of eIDAS could be  considered as a trust service itself, is the management of a remote signature / seal creation  device (QSCD) which provides the secure basis of remote signing service. In this service, the  user’s signing key is secured using an HSM under the remote control of an authenticated user  to provide a remote QSCD.  • Registration services. The registration of customers is an important part of several trust  services, notably for TSPs issuing certificates under EN 319 411-1 clause 6.2, and registered  electronic delivery services and REMS as defined in clause 5.2 of EN 319 521 and EN 319  531 respectively.  The registration requirements can be further detailed using TS 119 461: Policy and security  requirements for trust service components providing identity proofing of trust service subjects.  TS 119 461 gives policy and security requirements for trust service components providing  identity proofing of trust service subjects. Such identity proofing can be provided by the TSP  itself as an integral part of the trust service, or by a specialised identity proofing service  provider acting as a subcontractor to the TSP.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  29  Registration requirements could be met by a TSP’s own registration software running on a  CSP platform (IaaS, PaaS – see Section 1.4.1). Where such services bind an authentication  means to the registration, special attention needs to be given to any authentication services  provided by the CSP, to ensure that they match the assurance requirements for electronic  identification, such as defined in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) CIR 2015/1502.  The functionality of registration services is the responsibility of the TSP.  • Subject device provision service. In EN 319 411-1, subject device provisioning is  considered to be part of registration and identity proofing, as specified in clause 6.2.2.  Provisioning of user signing devices is part of the operation of the registration service under  control of the TSP outside the cloud services.  EN 319 411-2 clause 6.3 gives specific requirements for the issuance of qualified certificates  when the QSCD is managed for the subject. In this case, the private key must not be used for  signing, except within a QSCD and only under the subject’s sole control. Generally, this is the  responsibility of the TSP.  The management of a remote signature / seal creation device (QSCD), while it may be  considered as a special case of subject device provisioning, is addressed as a separate trust  service below.  • Certificate generation. EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.3.1–6.3.8 cover the general requirements for  generating certificates, including issuance, renewal, re-key and modification. In addition, when  a certificate is issued, it has to be signed by the TSP using a key managed in an HSM in  accordance with clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4.  The requirements covered in EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.3.1–6.3.9 are generally covered by the  TSP software.  EN 319 411-1 clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4 specify requirements relating to key pair generation. The  subsequent certification of the public key shall be undertaken in a physically secure  environment by personnel in trusted roles. The key pair used for signing certificates shall be  created under at least dual control. The number of personnel authorised to carry out CA key  pair generation must be kept to a minimum. These requirements cannot be addressed by  using a ‘shared HSM’ provided by the CSP. If a single-tenant HSM is provided by the CSP,  checks will need to be made to ensure that these requirements are met, in particular regarding  aspects that require at least dual control by trusted personnel. CSPs generally only support  FIPS 140-2 level 3 HSMs and preference is given to the European standard EN 419 221-5.  The use by CSPs of FIPS 140-2 level 2 HSM is not sufficient for most trust services.  • Revocation management. Requirements for revocation (and suspension) management are  specified in EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3.9 and EN 319 411-2 clause 6.3.9. The requirements for  revocation management in these clauses are generally procedural and can be implemented  by the TSP. As long as the CSP provides true separation of uses and secure management of  code, this is the responsibility of the TSP.  EN 319 411-1 clause 6.6 specifies requirements relating to profiles of certificates, certificate  revocation lists and Online Certificate Status Protocols (OCSPs). The profile is a matter of  configuring the TSP’s own certificate software.  • Certificate revocation status service. EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3.10 specifies requirements  for providing information on the revocation status of certificates, using certificate revocation  lists or OCSPs. In addition, when issuing information on certificate status, this has to be  signed by the TSP using a key managed in an HSM in accordance with clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  30  ETSI EN 319 411-2 in section 6.3.10 also adds additional requirements for qualified  certificates which are eIDAS compliant.  The requirements specified in EN 319 411-1 clause 6.3.10 are generally procedural and can  be implemented by the TSP. As long as the CSP provides true separation of uses and secure  management of code, this is a responsibility of the TSP.  The requirements for managing the TSP keys in accordance with clauses 6.5.1–6.5.4 cannot  be addressed by using a shared HSM provided by the CSP. This requires at least an HSM  provided by the TSP, hosted by the CSP and with remote HSM management. If a single- tenant HSM is provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to ensure that these  requirements are met, in particular regarding aspects that require at least dual control by  trusted personnel.  3.3.1.3. TSP issuing certificates – general conclusions  Most of the aspects of these policy requirements are likely to be met by CSPs, particularly those  offering a virtual infrastructure (IaaS – see Section 1.4.1). Nevertheless, before this can be  confirmed, detailed checks on provisions of a particular CSP against the EN 319 411-1 and EN  319 411-2 policy requirements are required. The use of cryptographic services and HSMs  require particular attention. The assurance of dual control of the management of the TSP  signing keys held in an HSM is a particular concern. This is best met using a TSP-provided  HSM, where the keys are managed remotely by the TSP personnel. Detailed investigation of  the provision of some CSPs called single-tenant HSMs is necessary to see whether this  provides the appropriate level of control of the TSP’s signing keys.  3.3.2.  REMOTE SIGNING SERVICE USING CLOUD SERVICES  Two critical elements of the remote signing service are: (i) the use of a specialised HSM, which  ensures that the use of the signing key is, with a high level of confidentiality, under the control of  the signatory; and (ii) the means used for authentication and identification of the signer. For the  signing device to be considered as a remote QSCD, the signature activation module in the  specialised secure devices (e.g. an HSM) has to be certified under EN 419 241-2 and EN 419  221-5. This device has to be under the direct control of the TSP. Thus, it is not considered that  this service could be provided by a CSP, unless very special arrangements are made to give the  TSP sole control of the specialised HSM device.  The authentication and identification means are required to meet the requirements specified in  Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 at a ‘substantial’ or ‘high’ level. Thus, unless the CSP  can demonstrate that their authentication meets these requirements, specific steps have to be  taken by the TSP to meet this regulatory requirement.  3.3.3. TIME STAMPING  EN 319 421 clause 5 specifies requirements related to a time stamp policy called ‘best practices  time-stamp policy for TSAs issuing time stamps’. This policy is supported by public key  certificates. The policies and general requirements deal mainly with matters relating to TSP  management of policies outside the scope of a CSP. A time-stamping service provider is  required to manage their own practice statement. The general requirements for policy  management are outside the scope of the CSP. The certification practice statement needs to  cover the practice statement requirements defined in EN 319 401 and identify the obligations of  all external organisations supporting the TSP services, including the applicable policies and  practices.  EN 319 421 clauses 7.6.2 and 7.6.3 specify requirements relating to time-stamping unit (TSU)  key generation and key protection. Provision of time-stamping services requires the use of  HSMs with keys generated by trusted personnel under dual control. If a single-tenant HSM is  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  31  provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to ensure these requirements are met, in  particular regarding aspects that require at least dual control by trusted personnel.  EN 319 421 clause 7.6.6 specifies requirements relating to specific controls over life cycle  management of signing cryptographic hardware. This ensures that the HSM is shipped, stored  and retired securely. If a TSP-provided HSM is not a CSP issue but for single-tenant HSMs,  checks will need to be made on the CSP procedures for the management of HSMs. This also  includes requirements for dual control of activation of the TSU key, which require particular  checks, as for key generation (see clause 7.6.2 above).  EN 319 421 clause 7.6.7 specifies requirements relating to the expiration date of TSU keys.  This generally concerns management of the TSU key lifetime, which is a TSP issue. However, it  also includes requirements for the destruction of private signing keys at the end of lifetime,  which would require specific checks on CSP operations in the case of single-tenant HSMs.  EN 319 421 clause 7.7 specifies requirements relating to TSU time issuance and clock  synchronisation with UTC within 1 second. The time stamps are required to be issued securely  and include the correct time. Time stamps are required to conform to the time-stamp profile as  defined in ETSI EN 319 422. Apart from the use of a compliant time-stamp profile, this is  concerned with ensuring synchronisation of time with UTC. This should be possible with most  CSPs but requires specific checks on the tracing of time synchronisation back to a trusted UTC  source.  EN 319 421 clause 7.8 specifies requirements relating to physical security. The time-stamping  management facilities are required to be operated in an environment which physically and  logically protects the services from compromise through unauthorised access to systems or  data. Every entry to the physically secure area has to be authorised and logged. Physical  protection is achieved through the creation of clearly defined security perimeters around the  time-stamping management facilities. Any parts of the premises shared with other organisations  have to be outside this perimeter. Physical and environmental security controls have to protect  the facility that houses system resources, the system resources themselves and the facilities  used to support their operation. The TSA’s physical and environmental security policy for  systems concerned with time-stamping management has to address, at a minimum, physical  access control, natural disaster protection, fire safety factors, failure of supporting utilities (e.g.  power, telecommunications), structure collapse, plumbing leaks, protection against theft,  breaking and entering and disaster recovery. Controls must protect against equipment,  information, media and software relating to the time-stamping services being taken off-site  without authorisation. All of this needs to be covered by CSP statements of practice and  conformity assessment. The use of Cloud Services to provide isolated virtual platforms assure a  degree of separation from other web based services but whether it can provide the same  assurance of physical separation requires further investigation.  EN 319 421 clause 7.9 specifies requirements relating to system planning, as part of  operational security. Capacity demand is required to be monitored and projections of future  capacity requirements must be made, to ensure that adequate processing power and storage  are available. Those requirements need specific checks on CSP operations.  EN 319 421 clause 7.10 specifies requirements relating to maintenance and protection of all  TSU systems in a secure zone. Configurations of all TSU systems require removing or disabling  all accounts, applications, services, protocols and ports that are not used in the TSA’s  operations. Only trusted roles are allowed to access secure zones and high-security zones. All  this must be covered by CSP practices and certifications but may require additional checking.  EN 319 421 clause 7.12 specifies requirements relating to the collection of evidence. Following  requirements in EN 319 401, the TSP is required to record and keep accessible for an  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  32  appropriate period of time, including after the activities of the TSP have ceased, all relevant  information concerning data issued and received by the TSP. On top of general controls, EN  319 421 specifies requirements to record all relevant information concerning all events relating  to the life cycles of TSU keys and TSU certificates. Additionally, all events relating to the  synchronisation of a TSU’s clock to UTC and the detection of loss of synchronisation is required  to be logged. If a CSP provides services related to securing event logs, this requires special  treatment in relevant policies and agreements.  EN 319 421 clause 7.13 specifies requirements relating to business continuity. The TSA  disaster recovery plan should include a violation or suspected violation of TSU private signing  keys or loss of TSU clock calibration that may have affected the issued time stamps. In the  event of compromise or suspected compromise or loss of calibration when issuing a time stamp,  the TSA must provide all subscribers and relying parties with a description of the compromise.  This includes specific requirements for handling compromises, which would be managed by the  TSP.  EN 319 421 clause 7.14 specifies requirements relating to termination of the service. The TSA  is required to revoke the TSU’s certificates. Specific requirements for revocation of certificates  can be a matter for the TSP.  3.3.4.  E-DELIVERY SERVICES  EN 319 521 clause 4 specifies requirements relating to general provisions on policies and  practices, which build on EN 319 401 (general requirements for trust service practices and  policies). The practice statement and policy are managed by the TSP and hence outside the  scope of the CSP. However, the practice statement needs to clearly state where use is made of  third-party services such as a CSP. The ERDS practice statement includes a description of how  the ERDS provision ensures the security of transmission against any risk of loss, theft, damage  or any unauthorised alterations, and that it needs to involve the CSP if applicable.  EN 319 521 clause 5.1 specifies requirements relating to content integrity and confidentiality,  including the use of digital signatures or other mechanisms to protect content. The TSP protects  the integrity of user content and associated metadata in transmissions, especially when  exchanged with the sender/recipient or between distributed ERDS system components, and in  storage. This should be generally met by security and privacy controls of the CSP, although  checks will be needed against the specific requirements.  EN 319 521 clause 5.2 specifies requirements relating to user Identification and authentication.  This generally concerns identity checks on the ERDS/REMS user and user authentication. If the  identification of the recipient for the qualified service is based on an internal process, the TSP  conducts the whole process in a secured and controlled environment; the TSP gathers and  protects all evidence of identification and consignment or handover process. This is mainly  covered by the TSP software, hardware and procedures, but specific checks will be necessary  according to provision by the CSP of the environment and protection of evidence.  EN 319 521 clause 5.3 specifies requirements relating to time reference. In the case of a  qualified service, a qualified time stamp must be used, which is a matter for the TSP. Otherwise,  no specific requirements on time synchronisation are stated for non-qualified services.  EN 319 521 clause 5.4 specifies requirements relating to events and evidence and specifies the  information to be recorded relating to events, which is a matter for the TSP. It also requires the  CSP to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability logs, which are important for checking  the CSP against privacy and security controls (see also EN 319 421 clause 7.10).  EN 319 521 clause 5.5 specifies requirements relating to interoperability. This is a matter for the  TSP-provided software.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  33  EN 319 521 clause 6 specifies requirements relating to risk assessment and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401.  EN 319 521 clauses 7.1–7.4 specify requirements relating to organisation, human resources,  asset management and access control. These requirements are covered by general EN 319  401 requirements, with the addition of specific TSP procedures.  EN 319 521 clause 7.5 specifies requirements relating to cryptographic controls. It requires the  use of a secure cryptographic device but does not require the use of a certified HSM. If CSP  cryptographic services are used, these will need to be checked against the specific  requirements. In particular, there is a requirement for dual control of trusted persons for backup,  storage and recovery of the service provider’s private signing keys.  EN 319 521 clause 7.6 specifies requirements relating to physical and environmental security  and addresses physical access control, natural disaster protection, fire safety factors, failure of  supporting utilities, structure collapse, plumbing leaks, protection against theft, breaking and  entering and disaster recovery. The TSP is required to implement controls to protect against  equipment, information, media and software relating to the provision of the ERDS being taken  off-site without authorisation. Additionally, the TSP is required to protect facility housing system  resources, the system resources themselves and the facilities used to support their operation.  All this must be covered by CSP practices and certifications but may require additional  checking.  EN 319 521 clause 7.7 specifies requirements relating to operational security and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401.  EN 319 521 clause 7.8 specifies requirements relating to network security, which follow the  requirements of EN 319 401. In addition, the clause requires projections of future capacity  requirements to ensure that adequate processing power and storage are available. The TSP is  also required to use state-of-the-art protocols and algorithms for encryption on the transport  layer level. Additional requirements would need to be checked but are expected to be  addressed by general CSP provisions.  EN 319 521 clause 7.9 specifies requirements relating to incident management and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401.  EN 319 521 clause 7.10 specifies requirements relating to collection of evidence. The TSP is  required to log all security events, including changes relating to the security policy, system start- up and shutdown, system crashes and hardware failures, firewall and router activities and PKI  system access attempts. The TSP is also required to define at least a 2-year retention period for  security logs. Specific requirements are the responsibility of the TSP, but CSP practices may  require additional checking.  EN 319 521 clause 7.11 specifies requirements relating to business continuity and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401. There are specific requirements for backup and storage in safe  places that are suitable to allow the TSP to quickly return to operations in case of  incidents/disasters. The TSP is required to provide adequate recovery facilities to ensure that all  essential information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure and to  set up regular tests to ensure that the facilities meet the requirements of business continuity  plans. If a CSP is involved in providing facilities enabling business continuity, the CSP practices  may require additional checking.  EN 319 521 clause 7.12 specifies requirements relating to termination plans and follows the  requirements of EN 319 401. Additional requirements to keep the collected evidence for the  national statutory time may need to be implemented by the TSP software.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  34  Most of the aspects of these policy requirements are likely to be met by CSPs, particularly those  offering a virtual infrastructure (IaaS). Nevertheless, before this can be confirmed, detailed  checks on provisions of a particular CSP against the EN 319 521 policy requirements are  required. The use of cryptographic services and HSMs requires particular attention, but the  standard does not impose any requirements on the certification of HSMs.  3.3.5.  SIGNATURE PRESERVATION SERVICES  ETSI TS 119 511 clauses 5 and 6 specify requirements for risk analysis and management of the  policies and practices of TSPs. These are outside the scope of the CSP.  Much of ETSI TS 119 441-clause 7 (other than clause 7.5 on cryptographic controls) includes  general requirements on the operation of the validation service, building on EN 319 401. This  would be generally covered by the CSP’s practices and certifications, but checks would be  necessary against the requirements of the TSP, as applied to the validation services.  EN 319 421 clause 7.5 on cryptographic controls provides requirements for the time-stamping  authority that is used in support of preservation services. Thus, the assessment given in  Section 3.3.3 applies to this aspect of preservation services. In the case that the preservation  service signs preservation evidence, as with other TSP cryptographic services issuing signed  data, these requirements cannot be addressed by using a shared HSM provided by the CSP. If  a single-tenant HSM is provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to ensure these  requirements are met, especially regarding aspects that require at least dual control by trusted  personnel.  3.3.6.  SIGNATURE VALIDATION  ETSI TS 119 441 clauses 5 and 6 specify requirements for risk analysis and management of the  policies and practices of TSPs. These are outside the scope of the CSP.  Much of ETSI TS 119 441 clause 7 (other than clause 7.5 on cryptographic controls) include  general requirements on the operation of the validation service, building on EN 319 401. This  would be generally covered by the CSPs practices and certifications, but checks would be  necessary against the requirements of the TSP as applied to the validation services.  ETSI TS 119 441 clause 7.5 includes similar requirements on the cryptographic controls applied  to the signing of validation reports. As with other TSP cryptographic services issuing signed  data, these requirements cannot be addressed by using a shared HSM provided by the CSP.  This requires at least an HSM provided by the TSP, hosted by the CSP and with remote HSM  management. If a single-tenant HSM is provided by the CSP, checks will need to be made to  ensure these requirements are met, regarding aspects that require at least dual control by  trusted personnel.  The technical requirements in ETSI TS 119 441 clause 8 specify requirements on the operation  of the validation service in a correct manner, aligned with the referenced standards. Provided  that the CSP provides true separation of uses and secure management of code, this is just a  concern of the TSP.  3.4.  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES  The previous sections analysed multiple standards for the move of trust services to the cloud. A  detailed overview was given on the requirements that both sides (TSP and CSP) have to fulfil in  order to implement the services on a cloud platform. The following section presents practical  experiences and considerations of TSPs, CSPs, NA/SBs, CABs and providers of solutions to  TSPs regarding the transition of trust services to the cloud. The findings come from a survey  that was conducted during the creation of this report, with over 120 participants from over 29  countries in the EU and globally.  Survey details  Participation of over  120 stakeholders  from over 29  countries in the EU  and globally.  50 % of the TSPs  that participated in  the survey already  operate or plan to  operate at least parts  of their trust services  in the cloud.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  35  The survey results have shown that there is a high interest in operating trust services in the  cloud. 50 % of the TSPs who participated in the survey already operate or plan to operate at  least parts of their trust services in the cloud. This number clearly shows that TSPs are moving  their services to the cloud. In comparison, only 12 % stated that they do not consider it at all.  This trend is also reflected in the responses from the NA/SBs: 39 % of them have stated that  they have direct experience with TSPs operating their services on a cloud. From the perspective  of NA/SBs, the use of trust services on a cloud has already been adopted to a large extent.  11 % stated that TSPs have asked them to consider TSPs using cloud services. 15 % of the  NA/SBs do not see the move of trust services to the cloud as a requirement or do not consider it  practical.  In the following section, a detailed analysis of the survey results will be given. TSPs and  solution providers to TSPs were the most represented stakeholder group in the survey results.  Together they made up more 75 % of the respondents. For the analysis of the results this has  no impact, as each stakeholder received their respective survey. In total, five different  questionnaires were created. The results were analysed individually and put into context where  appropriate, as the following section will show.  Figure 6: Types of stakeholders that participated in the survey  All stakeholders were asked which trust services could in their opinion be operated on the  cloud. TSPs and technical solution providers had different response options due to their  differing offer in services. Furthermore, the CABs were asked about the possibility of an audit of  the services, which will be further discussed in Section 4. The following table shows the services  that were mostly chosen by TSPs, NA/SBs and CSPs.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  36  Figure 7: Trust services that are mostly considered to be operated on a cloud platform by  TSPs, NA/SBs and CSPs  The figure shows that there are some differences among the TSPs, NA/SBs and CSPs. The  revocation status information and the preservation of seals and signatures were not considered  at all by CSPs. The survey also contained many more response options that were selected in  lower percentages.  It is noticeable that services such as time stamping or e-delivery are not among the most  chosen services. As explained in earlier sections, the necessary requirements and standards to  operate these services on the cloud already exist. However, when comparing the overall  services offered by TSPs according to the EU trusted list, neither of them are usually in the  portfolio of trust services.  We can say that the results reflect the current landscape of services that TSPs usually offer.  The management of user keys is the service mostly chosen by CSPs, whereas NA/SBs  consider this less likely to be operated on the cloud. Apart from the management of user keys,  qualified time stamps, qualified electronic signatures and validation services were each chosen  equally by 50 % of the providers that participated in the survey.  As mentioned above, the services offered by technical solution providers differ from those  offered by TSPs, which is why the results will be presented in a separate figure. The survey  showed that 48 % of the solution providers to TSPs already provide solutions for trust services  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  37  on a cloud platform and another 24 % plan to do so. In comparison, 16 % stated that they do  not consider providing solutions for TSPs on a cloud platform. All results can be found in the  Annex of this report.  The figure below shows the solutions or parts of solutions that could be placed on a cloud  platform.  Figure 8: Solutions mostly chosen to be operated on a cloud platform by technical solution  providers  When asked about the specific elements of the solutions that could be placed in the cloud,  event logs, data, backups and access control were the most selected responses. With regards  to trust services, the providers were asked to state the PKI-related parts of their solution that  could be placed in the cloud. Signature validation and a shared PKI service were selected most  often. Apart from that, time stamping, signature creation, revocation and certificate issuance  and renewal were the most chosen services. This assessment is consistent with the responses  from the trust services and NA/SBs.  In Section 1, the main cloud service provisions were described. The following figure illustrates  the preferred type of cloud by TSPs.  Figure 9: Preferred type of cloud by TSPs  While big global providers are most dominant in the market, the preference for a local cloud  solution is comparably high. Depending on security and infrastructure measures, some services  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  38  require a localised HSM under the control of a TSP. Thus, when it comes to the type of cloud  that is preferred by TSPs, many of them chose a hybrid solution of public and local clouds.  Some CSPs see perceived regulatory obstacles for cloud services from Member States. Most  CSPs support international certifications, which in their view are better suited to ensure  customer and CSP security needs.  The following figure illustrates the adoption of the main standards by CSPs identified in  Section 2.3. The ‘Other’ option includes global and regional certifications. The numbers show  the percentages of CSPs stating that they had adopted or planned to adopt the respective  standards.  Figure 10: Security and privacy standards that CSPs have adopted or plan to adopt in the  future  Before having a closer look at the benefits of moving trust services to the cloud, the  impediments that were mentioned by the survey participants will be presented. When  implementing eIDAS trust services in a cloud or when intending to do so, compliance with EU  standards in particular is crucial. CSPs that have implemented the transition have experienced  a lack of appropriately conformity-assessed CSPs. Fulfilling the requirements of ETSI EN 319  401 is a core precondition. This result goes along with the earlier sections describing  requirements for CSPs. One of the main reasons as to why coherence with EU standards is so  important is the set of auditing requirements. In Section 4, further details on the evaluation of  trust services in the cloud will be given.  Apart from the audit, the security requirements of the CSPs might not match those of some  Member States (such as Italy). Typical cloud providers offer ‘basic’ security whereas TSPs need  ‘high’ levels to fulfil eIDAS requirements. Apart from the defined security requirements, other  measures that go along with the security concept of the providers might differ, which can lead to  a lack in transparency, for example regarding the geographic positioning of services and related  data centres.  The considerations and possible impediments that have been stated by solution providers  mainly refer to the risk of non-EU entities accessing data and processes that are operated in a  cloud. The lack of standardisation for clouds could lead to privacy and security-related  problems.  From the perspective of NA/SBs, the increase in complexity, the loss of control of information  (user information, privacy, GDPR) and a potential lack of knowledge about how to handle these  trust services were all stated as possible impediments or reasons to not use trust services  operated in the cloud. However, its practical use is recognised.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  39  Figure 11: Impediments mentioned by TSPs, TSP solution providers, NA/SBs and CABs  While there are still some hurdles and open questions regarding trust services in the cloud, the  numbers clearly show a trend towards this transition. There are several benefits in providing  trust services or components in the cloud. The flexibility of choice of the platform is one of them.  This implies greater scalability and adaptation to changing environments. Another benefit is the  cost-saving aspect that results in flexibility. A TSP can easily change to another CSP. Another  big advantage of using cloud services is the set of recovery services and backup systems that  can work from the same CSP or from another CSP. Changes in structure, system or languages  are thus implemented quicker and more safely.  Figure 12: Benefits mentioned by TSPs, TSP solution providers, NA/SBs and CABs  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  40  All of these benefits can lead to an extension of services, as there is growth in usage. Moving  trust services to the cloud can thus help achieve business objectives and play an important role  in their success.  3.5.  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS  Most of the aspects of the policy requirements for the trust services considered in this section  are likely to be met by CSPs, particularly those offering a virtual infrastructure (IaaS – see  Section 1.4.1). Nevertheless, before this can be confirmed, detailed checks on provisions of a  particular CSP against the specific policy requirements of the particular trust services to be  supported are required.  The use of cryptographic services and HSMs requires particular attention. The assurance of  dual control of the management of the TSP signing keys held in an HSM is a particular concern.  This is best met using a TSP-provided HSM, where the keys are managed remotely by the TSP  personnel. Detailed investigation of the provision of some CSPs called single-tenant HSMs is  necessary to see whether this provides the appropriate level of control of the TSP signing keys.  CSPs generally only support FIPS 140-2 level 3 HSMs and preference is given to the European  standard EN 419 221-5. The use by CSPs of FIPS 140-2 level 2 HSM is not sufficient for most  trust services.  Certificate generation and revocation management services, and time-stamping services are  required to use security zones and to be physically isolated from any other organisation's  services.  It remains to be seen whether the same security isolation can be achieved using  virtual platforms provided by cloud services.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  41  4. EVALUATION OF TRUST  SERVICES IN THE CLOUD  This section considers the issues with the evaluation and audit of trust services in the cloud.  4.1.  ACCREDITATION AND CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT SCHEME  UNDER eIDAS  A key policy choice made by the eIDAS regulation is that in order to be granted a qualified  status by a national supervisory authority, TSPs must first demonstrate that they and the QTSs  they plan to provide meet the functional requirements of the regulation. This implies that TSPs  and the QTSs they intend to provide need to undergo a specific process and receive approval  from a competent national SB to attest to their conformity with the requirements. If successful,  this process leads to their inclusion in the national trusted list attesting their qualified status.  As part of this process, the prospective QTSP/QTS must be audited by an eIDAS-accredited  CAB to confirm, through a conformity assessment (audit) report, that they meet the  requirements of the eIDAS regulation. The CAB needs to be accredited by an NAB in line with  Regulation (EU) 765/2008, based on a suitable eIDAS conformity assessment scheme and the  CAB’s competence for assessing the compliance QTSPs and the QTSs they provide (hereafter  QTSPs/QTSs) with the eIDAS requirements.  The requirements on the CAB and the conformity assessment report referred to in Articles 20(1)  and 21(1) are further specified by Article 3(18) of the eIDAS regulation. Article 20(1) of the  eIDAS regulation requires that ‘the purpose of the audit shall be to confirm that the [QTSP] and  the [QTS] provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in this Regulation.’ Consequently,  the resulting conformity assessment report must include a formal conformity statement  confirming, when applicable, that the audited QTSP/QTS meets all of the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS regulation.  The accreditation of the CAB under eIDAS must ensure that the conformity assessment  activities used by such an independent body are such that there is a justifiable trust that the  QTSPs/QTSs meet the requirements laid down in the eIDAS regulation.  Neither the business nor the technical model can be imposed upon the QTSPs, nor a specific  standard to be followed for the QTS it provides. (Q)TSP/(Q)TS have to demonstrate their  compliance (building upon standards if it is deemed appropriate) with the requirements of the  eIDAS regulation, while the SB cannot refuse to grant the qualified status solely on the grounds  that the proposed model does not comply with a given standard or a given business or technical  model. However, in practical terms, supervisory and accreditation authorities have built the  scheme on the ETSI standards referred to above.  When using cloud services in support of a trust service the overall conformity assessment of the  trust service(s) is the responsibility of the trust service provider.  Inevitably there will be aspects  of the trust service, such as management of the operation of the trust service by trusted  personnel, which will not be met by the CSP.  It is the responsibility of the TSP to provide its  auditor with evidence that it meets all the operational and technical requirements of the trust  service.  This will require the TSP to provide evidence that requirements of the services of the  CSP, on which the TSP depends, are met for example by the CSP through certifications with  more detailed information as considered necessary by the auditor.  89 % of the CABs  stated that the  terms and  conditions of CSPs  do not contain  adequate clauses  allowing access for  auditors to perform  TSP assessments.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  42  4.2.  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES  A significant number of TSPs – not only CAs but also qualified certified electronic delivery or  time-stamping services – are migrating to or establishing their services directly in the cloud. The  level of integration with CSPs varies, but in general the service is hosted and operated from the  cloud by the provider’s staff on their premises.  This poses a number of challenges in implementing TSPs requirements and in auditing them  when they provide the trust service from the cloud. Some of the main problems encountered in  carrying out the compliance assessment are shown below.  • Inability to access data centres to assess physical security and other location-related  aspects. Large CSPs do not allow entry to CAB auditors or those appointed by the  providers themselves for various reasons, including business secrecy, impossibility of  handling such a large number of audits, location of data centres in another jurisdiction  and virtualisation of the service.  • Difficulty in accessing the CSP audit reports, which makes it impossible to verify the  work done by other auditors with other scopes and the total or partial overlap with the  scope of the trusted service.  • Difficulty in determining the contractual responsibility for the implementation of each of  the requirements and therefore in the review during the evaluation, always bearing in  mind that the responsibility for compliance with all the requirements always lies with  the TSP.  To solve these issues, a Spanish CAB has initiated a project with a CSP to identify the  responsibility for each control, i.e. to determine whether the controls implemented by the  provider on other accredited schemes fully or partially overlap with those required of the TSP  and its service(s). Using this information, it is possible to establish an audit time with greater  precision, to improve the analysis of the evaluation of the TSPs hosted by that CSP and to  reduce the time required to request and evaluate documents.  However, there is still the problem that the assessment of the controls that the TSP has  contractually outsourced to the cloud provider can only be done in a documentary manner,  which reduces the quality of the audit. This problem needs to be addressed.  Figure 13: Standards CABs recognise as supporting compliance audits of TSPs providing  services in the cloud (%)  Other  standards  There is a limitation  about the recognition  of other standards in  the sense of  accepting them  instead of performing  an own assessment.  It would be helpful to  get clear normative  and legal regulations  supporting the reuse  of assessments/audit  results/certifications  of other parties.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  43  5. CONCLUSIONS  The current report has examined the potential of moving trust services as defined in the eIDAS  regulation to the cloud. The applied method focused on analysing existing standards and the  technical requirements which have to be addressed for such movement to occur. In this report,  the current landscape of technical EU requirements that include a possibility for a move of trust  services to the cloud was presented and the survey results showed that there is interest from  TSPs to provide services from a cloud and from cloud providers to offer a platform for such  service. However, each specific case requires a detailed analysis to meet security and privacy  needs, as the individual requirements and the processes of offering trust services on the cloud  also highly depend on the CSPs and their requirements and capabilities.  The assessments of this report are based on the assumption that CSPs already follow the  mentioned standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002). Above all, there are existing EU  regulations that cloud services providers need to comply with, especially regarding privacy  issues and the GDPR, where private data is held in the cloud. Looking at these requirements, it  can be stated that a requirement for moving trust services to the cloud is that the cloud services  are provided from within the EU. The implications of the application of NIS 2 to trust services  which operate on the cloud require further study.  This report has identified the role of the HSM and the control over it as important aspects to be  addressed when planning to move trust services to the cloud. To ensure security, it is  indispensable that the TSP retains the control over the keys held in the HSM and their use in  signing. There are some cloud providers (even big global players) that allow the TSP to install  their own HSM and retain control over the keys. Others allow only temporary control over the  keys, which is called ‘temporary tenants’ or ‘multi-tenants’. From the perspective of the HSM  provider, the provision of key attestations, the knowledge of the cryptographic capacity and  when its limits are reached and the backup of data when using a remote HSM need to be  addressed. Preference is given to the use of HSMs certified under European standards EN 419  221-5 and EN 419 241-2.  Certain aspects of trust services are required by existing standards to use security zones and to  be physically isolated from any other organisation's services.  It remains to be seen whether the  same security isolation can be achieved using virtual platforms provided by cloud services.  From the audit perspective, the survey results have particularly shown that there is still  insecurity and open questions when it comes to auditing trust services remotely. While there are  standards which CABs recognise as supporting compliance audits of TSPs providing services in  the cloud (ISO 27017, ISO 27701, EU cloud cyber certification), most CABs think that the terms  and conditions of CSPs contain adequate clauses allowing access for auditors to perform TSP  assessments. Auditing TSPs that offer their services on a cloud requires the cooperation of  CSPs. This can take the form of physical access to the cloud service premises to perform the  compliance assessment of the TSP’s requirements, remote access to its system or the provision  of all necessary documentation for the TSP’s evaluation. However, the latter was evaluated by  the CABs who answered the survey as insufficient when generic cloud service is used in  support of a TSP. While some impediments from the audit perspective exist, the survey results  have shown that CABs can already perform audits on many trust services. It is important to note  that CABs carrying out assessments in the context of EUCS should be accredited to ISO 17065  and meet the additional requirements specified for EUCS.  TRUST SERVICES – SECURE MOVE TO THE CLOUD OF THE eIDAS ECOSYSTEM  MAY 2023  44  All in all, moving trust services to the cloud must be understood as an ongoing process that has  to be followed on a step-by-step basis. While some services – such as the validation of  signatures, delivery, time stamp or preservation – are moved rather quickly, other services –  such as the issuance of certificates and remote control over the signing device – require in- depth analysis and preparation. This also applies to the different components of trust services.  Either way, during the time of the move, the communication between the CSP and the data  centre needs to be secured and protected from attacks. The transition of data to the cloud has  to be secured at all times and, in the best case, remain in the data centre of the TSP. Some  services might not be suitable for operating on the cloud.  There are multiple benefits to moving trust services to the cloud. The main ones identified in this  report are the ability to extend services, cost savings and more choice and flexibility in choosing  the platform. 50 % of the TSPs who participated in the survey already operate or plan to operate  at least parts of their trust services in the cloud. This number clearly shows that TSPs are  moving their services to the cloud. This development is ongoing and we can expect more TSPs  to move their services to the cloud. This report has given a detailed overview of the issues to be  addressed for such a transition, including the related challenges and opportunities.

    "abstract": "This report includes a detailed analysis on the different technical requirements that must be addressed considering the relevant standards. It also gives an overview of practical experiences on the move of trust services to the cloud, based on the results of a survey conducted with over 120 participants. The report finds that there are many existing requirements on the TSP side that can be considered and potentially applied to cloud service providers (CSPs)."

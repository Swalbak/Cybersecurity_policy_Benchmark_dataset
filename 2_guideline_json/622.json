A turning point in the history of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA),  2019 set the agency’s future in motion. My esteemed predecessor, Prof. Dr Udo  Helmbrecht, brought to a conclusion 10 years of successful management, paving the  way for the most significant of the year’s achievements: the Cybersecurity Act (CSA),  which came into force in June 2019, providing the agency with a permanent mandate  and significantly extending the scope of its activities.  In addition to expanding the existing activities of the agency, the CSA gives ENISA an  operational role and mandates it to implement the cybersecurity certification framework,  a new challenge that the agency already started to address in 2019. The provisions of  the CSA enhance the capacity of the agency to act as a centre of expertise for the EU,  its Member States and the private and public sectors.  The CSA also establishes the new Advisory Group. Formerly known as the Permanent  Stakeholder Group, its purpose is to take on board the opinions of key stakeholders  such as industry, academia and relevant EU agencies and bodies as well as consumer  protection specialists.  The act also requires us to look to the future in order to ensure that the technological  developments that are about to change our society are properly secure. Today’s  information security must integrate the various concepts used to develop the emerging  technologies of tomorrow, an idea that is reflected in the new name given to ENISA by  the CSA: the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity.  These being significant changes, the introduction of the CSA necessarily had an impact on  the planning of activities. Working closely with its Management Board, ENISA identified a  series of amendments to be made to its work programme to reflect the key changes. I am  happy to report that the revised work programme was successfully implemented during  the course of 2019, the details of which are provided in this report.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 7  As part of this work, the agency continued to reach out to stakeholders through major  events, including the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) (which concluded in  Romania), the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) and the fifth eHealth Security  Conference organised in partnership with the Centre de Seguretat de la Informació  de Catalunya (Centre for Information Security of Catalonia) (CESICAT). Such events  demonstrate ENISA’s ability to draw communities together and further enhance  collaboration across Member States.  As in previous years, the agency delivered a series of publications on important  areas in cybersecurity. These included texts covering a wide range of topics,  providing recommendations and information on securing modern technologies  (e.g. how to implement security by design for the internet of things (IoT) and the  threat landscape of 5G networks), along with a substantial number of reports on  more traditional subjects (e.g. good practices for the security of healthcare services  and good practices for maritime security (port cybersecurity)).  The agency delivered a wide range of training sessions such as those offered during  the sixth Summer School on Network and Information Security (NIS). The topics  covered ranged from quantum computing and cryptography to cyberthreat analysis  and cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). The event was successfully co-organised with the  Foundation for Research and Technology – Hellas (FORTH) based in Heraklion, Crete.  The agency would not have achieved the successful results presented in this report  without the precious support of all our stakeholders and of the communities, European  institutions and bodies and Member States engaged with us in the challenge of keeping  Europe secure. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. I am especially grateful for the  level of commitment evidenced by the achievements of 2019.  Finally, it is time for me to congratulate those passionate professionals at the heart  of ENISA, namely the staff, for their unfailing motivation and engagement. They are  the ones creating the synergies behind the success of the European Union Agency  for Cybersecurity.  Juhan Lepassaar  Executive Director, ENISA  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 91  A new legal basis in 2019  ENISA was established in 20041. The first 4-year  mandate of the former European Network and  Information Security Agency was extended without  interruption in 2009, 2011 and 2013.  The CSA, signed on 17 April 2019, came into force  on 27 June of the same year. Under this new act,  ENISA’s tasks are reinforced and extended with the  new activities under the cybersecurity certification  framework. ENISA’s areas of action are the following:    expertise    policy    capacity    cooperation    certification    enabling.  The CSA also gives the agency a new name – ‘The  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’ – and, for  the first time in its history, a permanent mandate.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and  communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act), OJ  L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 15, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/ reg/2019/881/oj  Mission  ENISA’s mission is to contribute to securing Europe’s  information society. This is achieved by raising  awareness of cybersecurity and by developing and  promoting a culture of NIS in society for the benefit  of citizens, consumers and public and private  organisations in the EU.  The role of ENISA is therefore to ensure a high level  of NIS within the EU. Acting as a centre of expertise,  ENISA supports European institutions and bodies and  Member States to that end.  ENISA’s tasks are the following:    development and implementation of EU policy  and law,    capacity building,    operational cooperation at EU level,    market cybersecurity certification and  standardisation,    knowledge and information sharing,    awareness raising and education,    research and innovation,    international cooperation.

The Executive Board received a copy of the 2019 AAR  produced by the Executive Director of ENISA in his  quality of Authorising Officer for the implementation  of the annual budget on 26 May 2020 and the  Management Board received a copy of the 2019 AAR  on 11 June 2020.  In analysing and assessing the AAR 2019, the  Management Board has concluded the following:    The AAR presents key results of the  implementation of the ENISA Work programme  2019 and leads to conclusion that the Agency  completed all deliverables agreed with the  Management Board in the Work Programme 2019.    Despite challenging circumstances associated  with the transition to the responsibilities of the  new mandate following the entry into force of the  Cybersecurity Act, the Agency was able to meet  the objectives set in the work programme 2019 as  shown by the results presented in this report.    ENISA produced 55 reports on a variety of  subjects pertaining to the current cybersecurity  environment. These reports provided guidance  in ‘traditional areas’ of cybersecurity, such as  critical systems and incident handling, but also in  evolving areas such as SMART technologies and  the Internet of Things (IoT). Impact indicators show  that the Agency's results exceeded the targets  established in the Work Programme 2019, against  the framework of the ENISA Strategy 2016-2020.    In addition to delivering on its core work  programme, ENISA also supported the European  Commission and the Member States in responding  to priorities that arose during the course of the  year – notably the need to secure the elections for  the European Parliament and the support for the  Commission’s 5G Action Plan.    Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work  Programme 2019 and ENISA’s work is well  aligned with the overall European Union priorities  for digital single market. A coherent link is  provided between activities planned in the Work  Programme 2019 and the actual achievements  reached in the reporting period.    The AAR also describes ENISA’s management  of resources and the budget execution of the  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  14  EU subsidy. The changes in the legal mandate  also impacted the allocation of the budgetary  resources. An increase from EUR 11,0 million  to EUR 16,3 million could only be inscribed and  made available to the Agency following the  amendment approved by the Management Board  on 31/05/2019. ENISA was able to implement a  budgetary increase. In 2019, ENISA executed 15  771 525 euros in commitment appropriations  representing 97% of the total budget of the year.    The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2017  Discharge and control results. This section also  notes the main categories of deviation that led to  exceptions reported. In 2019 the agency recorded  38 exceptions. 33 of these are under the relevant  materiality level (less than EUR 15.000) and are  of minor administrative nature with no financial  impact. The remaining 5 exceptions were linked to  a posteriori commitments.    The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate  management of risks, high level of transparency,  data protection, business continuity, as well  as efforts were undertaken to improve overall  efficiency in all activities.    The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration  of assurance of the Executive Director as well as  additional information on human and financial  resources, draft annual accounts and financial  reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the  achievements of ENISA in 2019. The Management  Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA could deliver  work programme 2019 despite the Cybersecurity Act  entering into force on 27 June 2019. The Management  Board expresses its appreciation to the Executive  Director and his staff for their commitment and  achievements throughout the year.  The Management Board notes that the Executive  Director has no critical issues to report which would  affect the presentation of the annual accounts for the  financial year 2019 to the discharge authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management  Board requests the Management Board Secretariat  to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to  the European Commission, the European Parliament,  the Council, the Permanent Representations of the  Member States and the Court of Auditors.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 15  INTRODUCTION  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 171  Implementation of the agency’s annual work  programme: Highlights of the year  THE YEAR IN CONTEXT  There were two major events in 2019 that are of  significance for this report.  The signing of the CSA in June resulted in the need  to amend the work programme to reflect the most  important changes. These changes also impacted the  allocation of the budgetary resources.  In October, ENISA welcomed a new executive director:  Dr Prof. Udo Helmbrecht handed his role over to  Juhan Lepassaar.  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  ENISA’s key performance indicators (KPIs) provide  the metrics with which to measure the performance,  results and impact of the agency’s outcomes and  output. KPIs are defined and outlined in this report  according to the type of output for each activity.  Three types of output are identified: publication (P),  event (E) and support (S).  The major KPIs are the following:    number of reports, news items, dissemination  materials, etc. published;    number of Member States, stakeholders  and communities engaged in discussions  or workshops, or total number of individual  participants;    variety of representatives involved in the  preparation of recommendations;    quantity of training materials developed or  updated;    number of tests and exercises performed;    number of Member States using tools and/or  platforms developed.  ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES  AND OBJECTIVES  The CSA signed in April impacted the strategic  priorities of the agency initially defined for 2019.  As a result, ENISA, together with its Management  Board, identified and agreed on a number of  minor amendments to be performed to align its  activities accordingly.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  18  From an operational perspective, the highlights of the  year were as follows.    ENISA produced 55 reports on a variety of  subjects pertaining to the current cybersecurity  environment. These reports provided guidance  in ‘traditional’ areas of cybersecurity, such as  critical systems and incident handling, but also in  evolving areas such as self-monitoring analysis  and reporting technology (smart) technologies  and the IoT.    As in previous years, the agency was also active in  various awareness-raising activities. The ECSM and  the ECSC are key examples.    ENISA supported the effort to ensure the security  of the European Parliament elections. As part of  this effort, the agency supported an exercise to  ensure that the EU institutions and Member States  were prepared for potential attacks.    Following the high-priority request from the  Commission to engage in activities related to  the cybersecurity of 5G networks, ENISA worked  together with the Commission and the Member  States to produce a consolidated risk assessment  for 5G and an associated threat landscape.  The agency also contributed significantly to the  development of the 5G toolbox. This work was  carried out in addition to the work programme  activities; the only consequence was a delay in  the publication of the ENISA threat landscape  (ETL) report.    Despite the challenging circumstances associated  with the transition to the responsibilities of its  new mandate, the agency was able to meet  the objectives set in the single programming  document, as shown by the results presented in  this report.  ORGANISATION, BUDGET AND  INTERNAL CONTROL  The structure of the organisation had to be slightly  adapted to integrate ENISA’s new activities under the  cybersecurity certification framework, its increased  coordination of crisis management and its extended  responsibilities derived from the NIS directive (NISD).  Budget management was extremely challenging as  the budget associated with the entry into force of the  CSA (constituting an increase from EUR 11 million  to EUR 16.3 million) could only be encoded in  the financial system and made available to the  agency following the amendment approved by  the Management Board on 31 May 2019. This late  transition affected recruitment planning and also  resulted in the need to revise and update the agency’s  information technology (IT) infrastructure to meet the  new requirements under the CSA.  Between 1 January and 31 December 2019,  ENISA executed EUR 15 771 525 in commitment  appropriations, representing 97 % of the total budget  for the year.  Although our ambitious financial goal of committing  99 % of the budget was not achieved, the  commitment rate of 95 % set by the Commission for  the year was exceeded for 2019. Compared to 2018,  there was a slight decrease in commitment execution  (99 %) but ENISA was able to implement a budgetary  increase of almost 50 % following the adoption of  the CSA.  The payment execution rate of 70 % is a result of:    the late entry into force of the CSA;    delays in the recruitment execution, caused by the  late entry into force of the CSA;    late commitment of significant IT infrastructure  investments (in the last quarter of 2019) required  to meet the new challenges associated with  ENISA’s new mandate.  The agency takes the measures necessary to comply  with any observations or recommendations issued  by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) of the European  Commission and the European Court of Auditors  (ECA). The management team continuously uses  all these elements to assess the risk associated  with each area and to further develop controls  and procedures.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 19  INTRODUCTION  KEY CONCLUSIONS  The agency successfully carried out its work  programme throughout 2019 and managed the  transition to the new mandate in a smooth fashion.  In addition to delivering on its core work programme,  ENISA also supported the Commission and the  Member States in responding to priorities that arose  during the course of the year – notably the need  to ensure the security of the European Parliament  elections and the support for the Commission’s 5G  action plan.  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that the objective to increase assurance  of reliability of performance, legality and regularity  based on our legal and financial framework is realised  and working as intended. Internal risks are identified  and appropriately monitored. Mitigation measures  are implemented wherever deemed appropriate.

ENISA issued guidelines identifying and analysing  good practices for developing applications in a secure  manner, making use of secure software development  life cycle (3) principles. Several IoT security challenges  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for- security-of-iot-1  3 Typically referring to the activities of planning, implementation,  testing, documentation, deployment and maintenance.  can be addressed in this way, such as checking for  security vulnerabilities, secure deployment, ensuring  continuity of secure development in the case of  integrators, continuous delivery and more.  Existing frameworks, guidelines and initiatives were  considered while collaborating with the  ENISA IoT  SECurity (IoTSEC)4 Experts Group and the ENISA  Industry 4.0 Cyber Security Experts Group (EICS)5  Furthermore, targeted IoT case studies were  developed in order to identify risks and vulnerabilities.  This was achieved by setting out appropriate attack  scenarios and providing relevant recommendations  and good practices. ENISA also developed an online  tool that visually represents IoT security measures, in  order to further support stakeholders.  On 8 October 2019, ENISA organised a workshop  in Brussels in order to validate the findings of the  report. The workshop brought together 28 IoT  stakeholders. They all actively contributed to the  study. Overall, the study involved 37 IoT stakeholders  from 9 EU Member States, a European Economic Area  (EEA) country, Israel and the United States.  On 24 and 25 October 2019, the third ENISA–Europol  IoT Security Conference took place in Athens, Greece.  Organised by ENISA in cooperation with Europol, the  event brought together about 180 IoT stakeholders.  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1  5 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/eics-experts-group  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  OF THE YEAR  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot-1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot-1 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/eics-experts-group  22  The main topics of the conference included  IoT security and the emerging topic of artificial  intelligence (AI) security.  O.1.1.2. Good practices for the security of  smart cars  Main achievements:    report on good practices for the security of  smart cars;    workshop in Brussels to validate the findings  of the report;    supporting related activities of the European  Commission.  On 25 November 2019, ENISA issued a report on  good practices for the security of smart cars, namely  connected and (semi-)autonomous vehicles and their  added-value features designed to enhance car users’  experience and improve car safety.  This report can be used as a reference point since  it takes all existing standardisation, legislative and  policy initiatives into consideration. It helps promote  the cybersecurity of smart cars across Europe and  raises awareness of relevant threats and risks with a  focus on cybersecurity for safety.  On 7 October 2019, ENISA organised a workshop  in Brussels in order to validate the findings of the  report. The workshop brought together stakeholders  from the EU automotive sector. Overall, the study  involved over 20 automotive stakeholders from 7 EU  Member States.  ENISA also actively supported the Commission  in several activities, including the cooperative,  connected, automated and autonomous mobility  single platform6.  O.1.1.3. Encrypted traffic analysis: use cases and  security challenges  Main achievement:    Report on encrypted traffic analysis.  In 2019, ENISA focused on the disrupting impact  encryption has on network security. According to  recent studies, more than 80 % of internet traffic is  6 The cooperative, connected, automated and autonomous  mobility platform is a joint initiative by DG Mobility and  Transport, DG Communications Networks, Content and  Technology, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship  and SMEs and DG Research and Innovation  (see https://connectedautomateddriving.eu/mediaroom/ european-commission-launches-ccam-single-platform/).  protected by Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure7 and  applications increasingly use encryption by default for  their communications.  However, encryption is not always used in legitimate  ways. Encryption can also be used in ransomware  and sophisticated malicious software operating with  off-the-shelf or homemade encryption to evade  detection and prevention. This reduces the efficacy  of traditional network detection and protection tools,  since these require access to unencrypted traffic.  Organisations relying on such controls lose valuable  insight and end up relying on an infrastructure hiding  compromising blind spots.  An obvious solution to this problem is to prohibit or  to undo the encryption to allow inspection of traffic.  However, this can only be enforced on legitimate  users and it negates the principle of end-to-end  encryption, potentially exposing data and reducing  user privacy.  A lesser-known alternative leverages machine  learning and AI techniques to make inferences  directly from the encrypted traffic. These techniques  work by analysing traffic metadata, without having to  access the unencrypted payload.  ENISA’s study entitled Encrypted Traffic Analysis – Use  cases & security challenges looks at these techniques  and their use cases, such as encrypted malware and  traffic detection. For each use case, the study identifies  mainstream methods, denoting capabilities and  limitations. The impact of misuse of encryption on the  privacy of end users is also addressed. In addition, the  report presents simple but efficient countermeasures to  correct common bad Transport Layer Security practices.  The objective of the report is threefold; its aim is to:  (a)  advise decision-makers, security practitioners and  administrators on new network security tools and  techniques;  (b)  discourage improper Transport Layer Security  practices;  (c)  alert policymakers to limitations of encryption  posed by machine learning and AI, especially with  respect to user privacy.  7 Estimates place the percentage of web pages loaded by  Firefox using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure at + 80 %.

ENISA issued a set of guidelines for ensuring  cybersecurity in procurement for hospitals. The  guidelines are aimed at IT professionals and  procurement officers in hospitals and healthcare  organisations. They are of specific interest to the  professionals in charge who need to make informed  decisions when procuring services, products or  infrastructure for their organisation. All good  practices presented are linked to the types of  procurement for which they are relevant and to  threats that they can mitigate, providing an easy-to- filter set of practices for hospitals who want to focus  on particular aspects. ENISA collected input from  15 healthcare professionals, covering 8 Member  States and the private sector, namely medical device  manufacturers. The report was officially published in  February 2020.  On 30 October 2019, ENISA held the fifth eHealth  Security Conference in cooperation with CESICAT  in Barcelona, during the Barcelona Cybersecurity  Congress.  The conference brought together high-level speakers  who spoke on cybersecurity to an audience of 100  participants from both the public and the private  sector, from about 17 Member States and European  Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.  ENISA also actively supported the European  Commission and the community through  several actions.  ENISA participated in the Medical Device  Coordination Group – New Technologies Task Force  on Cybersecurity facilitated by DG Internal Market,  Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs. The group  published guidelines to help manufacturers meet all  the relevant safety and performance requirements  of the medical device regulation in regard to  cybersecurity (‘MDCG 2019–16 – Guidance on  cybersecurity for medical devices’).  ENISA also engaged in the European Cybersecurity  Health Group established by the eHealth Network  (run by DG Health and Food Safety). The group is  meant to identify technical measures to enhance  cybersecurity in healthcare organisations by raising  24  awareness and building capabilities in the area.  Through their national healthcare authorities,  12 Member States participated in the group.  Finally, ENISA supported the community and relevant  authorities in the creation of the NIS CG work stream  dedicated to the healthcare sector. The work stream  supported the implementation of the directive by  operators of essential healthcare services. Activities  are meant to start in 2020.  O.1.1.5. Good practices for maritime security  Main achievements:    report on good practices for chief information  security officers (CISOs) and chief information  officers of port authorities and terminal operators;    workshop in Lisbon to strengthen the  cybersecurity of EU ports hosted by the European  Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA);    activities in support of DG Mobility and Transport  and EMSA.  ENISA conducted a study to produce a comprehensive  set of good practices for CISOs and chief information  officers of operators involved in the port ecosystem,  especially port authorities and terminal operators.  Cybersecurity in ports is addressed in a holistic  manner for the first time in the report. It provides  detailed mapping of the relevant stakeholders,  interfaces and key services. It also introduces an  extensive taxonomy of port assets covering both IT  and Operational Technology. It proposes a detailed  threat taxonomy. It also defines four key scenarios of  potential attacks on ports.  The report concludes with a list of policy,  organisational and technical security measures, to be  implemented for protection against cyberattacks. The  report was developed in cooperation with a number  of EU ports and has been widely referenced.  On 26 November, ENISA organised a workshop  in Lisbon with the objective of strengthening the  cybersecurity of EU ports. The workshop was hosted  by EMSA and brought together over 60 stakeholders  from the EU maritime sector. A significant part of  the workshop was dedicated to a discussion on  ENISA’s report Port Cybersecurity – Good practices for  cybersecurity in the maritime sector. The afternoon  session focused on the concept of ‘information  sharing and analysis centres’ (ISACs), including  presentations on good practices and lessons learnt  from similar initiatives in other sectors.  A total of 75 stakeholders from 18 Member States  actively contributed to these activities by providing  input on the drafting of the report and/or by  participating in the workshop.  ENISA also actively supported the Commission  and EMSA in several activities, including:    the organisation by DG Mobility and Transport  of a maritime cybersecurity workshop in Brussels;    the organisation of a tabletop cybersecurity  exercise by EMSA in Lisbon;    EMSA’s SafeSeaNet project.  1.1.2 Objective 2: NIS threat landscape and  analysis – outputs  O.1.2.1. Annual ENISA threat landscape  Main achievements:    5G threat landscape mapping;    risk assessment work in support of the 5G toolbox;    organisation of CTI training (cyberthreat analysis,  CTI and practical cryptography) delivered during  the 2019 Summer School;    preparation of CTI-EU event8 of 30th and 31st  January 2020.  The ETL is an annual compilation of the cyberthreats  that have been encountered throughout the year.  The ETL summarises the top 15 cyberthreats,  based on the number of occurrences, as reported  in open-source resources, such as various reports,  articles, incident analyses and expert opinions.  The ETL report provides strategic intelligence on the  cyberthreats assessed, including points of interest,  statistics, mitigation measures, main incidents,  information about threat actors and their motives,  attack vectors deployed, mitigation measures and  authoritative resources.  In 2019, the Commission requested that ENISA be  involved in the work on the cybersecurity of 5G  networks9. Considered high priority, the extra work  this endeavour represented did not allow ENISA to  issue the ETL that it usually delivers on a yearly basis.  The 2019 ETL was therefore postponed to 2020. The  ETL report for 2019 will be based on data collected  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu- bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence  9 Commission recommendation of 26 March 2019 –  Cybersecurity of 5G networks, C(2019) 2335 final, available  at: https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_ id=58154  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 25  PART I. Achievements of the year  during both 2019 and the first half of 2020. The ETL  is expected to be released in mid 2020.  Further to the Commission’s request in relation to 5G,  ENISA delivered mapping of the 5G threat landscape.  The 5G threat landscape was developed thanks  to existing work of ENISA in the area (of software- defined networking / 5G threat landscapes). It was  created with the support of relevant stakeholders,  and was supported by the NIS CG.  The content of the 5G threat landscape was  communicated to other relevant bodies, such as  the Body of European Regulators for Electronic  Communications (BEREC) working group on 5G.  In support of the Member States, the Commission  and relevant stakeholders, ENISA consolidated  national risk assessments performed by Member  States into a single document.  For this task, ENISA engaged in close cooperation  with DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology by means of common efforts  towards the consolidation of the national risk  assessments received.  The NIS CG reviewed the material in a continuous  manner.  This consolidated risk assessment and the 5G threat  landscape were merged into a joint review of the EU- wide risk exposure of 5G networks and formed the  basis for the development of the 5G toolbox10.  ENISA continued to engage with its CTI Expert Group  in 2019. The group supported ENISA in streamlining  various tasks in the area of CTI. It provided advice  for the key ENISA CTI stakeholder event ‘CTI-EU’. It  also provided support for the organisation of the CTI  training during the 2019 ENISA Summer School and  contributed to information collection.  ENISA also delivered training sessions on cyberthreat  analysis, CTI and practical cryptography during the  ENISA–FORTH NIS Summer School.  The objective of such training sessions is to promote  cyberthreat analysis by ensuring knowledge transfer  on CTI matters between cybersecurity practitioners.  The feedback received from participants has revealed  the interest of the community in cyberthreat analysis.  10 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ ip_20_123  O.1.2.2. Restricted and public info notes on NIS  Main achievements:  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and  developments through info notes.  The work on info notes was suspended in 2019  further to the emergence of activities to be performed  in relation to 5G.  Resources allocated to this task were transferred to  the 5G threat landscape and the consolidation of 5G  national risk assessments.  O.1.2.3. Support for incident-reporting activities  in the EU  Main achievements:    Article 13a11 Expert Group meetings and Border  Gateway Protocol (BGP) security paper;    Article 1912 meetings and 2-day  cryptography seminar;    update of the telecoms and trust services  breach-reporting templates;    report on breach-reporting synergies.  Throughout the year, ENISA continued to engage in  the cooperation with ENISA’s expert group set up to  carry out the provisions of Article 13a of the Telecom  Framework Directive.  Every year the group of experts from European  national telecoms security authorities sees its number  of members and meeting attendance increase.  The group is chaired by the Dutch telecoms authority.  Formed of 28 countries (from the EU/EFTA/EEA), the  group validated the EU-wide annual telecoms security  incidents report.  About 45 experts from telecoms security authorities  joined the meetings related to the provisions of  Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive in  Stockholm, Ljubljana and Belgrade.  The Article 13a in-depth technical publication  focused on BGP security (7 Steps to Shore up BGP)  was drafted and delivered in close cooperation  with industry experts.  11 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  12  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-19  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-19  26  ENISA continued to engage in strengthening its  cooperation with supervisory bodies and with FESA13,  supporting ENISA’s expert group set up to carry out  the provisions of Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  Chaired by the Austrian supervisory body, the group, now  involving 29 countries (from the EU/EFTA/EEA), validated  the EU-wide annual trust services security incidents  report. A total of 40 experts from trust service supervisory  bodies joined the meetings related to the provisions of  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation in Tirana and Paris.  ENISA also hosted and delivered a 2-day cryptography  seminar (theoretical and practical) for experts  from the supervisory bodies (to support the  Article 19 Expert Group).  ENISA maintained its cooperation with the EU  Member States on EU-wide breach reporting. This  cooperation operates along two lines:    the support given by ENISA to the NIS CG work  stream 3 (NISD breach reporting) building on the  telecoms breach-reporting experience;    the work of adapting the telecoms and trust  service breach-reporting templates, for better  alignment with the NISD.  The new tool is designed to support telecoms,  trust services and the NISD, and uses the  NIS CG taxonomy.  ENISA also delivered a new map of breach-reporting  processes: the breach-reporting synergies paper.  The breach-reporting synergies paper, delivered by  ENISA, was validated by the group, 12 countries and  20 experts from the NIS CG work stream 3.  The paper was delivered to the work stream  by the deadline in the work stream 3 work plan  (end of 2019).  O.1.2.4. Regular technical reports on the state  of cybersecurity  Main achievement:    report on software vulnerabilities.  For this particular output, ENISA produced a report  on the state of software vulnerabilities for 2018/2019.  The report analyses the actual figures and generates  intuitive statistics on the root causes of the most  critical vulnerabilities. In order to produce this  13 Forum of European supervisory authorities for trust services  providers: http://www.fesa.eu/  deliverable, ENISA engaged with experts in the related  fields from the CTI and the CSIRT community.  1.1.3 Objective 3: Research, development and  innovation – outputs  O.1.3.1. Supporting cybersecurity public–private  partnership in establishing priorities for EU  research and development  Main achievements:    publication of an information and communications  technology (ICT) consultation paper on digital  sovereignty;    report on research and innovation directions for  EU digital sovereignty.  To help shape the research and innovation  landscape, ENISA produced a report on the most  important cybersecurity research priorities, following  an open consultation.  In 2018 the focus was on improving the EU’s cyber  safety14. A new report was necessary to identify  the research and innovation directions for  EU digital sovereignty.  To that end, ENISA studied recent relevant  cybersecurity research roadmaps proposed and  defined by several groups in the EU including recent  Networks of Excellence, the European Cyber Security  Organisation (ECSO) and several national initiatives.  To select the most relevant research directions, ENISA  created a survey and invited a wide community of  stakeholders to express their opinions.  About 100 stakeholders responded to the survey  and ENISA drafted its conclusions to be discussed in  an open validation, in which an ECSO representative  and members of ECSO Working Group 6 were invited  to participate.  A final presentation of the results was given to the  ECSO Working Group 6 community in February 2020.  In addition, ENISA provided secretariat support to  the National Public Administration Committee. Two  meetings were scheduled by ECSO in 2019, one in  February and the other in May.  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the- european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  http://www.fesa.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 27  PART I. Achievements of the year  1.2 Outputs and performance indicators for Activity 1: EXPERTISE  Summary of outputs from Activity 1: EXPERTISE – Anticipate and support Europe  in facing emerging NIS challenges Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 1.1.

In 2019, ENISA supported the work on the legislative  and policy developments leading to the official  publication of the CSA, which came into force  on 27 June.  ENISA continued working towards meeting  preparatory requirements for the certification  framework for ICT security products and services  by, for example, promoting mutual recognition  or harmonisation of certification practices up to a  certain level, in line with the provisions of the act.  The activities in the area of cybersecurity certification  were performed in line with the existing national  efforts and interests as well as the principle that,  wherever possible, decisions must be taken at the  level of government closest to the public (i.e. the  principle of ‘subsidiarity’) that applies in the area  of certification, while taking into consideration the  ongoing legislative process.  ENISA provided support to the Commission and the  Member States in the policy area on certification  of products and services within the scope of the  approved CSA and to better support the new EU  cybersecurity certification framework for products  and services. Within this framework, ENISA entered  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 29  PART I. Achievements of the year  the final steps of the CSA. ENISA subsequently  endeavoured to stimulate the interaction and  involvement of Member States’ governments as well  as public policy and industry stakeholders before  the emergence of the EU certification framework.  The final approval of the CSA required ENISA to  maintain excellent cooperation with Member  States’ governments while transitioning from  policy preparation to policy implementation. The  achievement of the CSA is evidence of that success.  ENISA provided support for the organisation of  the EU cybersecurity certification framework. It  supported the Commission in its role in the European  Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) and  analysed aspects of functional equivalence of existing  certification schemes across the EU with the emerging  EU certification framework in order to facilitate the  transition to the new EU framework. ENISA further  developed its interaction with key stakeholders  associated with the EU cybersecurity certification  framework.  2.1.2 Objective 2: Supporting EU policy  implementation – outputs  O.2.2.1. Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS regulation  Main achievements:  ENISA continued its work on supporting public  and private bodies in implementing the electronic  identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation  by addressing technological aspects and building  blocks for trust services. Deliverables throughout  2020 were determined in consultation with the  Commission and with public authorities in the  Member States through the eIDAS Expert Group.  Interacting with the private sector enhanced ENISA’s  ability to make further meaningful contributions in  this area. In implementing the CSA, ENISA supported  the Member States’ and the Commission’s efforts  in electronic identification. The eIDAS Expert  Group was consulted for approval on specific  ENISA implementation guidelines and technical  recommendations addressing operational aspects  of trust service providers, conformity assessment  bodies and supervisory authorities. ENISA continued  to accumulate experience of best-practice and  state-of-the-art progress, seeking to emphasise  implementation and interoperability. These  recommendations complemented the existing  knowledge base that ENISA created for the trust  service providers. ENISA took into account the  recommendations and standards developed by the  European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) /  the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation (CENELEC), the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and  the International Organization for Standardization  and sought to avoid both duplication of work and  potentially opposing approaches. In this regard,  ENISA supported the Commission in assessing the  relevant standards by reviewing how they met the  requirements of the eIDAS regulation.  O.2.2.2. Supporting the implementation of the  work programme of the NIS CG  Main achievements:  ENISA completed another year of strong support of  the NIS CG, in close collaboration with the members  of the group and the Commission. Projects included  the work on the European Parliament elections  and on the 5G risks and toolbox. ENISA continued  to engage closely with many different groups of  sectorial authorities and regulators in the different  work streams. ENISA supported all work streams with  drafting reports, performing analyses and conducting  seminars on various sectors and topics, such as  the energy sector, digital service providers (DSPs),  the digital infrastructure sector, security measures,  dependencies, blueprints, elections, etc.  The working group of DSP authorities, under NIS CG  work stream 5, validated and worked closely with  ENISA on the NISD digital services scope / decision  tree – a working document, validated and delivered to  the work stream (accessible via the Communication  and Information Resource Centre for Administrations,  Businesses and Citizens only).  ENISA hosted work streams 5 (digital services) and 10  (digital infrastructures), organising the following.    Two working meetings in Athens.    A joint exercise for authorities.    A seminar by the Réseaux IP Européens Network  Coordination Centre (a regional internet registry  covering Europe, the former USSR and West Asia;  RIPENCC) on internet infrastructure.    A training session on cloud security. Over the week  60 experts from different authorities attended.  ENISA heavily supported the work on 5G,  consolidating national risk assessments and  developing a 5G toolbox. This important work was  completed on time, and was well appreciated upon its  publication by the Commission in January 2020.  30  O.2.2.3. Assist Member States in the  implementation of security requirements for  operators of essential services and DSPs  Main achievements:  In 2019, ENISA contributed to addressing  the challenge posed by the different security  requirements stemming from multiple regulatory  frameworks by issuing a report on the provisions  on operators of essential services (OESs) and DSPs  laid down by the NISD, as well as the general data  protection regulation (GDPR). The report aims to  provide a harmonised approach to using the available  ENISA guidance – an approach that can also be used  by any organisation that plans to implement security  measures appropriate for the security of network  and information systems as well as for personal data  protection. The report was disseminated at the NIS  CG plenary meeting in September.  In 2019 ENISA developed a web tool that provides  interactive mapping of security measures for OESs,  defined by the NIS CG16, onto international standards  from different business sectors mentioned in Annex 2  to the NISD. The tool was presented in the last NIS CG  plenary of 2019 and was welcomed by the Member  States. It is available on the ENISA website17.  O.2.2.4. Supporting the implementation of the  payment services directive  This output was removed following amendment 7 to  the 2019 work programme18 to reflect organisational  changes while taking on board new tasks and new  priorities (i.e. MeliCERTes, a project funded by the EU  to connect CSIRTS around the Member States).  O.2.2.5. Contribute to the EU policy in the area of  privacy and data protection with policy input on  security measures  Main achievements:    the seventh Annual Privacy Forum (APF) held  in cooperation with the University Tor Vergata  and LUISS University and with the support of the  Garante per la protezione dei dati personali  (the Italian Data Protection Authority);  16 NIS CG Publication 01/2018, ‘Reference document on security  measures for Operators of Essential Services’, available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_ id=53643  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum- security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  18 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/management-board- decisions/MBDecision%202019_3amending%20PD2019%20 and%20adjusting%20budget2019.pdf/view    report on data pseudonymisation.  Within the scope of security measures required by  the legal framework on personal data protection and  privacy as well as appropriate provisions of the draft  CSA on the role of ENISA in this area, ENISA continued  promoting trust and security in digital services by  means of technical analyses on the implementation  of EU legislation addressing privacy and personal data  protection.  In particular, ENISA addressed aspects of shaping  technology in accordance with GDPR, with a special  focus on data pseudonymisation. The main outcome  is a report based on ENISA’s past work in the field  and provides an analysis of key pseudonymisation  techniques, along with specific use cases and relevant  scenarios.  In addition, following previous work on the security  of personal data processing, ENISA published a  web tool19 and a manual. These were developed to  support controllers and processors in performing risk  assessments and adopting security measures for the  protection of their personal data.  The seventh APF – a conference that has grown to be  a major event for ENISA – remained the instrument  of choice to bring together key communities, namely  those of policy, academia and industry, in the broader  area of privacy and data protection while focusing  on privacy-related areas of application. The 2019 APF  took place in Rome, in cooperation with the University  Tor Vergata and LUISS University and with the  support of the Italian Data Protection Authority20.  Cooperation activities with Commission services,  the European data protection supervisor (EDPS), the  European Data Protection Board and national data  protection authorities were further pursued. In this  context, a conference on personal data breaches  was jointly organised with the EDPS. Moreover, an  invitation-only workshop on data pseudonymisation  was co-organised by the Unabhängiges Landeszentrum  für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein (ULD) (the German  data protection authority of Schleswig-Holstein) and  ENISA.  ENISA continued promoting the visibility of security  measures for data protection and privacy, through  considerations of IT security of products on the one  hand, and through the area of certification of services  on the other. ENISA liaised with stakeholders and  policymakers as well as with competent authorities  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/risk-level-tool/ 20 https://2019.privacyforum.eu/  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/pseudonymisation-techniques-and-best-practices https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/edps-enisa-conference/edps-enisa-conference-towards-accessing-the-risk-in-personal-data-breaches https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/uld-enisa-workshop/uld-enisa-workshop-pseudonymization-and-relevant-security-technologies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/risk-level-tool/ https://2019.privacyforum.eu/  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 31  PART I. Achievements of the year  in the Member States and EU institutions to identify  potential for synergy between privacy and security  and assistance for key stakeholders, namely the  Commission and competent EU bodies.  O.2.2.6. Guidelines for EU standardisation  in ICT security  Main achievements:  Building on its own policy work, existing standards  and the requirements of the Member States, this  activity makes recurrent contributions in terms of gap  analyses and/or provides guidance on implementing  existing cybersecurity standards.  Additionally, ENISA maintains the relationship  developed with the EU and international  standardisation organisations (CEN/CENELEC and  ETSI; International Organization for Standardization  and International Electrotechnical Commission).  It thus contributes to their standardisation work  at the strategic and tactical levels. For instance,  it facilitates cooperation between the relevant  technical committees of ETSI (Technical Committee –  Cybersecurity) and CEN/CENELEC (Joint Technical  Committee 13). It also promotes participation in  various conference programme committees, and  organises highly recognised and well-attended  standardisation conferences.  New requirements associated primarily with the  implementation and secondly with the transposition  of the EU legal instruments in place in the Member  States will be taken into account. These requirements  include aspects of the NISD and the GDPR, as well as  the preparation for the entry into force of the draft  ePrivacy regulation, the draft CSA and more.  ENISA contributed to this relationship with its  technical and organisational knowledge, which  was further leveraged in extending or assessing  standards, the objective being to tailor them to  stakeholders while making them compliant with  the prevailing regulatory framework. Of particular  importance is the participation of ENISA in the work  of the International Organization for Standardization  Subcommittee 27.  In carrying out this work, ENISA consulted the  Member States, industry and standard-developing  organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN/CENELEC, International  Organisation for Standardization). ENISA organised  an annual conference on cybersecurity standards  with these organisations and consulted with the  Commission services and agencies endowed with  competence for policy as appropriate.  O.2.2.7. Supporting the implementation of the  European Electronic Communications Code  Main achievements:    telecoms security event in Stockholm;    ETIS21 Information Security Working  Group meeting;    report “security supervision changes under  the European Electronic Communications  Code” (EECC).  The telecoms security event in Stockholm had an  attendance of 75 experts, from both the public and  the private sector. At this event, the Commission and  ENISA gave talks about the upcoming EECC.  ENISA hosted and organised the ETIS Information  Security Working Group in Athens beginning of 2019.  At this industry event, one of the most important ISAC  groups for telecoms, initial discussions on the EECC  took place with the industry experts.  In 2019, ENISA produced and delivered a seminal  paper for the future work on the EECC: ‘Telecoms  security supervision changes under the EECC’, based  on legal analyses and discussions with regulators,  ministries, the Commission and the private sector.  The paper was validated by all 28 countries in the  group. Intermediate drafts were discussed during  meetings held in June and October with the regulator.  A solid basis was laid for the future work with the EU  Member States on telecoms security supervision.  O.2.2.8. Supporting the sectorial implementation  of the NISD  Main achievements:    Transport Cyber Security Conference organised  with DG Mobility and Transport, the European  Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), EMSA and the  European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), held on  23 January 2019;    establishment of the Transport Resilience and  Security Expert Group;    facilitating the European Rail ISAC;    energy sector survey.  On 23 January 2019 in Lisbon, ENISA held the first  Transport Cyber Security Conference.  21 https://www.etis.org/page/About_Us  https://www.etis.org/page/About_Us  32  The conference had the support of the European  Commission (DG Mobility and Transport), EASA, EMSA  and ERA.  More than 170 public and private partners from all  over Europe, representing all modes of transport,  took part in the event. Together, they discussed  the EU legal framework for cybersecurity and its  relevance for the transport sector, and explored  options for further cooperation.  The discussions demonstrated the importance of  intensifying the cooperation between DG Mobility and  Transport, DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology, ENISA, EASA, EMSA and ERA to raise  the level of cybersecurity in transport.  In addition, ENISA established the Transport  Resilience and Security Expert Group in 2019  to support its activities in the transport sector.  In 2019, the European Rail ISAC was launched and  two general assemblies took place over the course  of the year. Cybersecurity professionals from  European infrastructure managers and railway  undertakings met and exchanged information on  cybersecurity issues. Together, they planned the  next steps to increase cybersecurity capabilities and  raise awareness in the sector. Initially more than  eight Member States were members of the European  Rail ISAC, which has been heavily supported and  facilitated by ENISA (as a partner).  In 2019, ENISA conducted a survey along with a set  of interviews with various stakeholders from the  energy sector in order to identify challenges and  good cybersecurity practices. The preliminary results  were examined with the members of the NIS CG work  stream 8 (energy) (covering 15 Member States). Based  on the information collected, the agency will consider  the priorities of the energy utilities and cybersecurity  trends in the energy sector in general.  O.2.2.9. Hands-on tasks in the area of certification  of products and services  Main achievements:  Having adopted the finally approved CSA and its  component on certification, ENISA started to support  the Commission and the Member States by carrying  out hands-on tasks in this area designed to assist  them in deploying the framework.  ENISA is developing a framework for certification  schemes, along with carrying out structured  interactions with the stakeholder community, and has  started to provide the procedures and tools required  to implement the new tasks.  Working in cooperation with Member States’  certification supervisory authorities, the ECCG  and other key stakeholders, ENISA set the stage  for implementation. To that end, ENISA supports  the functional equivalence of existing certification  schemes across the EU (at both the national and  the EU level) with the emerging EU cybersecurity  certification framework for integrating existing  schemes into the new EU framework in a flexible way.  ENISA maintained its cooperation with stakeholders  to collect, establish and understand their expectations  of the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  ENISA implemented an action plan to accelerate  the launch of the new tasks pertaining to the  cybersecurity certification framework for the benefit  of the Member States.  Practical aspects to be considered included but were  not limited to:    identifying new areas in certification;    recommendations of next steps to take at EU level;    analysis of impact of certification  for manufacturers;    Supporting governments and end users;    recommendations on prioritisation of schemes;    review of overlaps between and gaps in  proposed schemes.  Concretely, ENISA launched two ad hoc working  groups to respond to the 2 requests received in the  area, specifically on:  (a)  a cybersecurity certification scheme in the area  of common criteria for transposing the Senior  Officials Group Information Systems Security  Mutual Recognition Agreement; and on  (b)  a cybersecurity certification scheme in the area of  cloud services.  ENISA assisted the Commission in launching and  supporting the ECCG. It also prepared a proposal  in relation to the membership of the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group.  ENISA carried out support activities in the area of  certification through an annual conference and a  validation workshop.  ENISA carried out very important preparatory  work internally to develop a platform dedicated to  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 33  PART I. Achievements of the year  the support of the ad hoc working group in their  certification tasks as provided for in the CSA.

In 2019 most of the activities in this area aimed at  maintaining and extending the guidelines on good  practices and training materials for CSIRTs and other  operational personnel.  ENISA supported the development of Member  States’ incident-response preparedness by providing  guidance on good practices in key elements of NIS  capacity building. The focus was on CSIRT training and  services in order to improve CSIRTs’ skills and those  of their personnel.  In detail, ENISA performed the necessary updates of  the training material, according to the findings of the  study taking stock of training needs in NISD sectors.  A new set of training materials based on emerging  technologies was created in order to improve  Member State CSIRTs’ skills and capacities to manage  cybersecurity incidents more efficiently.  A special emphasis was placed on supporting  Member States’ CSIRTs and EU bodies with concrete  advice such as examples of good practice and  concrete actions such as the CSIRT training.  ENISA also directly provided tailor-made technical  training and advice to Member States that requested  such support.  In 2019, ENISA further enhanced its methodology,  seminars and training on:  (a)  cyber-crisis management;  (b)  the organisation and management of exercises.  These developments stemmed from the existing  materials and infrastructure for on-site and online  training on these subjects. In addition, this activity  included delivering training upon request.  On 12 and 13 September 2019, ENISA, in  collaboration with the European Security and  Defence College, organised and hosted a pilot course  dedicated to information security risk management.  The 2-day course was attended by 27 experts from  9 Member States and 4 EU institutions at the ENISA  branch office in Heraklion, Crete. Through bolstering  their cybersecurity knowledge and exchanging  experiences and good practices, they honed  their skills and capabilities in cybersecurity and  risk management.  All participants shared the opinion that the course  should be made available every year.  O.3.1.2. Support EU Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies  Main achievements:    report on good practices and innovation under the  national cybersecurity strategies (NCSSs);    the updated interactive NCSS map;    seventh national cybersecurity workshop in  Warsaw, organised with Naukowa i Akademicka  Sieć Komputerowa (Research and Academic  Computer Network, NASK) Poland.  ENISA issued a report addressing challenges, good  practices and recommendations from the Member  States in their efforts to execute innovation as a  strategic priority of their NCSSs.  The report analyses different Member States’  innovation approaches, stakeholders, challenges,  funding mechanisms and initiatives that support  innovation objectives at a national level. Through  interviews, 15 stakeholders from 12 Member States  provided input and validated the results of the report.  A new version of the interactive NCSS map was  released in 2019. It became an info hub with  information provided by the Member States in  their efforts to enhance their cybersecurity at  national level. Designed with the most up-to-date  information, the map is considered a valuable asset  by the community.  36  On 26 September, ENISA, in collaboration with NASK  Poland, held the seventh national cybersecurity  workshop in Warsaw.  A total of 78 stakeholders from national competent  authorities, private and public organisations,  academia and CSIRTs were present.  ENISA presented the report on good practices in  innovation under NCSSs and the updated NCSS map.  The event focused on ‘innovation in cybersecurity’,  covering Member States’ approaches and initiatives  and presented by officials from Spain, Austria, Poland,  the United Kingdom, the Commission and ENISA.  Stakeholders from national and EU ISACs such as  those for the energy, financial and rail sectors shared  their experiences with the tools they use, good  practices and the challenges they face when dealing  with information sharing and cooperation.  O.3.1.3. Support EU Member States in their  incident-response development  Main achievements:  In 2019, ENISA assisted the Member States in  improving their incident-response capabilities by  providing an updated perspective on the CSIRT  landscape and its development in Europe.  In close cooperation with the NISD CSIRT Network,  ENISA supported the development of the  Member States’ incident-response capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions  of NIS capability building with a focus on the  development and efficient functioning of national  and sectorial CSIRTs.  ENISA offered direct support to individual Member  States that requested the assessment and  improvement of their incident-response capabilities,  including assistance in the preparatory phase of the  Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) proposals.  ENISA helped Member States and other incident- response stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy  their incident-response capabilities and services in  order to meet the ever-growing challenges of securing  their networks.  The agency further developed and applied its own  recommendations for CSIRT baseline capabilities  and a maturity framework. It conducted four peer  reviews to assess the maturity level of CSIRT Network  members and supported CSIRT Network members in  conducting their own peer reviews.  ENISA maintained its support for cross-border CSIRT  community projects and development of tools,  and continued to engage in the global dialogue on  common definitions and maturity frameworks in the  incident-response domain.  ENISA’s experts on incident response became  certified Security Incident Management Maturity  Model (SIM3) auditors to enhance the performance of  CSIRTs in the EU.  O.3.1.4. Support EU Member States in the  development of ISACs for the NISD sectors  Main achievements:    13th European Energy ISAC plenary meeting, on  26 and 27 November 2019;    first inter-EU-ISAC meeting, on 10 October 2019.  ENISA has been engaged in close cooperation with  the EU’s OESs over the years.  A number of sectorial expert groups were set  up, covering sectors such as transport, finance  and health.  ENISA actively supports sectorial ISACs, such as  the European Energy ISAC, the European Financial  Institutes ISAC and the European Rail ISAC.  On 26 and 27 November 2019, ENISA held the 13th  European Energy ISAC plenary meeting.  In 2019, ENISA  assisted the Member  States in improving  their incident-response  capabilities by providing  an updated perspective  on the CSIRT landscape  and its development  in Europe.  https://opencsirt.org/csirt-maturity/sim3-and-references/  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 37  PART I. Achievements of the year  Energy sector stakeholders had the opportunity  to exchange views on critical infrastructure threat  analysis, the activities of the energy community and  NISD-related challenges for energy operators.  The open session saw participation from 50 experts.  On 28 November, a training session on network  forensics, tailored to the needs of the energy sector  community, was delivered to the plenary participants  by ENISA.  The training room was fully booked and the  participants expressed a wish to see ENISA organise a  similar initiative in the near future. This confirms the  success and the need for such an event. Five Member  States and three OESs signed up for an extra activity,  namely the European Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition and Control System Information Exchange  (EuroSCSIE) meeting.  On 10 October 2019, ENISA held the first-ever inter- EU-ISAC meeting. The purpose of the meeting was  to bring together the chairs of the existing EU-wide  ISACs in order to discuss both administrative and  operational challenges and identify possible solutions  and ways to ensure close collaboration in the future.  In addition, the event gave the Commission the  opportunity to engage the ISACs in the dialogue on  the funding opportunities available through the CEF  telecoms project.  The participants welcomed this initiative from ENISA  and agreed to organise the meeting on a yearly basis  from then on.  3.1.2 Objective 2: Supporting EU institutions in  capacity building – outputs  O.3.2.1. Representation of ENISA on the CERT-EU  Steering Board and coordination with other EU  agencies using CERT-EU services  Main achievements:  The members of the Computer Emergency Response  Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies  (CERT-EU) Steering Board include the participating EU  institutions and ENISA, representing the EU agencies  using CERT-EU services.

A new version of the interactive map of European  CSIRTs was released, with a new look and feel and  improved back end. Major updates were deployed in  the second and fourth quarters of the year. A dedicated view of CSIRT new members was  integrated into the CSIRT Network public website. In 2019 ENISA conducted four peer reviews to assess  the maturity level of CSIRT Network members, and  reviewed and updated documents on the CSIRT  maturity framework: ENISA Maturity Evaluation  Methodology for CSIRTs and the ENISA CSIRT Maturity  Assessment Model for the CSIRT Network. ENISA also further coordinated the continuous  update of the ‘Reference Security Incident  Taxonomy’ within the official Task Force on CSIRT’s  working group. ENISA experts had involvement  with the Forum of Incident Response and Security  Teams’ board of directors (FIRST), the Task Force  on CSIRT’s steering committee28 and Open CSIRT  Foundation-certified Security Incident Management  Maturity Model29 auditors. ENISA further provided  input to the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise and  MeliCERTes30 projects throughout the year.  26 Computer-security and incident-response team (CSIRT) personnel training 27 https://tf-csirt.org/trusted-introducer/ 28 https://tf-csirt.org/tf-csirt/steering-committee/ 29 https://opencsirt.org/csirt-maturity/sim3-and-references/ 30 Melicertes is the name of a project funded by the EU to connect CSIRTS around the Member States.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/reference-incident-classification-taxonomy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/reference-incident-classification-taxonomy https://www.first.org/about/organization/directors https://opencsirt.org/csirt-maturity/sim3-and-references/ https://opencsirt.org/csirt-maturity/sim3-and-references/ https://tf-csirt.org/trusted-introducer/ https://tf-csirt.org/tf-csirt/steering-committee/ https://opencsirt.org/csirt-maturity/sim3-and-references/  40  Summary of outputs in Activity 3: CAPACITY – Support Europe in maintaining state- of-the-art NIS capacities Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Output O.3.1.4.

ENISA managed to finalise the preparations for the  sixth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe  2020. The preparations closely followed up on  and built on the lessons learned and actions from  previous exercises, such as Cyber Europe 2018.  Cyber Europe 2020 was designed to focus on the  health sector’s testing capabilities and procedures,  namely large-scale incident management cooperation  procedures at EU and national level.  The crisis escalation scenario includes 18 distinct  realistic incidents focused on capturing real life more  accurately. The exercise includes explicit scenarios  for the CSIRT Network, the EU institutions and the  operational cooperation single points of contact and  competent authorities as identified in the blueprint.  ENISA also organised the Cyber SOPEx (formerly  known as EuroSOPEx) for the CSIRT Network  to increase cooperation. As in previous years,  the exercise was planned with the support of  representatives from the organisations involved.  The exercise had a number of objectives: to raise  awareness of cooperation procedures, to train  participants in using cooperation infrastructures  such as communication and information sharing and  ultimately to contribute to increasing trust within the  CSIRT Network.  The theme of the scenario was the European  Parliament elections.  O.4.1.2. Support activities for cyber exercises  Main achievements:  ENISA has been developing the cyber exercise  platform (CEP) since 2014.  The CEP hosts a number of services that ENISA  offers to Member States and EU institutions, such  as: exercise organisation and management, an  exercise playground with technical incidents, a  map of exercises and the hosting of the exercise  development community.  In addition, new content and practice incidents and  material were developed in order to maintain the  interest of the stakeholders and to make the CEP a  central tool in cybersecurity practice exercises for  all stakeholders.  The CEP opens up new opportunities for ENISA to  enlarge its user base and thus offer the operational  cybersecurity communities opportunities to practise  and gain experience and knowledge.  In 2019, the CEP was used to host a national exercise  for the first time. The Portuguese National Cyber  Security Centre held Portugal’s national cyber exercise  in May 2019, using the unique exercise management  infrastructure developed by ENISA.  O.4.1.3. Support the implementation and  further development of the cyber-crisis  collaboration blueprint  Main achievements:    first EU tabletop exercise, code-named ‘EU ELEx19’,  on 5 April 2019;    first cyber law enforcement exercise, ‘CyLEEx19’, on  31 October 2019;    conference on the future of EU cyber-crisis  management on 3 and 4 June 2019.  ENISA continued to be committed to supporting the  implementation and development of the EU cyber- crisis management blueprint in 2019.  As specified in the blueprint, ‘[c]yber crisis response  activities should be coordinated with other crisis  management mechanisms at EU, national or  sectoral levels.’  ENISA maintained its efforts to offer continuous  support to the Commission in further developing  bilateral and multilateral standard operating  procedures (SOPs) for cyber-crisis cooperation with  42  EU bodies and institutions, and to Member States.  It does so either through the NIS CG’s activities or  by responding to individual requests from Member  States for the development of SOP blueprints at  national level.  In addition, ENISA supported EU institutions and  Member States in testing their crisis management  structures, as explained below.  The Parliament, the Member States, the Commission  and ENISA organised this first EU tabletop exercise,  code-named EU ELEx19, on 5 April 2019.  The objective of the exercise, carried out on the  Parliament premises, was to test the effectiveness of  national and EU crisis response practices and plans. It  was also designed to identify how any cybersecurity  incidents that might arise and affect the 2019  European Parliament elections could be prevented,  detected and mitigated.  The exercise was part of the measures being  implemented by the EU to ensure free and fair  elections in May 2019. It lasted a full day and the  participants included 80 players from 27 Member  States, together with observers from the European  Parliament, the Commission and ENISA.  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and  ENISA successfully co-organised the first-ever  cyber law enforcement exercise, called ‘CyLEEx19’,  on 31 October 2019.  This exercise, held in a simulated environment,  was designed to:    test the European Union Law Enforcement  Emergency Response Protocol32;    identify deficiencies and potential for  improvement;    increase preparedness in case of a real-life  cyberattack;    evaluate the procedure for aligning the law  enforcement agencies’ response with other EU  bodies that play a role in the EU blueprint.  The cyber simulation took place in a single day. It  was a lightweight but intellectually intensive exercise  that explored the effects of large-scale transnational  cyberattacks on the capability of law enforcement and  32 Europol document EDOC#1012248 (see: https://www.europol. europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies- across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks).  on the partners involved to carry out their tasks in  accordance with the protocol.  Furthermore, on 3 and 4 June 2019, the agency held  a conference in Athens, focusing on the future of the  EU’s cyber-crisis management. The advantages and  challenges were identified, particularly where the use  of AI is concerned.  The objective of the conference was to provide  a discussion forum for the EU organisations and  bodies that are the main stakeholders of the  blueprint proposal for a cyber-crisis cooperation  framework. It also aimed to bring together experts  on AI from the private sector and academia to  discuss the uses and applications of AI and machine  learning in the context of cyber-crisis cooperation,  such as how AI can support the response to large- scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents at the  strategic and political levels.  O.4.1.4. Supporting the implementation of the  information hub  Main achievements:  Intelligence supporting decision-making in the  cybersecurity domain is scarce, despite today’s  security information overload33.  ENISA is at the crossroads of most if not all public– private, cross-sector cybersecurity communities in  Europe, from the technical to the strategic level.  As indicated in the Commission communication on  building strong cybersecurity for the EU34, ENISA  serves as the ‘focal point for information and  knowledge in the cybersecurity community’.  As a result, ENISA is in a unique position to leverage  its network to gather information, process it and  foster timely, tailored and highly relevant situational  awareness to support decision-making in both  the public and the private European sectors, as  recommended by the Commission in the blueprint.  As part of the regular cooperation at a technical and  operational level to support EU situational awareness  in the context of the blueprint, ENISA issued EU  cybersecurity situation reports on incidents and  threats, based on publicly available information, its  33 Scott J. and Spaniel D., ‘CISO Solution Fatigue – overcoming  the challenges of cybersecurity solution overload’, Hewlett  Packard Enterprise, Institute for Critical Infrastructure  Technology, 2016 (http://icitech.org/wp-content/ uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf).  34 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies-across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies-across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies-across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 43  PART I. Achievements of the year  own analysis and reports shared with it by Member  States’ CSIRTs (on a voluntary basis) or NISD single  points of contact, EC3 at Europol, CERT-EU and, where  appropriate, the European Union Intelligence and  Situation Centre at the European External Action  Service and other EU institutions.  The report was made available to the relevant  bodies of the Council, the Commission, the High  Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and  Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission  and the CSIRT Network.  To best support the fusion of open-source  information for these reports, ENISA migrated  the Open Cyber Situational Awareness Machine  (OpenCSAM) platform to an operational environment.  The operational OpenCSAM includes enhanced  functionalities and capabilities, building on the  experience gained from the first prototype.  The tool received wide acceptance by blueprint  stakeholders.  As the first brick of a broader capability, the tool is  called ‘the ENISA Info Hub’. It is meant to assist in  the compilation of input from blueprint stakeholders  on the development of EU cybersecurity situation  reports, supporting a steady increase and offering  guarantees of shorter production times, of quality  and of consistency.  O.4.1.5. Supporting the implementation of the  cyber-crisis collaboration blueprint  This output was replaced by output O.4.1.3 following  amendment 13 to the 2019 work programme35.  4.1.2 Objective 2: CSIRT and other NIS community  building – outputs  O.4.2.1. EU CSIRT Network secretariat and support  for EU CSIRT Network community building  Main achievements:  ENISA maintained the activities meant to support  the Commission and Member States in the  implementation of the NISD, in particular in the area  of CSIRTs.  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/management-board- decisions/MBDecision%202019_3amending%20PD2019%20 and%20adjusting%20budget2019.pdf  ENISA continued to provide the secretariat of  the CSIRT Network and actively supported the  network’s functioning by suggesting ways to improve  cooperation and trust building among CSIRTs.  ENISA also supported this cooperation by developing  and providing guidance and examples of good  practice in the area of operational community efforts.  In this way, ENISA responded to the request by  members of the CSIRT Network regarding information  exchange and secure communication, for instance.  In particular, ENISA worked on the topics of proactive  detection of incidents and secure communications,  and the preparation of the second report to the NIS  CG as defined by the NISD.  In addition, ENISA had an active role in supporting the  CSIRTs in the CSIRT Network in activities related to  the CEF work programme. ENISA actively supported  teams in testing and use of the Core Service Platform  (CSP) cooperation mechanism for CSIRTs, known as  MeliCERTes36.  Trust being an important asset for CSIRT operations,  ENISA strived to improve the level of trust in the  network by providing one trust-building exercise and  three face-to-face meetings in coordination with the  CSIRT Network management.  ENISA further improved, developed and secured  the CSIRT Network infrastructure (i.e. CSIRT  Network Cooperation Portal and other means of  communication) to ensure smooth cooperation  between members and for its use in administration.  O.4.2.2. Support the fight against cybercrime  and collaboration between CSIRTs and law  enforcement  Main achievements:    annual workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs and their law  enforcement agency counterparts, co- organised with Europol/EC3;    cooperation between CSIRTs and law  enforcement: interaction with the judiciary.  ENISA provided significant support in the cooperation  between the CSIRTs and the law enforcement  agencies and in the further cooperation with  the judiciary.  36 Project funded by the EU to connect CSIRTS around the  Member States.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf  44  ENISA produced a roadmap of possible activities on  the basis of a broad survey. Specific stakeholders  in this field were selected to further enhance  the cooperation between the CSIRTs and law  enforcement, along with their interaction with  the judiciary.  ENISA also continued its efforts in support of the  fight against cybercrime, an EU-wide objective, and  liaised with various stakeholders at EU level (notably  Europol/EC3), together with stakeholders selected at  Member State level.  ENISA also prepared training material used in training  sessions organised by the European Union Agency  for Law Enforcement Training and in the hands-on  training delivered in the eighth ENISA–EC3 workshop.  Additionally, a report on technical aspects  of cooperation across these two operational  communities was drafted to highlight gaps  and make concrete recommendations to  stakeholders in this field.  ENISA co-organised the annual workshop for national  and governmental CSIRTs and their law enforcement  agency counterparts with Europol/EC3.  O.4.2.3. Supporting the implementation and  development of the MeliCERTes platform  Main achievements:  ENISA took over the central component of  MeliCERTes, designed to be the primary cooperation  platform between participating Member States’  CSIRTs and to improve Member States’ preparedness,  cooperation and coordination in order to efficiently  respond to emerging cyberthreats as well as to cross- border incidents.  ENISA actively supported the platform handover  procedure from an operational perspective (i.e.  managing the trust circles).  In particular, ENISA engaged in the cooperation with  the Commission to ensure a smooth transfer of the  knowledge and expertise regarding the trust circles  management.  Additionally, ENISA implemented specific mandatory  operational procedures for system administration.  4.2 Outputs and performance indicators for Activity 4: COMMUNITY  Summary of outputs in Activity 4: COMMUNITY – Foster the emerging European  NIS community Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 4.1.

Management  This topic is covered in Part II.1, ‘Management Board’.  The Resources Department oversees a variety of  programmes, projects and services regarding ENISA’s  management and horizontal services, assisting the  executive director in areas such as human resources,  finance and procurement, internal communications,  ICT, facilities management, health and safety,  physical security, legal services, protocol and liaison  with local authorities.  The aim of the Resources Department is to ensure  the operation of these services based on the legal  and financial framework and to do so with the highest  level of efficient and effective use of the financial and  human resources available to ENISA.  The main internal stakeholders in ENISA are the staff,  the executive director and the Management Board.  Externally, the main stakeholders include, but are  not limited to, the IAS of the European Commission,  the ECA, the European Ombudsman, the European  Anti-Fraud Office and Commission services such as  DG Human Resources and Security, DG Budget, DG  Communications Networks, Content and Technology,  and more.  Significant attention is given to the internal policies  related to transparency, fraud prevention, whistle- blower protection, avoidance of conflicts of interest,  and so on.  Special attention is given to maintaining a modern  and safe public administration, so as to protect the  EU public and institutions. The focus is on a constant  alignment with achieving the agency’s strategy.  Internally and externally, objectives and monitoring  strategies are set with the objective of implementing  optimal solutions for delivering on ENISA’s mandate  and work programme, assuring the functioning  of the required horizontal services both within  adequate risk levels and in full compliance with the  legal requirements.  The objective of the Resources Department is to  equip the agency with state-of-the-art strategies,  programmes and tools to optimise the use of  resources across ENISA, enabling it to deliver on the  work programme and statutory commitments.  The Core Operations Department coordinates  the delivery of ENISA’s core activities. As such, its  main role is to deliver on Activities 1–4 of the work  programme. It also includes the Policy Office and  the Public Affairs Team. The support for the ENISA  Advisory Group and National Liaison Officers  (NLO) Network is also carried out within the Core  Operations Department.  b. Policy Office  ENISA initiated and further developed strategic  cooperation with relevant stakeholders active in the  cybersecurity community.  For instance, it engaged in policy and strategy  discussions with political and policy decision-makers  (by participating in or organising e.g. breakfasts with  Members of the European Parliament).  In addition, ENISA engaged in strategic relationships  to foster further development – for instance with  specific industry sectors at the decision-making level  (i.e. with industry groups) to identify cybersecurity  issues of strategic importance.  ENISA further developed its cooperation with the  EDA, CERT-EU and EC3 in the context of the existing  memorandum of understanding with those bodies.  More details of the activities delivered by the Policy  Office and the Public Affairs Team are given under  ‘Objective 2: Engagement with stakeholders and  international activities’ below.  The Policy Office also delivered ENISA’s planning  activities, including the preparation of the single  programming document and coordination of the  work programme.  Further to the publication of the CSA, the 2019  work programme was amended; the Policy Office  coordinated the work involved.  c. Public Affairs Team  The Public Affairs Team is responsible for  coordinating all activities with the media and press,  including press releases, news items and interviews.  It also plays a major role in supporting events  attended by ENISA, ensuring that ENISA is well  represented from a public affairs perspective, that  48  appropriate publicity material is available and, where  appropriate, that booths are arranged and supported.  d. Internal control  This topic is covered in Part III – ‘Assessment of the  effectiveness of the internal control systems’.  e. Information technology  ENISA made important decisions in 2019 to  improve its security posture and resilience. The  implementation of the projects below, initiated  in 2019, could not be started until 2020. They are  expected to be fully developed by 2021. This came  in addition to the constant monitoring of the threat  landscape and market evolution.  Some of the main projects/investments initiated in  2019 are as follows:    a new data centre in the Heraklion office;    a new data centre in the Athens office;    a disaster recovery site, using a partnership with  a decentralised EU agency in Alicante, Spain – the  European Union Intellectual Property Office;    a set of measures, as identified in a risk  assessment, with the objective of increasing  preparedness and resilience of the IT security and  cybersecurity in ENISA’s corporate systems.  In addition to the main projects indicated above,  smaller projects were also initiated. These projects  are part of the constant effort to improve internal  operations, enhancing the security and availability of  ENISA services to all ENISA stakeholders.  The corporate IT team also assumed the  responsibility for taking over the MeliCERTes project  from the Commission. Throughout the year, the team  invested an extensive amount of work in the project,  in coordination with the Commission and Consortium  of suppliers38.  As planned, in November 2019 the platform was  handed over to ENISA and is now successfully running  within ENISA’s infrastructure.  38 “The consortium is composed of three members of the CSIRTs  Network, which have a proven track record of both building  new tooling and maintaining software over the long-term,  such as CERT.at, CERT.PL, CIRCL and CERT EE.” Quoted  from https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/open- platform-and-tools-to-facilitate-the-collaboration-among- computer-security-incident-response-teams  In addition to running the system, the IT team is also  responsible for being the help desk for all the CSIRTs  using this facility.  The KPIs defined in the 2019 work programme were  all achieved, as shown in the table below.  Task Objective Level of  completion  in 2019  Keep ENISA’s systems  safe from (external)  cybersecurity incidents  – prevent and react to  threats  Security 100 %  Patching IT-managed  servers by deadline  (24 hours after being  received from supplier)  Security 100 %  Ensure availability of  server exchange  Efficiency 95 %  Ensure availability of  internal applications  Availability  of services  95 %  Help desk: successfully  reply to all service  requests  Efficiency 95 %  f.

This group, composed mainly of industry, academia  and consumer organisation experts, continues to  advise ENISA on its performance of its tasks, except  with regard to the provisions of Title III (‘Certification’).  In 2019, two meetings took place, as planned: one  meeting of the former Permanent Stakeholder Group  and one of the new ENISA Advisory Group.  National Liaison Officers Network  The NLO Network was set up in 2004 as a series  of informal points of communication in the  Member States.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 51  PART I. Achievements of the year  In January 2019, the NLO Network, in its informal  capacity, met once – to set up an action plan for 2019.  As of 27 June 2019, the NLO Network is a statutory  body of ENISA. It is a point of contact at national level  to facilitate cooperation between ENISA and national  experts in the context of the implementation of  ENISA’s annual work programme.  Nominations to the NLO Network were received  from Member States in the course of 2019. This led  to the adoption of Decision No MB/2020/04 of the  Management Board of ENISA, officially establishing  the NLO Network.  b. International relations  Under the executive director’s guidance and  initiative and in line with the approach agreed by the  Management Board, ENISA strengthened contacts  at an international level in line with the relevant  provisions of the new CSA.

The extraordinary meetings took place due to the  need to process the selection and appointment of the  executive director and the elections of the chair and  deputy chair of the Management Board.  In total, the Management Board made 17 decisions  during the year, the appointment of ENISA’s new  executive director being one of the most substantial.  In addition, the 2019–2021 programming document,  the 2019 statement of estimates and the 2019  establishment plan were amended pursuant to the  entry into force of the CSA.  As part of its functions, the Management Board  adopted its analysis and assessment of the 2018  annual activity report in which it commended the  agency on the very high standard achieved in the  delivery of its work. The Management Board also  expressed its opinion on the final annual accounts for  2018 and adopted the ENISA Programming Document  2020–2022, including the 2020 budget and the 2020  establishment plan.  Sharing information with the Management Board  on a regular basis, ENISA reported on the work  programme, budget implementation, and audit and  evaluation activities (by e.g. ECA, IAS), among other  pertinent matters.  The Management Board was informed of any  potential risks or matters impacting quality control.  The board members remained committed to  declaring their interests in order to avoid any conflicts  of interest at meetings.  In addition, the Management Board, in agreement  with the Commission, continued to engage in the  adoption of the necessary implementing measures  in accordance with the arrangements provided for in  Article 110 of the Staff Regulations.  In 2019, the Management Board took note of  the observation on internal controls in the ECA  preliminary observations.  The Management Board decisions were prepared by  the Executive Board and adopted by the Management  Board (Annex 11 – ‘List of Management Board  decisions adopted in 2019’).  The Executive Board had one formal meeting per  quarter.  PART II MANAGEMENT  55  5656  2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS  The most important development concerning ENISA  was the entry into force on 27 June 2019 of the  CSA, conferring a new mandate, with enhanced  competences and resources, on the agency.  The new tasks pertain to the areas of cybersecurity  certification, providing for the improved  coordination of crisis management and for extended  responsibilities under the NISD.  These changes presented challenges in relation to  budgetary consumption, and led to organisational  changes to integrate the new tasks. This necessarily  impacted recruitment. The financial resources  allocated to ENISA increased by 41 % from 2019 to  2020 (see table below).  The establishment plan projected a staff increase of  27 % over the same period (from 98 staff members in  2019 to 124 in 2022).

Financial management  During 2019, the agency operated with a budget of  EUR 11.6 million until 31 May 2019 and with a total  budget of EUR 16.9 million. The amended 2019  budget was adopted by the Management Board by  written procedure on 31 May 2019, and allowed the  agency to make use of the new appropriations.  The table below shows ENISA’s budget implementation targets and achievements in 2019.  Area Objective Target 2019 Level of  completion 2019  Budget implementation (appropriations  committed through the year)  Efficiency and sound financial  management  99 % 97 %  Payments against appropriations of the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound financial  management  85 % 70 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from previous year (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound financial  management  93 % 95 %  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 57ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 57  PART II. Management  b. Budget execution of EU subsidy (C1 funds of  current year 2019N)  During 2019, ENISA committed an amount of  EUR 15 771 526, representing 97 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the year  amounted to EUR 11 424 194, representing 70 % of  the total budget.  Budgetary execution remained high. Compared to  2018, there was a slight decrease in commitment  execution (97 % in 2019 compared to 99 % in 2018)  as well as a decrease in payment execution (70 % in  2019 compared to 89 % in 2018).  The target commitment rate set by the Commission  (DG Budget) for the year (95 %) was reached, despite  the adoption of a significant budgetary increase on  31 May 2019.  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not paid  at the end of 2019 were carried forward to 2020.  The table below summarises the execution of the budget in 2019.  2019 budget (C1)  2019 area  of budget  allocation  Appropria- tion amount  (in EUR)  (1)  Commitment  amount  (in EUR)  (2)  Percentage  committed  (2)/(1)  Payment  amount  (in EUR)  (3)  percentage  paid  (3)/(1)  Amount car- ried forward  to 2020  (in EUR)  Title I 7 636 363 7 458 310 97.67 % 7 100 374 92.98 % 357 936  Title II (*) 4 095 835 3 910 898 95.48 % 1 026 856 25.07 % 2 884 042  Title III 4 560 754 4 402 318 96.53 % 3 296 964 72.29 % 1 105 354  TOTAL 16 292 952 15 771 526 96.80 % 11 424 194 70.12 % 4 347 332  (*) Title II does not include the 2019 subsidy of EUR 435 844 received from the Hellenic authorities for the rent of the building (as  stipulated in the host country agreement).  Further details on budget execution are provided in Annex 2.   c. Amending budget / budgetary transfers  According to the Article 26 of ENISA’s applicable  financial rules, the executive director may transfer  appropriations from one title to another of up to  a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the  financial year allocated to the title from which the  transfer is made. Transfers within the same title are  also permitted, without limit.  Beyond the limit referred to above, the executive  director may propose transfers of appropriations  from one title to another to the Management Board.  The Management Board has 2 weeks to oppose  the proposed transfers. After that time limit, the  proposed transfers are deemed to be adopted.  At the beginning of 2019 ENISA had an original  budget of EUR 11 million. With the adoption of the  CSA, conferring a revised mandate with greater  competences and resources on the agency, its budget  increased to EUR 16.3 million. The Management  Board amended the budget accordingly by written  procedure on 31 May 2019. The agency integrated  and started using the full appropriations provided for  2019 after the decision was made.  During 2019, the executive director made four  transfers within the initial budget and six transfers  within the amended budget. An additional transfer  between titles was approved by the Management  Board on 21 November 2019, transferring  EUR 1.6 million from Title I to Title II. This transfer  was the result of savings under Title I, ‘Staff  expenditure’, mainly due to the late entry into force  of the CSA. This delayed the recruitment planning.  In order to meet all the requirements of ENISA’s new  mandate, a revision and update of the agency’s IT  infrastructure was also needed.  5858  d. Carry-forward of commitment appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not fully  paid at the end of 2018 were carried forward to 2019  (C8 appropriations).  Compared to 2018, there was an increase of 1  percentage point in the commitment execution  (94.93 % in 2019 compared to 93.98 % in 2018) and of  2.6 percentage points in payment execution (94.93 %  in 2019 compared to 92.33 % in 2018), showing an  improvement in finance management in this regard.  The table below summarises the changes to the budget in 2019.  2019 budget (C1) (in EUR)  2019 area of  budget allocation  Initial budget Amended budget Transfers  approved by the  Management  Board and the  executive director  Final budget  Title I 7 133 783 9 387 948 – 1 751 585 7 636 363  Title II (*) 964 101 2 037 000 2 058 835 4 095 835  Title III 2 901 000 4 868 004 – 307 250 4 560 754  TOTAL 10 998 884 16 292 952 0 16 292 952  (*) Title II does not include the 2019 subsidy of EUR 435 844 received from the Hellenic authorities to cover ENISA’s office rental costs as  established in the host country agreement.  The following table shows the commitment execution and payment execution in 2019.  2019 budget (C8)  2019 area of  budget allocation  Appropriations  carried forward  from 2018 to 2019  (in EUR)  Payment amount  (in EUR)  Percentage paid Amount cancelled  (in EUR)  Title I 527 606 505 549 95.82 % 22 057  Title II 323 628 323 122 99.84 % 505  Title III 381 029 341 071 89.51 % 39 958  TOTAL 1 232 263 1 169 742 94.93 % 62 521  4 DELEGATION AND SUBDELEGATION  The executive director has delegated the power  for budget implementation of a maximum of  EUR 500 000 for an unlimited period to the head of  the Resources Department for Titles I and II and to  the head of the Core Operations Department for  Title III. Further financial delegations of a maximum  of EUR 100 000 have been granted to heads of unit  to implement the budget for an unlimited period for  budget items relevant to their assigned tasks.  No further subdelegations have been implemented  at ENISA.  Controls on these delegation rights are mainly done  through a periodical revision of the rights granted in  the main financial system, ‘ABAC41’.  5 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  The Human Resources Unit supports the operational  and administrative goals of the agency in terms of  staff acquisition and development. The planning of,  execution of and accounting for the long- and short-  41 ABAC (Accrual Based Accounting): the acronym of the European  Commission’s project to switch from cash-based to accrual  accounting, and of the new accounting system introduced.  https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/ modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 59ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 59  PART II. Management  term needs of the agency form the majority of the  unit’s regular activities. In this regard, the Human  Resources Unit carries out its tasks in relation to the  management of ENISA’s statutory staff along with  its external staff (e.g. trainees) in line with the staff  regulations / conditions of employment of other  servants of the European Union, as appropriate.  In 2019, ENISA carried out tasks in support of the  deployment of the Commission’s information  management system for human resources (‘Sysper’).  Compliance remained a priority for the Human  Resources Unit both in terms of meeting audit and  internal control recommendations and in terms of  meeting statutory requirements such as in the area of  personal data protection.  In 2019, ENISA increased its efforts to recruit staff  to fill all posts according to the establishment plan  pursuant to the CSA and to lay the groundwork for  recruitment in 2020.  The table below shows ENISA’s planned recruitment goals for 2019 to 2021.  Area Objective 2019 target 2020 target 2021 target  Efficient management  of selection procedures  Reduction of time taken to hire (in line  with the standard EU human resources  definition, this is the timeframe set from the  deadline of the vacancy for candidates to  submit applications until the signing of the  reserve list by the executive director)  ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months  Turnover of staff Reduced turnover rate of statutory staff  (temporary agents and contract agents)  < 15 % < 15 % < 15 %  Staff performance  management  Implementation and monitoring of the  appraisal and reclassification exercises  (launching and completion of the exercises)  100 % 100 % 100 %  6 STRATEGY FOR EFFICIENCY GAINS  ENISA is committed to continuously implementing  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  For this purpose, the agency launched coordinated  initiatives (notably with other EU institutions and  bodies) to create synergies and seek to rationalise  its internal processes to improve its overall efficiency  and to follow the benchmark best practices in the EU  agencies.  In addition, further efficiency gains are planned  for the future, based on the deployment and  enhancing of IT tools and internal procedures (such  as Sysper, the Missions Integrated Processing System,  e-recruitment, etc.).  7 EX POST EVALUATION RESULTS DURING  THE REPORTING YEAR  Ex post audit control and exceptions  In 2019, ENISA performed ex post controls, as part of  the internal control framework, for the 2018 financial  year. A total of 180 financial transactions were  scrutinised, representing 10.67 % of all of the agency’s  financial transactions and 67.72 % of the agency’s  2018 budget. As a result, recommendations were  issued as follows.  Four recommendations were made pertaining to  observations on administrative procedures for which  corrective measures had already been implemented.  One recommendation was related to financial  management, revealing a weakness in forecasting  expenditures for non-fixed costs.  The final recommendation related to the late  payment of the rent subsidy by the Hellenic  authorities, as it delayed the payment from the  agency to the property owner.  In 2019 the agency recorded 38 exceptions: 33 of  these were below the relevant materiality level (less  than EUR 15 000) and of a minor administrative  nature with no financial impact. The remaining five  exceptions were linked to a posteriori commitments.  Reminders and additional information/training  were delivered to the respective project managers  and authorising officers by delegation on the  applicable financial rules and ENISA will look into the  accountability procedure for future events. In relation  to the above, controls for the 2020 carry-forward will  be improved.  6060  The ECA is in charge of the annual audit of the  agency. It compiles its conclusions in the publication  of an annual report in accordance with the provisions  of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union.  For several consecutive years, the ECA’s reports  have confirmed improvement in the agency’s overall  internal control environment and performance.  8 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT AND FOLLOW- UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTION  PLANS FROM AUDITS  This section discloses and assesses the observations,  opinions and conclusions published by auditors in  their reports, along with the limited conclusion of  the internal auditor on the state of internal control,  that may have a material impact on the achievement  of the internal control objectives, and therefore on  assurance, together with any management measures  taken in response to the audit recommendations.  Internal Audit Service  The IAS audit report on human resources  management and ethics was issued in September  2019. Four important and three very important  recommendations were issued in this audit. An action  plan was devised and agreed with the IAS. All issues  should be addressed by the end of 2020.  The IAS audit report on stakeholder involvement  in deliverables was issued in June 2018. Five  recommendations42 were issued during this audit.  ENISA set up a specific task force to ensure the  adequate implementation of the action plan  agreed with the IAS. As of the end of 2019, four  recommendations were considered closed by the IAS.  One important recommendation43 was still pending  as relevant procedures needed to be revised and  approved internally.  European Court of Auditors  Issued in 2019, the ECA report on the 2018 annual  accounts did not contain any critical audit findings.  The agency continued to engage in the improvement  of its internal systems and remained vigilant for  42 Three of these five recommendations have been assessed  as important while the remaining two were deemed very  important.  43 This recommendation was downgraded from very important  to important in 2019 as most of the underlying issues had  been addressed during the year.  potential risks in its activities within the internal legal  and financial framework, in order to strive for the  level of non-compliance issues recommended by the  IAS and the ECA.  9 FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  ISSUED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS BY  THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE  One recommendation issued by the European Anti- Fraud Office relating to a recovery order of EUR 5 600  to a supplier has been actively pursued by ENISA and  is expected to be positively resolved by end of 2020.  10 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  In relation to the 2018 discharge as decided by the  European Parliament, the executive director of the  agency was granted discharge in respect of the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the 2018  financial year. The closure of the agency’s accounts  for the 2018 financial year was also approved.  11 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  While ENISA has not yet adopted a formal  environmental management policy, the agency still  implemented greening measures in 2019 such as:  recycling of office materials, reduction in electricity  usage for lighting and heating/cooling, the use of  video conferencing equipment instead of face-to- face meetings involving travel, use of teleworking,  provision of bicycle racks to promote the use of  public transport and implementing green public  procurement.  All the measures were taken within the scope of the  agency’s activities and to the greatest extent allowed  by its infrastructure and location.  ENISA presently occupies part of a leased building  in Athens. This does not allow the agency to control  the heating/cooling system or to access autonomous  electricity meters. The agency is therefore unable to  directly monitor those systems and assess the impact  of the greening measures implemented.  Therefore, ENISA could not seek to obtain the eco- management and audit scheme certification for its  main office building given the leasing restrictions.  However, achieving this certification will be envisaged  for the new premises to be provided by the Hellenic  authorities.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 61ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 61  PART II. Management  12  COMPLIANCE REGARDING  TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND  INTEGRITY  The agency is committed to maintaining its vigilance  and to ensuring openness and transparency. ENISA  publishes a wide range of documents and other  relevant information on its website (https://www. enisa.europa.eu) to show how the agency is managed  and held accountable. This is done with the objective  of helping the EU public and any other stakeholder  understand how the agency is managed and being  held accountable.  As provided for by the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 2019/881), the Management Board is the  governing body of the agency. It is composed of  representatives of the EU Member States and the  Commission. Its main role is to ensure that the  agency carries out its tasks in accordance with its  operational and strategic objectives, as adopted  through the agency’s annual and multiannual work  programme. It also supervises all budgetary and  administrative matters.  To ensure the transparency of the decisions adopted,  the following documents are published on ENISA’s  website: the internal rules of procedure for the  Management Board, the list of its representatives  and alternates, the minutes of meetings and the  decisions adopted (including annual and multiannual  work programmes).  The Management Board has the responsibility  of appointing the executive director, who is  responsible for implementing the decisions adopted  by the Management Board and for the day-to-day  administration of the agency.  To ensure the transparency and accountability of the  executive function, one of the duties of the executive  director is to provide an annual activity report; this  report is given to the Management Board for analysis  and assessment.  Once approved, and no later than 30 June of the year  following the year under review, the annual activity  report is formally adopted and communicated to  the relevant stakeholders (namely the European  Parliament, the European Council, the Commission  and the ECA). The report outlines the achievements  of the year and the resources used. Once approved,  it is made publicly available through ENISA’s website.  Both the annual accounts (including the budgetary  execution report) and the annual adopted budget are  published on the website.  The executive director, representing the agency,  is accountable to the European Parliament for the  execution of the annual budget. The executive  director must provide the Parliament with all the  information necessary for the discharge procedure.  The discharge procedure is a tool whereby the  Members of the European Parliament check how  public funds were spent and for what purpose. The  Parliament can then decide to grant, postpone or  refuse a discharge for the specific year.  To help the Parliament in the discharge procedure,  independent reviews of the agency are carried out.  On an annual basis, the ECA provides assurance  of the reliability of the annual financial statements  and of the legality and regularity of the transactions  conducted by the agency for the year under review.  The IAS conducts periodic audits on specific topics,  selected based on a risk assessment. The results  and follow-up of these audits must be included in  the annual activity report (see previous sections).  Complementing the external and internal audits,  independent evaluations are carried out to assess  the performance and long-term impact of the  agency’s operations.  To avoid situations that might impair its  independence or impartiality, the agency has  implemented a comprehensive set of rules on  preventing and managing conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, ENISA’s Management Board, Advisory  Group, executive director and officials seconded  The agency is  committed to  maintaining its  vigilance and to  ensuring openness  and transparency.  ENISA publishes a wide  range of documents  and other relevant  information on its  website to show how  the agency is managed  and held accountable.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu https://www.enisa.europa.eu  6262  from Member States on a temporary basis  need to make a declaration of commitments  and a declaration of any interests that might be  considered to be prejudicial to their independence.  These declarations are made in writing.  ENISA adopted an anti-fraud strategy and action  plan in 2014. It achieved significant results in terms  of awareness raising by preparing and delivering  internal training on fraud prevention to its entire  staff. Training is delivered periodically to ensure  that all staff are regularly informed about fraud  prevention. As from 2018, fraud awareness training  sessions are included in the agency’s yearly training  plan, together with the training on ethics and integrity  that is compulsory for all staff. The anti-fraud strategy  is expected to be updated and adopted in 2020.  In addition to the staff regulations, the agency has  to adhere to the Commission code of conduct for all  staff. The code offers comprehensive information and  advice on a variety of issues, ranging from ethics to  compliance with legal obligations. The objective of the  code is to ensure that all employees share the values  of ENISA as an open, accessible and transparent  organisation. Furthermore, in accordance with the  code of good administrative conduct issued by the  European Ombudsman, ENISA intends to commit  to a 2-week deadline for answering requests from  members of the public.  13 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  Generally performance was very good and in line with  expectations, especially given the fact that the agency  delivered on its annual work programme while  simultaneously managing the transition to the new  legal framework.  In this respect, a proactive approach to preparing for  the new tasks, notably in the area of cybersecurity  certification, proved to be well worth the effort. The  work on certification is now proceeding smoothly,  with clear goals for 2020 and a team that is up  to speed.  Work in other key areas, such as implementation  of the NISD and the eIDAS regulation, continue to  develop well. Indeed, in the implementation of the  NISD, ENISA’s role is clearly growing, in terms of  support for both the NIS CG and the CSIRT Network.  The fact that the agency was not able to commit the  budget associated with the CSA until the act had  come into force was a major challenge as the budget  allocation effectively covered the full year.  Other significant challenges included the  Commission’s 5G action plan and the cybersecurity  exercise that the agency organised in order to  support the European Parliament elections. Both  these tasks required significant changes to planning  and both were done at extremely short notice.  Last but not least, the transition to the new director  was very smooth, allowing all annual activities to  finish on time.  In addition to the  staff regulations,  the agency has  to adhere to the  Commission code  of conduct for all  staff. The code offers  comprehensive  information and advice  on a variety of issues,  ranging from ethics  to compliance with  legal obligations.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 63ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 63  PART II. Management  64  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 65  a. Effectiveness of internal control systems  ENISA set up the internal control framework at the  end of 2019.  ENISA has adopted an internal control framework,  based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission’s framework and  on international best practices, following the  Commission’s revision in 2017. The financial  regulation requires the organisational structure  and the internal control systems used for the  implementation of the budget to be set up in  accordance with these principles (Article 36). ENISA  has assessed the internal control systems during the  reporting year and has concluded that the internal  control principles are implemented correctly for  its purposes and in adequate proportion to the  identified risks.  The current instruments used are the following:    100 % verification of financial transactions (ex ante  controls);    internal electronic workflows, assurance of  segregation of duties and several layers of review  and checks;    a register of exceptions;    ex post control report and follow-up measures;    independent audit from the ECA;    independent audit from the IAS (performed by the  European Commission).  These instruments provide adequate and sufficient  assurance as to the completeness and reliability of  the information reported.  ENISA adopted the revised internal control framework  at the end of 2019. The revised framework follows  that of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission as adopted by the  European Commission, and consists of five internal  control components and 17 internal control  principles.  The effective internal control system of processes and  procedures ensures the appropriate management of  the risks in relation to the legality and regularity of the  underlying transactions, and the nature of payments.  The internal control system designed provides  reasonable assurance of achieving effectiveness,  efficiency and economy of operations, reliability of  reporting, safeguarding of assets and information,  and prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of  fraud and irregularities.  The established internal control system is based  on segregation of duties, the risk management and  control strategy, avoidance of conflicts of interest,  appropriate audit trails and data integrity in data  systems, and established procedures for monitoring  PART III ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  66  performance and for follow-up of identified internal  control weaknesses and threats.  Financial management and control is rooted in  such core processes as procurement (from the  assessment of needs to the selection of suppliers  to the award decision), financial operations (all  processes establishing the financial commitment to  payment, contract monitoring and recoveries with ad  hoc procedures in place are 100 % verified through ex  ante verification) and supervisory measures (including  ex post controls and audits), which form the basis for  achieving sound financial management.  Legality and regularity is audited independently by  the ECA.  b. Conclusions of assessment of internal  control systems  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that the objective to constantly enhance  the assurance of reliability of performance, legality  and regularity based on the legal and financial  framework was realised and working as intended in  2019. Internal risks were identified and appropriately  monitored, and mitigation measures were  implemented.  c. Statement of the internal control coordinator in  charge of risk management and internal control  I, the undersigned,  manager in charge of risk management and internal  control within the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA),  in my capacity as manager in charge of risk  management and internal control, declare that, in  accordance with ENISA’s internal control framework,  I have reported my advice and recommendations on  the overall state of internal control in the agency to  the executive director.  I hereby certify that the information provided in the  present consolidated annual activity report and in its  annexes is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate,  reliable and complete.

Review of the elements supporting assurance  The declaration of assurance, provided by the  authorising officer, is mainly based on the following  three pillars:  1.  regular monitoring of the KPIs set for operational,  administrative and financial tasks through the  formal periodical management reporting;  2.  effectiveness of the internal controls and  processes to detect weaknesses and to identify  areas for improvement;  3.  assessment and reports from independent bodies  (external evaluators, financial auditors (ECA,  complemented by a private audit firm), internal  auditors (IAS), etc.).  As highlighted in the previous sections, by the  operational, administrative and financial KPIs, and  by the positive opinion of the ECA on the reliability of  the accounts and on the legality and regularity of the  transaction, and as no critical observations have been  formulated by the IAS, management has sufficient  assurance that ENISA is adequately managed so as to  safeguard its financial resources and to pursue the  tasks with which it has been entrusted.  b. Overall conclusion on assurance  Considering the results of the 2019 annual audits  performed by the ECA and the IAS, the 2019 results  of the internal controls (ex post controls and review  of the register of exceptions) and the 2019 results  of the key financial and operational indicators,  the authorising officer can conclude that ENISA  operated in 2019 in such a way as to appropriately  manage the risks.  In addition, the authorising officer has reasonable  assurance that the allocated resources were used for  their intended purpose, in compliance with the legal  framework and in accordance with the principle of  sound financial management.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  70  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 71  I, the undersigned,  Juhan LEPASSAAR,  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair (44) view of the state of the agency’s  affairs, and state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in  this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial  management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality  and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year  of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the agency.  Athens, 30 June 2019  [signed]  Juhan LEPASSAAR  Executive Director  44  True and fair in this context means reliable, complete and accurate.

A turning point in the history of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA),  2019 set the agency’s future in motion. My esteemed predecessor, Prof. Dr Udo  Helmbrecht, brought to a conclusion 10 years of successful management, paving the  way for the most significant of the year’s achievements: the Cybersecurity Act (CSA),  which came into force in June 2019, providing the agency with a permanent mandate  and significantly extending the scope of its activities.  In addition to expanding the existing activities of the agency, the CSA gives ENISA an  operational role and mandates it to implement the cybersecurity certification framework,  a new challenge that the agency already started to address in 2019. The provisions of  the CSA enhance the capacity of the agency to act as a centre of expertise for the EU,  its Member States and the private and public sectors.  The CSA also establishes the new Advisory Group. Formerly known as the Permanent  Stakeholder Group, its purpose is to take on board the opinions of key stakeholders  such as industry, academia and relevant EU agencies and bodies as well as consumer  protection specialists.  The act also requires us to look to the future in order to ensure that the technological  developments that are about to change our society are properly secure. Today’s  information security must integrate the various concepts used to develop the emerging  technologies of tomorrow, an idea that is reflected in the new name given to ENISA by  the CSA: the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity.  These being significant changes, the introduction of the CSA necessarily had an impact on  the planning of activities. Working closely with its Management Board, ENISA identified a  series of amendments to be made to its work programme to reflect the key changes. I am  happy to report that the revised work programme was successfully implemented during  the course of 2019, the details of which are provided in this report.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 7  As part of this work, the agency continued to reach out to stakeholders through major  events, including the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) (which concluded in  Romania), the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) and the fifth eHealth Security  Conference organised in partnership with the Centre de Seguretat de la Informació  de Catalunya (Centre for Information Security of Catalonia) (CESICAT). Such events  demonstrate ENISA’s ability to draw communities together and further enhance  collaboration across Member States.  As in previous years, the agency delivered a series of publications on important  areas in cybersecurity. These included texts covering a wide range of topics,  providing recommendations and information on securing modern technologies  (e.g. how to implement security by design for the internet of things (IoT) and the  threat landscape of 5G networks), along with a substantial number of reports on  more traditional subjects (e.g. good practices for the security of healthcare services  and good practices for maritime security (port cybersecurity)).  The agency delivered a wide range of training sessions such as those offered during  the sixth Summer School on Network and Information Security (NIS). The topics  covered ranged from quantum computing and cryptography to cyberthreat analysis  and cyberthreat intelligence (CTI). The event was successfully co-organised with the  Foundation for Research and Technology – Hellas (FORTH) based in Heraklion, Crete.  The agency would not have achieved the successful results presented in this report  without the precious support of all our stakeholders and of the communities, European  institutions and bodies and Member States engaged with us in the challenge of keeping  Europe secure. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. I am especially grateful for the  level of commitment evidenced by the achievements of 2019.  Finally, it is time for me to congratulate those passionate professionals at the heart  of ENISA, namely the staff, for their unfailing motivation and engagement. They are  the ones creating the synergies behind the success of the European Union Agency  for Cybersecurity.  Juhan Lepassaar  Executive Director, ENISA  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 91  A new legal basis in 2019  ENISA was established in 20041. The first 4-year  mandate of the former European Network and  Information Security Agency was extended without  interruption in 2009, 2011 and 2013.  The CSA, signed on 17 April 2019, came into force  on 27 June of the same year. Under this new act,  ENISA’s tasks are reinforced and extended with the  new activities under the cybersecurity certification  framework. ENISA’s areas of action are the following:    expertise    policy    capacity    cooperation    certification    enabling.  The CSA also gives the agency a new name – ‘The  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’ – and, for  the first time in its history, a permanent mandate.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and  communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act), OJ  L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 15, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/ reg/2019/881/oj  Mission  ENISA’s mission is to contribute to securing Europe’s  information society. This is achieved by raising  awareness of cybersecurity and by developing and  promoting a culture of NIS in society for the benefit  of citizens, consumers and public and private  organisations in the EU.  The role of ENISA is therefore to ensure a high level  of NIS within the EU. Acting as a centre of expertise,  ENISA supports European institutions and bodies and  Member States to that end.  ENISA’s tasks are the following:    development and implementation of EU policy  and law,    capacity building,    operational cooperation at EU level,    market cybersecurity certification and  standardisation,    knowledge and information sharing,    awareness raising and education,    research and innovation,    international cooperation.

The Executive Board received a copy of the 2019 AAR  produced by the Executive Director of ENISA in his  quality of Authorising Officer for the implementation  of the annual budget on 26 May 2020 and the  Management Board received a copy of the 2019 AAR  on 11 June 2020.  In analysing and assessing the AAR 2019, the  Management Board has concluded the following:    The AAR presents key results of the  implementation of the ENISA Work programme  2019 and leads to conclusion that the Agency  completed all deliverables agreed with the  Management Board in the Work Programme 2019.    Despite challenging circumstances associated  with the transition to the responsibilities of the  new mandate following the entry into force of the  Cybersecurity Act, the Agency was able to meet  the objectives set in the work programme 2019 as  shown by the results presented in this report.    ENISA produced 55 reports on a variety of  subjects pertaining to the current cybersecurity  environment. These reports provided guidance  in ‘traditional areas’ of cybersecurity, such as  critical systems and incident handling, but also in  evolving areas such as SMART technologies and  the Internet of Things (IoT). Impact indicators show  that the Agency's results exceeded the targets  established in the Work Programme 2019, against  the framework of the ENISA Strategy 2016-2020.    In addition to delivering on its core work  programme, ENISA also supported the European  Commission and the Member States in responding  to priorities that arose during the course of the  year – notably the need to secure the elections for  the European Parliament and the support for the  Commission’s 5G Action Plan.    Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work  Programme 2019 and ENISA’s work is well  aligned with the overall European Union priorities  for digital single market. A coherent link is  provided between activities planned in the Work  Programme 2019 and the actual achievements  reached in the reporting period.    The AAR also describes ENISA’s management  of resources and the budget execution of the  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  14  EU subsidy. The changes in the legal mandate  also impacted the allocation of the budgetary  resources. An increase from EUR 11,0 million  to EUR 16,3 million could only be inscribed and  made available to the Agency following the  amendment approved by the Management Board  on 31/05/2019. ENISA was able to implement a  budgetary increase. In 2019, ENISA executed 15  771 525 euros in commitment appropriations  representing 97% of the total budget of the year.    The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2017  Discharge and control results. This section also  notes the main categories of deviation that led to  exceptions reported. In 2019 the agency recorded  38 exceptions. 33 of these are under the relevant  materiality level (less than EUR 15.000) and are  of minor administrative nature with no financial  impact. The remaining 5 exceptions were linked to  a posteriori commitments.    The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate  management of risks, high level of transparency,  data protection, business continuity, as well  as efforts were undertaken to improve overall  efficiency in all activities.    The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration  of assurance of the Executive Director as well as  additional information on human and financial  resources, draft annual accounts and financial  reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the  achievements of ENISA in 2019. The Management  Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA could deliver  work programme 2019 despite the Cybersecurity Act  entering into force on 27 June 2019. The Management  Board expresses its appreciation to the Executive  Director and his staff for their commitment and  achievements throughout the year.  The Management Board notes that the Executive  Director has no critical issues to report which would  affect the presentation of the annual accounts for the  financial year 2019 to the discharge authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management  Board requests the Management Board Secretariat  to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to  the European Commission, the European Parliament,  the Council, the Permanent Representations of the  Member States and the Court of Auditors.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 15  INTRODUCTION  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 171  Implementation of the agency’s annual work  programme: Highlights of the year  THE YEAR IN CONTEXT  There were two major events in 2019 that are of  significance for this report.  The signing of the CSA in June resulted in the need  to amend the work programme to reflect the most  important changes. These changes also impacted the  allocation of the budgetary resources.  In October, ENISA welcomed a new executive director:  Dr Prof. Udo Helmbrecht handed his role over to  Juhan Lepassaar.  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  ENISA’s key performance indicators (KPIs) provide  the metrics with which to measure the performance,  results and impact of the agency’s outcomes and  output. KPIs are defined and outlined in this report  according to the type of output for each activity.  Three types of output are identified: publication (P),  event (E) and support (S).  The major KPIs are the following:    number of reports, news items, dissemination  materials, etc. published;    number of Member States, stakeholders  and communities engaged in discussions  or workshops, or total number of individual  participants;    variety of representatives involved in the  preparation of recommendations;    quantity of training materials developed or  updated;    number of tests and exercises performed;    number of Member States using tools and/or  platforms developed.  ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES  AND OBJECTIVES  The CSA signed in April impacted the strategic  priorities of the agency initially defined for 2019.  As a result, ENISA, together with its Management  Board, identified and agreed on a number of  minor amendments to be performed to align its  activities accordingly.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  18  From an operational perspective, the highlights of the  year were as follows.    ENISA produced 55 reports on a variety of  subjects pertaining to the current cybersecurity  environment. These reports provided guidance  in ‘traditional’ areas of cybersecurity, such as  critical systems and incident handling, but also in  evolving areas such as self-monitoring analysis  and reporting technology (smart) technologies  and the IoT.    As in previous years, the agency was also active in  various awareness-raising activities. The ECSM and  the ECSC are key examples.    ENISA supported the effort to ensure the security  of the European Parliament elections. As part of  this effort, the agency supported an exercise to  ensure that the EU institutions and Member States  were prepared for potential attacks.    Following the high-priority request from the  Commission to engage in activities related to  the cybersecurity of 5G networks, ENISA worked  together with the Commission and the Member  States to produce a consolidated risk assessment  for 5G and an associated threat landscape.  The agency also contributed significantly to the  development of the 5G toolbox. This work was  carried out in addition to the work programme  activities; the only consequence was a delay in  the publication of the ENISA threat landscape  (ETL) report.    Despite the challenging circumstances associated  with the transition to the responsibilities of its  new mandate, the agency was able to meet  the objectives set in the single programming  document, as shown by the results presented in  this report.  ORGANISATION, BUDGET AND  INTERNAL CONTROL  The structure of the organisation had to be slightly  adapted to integrate ENISA’s new activities under the  cybersecurity certification framework, its increased  coordination of crisis management and its extended  responsibilities derived from the NIS directive (NISD).  Budget management was extremely challenging as  the budget associated with the entry into force of the  CSA (constituting an increase from EUR 11 million  to EUR 16.3 million) could only be encoded in  the financial system and made available to the  agency following the amendment approved by  the Management Board on 31 May 2019. This late  transition affected recruitment planning and also  resulted in the need to revise and update the agency’s  information technology (IT) infrastructure to meet the  new requirements under the CSA.  Between 1 January and 31 December 2019,  ENISA executed EUR 15 771 525 in commitment  appropriations, representing 97 % of the total budget  for the year.  Although our ambitious financial goal of committing  99 % of the budget was not achieved, the  commitment rate of 95 % set by the Commission for  the year was exceeded for 2019. Compared to 2018,  there was a slight decrease in commitment execution  (99 %) but ENISA was able to implement a budgetary  increase of almost 50 % following the adoption of  the CSA.  The payment execution rate of 70 % is a result of:    the late entry into force of the CSA;    delays in the recruitment execution, caused by the  late entry into force of the CSA;    late commitment of significant IT infrastructure  investments (in the last quarter of 2019) required  to meet the new challenges associated with  ENISA’s new mandate.  The agency takes the measures necessary to comply  with any observations or recommendations issued  by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) of the European  Commission and the European Court of Auditors  (ECA). The management team continuously uses  all these elements to assess the risk associated  with each area and to further develop controls  and procedures.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 19  INTRODUCTION  KEY CONCLUSIONS  The agency successfully carried out its work  programme throughout 2019 and managed the  transition to the new mandate in a smooth fashion.  In addition to delivering on its core work programme,  ENISA also supported the Commission and the  Member States in responding to priorities that arose  during the course of the year – notably the need  to ensure the security of the European Parliament  elections and the support for the Commission’s 5G  action plan.  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that the objective to increase assurance  of reliability of performance, legality and regularity  based on our legal and financial framework is realised  and working as intended.

ENISA issued guidelines identifying and analysing  good practices for developing applications in a secure  manner, making use of secure software development  life cycle (3) principles. Several IoT security challenges  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for- security-of-iot-1  3 Typically referring to the activities of planning, implementation,  testing, documentation, deployment and maintenance.  can be addressed in this way, such as checking for  security vulnerabilities, secure deployment, ensuring  continuity of secure development in the case of  integrators, continuous delivery and more.  Existing frameworks, guidelines and initiatives were  considered while collaborating with the  ENISA IoT  SECurity (IoTSEC)4 Experts Group and the ENISA  Industry 4.0 Cyber Security Experts Group (EICS)5  Furthermore, targeted IoT case studies were  developed in order to identify risks and vulnerabilities.  This was achieved by setting out appropriate attack  scenarios and providing relevant recommendations  and good practices. ENISA also developed an online  tool that visually represents IoT security measures, in  order to further support stakeholders.  On 8 October 2019, ENISA organised a workshop  in Brussels in order to validate the findings of the  report. The workshop brought together 28 IoT  stakeholders. They all actively contributed to the  study. Overall, the study involved 37 IoT stakeholders  from 9 EU Member States, a European Economic Area  (EEA) country, Israel and the United States.  On 24 and 25 October 2019, the third ENISA–Europol  IoT Security Conference took place in Athens, Greece.  Organised by ENISA in cooperation with Europol, the  event brought together about 180 IoT stakeholders.  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1  5 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/eics-experts-group  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  OF THE YEAR  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot-1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot-1 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/iot-security-experts-group-1 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/eics-experts-group  22  The main topics of the conference included  IoT security and the emerging topic of artificial  intelligence (AI) security.  O.1.1.2. Good practices for the security of  smart cars  Main achievements:    report on good practices for the security of  smart cars;    workshop in Brussels to validate the findings  of the report;    supporting related activities of the European  Commission.  On 25 November 2019, ENISA issued a report on  good practices for the security of smart cars, namely  connected and (semi-)autonomous vehicles and their  added-value features designed to enhance car users’  experience and improve car safety.  This report can be used as a reference point since  it takes all existing standardisation, legislative and  policy initiatives into consideration. It helps promote  the cybersecurity of smart cars across Europe and  raises awareness of relevant threats and risks with a  focus on cybersecurity for safety.  On 7 October 2019, ENISA organised a workshop  in Brussels in order to validate the findings of the  report. The workshop brought together stakeholders  from the EU automotive sector. Overall, the study  involved over 20 automotive stakeholders from 7 EU  Member States.  ENISA also actively supported the Commission  in several activities, including the cooperative,  connected, automated and autonomous mobility  single platform6.  O.1.1.3. Encrypted traffic analysis: use cases and  security challenges  Main achievement:    Report on encrypted traffic analysis.  In 2019, ENISA focused on the disrupting impact  encryption has on network security. According to  recent studies, more than 80 % of internet traffic is  6 The cooperative, connected, automated and autonomous  mobility platform is a joint initiative by DG Mobility and  Transport, DG Communications Networks, Content and  Technology, DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship  and SMEs and DG Research and Innovation  (see https://connectedautomateddriving.eu/mediaroom/ european-commission-launches-ccam-single-platform/).  protected by Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure7 and  applications increasingly use encryption by default for  their communications.  However, encryption is not always used in legitimate  ways. Encryption can also be used in ransomware  and sophisticated malicious software operating with  off-the-shelf or homemade encryption to evade  detection and prevention. This reduces the efficacy  of traditional network detection and protection tools,  since these require access to unencrypted traffic.  Organisations relying on such controls lose valuable  insight and end up relying on an infrastructure hiding  compromising blind spots.  An obvious solution to this problem is to prohibit or  to undo the encryption to allow inspection of traffic.  However, this can only be enforced on legitimate  users and it negates the principle of end-to-end  encryption, potentially exposing data and reducing  user privacy.  A lesser-known alternative leverages machine  learning and AI techniques to make inferences  directly from the encrypted traffic. These techniques  work by analysing traffic metadata, without having to  access the unencrypted payload.  ENISA’s study entitled Encrypted Traffic Analysis – Use  cases & security challenges looks at these techniques  and their use cases, such as encrypted malware and  traffic detection. For each use case, the study identifies  mainstream methods, denoting capabilities and  limitations. The impact of misuse of encryption on the  privacy of end users is also addressed. In addition, the  report presents simple but efficient countermeasures to  correct common bad Transport Layer Security practices.  The objective of the report is threefold; its aim is to:  (a)  advise decision-makers, security practitioners and  administrators on new network security tools and  techniques;  (b)  discourage improper Transport Layer Security  practices;  (c)  alert policymakers to limitations of encryption  posed by machine learning and AI, especially with  respect to user privacy.  7 Estimates place the percentage of web pages loaded by  Firefox using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure at + 80 %.

ENISA issued a set of guidelines for ensuring  cybersecurity in procurement for hospitals. The  guidelines are aimed at IT professionals and  procurement officers in hospitals and healthcare  organisations. They are of specific interest to the  professionals in charge who need to make informed  decisions when procuring services, products or  infrastructure for their organisation. All good  practices presented are linked to the types of  procurement for which they are relevant and to  threats that they can mitigate, providing an easy-to- filter set of practices for hospitals who want to focus  on particular aspects. ENISA collected input from  15 healthcare professionals, covering 8 Member  States and the private sector, namely medical device  manufacturers. The report was officially published in  February 2020.  On 30 October 2019, ENISA held the fifth eHealth  Security Conference in cooperation with CESICAT  in Barcelona, during the Barcelona Cybersecurity  Congress.  The conference brought together high-level speakers  who spoke on cybersecurity to an audience of 100  participants from both the public and the private  sector, from about 17 Member States and European  Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.  ENISA also actively supported the European  Commission and the community through  several actions.  ENISA participated in the Medical Device  Coordination Group – New Technologies Task Force  on Cybersecurity facilitated by DG Internal Market,  Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs. The group  published guidelines to help manufacturers meet all  the relevant safety and performance requirements  of the medical device regulation in regard to  cybersecurity (‘MDCG 2019–16 – Guidance on  cybersecurity for medical devices’).  ENISA also engaged in the European Cybersecurity  Health Group established by the eHealth Network  (run by DG Health and Food Safety). The group is  meant to identify technical measures to enhance  cybersecurity in healthcare organisations by raising  24  awareness and building capabilities in the area.  Through their national healthcare authorities,  12 Member States participated in the group.  Finally, ENISA supported the community and relevant  authorities in the creation of the NIS CG work stream  dedicated to the healthcare sector. The work stream  supported the implementation of the directive by  operators of essential healthcare services. Activities  are meant to start in 2020.  O.1.1.5. Good practices for maritime security  Main achievements:    report on good practices for chief information  security officers (CISOs) and chief information  officers of port authorities and terminal operators;    workshop in Lisbon to strengthen the  cybersecurity of EU ports hosted by the European  Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA);    activities in support of DG Mobility and Transport  and EMSA.  ENISA conducted a study to produce a comprehensive  set of good practices for CISOs and chief information  officers of operators involved in the port ecosystem,  especially port authorities and terminal operators.  Cybersecurity in ports is addressed in a holistic  manner for the first time in the report. It provides  detailed mapping of the relevant stakeholders,  interfaces and key services. It also introduces an  extensive taxonomy of port assets covering both IT  and Operational Technology. It proposes a detailed  threat taxonomy. It also defines four key scenarios of  potential attacks on ports.  The report concludes with a list of policy,  organisational and technical security measures, to be  implemented for protection against cyberattacks. The  report was developed in cooperation with a number  of EU ports and has been widely referenced.  On 26 November, ENISA organised a workshop  in Lisbon with the objective of strengthening the  cybersecurity of EU ports. The workshop was hosted  by EMSA and brought together over 60 stakeholders  from the EU maritime sector. A significant part of  the workshop was dedicated to a discussion on  ENISA’s report Port Cybersecurity – Good practices for  cybersecurity in the maritime sector. The afternoon  session focused on the concept of ‘information  sharing and analysis centres’ (ISACs), including  presentations on good practices and lessons learnt  from similar initiatives in other sectors.  A total of 75 stakeholders from 18 Member States  actively contributed to these activities by providing  input on the drafting of the report and/or by  participating in the workshop.  ENISA also actively supported the Commission  and EMSA in several activities, including:    the organisation by DG Mobility and Transport  of a maritime cybersecurity workshop in Brussels;    the organisation of a tabletop cybersecurity  exercise by EMSA in Lisbon;    EMSA’s SafeSeaNet project.  1.1.2 Objective 2: NIS threat landscape and  analysis – outputs  O.1.2.1. Annual ENISA threat landscape  Main achievements:    5G threat landscape mapping;    risk assessment work in support of the 5G toolbox;    organisation of CTI training (cyberthreat analysis,  CTI and practical cryptography) delivered during  the 2019 Summer School;    preparation of CTI-EU event8 of 30th and 31st  January 2020.  The ETL is an annual compilation of the cyberthreats  that have been encountered throughout the year.  The ETL summarises the top 15 cyberthreats,  based on the number of occurrences, as reported  in open-source resources, such as various reports,  articles, incident analyses and expert opinions.  The ETL report provides strategic intelligence on the  cyberthreats assessed, including points of interest,  statistics, mitigation measures, main incidents,  information about threat actors and their motives,  attack vectors deployed, mitigation measures and  authoritative resources.  In 2019, the Commission requested that ENISA be  involved in the work on the cybersecurity of 5G  networks9. Considered high priority, the extra work  this endeavour represented did not allow ENISA to  issue the ETL that it usually delivers on a yearly basis.  The 2019 ETL was therefore postponed to 2020. The  ETL report for 2019 will be based on data collected  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu- bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence  9 Commission recommendation of 26 March 2019 –  Cybersecurity of 5G networks, C(2019) 2335 final, available  at: https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_ id=58154  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2019-cti-eu/2019-cti-eu-bonding-eu-cyber-threat-intelligence https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 25  PART I. Achievements of the year  during both 2019 and the first half of 2020. The ETL  is expected to be released in mid 2020.  Further to the Commission’s request in relation to 5G,  ENISA delivered mapping of the 5G threat landscape.  The 5G threat landscape was developed thanks  to existing work of ENISA in the area (of software- defined networking / 5G threat landscapes). It was  created with the support of relevant stakeholders,  and was supported by the NIS CG.  The content of the 5G threat landscape was  communicated to other relevant bodies, such as  the Body of European Regulators for Electronic  Communications (BEREC) working group on 5G.  In support of the Member States, the Commission  and relevant stakeholders, ENISA consolidated  national risk assessments performed by Member  States into a single document.  For this task, ENISA engaged in close cooperation  with DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology by means of common efforts  towards the consolidation of the national risk  assessments received.  The NIS CG reviewed the material in a continuous  manner.  This consolidated risk assessment and the 5G threat  landscape were merged into a joint review of the EU- wide risk exposure of 5G networks and formed the  basis for the development of the 5G toolbox10.  ENISA continued to engage with its CTI Expert Group  in 2019. The group supported ENISA in streamlining  various tasks in the area of CTI. It provided advice  for the key ENISA CTI stakeholder event ‘CTI-EU’. It  also provided support for the organisation of the CTI  training during the 2019 ENISA Summer School and  contributed to information collection.  ENISA also delivered training sessions on cyberthreat  analysis, CTI and practical cryptography during the  ENISA–FORTH NIS Summer School.  The objective of such training sessions is to promote  cyberthreat analysis by ensuring knowledge transfer  on CTI matters between cybersecurity practitioners.  The feedback received from participants has revealed  the interest of the community in cyberthreat analysis.  10 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ ip_20_123  O.1.2.2. Restricted and public info notes on NIS  Main achievements:  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and  developments through info notes.  The work on info notes was suspended in 2019  further to the emergence of activities to be performed  in relation to 5G.  Resources allocated to this task were transferred to  the 5G threat landscape and the consolidation of 5G  national risk assessments.  O.1.2.3. Support for incident-reporting activities  in the EU  Main achievements:    Article 13a11 Expert Group meetings and Border  Gateway Protocol (BGP) security paper;    Article 1912 meetings and 2-day  cryptography seminar;    update of the telecoms and trust services  breach-reporting templates;    report on breach-reporting synergies.  Throughout the year, ENISA continued to engage in  the cooperation with ENISA’s expert group set up to  carry out the provisions of Article 13a of the Telecom  Framework Directive.  Every year the group of experts from European  national telecoms security authorities sees its number  of members and meeting attendance increase.  The group is chaired by the Dutch telecoms authority.  Formed of 28 countries (from the EU/EFTA/EEA), the  group validated the EU-wide annual telecoms security  incidents report.  About 45 experts from telecoms security authorities  joined the meetings related to the provisions of  Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive in  Stockholm, Ljubljana and Belgrade.  The Article 13a in-depth technical publication  focused on BGP security (7 Steps to Shore up BGP)  was drafted and delivered in close cooperation  with industry experts.  11 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  12  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-19  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-19  26  ENISA continued to engage in strengthening its  cooperation with supervisory bodies and with FESA13,  supporting ENISA’s expert group set up to carry out  the provisions of Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  Chaired by the Austrian supervisory body, the group, now  involving 29 countries (from the EU/EFTA/EEA), validated  the EU-wide annual trust services security incidents  report. A total of 40 experts from trust service supervisory  bodies joined the meetings related to the provisions of  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation in Tirana and Paris.  ENISA also hosted and delivered a 2-day cryptography  seminar (theoretical and practical) for experts  from the supervisory bodies (to support the  Article 19 Expert Group).  ENISA maintained its cooperation with the EU  Member States on EU-wide breach reporting. This  cooperation operates along two lines:    the support given by ENISA to the NIS CG work  stream 3 (NISD breach reporting) building on the  telecoms breach-reporting experience;    the work of adapting the telecoms and trust  service breach-reporting templates, for better  alignment with the NISD.  The new tool is designed to support telecoms,  trust services and the NISD, and uses the  NIS CG taxonomy.  ENISA also delivered a new map of breach-reporting  processes: the breach-reporting synergies paper.  The breach-reporting synergies paper, delivered by  ENISA, was validated by the group, 12 countries and  20 experts from the NIS CG work stream 3.  The paper was delivered to the work stream  by the deadline in the work stream 3 work plan  (end of 2019).  O.1.2.4. Regular technical reports on the state  of cybersecurity  Main achievement:    report on software vulnerabilities.  For this particular output, ENISA produced a report  on the state of software vulnerabilities for 2018/2019.  The report analyses the actual figures and generates  intuitive statistics on the root causes of the most  critical vulnerabilities. In order to produce this  13 Forum of European supervisory authorities for trust services  providers: http://www.fesa.eu/  deliverable, ENISA engaged with experts in the related  fields from the CTI and the CSIRT community.  1.1.3 Objective 3: Research, development and  innovation – outputs  O.1.3.1. Supporting cybersecurity public–private  partnership in establishing priorities for EU  research and development  Main achievements:    publication of an information and communications  technology (ICT) consultation paper on digital  sovereignty;    report on research and innovation directions for  EU digital sovereignty.  To help shape the research and innovation  landscape, ENISA produced a report on the most  important cybersecurity research priorities, following  an open consultation.  In 2018 the focus was on improving the EU’s cyber  safety14. A new report was necessary to identify  the research and innovation directions for  EU digital sovereignty.  To that end, ENISA studied recent relevant  cybersecurity research roadmaps proposed and  defined by several groups in the EU including recent  Networks of Excellence, the European Cyber Security  Organisation (ECSO) and several national initiatives.  To select the most relevant research directions, ENISA  created a survey and invited a wide community of  stakeholders to express their opinions.  About 100 stakeholders responded to the survey  and ENISA drafted its conclusions to be discussed in  an open validation, in which an ECSO representative  and members of ECSO Working Group 6 were invited  to participate.  A final presentation of the results was given to the  ECSO Working Group 6 community in February 2020.  In addition, ENISA provided secretariat support to  the National Public Administration Committee. Two  meetings were scheduled by ECSO in 2019, one in  February and the other in May.  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the- european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  http://www.fesa.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/analysis-of-the-european-r-d-priorities-in-cybersecurity  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 27  PART I. Achievements of the year  1.2 Outputs and performance indicators for Activity 1: EXPERTISE  Summary of outputs from Activity 1: EXPERTISE – Anticipate and support Europe  in facing emerging NIS challenges Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 1.1.

In 2019, ENISA supported the work on the legislative  and policy developments leading to the official  publication of the CSA, which came into force  on 27 June.  ENISA continued working towards meeting  preparatory requirements for the certification  framework for ICT security products and services  by, for example, promoting mutual recognition  or harmonisation of certification practices up to a  certain level, in line with the provisions of the act.  The activities in the area of cybersecurity certification  were performed in line with the existing national  efforts and interests as well as the principle that,  wherever possible, decisions must be taken at the  level of government closest to the public (i.e. the  principle of ‘subsidiarity’) that applies in the area  of certification, while taking into consideration the  ongoing legislative process.  ENISA provided support to the Commission and the  Member States in the policy area on certification  of products and services within the scope of the  approved CSA and to better support the new EU  cybersecurity certification framework for products  and services. Within this framework, ENISA entered  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 29  PART I. Achievements of the year  the final steps of the CSA. ENISA subsequently  endeavoured to stimulate the interaction and  involvement of Member States’ governments as well  as public policy and industry stakeholders before  the emergence of the EU certification framework.  The final approval of the CSA required ENISA to  maintain excellent cooperation with Member  States’ governments while transitioning from  policy preparation to policy implementation. The  achievement of the CSA is evidence of that success.  ENISA provided support for the organisation of  the EU cybersecurity certification framework. It  supported the Commission in its role in the European  Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) and  analysed aspects of functional equivalence of existing  certification schemes across the EU with the emerging  EU certification framework in order to facilitate the  transition to the new EU framework. ENISA further  developed its interaction with key stakeholders  associated with the EU cybersecurity certification  framework.  2.1.2 Objective 2: Supporting EU policy  implementation – outputs  O.2.2.1. Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS regulation  Main achievements:  ENISA continued its work on supporting public  and private bodies in implementing the electronic  identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation  by addressing technological aspects and building  blocks for trust services. Deliverables throughout  2020 were determined in consultation with the  Commission and with public authorities in the  Member States through the eIDAS Expert Group.  Interacting with the private sector enhanced ENISA’s  ability to make further meaningful contributions in  this area. In implementing the CSA, ENISA supported  the Member States’ and the Commission’s efforts  in electronic identification. The eIDAS Expert  Group was consulted for approval on specific  ENISA implementation guidelines and technical  recommendations addressing operational aspects  of trust service providers, conformity assessment  bodies and supervisory authorities. ENISA continued  to accumulate experience of best-practice and  state-of-the-art progress, seeking to emphasise  implementation and interoperability. These  recommendations complemented the existing  knowledge base that ENISA created for the trust  service providers. ENISA took into account the  recommendations and standards developed by the  European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) /  the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation (CENELEC), the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and  the International Organization for Standardization  and sought to avoid both duplication of work and  potentially opposing approaches. In this regard,  ENISA supported the Commission in assessing the  relevant standards by reviewing how they met the  requirements of the eIDAS regulation.  O.2.2.2. Supporting the implementation of the  work programme of the NIS CG  Main achievements:  ENISA completed another year of strong support of  the NIS CG, in close collaboration with the members  of the group and the Commission. Projects included  the work on the European Parliament elections  and on the 5G risks and toolbox. ENISA continued  to engage closely with many different groups of  sectorial authorities and regulators in the different  work streams. ENISA supported all work streams with  drafting reports, performing analyses and conducting  seminars on various sectors and topics, such as  the energy sector, digital service providers (DSPs),  the digital infrastructure sector, security measures,  dependencies, blueprints, elections, etc.  The working group of DSP authorities, under NIS CG  work stream 5, validated and worked closely with  ENISA on the NISD digital services scope / decision  tree – a working document, validated and delivered to  the work stream (accessible via the Communication  and Information Resource Centre for Administrations,  Businesses and Citizens only).  ENISA hosted work streams 5 (digital services) and 10  (digital infrastructures), organising the following.    Two working meetings in Athens.    A joint exercise for authorities.    A seminar by the Réseaux IP Européens Network  Coordination Centre (a regional internet registry  covering Europe, the former USSR and West Asia;  RIPENCC) on internet infrastructure.    A training session on cloud security. Over the week  60 experts from different authorities attended.  ENISA heavily supported the work on 5G,  consolidating national risk assessments and  developing a 5G toolbox. This important work was  completed on time, and was well appreciated upon its  publication by the Commission in January 2020.  30  O.2.2.3. Assist Member States in the  implementation of security requirements for  operators of essential services and DSPs  Main achievements:  In 2019, ENISA contributed to addressing  the challenge posed by the different security  requirements stemming from multiple regulatory  frameworks by issuing a report on the provisions  on operators of essential services (OESs) and DSPs  laid down by the NISD, as well as the general data  protection regulation (GDPR). The report aims to  provide a harmonised approach to using the available  ENISA guidance – an approach that can also be used  by any organisation that plans to implement security  measures appropriate for the security of network  and information systems as well as for personal data  protection. The report was disseminated at the NIS  CG plenary meeting in September.  In 2019 ENISA developed a web tool that provides  interactive mapping of security measures for OESs,  defined by the NIS CG16, onto international standards  from different business sectors mentioned in Annex 2  to the NISD. The tool was presented in the last NIS CG  plenary of 2019 and was welcomed by the Member  States. It is available on the ENISA website17.  O.2.2.4. Supporting the implementation of the  payment services directive  This output was removed following amendment 7 to  the 2019 work programme18 to reflect organisational  changes while taking on board new tasks and new  priorities (i.e. MeliCERTes, a project funded by the EU  to connect CSIRTS around the Member States).  O.2.2.5. Contribute to the EU policy in the area of  privacy and data protection with policy input on  security measures  Main achievements:    the seventh Annual Privacy Forum (APF) held  in cooperation with the University Tor Vergata  and LUISS University and with the support of the  Garante per la protezione dei dati personali  (the Italian Data Protection Authority);  16 NIS CG Publication 01/2018, ‘Reference document on security  measures for Operators of Essential Services’, available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_ id=53643  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum- security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  18 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/management-board- decisions/MBDecision%202019_3amending%20PD2019%20 and%20adjusting%20budget2019.pdf/view    report on data pseudonymisation.  Within the scope of security measures required by  the legal framework on personal data protection and  privacy as well as appropriate provisions of the draft  CSA on the role of ENISA in this area, ENISA continued  promoting trust and security in digital services by  means of technical analyses on the implementation  of EU legislation addressing privacy and personal data  protection.  In particular, ENISA addressed aspects of shaping  technology in accordance with GDPR, with a special  focus on data pseudonymisation. The main outcome  is a report based on ENISA’s past work in the field  and provides an analysis of key pseudonymisation  techniques, along with specific use cases and relevant  scenarios.  In addition, following previous work on the security  of personal data processing, ENISA published a  web tool19 and a manual. These were developed to  support controllers and processors in performing risk  assessments and adopting security measures for the  protection of their personal data.  The seventh APF – a conference that has grown to be  a major event for ENISA – remained the instrument  of choice to bring together key communities, namely  those of policy, academia and industry, in the broader  area of privacy and data protection while focusing  on privacy-related areas of application. The 2019 APF  took place in Rome, in cooperation with the University  Tor Vergata and LUISS University and with the  support of the Italian Data Protection Authority20.  Cooperation activities with Commission services,  the European data protection supervisor (EDPS), the  European Data Protection Board and national data  protection authorities were further pursued. In this  context, a conference on personal data breaches  was jointly organised with the EDPS. Moreover, an  invitation-only workshop on data pseudonymisation  was co-organised by the Unabhängiges Landeszentrum  für Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein (ULD) (the German  data protection authority of Schleswig-Holstein) and  ENISA.  ENISA continued promoting the visibility of security  measures for data protection and privacy, through  considerations of IT security of products on the one  hand, and through the area of certification of services  on the other. ENISA liaised with stakeholders and  policymakers as well as with competent authorities  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/risk-level-tool/ 20 https://2019.privacyforum.eu/  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/pseudonymisation-techniques-and-best-practices https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/edps-enisa-conference/edps-enisa-conference-towards-accessing-the-risk-in-personal-data-breaches https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/uld-enisa-workshop/uld-enisa-workshop-pseudonymization-and-relevant-security-technologies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/risk-level-tool/ https://2019.privacyforum.eu/  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 31  PART I. Achievements of the year  in the Member States and EU institutions to identify  potential for synergy between privacy and security  and assistance for key stakeholders, namely the  Commission and competent EU bodies.  O.2.2.6. Guidelines for EU standardisation  in ICT security  Main achievements:  Building on its own policy work, existing standards  and the requirements of the Member States, this  activity makes recurrent contributions in terms of gap  analyses and/or provides guidance on implementing  existing cybersecurity standards.  Additionally, ENISA maintains the relationship  developed with the EU and international  standardisation organisations (CEN/CENELEC and  ETSI; International Organization for Standardization  and International Electrotechnical Commission).  It thus contributes to their standardisation work  at the strategic and tactical levels. For instance,  it facilitates cooperation between the relevant  technical committees of ETSI (Technical Committee –  Cybersecurity) and CEN/CENELEC (Joint Technical  Committee 13). It also promotes participation in  various conference programme committees, and  organises highly recognised and well-attended  standardisation conferences.  New requirements associated primarily with the  implementation and secondly with the transposition  of the EU legal instruments in place in the Member  States will be taken into account. These requirements  include aspects of the NISD and the GDPR, as well as  the preparation for the entry into force of the draft  ePrivacy regulation, the draft CSA and more.  ENISA contributed to this relationship with its  technical and organisational knowledge, which  was further leveraged in extending or assessing  standards, the objective being to tailor them to  stakeholders while making them compliant with  the prevailing regulatory framework. Of particular  importance is the participation of ENISA in the work  of the International Organization for Standardization  Subcommittee 27.  In carrying out this work, ENISA consulted the  Member States, industry and standard-developing  organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN/CENELEC, International  Organisation for Standardization). ENISA organised  an annual conference on cybersecurity standards  with these organisations and consulted with the  Commission services and agencies endowed with  competence for policy as appropriate.  O.2.2.7. Supporting the implementation of the  European Electronic Communications Code  Main achievements:    telecoms security event in Stockholm;    ETIS21 Information Security Working  Group meeting;    report “security supervision changes under  the European Electronic Communications  Code” (EECC).  The telecoms security event in Stockholm had an  attendance of 75 experts, from both the public and  the private sector. At this event, the Commission and  ENISA gave talks about the upcoming EECC.  ENISA hosted and organised the ETIS Information  Security Working Group in Athens beginning of 2019.  At this industry event, one of the most important ISAC  groups for telecoms, initial discussions on the EECC  took place with the industry experts.  In 2019, ENISA produced and delivered a seminal  paper for the future work on the EECC: ‘Telecoms  security supervision changes under the EECC’, based  on legal analyses and discussions with regulators,  ministries, the Commission and the private sector.  The paper was validated by all 28 countries in the  group. Intermediate drafts were discussed during  meetings held in June and October with the regulator.  A solid basis was laid for the future work with the EU  Member States on telecoms security supervision.  O.2.2.8. Supporting the sectorial implementation  of the NISD  Main achievements:    Transport Cyber Security Conference organised  with DG Mobility and Transport, the European  Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), EMSA and the  European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), held on  23 January 2019;    establishment of the Transport Resilience and  Security Expert Group;    facilitating the European Rail ISAC;    energy sector survey.  On 23 January 2019 in Lisbon, ENISA held the first  Transport Cyber Security Conference.  21 https://www.etis.org/page/About_Us  https://www.etis.org/page/About_Us  32  The conference had the support of the European  Commission (DG Mobility and Transport), EASA, EMSA  and ERA.  More than 170 public and private partners from all  over Europe, representing all modes of transport,  took part in the event. Together, they discussed  the EU legal framework for cybersecurity and its  relevance for the transport sector, and explored  options for further cooperation.  The discussions demonstrated the importance of  intensifying the cooperation between DG Mobility and  Transport, DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology, ENISA, EASA, EMSA and ERA to raise  the level of cybersecurity in transport.  In addition, ENISA established the Transport  Resilience and Security Expert Group in 2019  to support its activities in the transport sector.  In 2019, the European Rail ISAC was launched and  two general assemblies took place over the course  of the year. Cybersecurity professionals from  European infrastructure managers and railway  undertakings met and exchanged information on  cybersecurity issues. Together, they planned the  next steps to increase cybersecurity capabilities and  raise awareness in the sector. Initially more than  eight Member States were members of the European  Rail ISAC, which has been heavily supported and  facilitated by ENISA (as a partner).  In 2019, ENISA conducted a survey along with a set  of interviews with various stakeholders from the  energy sector in order to identify challenges and  good cybersecurity practices. The preliminary results  were examined with the members of the NIS CG work  stream 8 (energy) (covering 15 Member States). Based  on the information collected, the agency will consider  the priorities of the energy utilities and cybersecurity  trends in the energy sector in general.  O.2.2.9. Hands-on tasks in the area of certification  of products and services  Main achievements:  Having adopted the finally approved CSA and its  component on certification, ENISA started to support  the Commission and the Member States by carrying  out hands-on tasks in this area designed to assist  them in deploying the framework.  ENISA is developing a framework for certification  schemes, along with carrying out structured  interactions with the stakeholder community, and has  started to provide the procedures and tools required  to implement the new tasks.  Working in cooperation with Member States’  certification supervisory authorities, the ECCG  and other key stakeholders, ENISA set the stage  for implementation. To that end, ENISA supports  the functional equivalence of existing certification  schemes across the EU (at both the national and  the EU level) with the emerging EU cybersecurity  certification framework for integrating existing  schemes into the new EU framework in a flexible way.  ENISA maintained its cooperation with stakeholders  to collect, establish and understand their expectations  of the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  ENISA implemented an action plan to accelerate  the launch of the new tasks pertaining to the  cybersecurity certification framework for the benefit  of the Member States.  Practical aspects to be considered included but were  not limited to:    identifying new areas in certification;    recommendations of next steps to take at EU level;    analysis of impact of certification  for manufacturers;    Supporting governments and end users;    recommendations on prioritisation of schemes;    review of overlaps between and gaps in  proposed schemes.  Concretely, ENISA launched two ad hoc working  groups to respond to the 2 requests received in the  area, specifically on:  (a)  a cybersecurity certification scheme in the area  of common criteria for transposing the Senior  Officials Group Information Systems Security  Mutual Recognition Agreement; and on  (b)  a cybersecurity certification scheme in the area of  cloud services.  ENISA assisted the Commission in launching and  supporting the ECCG. It also prepared a proposal  in relation to the membership of the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group.  ENISA carried out support activities in the area of  certification through an annual conference and a  validation workshop.  ENISA carried out very important preparatory  work internally to develop a platform dedicated to  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 33  PART I. Achievements of the year  the support of the ad hoc working group in their  certification tasks as provided for in the CSA. ENISA  worked further on implementing a new infrastructure  for web-based activities mandated by the CSA.  2.2 Outputs and performance indicators  for Activity 2: POLICY  Summary of outputs from Activity 2: POLICY – Promote NIS as an EU policy priority Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 2.1.

In 2019 most of the activities in this area aimed at  maintaining and extending the guidelines on good  practices and training materials for CSIRTs and other  operational personnel.  ENISA supported the development of Member  States’ incident-response preparedness by providing  guidance on good practices in key elements of NIS  capacity building. The focus was on CSIRT training and  services in order to improve CSIRTs’ skills and those  of their personnel.  In detail, ENISA performed the necessary updates of  the training material, according to the findings of the  study taking stock of training needs in NISD sectors.  A new set of training materials based on emerging  technologies was created in order to improve  Member State CSIRTs’ skills and capacities to manage  cybersecurity incidents more efficiently.  A special emphasis was placed on supporting  Member States’ CSIRTs and EU bodies with concrete  advice such as examples of good practice and  concrete actions such as the CSIRT training.  ENISA also directly provided tailor-made technical  training and advice to Member States that requested  such support.  In 2019, ENISA further enhanced its methodology,  seminars and training on:  (a)  cyber-crisis management;  (b)  the organisation and management of exercises.  These developments stemmed from the existing  materials and infrastructure for on-site and online  training on these subjects. In addition, this activity  included delivering training upon request.  On 12 and 13 September 2019, ENISA, in  collaboration with the European Security and  Defence College, organised and hosted a pilot course  dedicated to information security risk management.  The 2-day course was attended by 27 experts from  9 Member States and 4 EU institutions at the ENISA  branch office in Heraklion, Crete. Through bolstering  their cybersecurity knowledge and exchanging  experiences and good practices, they honed  their skills and capabilities in cybersecurity and  risk management.  All participants shared the opinion that the course  should be made available every year.  O.3.1.2. Support EU Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies  Main achievements:    report on good practices and innovation under the  national cybersecurity strategies (NCSSs);    the updated interactive NCSS map;    seventh national cybersecurity workshop in  Warsaw, organised with Naukowa i Akademicka  Sieć Komputerowa (Research and Academic  Computer Network, NASK) Poland.  ENISA issued a report addressing challenges, good  practices and recommendations from the Member  States in their efforts to execute innovation as a  strategic priority of their NCSSs.  The report analyses different Member States’  innovation approaches, stakeholders, challenges,  funding mechanisms and initiatives that support  innovation objectives at a national level. Through  interviews, 15 stakeholders from 12 Member States  provided input and validated the results of the report.  A new version of the interactive NCSS map was  released in 2019. It became an info hub with  information provided by the Member States in  their efforts to enhance their cybersecurity at  national level. Designed with the most up-to-date  information, the map is considered a valuable asset  by the community.  36  On 26 September, ENISA, in collaboration with NASK  Poland, held the seventh national cybersecurity  workshop in Warsaw.  A total of 78 stakeholders from national competent  authorities, private and public organisations,  academia and CSIRTs were present.  ENISA presented the report on good practices in  innovation under NCSSs and the updated NCSS map.  The event focused on ‘innovation in cybersecurity’,  covering Member States’ approaches and initiatives  and presented by officials from Spain, Austria, Poland,  the United Kingdom, the Commission and ENISA.  Stakeholders from national and EU ISACs such as  those for the energy, financial and rail sectors shared  their experiences with the tools they use, good  practices and the challenges they face when dealing  with information sharing and cooperation.  O.3.1.3. Support EU Member States in their  incident-response development  Main achievements:  In 2019, ENISA assisted the Member States in  improving their incident-response capabilities by  providing an updated perspective on the CSIRT  landscape and its development in Europe.  In close cooperation with the NISD CSIRT Network,  ENISA supported the development of the  Member States’ incident-response capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions  of NIS capability building with a focus on the  development and efficient functioning of national  and sectorial CSIRTs.  ENISA offered direct support to individual Member  States that requested the assessment and  improvement of their incident-response capabilities,  including assistance in the preparatory phase of the  Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) proposals.  ENISA helped Member States and other incident- response stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy  their incident-response capabilities and services in  order to meet the ever-growing challenges of securing  their networks.  The agency further developed and applied its own  recommendations for CSIRT baseline capabilities  and a maturity framework. It conducted four peer  reviews to assess the maturity level of CSIRT Network  members and supported CSIRT Network members in  conducting their own peer reviews.  ENISA maintained its support for cross-border CSIRT  community projects and development of tools,  and continued to engage in the global dialogue on  common definitions and maturity frameworks in the  incident-response domain.  ENISA’s experts on incident response became  certified Security Incident Management Maturity  Model (SIM3) auditors to enhance the performance of  CSIRTs in the EU.  O.3.1.4. Support EU Member States in the  development of ISACs for the NISD sectors  Main achievements:    13th European Energy ISAC plenary meeting, on  26 and 27 November 2019;    first inter-EU-ISAC meeting, on 10 October 2019.  ENISA has been engaged in close cooperation with  the EU’s OESs over the years.  A number of sectorial expert groups were set  up, covering sectors such as transport, finance  and health.  ENISA actively supports sectorial ISACs, such as  the European Energy ISAC, the European Financial  Institutes ISAC and the European Rail ISAC.  On 26 and 27 November 2019, ENISA held the 13th  European Energy ISAC plenary meeting.  In 2019, ENISA  assisted the Member  States in improving  their incident-response  capabilities by providing  an updated perspective  on the CSIRT landscape  and its development  in Europe.  https://opencsirt.org/csirt-maturity/sim3-and-references/  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 37  PART I. Achievements of the year  Energy sector stakeholders had the opportunity  to exchange views on critical infrastructure threat  analysis, the activities of the energy community and  NISD-related challenges for energy operators.  The open session saw participation from 50 experts.  On 28 November, a training session on network  forensics, tailored to the needs of the energy sector  community, was delivered to the plenary participants  by ENISA.  The training room was fully booked and the  participants expressed a wish to see ENISA organise a  similar initiative in the near future. This confirms the  success and the need for such an event. Five Member  States and three OESs signed up for an extra activity,  namely the European Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition and Control System Information Exchange  (EuroSCSIE) meeting.  On 10 October 2019, ENISA held the first-ever inter- EU-ISAC meeting. The purpose of the meeting was  to bring together the chairs of the existing EU-wide  ISACs in order to discuss both administrative and  operational challenges and identify possible solutions  and ways to ensure close collaboration in the future.  In addition, the event gave the Commission the  opportunity to engage the ISACs in the dialogue on  the funding opportunities available through the CEF  telecoms project.  The participants welcomed this initiative from ENISA  and agreed to organise the meeting on a yearly basis  from then on.  3.1.2 Objective 2: Supporting EU institutions in  capacity building – outputs  O.3.2.1. Representation of ENISA on the CERT-EU  Steering Board and coordination with other EU  agencies using CERT-EU services  Main achievements:  The members of the Computer Emergency Response  Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies  (CERT-EU) Steering Board include the participating EU  institutions and ENISA, representing the EU agencies  using CERT-EU services.  In this context ENISA is actively engaged in the  activities of the CERT-EU Steering Board on a  permanent basis.  In 2019, ENISA maintained its cooperation with the  EU agencies on operational issues related to CERT-  EU’s activities, in particular through the ICT Advisory  Committee of the EU agencies. ENISA’s role in this  context is to ensure that the viewpoints of the  agencies are adequately represented.  ENISA also reports to the CERT-EU Steering Board on  the evolution of services required by the agencies.  O.3.2.2. Cooperation with relevant EU bodies  on initiatives covering the NIS dimension of  their missions  Main achievements:  ENISA has seen its cooperation efforts with a number  of EU bodies increase since 2017. ENISA has been  involved in the following:    cooperation with CERT-EU in the context of the  WannaCry incident;    providing support in the context of the annual  International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon)  between Cyber Europe, Cyber Coalition and  Locked Shields;    contribution to the preparation of the tabletop  exercise conducted in the context of the Estonian  Presidency.  In this context, ENISA strengthened its cooperation  efforts and continued to engage and liaise with the  relevant EU bodies23 (such as EASA, CERT-EU, the  European Defence Agency (EDA) – including civil/ defence cooperation – etc.).  ENISA also engaged with the European Union  Institute for Security Studies and the Commission’s  Service for Foreign Policy Instruments in delivering  the first EU Cyber Forum, and showcased  cybersecurity work in the EU.  3.1.3 Objective 3: Assisting in improving  private sector capacity building and general  awareness – outputs  O.3.3.1. European Cyber Security Challenges  Main achievements:    supporting the sixth ECSC, in Bucharest from 9 to  11 October 2019.  The sixth ECSC, ECSC 2019, took place in Bucharest  from 9 to 11 October.  23 Memorandum of understanding between ENISA, the EDA,  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and CERT- EU (see: https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/ documents/mou–eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3–23-05-18.pdf).  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf  38  The event was organised by the Asociația Națională  pentru Securitatea Sistemelor Informatice (the  Romanian national association for information  systems security) and the Centrul Național de Răspuns  la Incidente de Securitate Cibernetică (the national  cybersecurity and incident-response team) and held  at the Palace of the Parliament.  Each country was represented at the ECSC final by  a team of 10 contestants, all winners of the national  competitions. The ages of half the participants ranged  from 14 to 20 while the other half ranged from 21 to 25.  In total, the event brought together 300 people,  representing contestants, coaches and judges, all of  whom competed in the ECSC final in Bucharest and  covered a total of 20 EU and EFTA countries (Austria,  Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany,  Greece, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the  Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,  Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom).  The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web  applications, binaries and document files, solved  puzzles with cryptographic componentscryptograms  and hacked hardware systems.  However, technical skills were just one part of  the story. Teamwork and presentation skills were  also evaluated, allowing a significant range of the  important skills for an IT security team to be tested.  The finalists of ECSC 2019 were the teams from  Romania24, Italy and Austria.  ENISA is actively hosting different platforms and  performing different activities to support the ECSC  host country and the evolution of the project.  These include:    the main ECSC website;    the ECSC information-sharing platform;    a common public affairs strategy;    designing challenges scenarios.  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the host  of each ECSC in order to ensure appropriate and  transparent reporting to the steering committee.  24 https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/past-editions  O.3.3.2. European Cyber Security Month  Main achievements:  The metrics built into the ECSM show an increased  number of participants and a better engagement level  in 2019 than in 2018.  The 2019 campaign had a different format to that of  previous years. The activities were developed around  two themes: cyber hygiene and emerging technology.  According to the report, the conferences and  workshops attracted nearly three times more visitors  than in previous years.  In 2019, ENISA continued to engage with Member  States and the public alike to promote cybersecurity.  Previously proposed pillars remain: support for a  multi-stakeholder governance approach; encouraging  common public–private activities; assessment of the  impact of activities, optimising them and adapting to  new challenges as appropriate.  O.3.3.3. Support EU Member States in the  development of cybersecurity skills  Main achievements:  ENISA performed an analysis of the EU and  international initiatives in the field of cyber skills  development and collected input from EU Member  States on their policies in the field of cybersecurity  education. These gave rise to the two following  initiatives.  a.  A White Paper entitled Cybersecurity Skills  Development in the EU. The paper focuses on  the state of the cybersecurity education system  and its inability to attract more students to the  area of cybersecurity. It provides considerations  and recommendations for policy interventions  at national and EU level in order to address the  shortage of cybersecurity skills.  b.  The Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. The  database’s25 objective is to become the focal point  of reference for all members of the EU public who  seek to improve their cybersecurity knowledge and  skills. This will allow young talent to make informed  decisions on the variety of possibilities offered by  higher education in cybersecurity and will help  universities attract high-calibre students motivated  to ensure cybersecurity for the EU.  25 Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/past-editions https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/education-map  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 39  PART I. Achievements of the year  3.2 Outputs and performance indicators for Activity 3: CAPACITY  Summary of outputs in Activity 3: CAPACITY – Support Europe in maintaining state- of-the-art NIS capacities Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 3.1.

ENISA managed to finalise the preparations for the  sixth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe  2020. The preparations closely followed up on  and built on the lessons learned and actions from  previous exercises, such as Cyber Europe 2018.  Cyber Europe 2020 was designed to focus on the  health sector’s testing capabilities and procedures,  namely large-scale incident management cooperation  procedures at EU and national level.  The crisis escalation scenario includes 18 distinct  realistic incidents focused on capturing real life more  accurately. The exercise includes explicit scenarios  for the CSIRT Network, the EU institutions and the  operational cooperation single points of contact and  competent authorities as identified in the blueprint.  ENISA also organised the Cyber SOPEx (formerly  known as EuroSOPEx) for the CSIRT Network  to increase cooperation. As in previous years,  the exercise was planned with the support of  representatives from the organisations involved.  The exercise had a number of objectives: to raise  awareness of cooperation procedures, to train  participants in using cooperation infrastructures  such as communication and information sharing and  ultimately to contribute to increasing trust within the  CSIRT Network.  The theme of the scenario was the European  Parliament elections.  O.4.1.2. Support activities for cyber exercises  Main achievements:  ENISA has been developing the cyber exercise  platform (CEP) since 2014.  The CEP hosts a number of services that ENISA  offers to Member States and EU institutions, such  as: exercise organisation and management, an  exercise playground with technical incidents, a  map of exercises and the hosting of the exercise  development community.  In addition, new content and practice incidents and  material were developed in order to maintain the  interest of the stakeholders and to make the CEP a  central tool in cybersecurity practice exercises for  all stakeholders.  The CEP opens up new opportunities for ENISA to  enlarge its user base and thus offer the operational  cybersecurity communities opportunities to practise  and gain experience and knowledge.  In 2019, the CEP was used to host a national exercise  for the first time. The Portuguese National Cyber  Security Centre held Portugal’s national cyber exercise  in May 2019, using the unique exercise management  infrastructure developed by ENISA.  O.4.1.3. Support the implementation and  further development of the cyber-crisis  collaboration blueprint  Main achievements:    first EU tabletop exercise, code-named ‘EU ELEx19’,  on 5 April 2019;    first cyber law enforcement exercise, ‘CyLEEx19’, on  31 October 2019;    conference on the future of EU cyber-crisis  management on 3 and 4 June 2019.  ENISA continued to be committed to supporting the  implementation and development of the EU cyber- crisis management blueprint in 2019.  As specified in the blueprint, ‘[c]yber crisis response  activities should be coordinated with other crisis  management mechanisms at EU, national or  sectoral levels.’  ENISA maintained its efforts to offer continuous  support to the Commission in further developing  bilateral and multilateral standard operating  procedures (SOPs) for cyber-crisis cooperation with  42  EU bodies and institutions, and to Member States.  It does so either through the NIS CG’s activities or  by responding to individual requests from Member  States for the development of SOP blueprints at  national level.  In addition, ENISA supported EU institutions and  Member States in testing their crisis management  structures, as explained below.  The Parliament, the Member States, the Commission  and ENISA organised this first EU tabletop exercise,  code-named EU ELEx19, on 5 April 2019.  The objective of the exercise, carried out on the  Parliament premises, was to test the effectiveness of  national and EU crisis response practices and plans. It  was also designed to identify how any cybersecurity  incidents that might arise and affect the 2019  European Parliament elections could be prevented,  detected and mitigated.  The exercise was part of the measures being  implemented by the EU to ensure free and fair  elections in May 2019. It lasted a full day and the  participants included 80 players from 27 Member  States, together with observers from the European  Parliament, the Commission and ENISA.  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and  ENISA successfully co-organised the first-ever  cyber law enforcement exercise, called ‘CyLEEx19’,  on 31 October 2019.  This exercise, held in a simulated environment,  was designed to:    test the European Union Law Enforcement  Emergency Response Protocol32;    identify deficiencies and potential for  improvement;    increase preparedness in case of a real-life  cyberattack;    evaluate the procedure for aligning the law  enforcement agencies’ response with other EU  bodies that play a role in the EU blueprint.  The cyber simulation took place in a single day. It  was a lightweight but intellectually intensive exercise  that explored the effects of large-scale transnational  cyberattacks on the capability of law enforcement and  32 Europol document EDOC#1012248 (see: https://www.europol. europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies- across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks).  on the partners involved to carry out their tasks in  accordance with the protocol.  Furthermore, on 3 and 4 June 2019, the agency held  a conference in Athens, focusing on the future of the  EU’s cyber-crisis management. The advantages and  challenges were identified, particularly where the use  of AI is concerned.  The objective of the conference was to provide  a discussion forum for the EU organisations and  bodies that are the main stakeholders of the  blueprint proposal for a cyber-crisis cooperation  framework. It also aimed to bring together experts  on AI from the private sector and academia to  discuss the uses and applications of AI and machine  learning in the context of cyber-crisis cooperation,  such as how AI can support the response to large- scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents at the  strategic and political levels.  O.4.1.4. Supporting the implementation of the  information hub  Main achievements:  Intelligence supporting decision-making in the  cybersecurity domain is scarce, despite today’s  security information overload33.  ENISA is at the crossroads of most if not all public– private, cross-sector cybersecurity communities in  Europe, from the technical to the strategic level.  As indicated in the Commission communication on  building strong cybersecurity for the EU34, ENISA  serves as the ‘focal point for information and  knowledge in the cybersecurity community’.  As a result, ENISA is in a unique position to leverage  its network to gather information, process it and  foster timely, tailored and highly relevant situational  awareness to support decision-making in both  the public and the private European sectors, as  recommended by the Commission in the blueprint.  As part of the regular cooperation at a technical and  operational level to support EU situational awareness  in the context of the blueprint, ENISA issued EU  cybersecurity situation reports on incidents and  threats, based on publicly available information, its  33 Scott J. and Spaniel D., ‘CISO Solution Fatigue – overcoming  the challenges of cybersecurity solution overload’, Hewlett  Packard Enterprise, Institute for Critical Infrastructure  Technology, 2016 (http://icitech.org/wp-content/ uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf).  34 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies-across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies-across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-agencies-across-eu-prepare-for-major-cross-border-cyber-attacks http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 43  PART I. Achievements of the year  own analysis and reports shared with it by Member  States’ CSIRTs (on a voluntary basis) or NISD single  points of contact, EC3 at Europol, CERT-EU and, where  appropriate, the European Union Intelligence and  Situation Centre at the European External Action  Service and other EU institutions.  The report was made available to the relevant  bodies of the Council, the Commission, the High  Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and  Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission  and the CSIRT Network.  To best support the fusion of open-source  information for these reports, ENISA migrated  the Open Cyber Situational Awareness Machine  (OpenCSAM) platform to an operational environment.  The operational OpenCSAM includes enhanced  functionalities and capabilities, building on the  experience gained from the first prototype.  The tool received wide acceptance by blueprint  stakeholders.  As the first brick of a broader capability, the tool is  called ‘the ENISA Info Hub’. It is meant to assist in  the compilation of input from blueprint stakeholders  on the development of EU cybersecurity situation  reports, supporting a steady increase and offering  guarantees of shorter production times, of quality  and of consistency.  O.4.1.5. Supporting the implementation of the  cyber-crisis collaboration blueprint  This output was replaced by output O.4.1.3 following  amendment 13 to the 2019 work programme35.  4.1.2 Objective 2: CSIRT and other NIS community  building – outputs  O.4.2.1. EU CSIRT Network secretariat and support  for EU CSIRT Network community building  Main achievements:  ENISA maintained the activities meant to support  the Commission and Member States in the  implementation of the NISD, in particular in the area  of CSIRTs.  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/management-board- decisions/MBDecision%202019_3amending%20PD2019%20 and%20adjusting%20budget2019.pdf  ENISA continued to provide the secretariat of  the CSIRT Network and actively supported the  network’s functioning by suggesting ways to improve  cooperation and trust building among CSIRTs.  ENISA also supported this cooperation by developing  and providing guidance and examples of good  practice in the area of operational community efforts.  In this way, ENISA responded to the request by  members of the CSIRT Network regarding information  exchange and secure communication, for instance.  In particular, ENISA worked on the topics of proactive  detection of incidents and secure communications,  and the preparation of the second report to the NIS  CG as defined by the NISD.  In addition, ENISA had an active role in supporting the  CSIRTs in the CSIRT Network in activities related to  the CEF work programme. ENISA actively supported  teams in testing and use of the Core Service Platform  (CSP) cooperation mechanism for CSIRTs, known as  MeliCERTes36.  Trust being an important asset for CSIRT operations,  ENISA strived to improve the level of trust in the  network by providing one trust-building exercise and  three face-to-face meetings in coordination with the  CSIRT Network management.  ENISA further improved, developed and secured  the CSIRT Network infrastructure (i.e. CSIRT  Network Cooperation Portal and other means of  communication) to ensure smooth cooperation  between members and for its use in administration.  O.4.2.2. Support the fight against cybercrime  and collaboration between CSIRTs and law  enforcement  Main achievements:    annual workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs and their law  enforcement agency counterparts, co- organised with Europol/EC3;    cooperation between CSIRTs and law  enforcement: interaction with the judiciary.  ENISA provided significant support in the cooperation  between the CSIRTs and the law enforcement  agencies and in the further cooperation with  the judiciary.  36 Project funded by the EU to connect CSIRTS around the  Member States.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MBDecision 2019_3amending PD2019 and adjusting budget2019.pdf  44  ENISA produced a roadmap of possible activities on  the basis of a broad survey. Specific stakeholders  in this field were selected to further enhance  the cooperation between the CSIRTs and law  enforcement, along with their interaction with  the judiciary.  ENISA also continued its efforts in support of the  fight against cybercrime, an EU-wide objective, and  liaised with various stakeholders at EU level (notably  Europol/EC3), together with stakeholders selected at  Member State level.  ENISA also prepared training material used in training  sessions organised by the European Union Agency  for Law Enforcement Training and in the hands-on  training delivered in the eighth ENISA–EC3 workshop.  Additionally, a report on technical aspects  of cooperation across these two operational  communities was drafted to highlight gaps  and make concrete recommendations to  stakeholders in this field.  ENISA co-organised the annual workshop for national  and governmental CSIRTs and their law enforcement  agency counterparts with Europol/EC3.  O.4.2.3. Supporting the implementation and  development of the MeliCERTes platform  Main achievements:  ENISA took over the central component of  MeliCERTes, designed to be the primary cooperation  platform between participating Member States’  CSIRTs and to improve Member States’ preparedness,  cooperation and coordination in order to efficiently  respond to emerging cyberthreats as well as to cross- border incidents.  ENISA actively supported the platform handover  procedure from an operational perspective (i.e.  managing the trust circles).  In particular, ENISA engaged in the cooperation with  the Commission to ensure a smooth transfer of the  knowledge and expertise regarding the trust circles  management.  Additionally, ENISA implemented specific mandatory  operational procedures for system administration.  4.2 Outputs and performance indicators for Activity 4: COMMUNITY  Summary of outputs in Activity 4: COMMUNITY – Foster the emerging European  NIS community Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 4.1.

Management  This topic is covered in Part II.1, ‘Management Board’.  The Resources Department oversees a variety of  programmes, projects and services regarding ENISA’s  management and horizontal services, assisting the  executive director in areas such as human resources,  finance and procurement, internal communications,  ICT, facilities management, health and safety,  physical security, legal services, protocol and liaison  with local authorities.  The aim of the Resources Department is to ensure  the operation of these services based on the legal  and financial framework and to do so with the highest  level of efficient and effective use of the financial and  human resources available to ENISA.  The main internal stakeholders in ENISA are the staff,  the executive director and the Management Board.  Externally, the main stakeholders include, but are  not limited to, the IAS of the European Commission,  the ECA, the European Ombudsman, the European  Anti-Fraud Office and Commission services such as  DG Human Resources and Security, DG Budget, DG  Communications Networks, Content and Technology,  and more.  Significant attention is given to the internal policies  related to transparency, fraud prevention, whistle- blower protection, avoidance of conflicts of interest,  and so on.  Special attention is given to maintaining a modern  and safe public administration, so as to protect the  EU public and institutions. The focus is on a constant  alignment with achieving the agency’s strategy.  Internally and externally, objectives and monitoring  strategies are set with the objective of implementing  optimal solutions for delivering on ENISA’s mandate  and work programme, assuring the functioning  of the required horizontal services both within  adequate risk levels and in full compliance with the  legal requirements.  The objective of the Resources Department is to  equip the agency with state-of-the-art strategies,  programmes and tools to optimise the use of  resources across ENISA, enabling it to deliver on the  work programme and statutory commitments.  The Core Operations Department coordinates  the delivery of ENISA’s core activities. As such, its  main role is to deliver on Activities 1–4 of the work  programme. It also includes the Policy Office and  the Public Affairs Team. The support for the ENISA  Advisory Group and National Liaison Officers  (NLO) Network is also carried out within the Core  Operations Department.  b. Policy Office  ENISA initiated and further developed strategic  cooperation with relevant stakeholders active in the  cybersecurity community.  For instance, it engaged in policy and strategy  discussions with political and policy decision-makers  (by participating in or organising e.g. breakfasts with  Members of the European Parliament).  In addition, ENISA engaged in strategic relationships  to foster further development – for instance with  specific industry sectors at the decision-making level  (i.e. with industry groups) to identify cybersecurity  issues of strategic importance.  ENISA further developed its cooperation with the  EDA, CERT-EU and EC3 in the context of the existing  memorandum of understanding with those bodies.  More details of the activities delivered by the Policy  Office and the Public Affairs Team are given under  ‘Objective 2: Engagement with stakeholders and  international activities’ below.  The Policy Office also delivered ENISA’s planning  activities, including the preparation of the single  programming document and coordination of the  work programme.  Further to the publication of the CSA, the 2019  work programme was amended; the Policy Office  coordinated the work involved.  c. Public Affairs Team  The Public Affairs Team is responsible for  coordinating all activities with the media and press,  including press releases, news items and interviews.  It also plays a major role in supporting events  attended by ENISA, ensuring that ENISA is well  represented from a public affairs perspective, that  48  appropriate publicity material is available and, where  appropriate, that booths are arranged and supported.  d. Internal control  This topic is covered in Part III – ‘Assessment of the  effectiveness of the internal control systems’.  e. Information technology  ENISA made important decisions in 2019 to  improve its security posture and resilience. The  implementation of the projects below, initiated  in 2019, could not be started until 2020. They are  expected to be fully developed by 2021. This came  in addition to the constant monitoring of the threat  landscape and market evolution.  Some of the main projects/investments initiated in  2019 are as follows:    a new data centre in the Heraklion office;    a new data centre in the Athens office;    a disaster recovery site, using a partnership with  a decentralised EU agency in Alicante, Spain – the  European Union Intellectual Property Office;    a set of measures, as identified in a risk  assessment, with the objective of increasing  preparedness and resilience of the IT security and  cybersecurity in ENISA’s corporate systems.  In addition to the main projects indicated above,  smaller projects were also initiated. These projects  are part of the constant effort to improve internal  operations, enhancing the security and availability of  ENISA services to all ENISA stakeholders.  The corporate IT team also assumed the  responsibility for taking over the MeliCERTes project  from the Commission. Throughout the year, the team  invested an extensive amount of work in the project,  in coordination with the Commission and Consortium  of suppliers38.  As planned, in November 2019 the platform was  handed over to ENISA and is now successfully running  within ENISA’s infrastructure.  38 “The consortium is composed of three members of the CSIRTs  Network, which have a proven track record of both building  new tooling and maintaining software over the long-term,  such as CERT.at, CERT.PL, CIRCL and CERT EE.” Quoted  from https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/open- platform-and-tools-to-facilitate-the-collaboration-among- computer-security-incident-response-teams  In addition to running the system, the IT team is also  responsible for being the help desk for all the CSIRTs  using this facility.  The KPIs defined in the 2019 work programme were  all achieved, as shown in the table below.  Task Objective Level of  completion  in 2019  Keep ENISA’s systems  safe from (external)  cybersecurity incidents  – prevent and react to  threats  Security 100 %  Patching IT-managed  servers by deadline  (24 hours after being  received from supplier)  Security 100 %  Ensure availability of  server exchange  Efficiency 95 %  Ensure availability of  internal applications  Availability  of services  95 %  Help desk: successfully  reply to all service  requests  Efficiency 95 %  f.

The extraordinary meetings took place due to the  need to process the selection and appointment of the  executive director and the elections of the chair and  deputy chair of the Management Board.  In total, the Management Board made 17 decisions  during the year, the appointment of ENISA’s new  executive director being one of the most substantial.  In addition, the 2019–2021 programming document,  the 2019 statement of estimates and the 2019  establishment plan were amended pursuant to the  entry into force of the CSA.  As part of its functions, the Management Board  adopted its analysis and assessment of the 2018  annual activity report in which it commended the  agency on the very high standard achieved in the  delivery of its work. The Management Board also  expressed its opinion on the final annual accounts for  2018 and adopted the ENISA Programming Document  2020–2022, including the 2020 budget and the 2020  establishment plan.  Sharing information with the Management Board  on a regular basis, ENISA reported on the work  programme, budget implementation, and audit and  evaluation activities (by e.g. ECA, IAS), among other  pertinent matters.  The Management Board was informed of any  potential risks or matters impacting quality control.  The board members remained committed to  declaring their interests in order to avoid any conflicts  of interest at meetings.  In addition, the Management Board, in agreement  with the Commission, continued to engage in the  adoption of the necessary implementing measures  in accordance with the arrangements provided for in  Article 110 of the Staff Regulations.  In 2019, the Management Board took note of  the observation on internal controls in the ECA  preliminary observations.  The Management Board decisions were prepared by  the Executive Board and adopted by the Management  Board (Annex 11 – ‘List of Management Board  decisions adopted in 2019’).  The Executive Board had one formal meeting per  quarter.  PART II MANAGEMENT  55  5656  2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS  The most important development concerning ENISA  was the entry into force on 27 June 2019 of the  CSA, conferring a new mandate, with enhanced  competences and resources, on the agency.  The new tasks pertain to the areas of cybersecurity  certification, providing for the improved  coordination of crisis management and for extended  responsibilities under the NISD.  These changes presented challenges in relation to  budgetary consumption, and led to organisational  changes to integrate the new tasks. This necessarily  impacted recruitment. The financial resources  allocated to ENISA increased by 41 % from 2019 to  2020 (see table below).  The establishment plan projected a staff increase of  27 % over the same period (from 98 staff members in  2019 to 124 in 2022).

Financial management  During 2019, the agency operated with a budget of  EUR 11.6 million until 31 May 2019 and with a total  budget of EUR 16.9 million. The amended 2019  budget was adopted by the Management Board by  written procedure on 31 May 2019, and allowed the  agency to make use of the new appropriations.  The table below shows ENISA’s budget implementation targets and achievements in 2019.  Area Objective Target 2019 Level of  completion 2019  Budget implementation (appropriations  committed through the year)  Efficiency and sound financial  management  99 % 97 %  Payments against appropriations of the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound financial  management  85 % 70 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from previous year (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound financial  management  93 % 95 %  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 57ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 57  PART II. Management  b. Budget execution of EU subsidy (C1 funds of  current year 2019N)  During 2019, ENISA committed an amount of  EUR 15 771 526, representing 97 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the year  amounted to EUR 11 424 194, representing 70 % of  the total budget.  Budgetary execution remained high. Compared to  2018, there was a slight decrease in commitment  execution (97 % in 2019 compared to 99 % in 2018)  as well as a decrease in payment execution (70 % in  2019 compared to 89 % in 2018).  The target commitment rate set by the Commission  (DG Budget) for the year (95 %) was reached, despite  the adoption of a significant budgetary increase on  31 May 2019.  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not paid  at the end of 2019 were carried forward to 2020.  The table below summarises the execution of the budget in 2019.  2019 budget (C1)  2019 area  of budget  allocation  Appropria- tion amount  (in EUR)  (1)  Commitment  amount  (in EUR)  (2)  Percentage  committed  (2)/(1)  Payment  amount  (in EUR)  (3)  percentage  paid  (3)/(1)  Amount car- ried forward  to 2020  (in EUR)  Title I 7 636 363 7 458 310 97.67 % 7 100 374 92.98 % 357 936  Title II (*) 4 095 835 3 910 898 95.48 % 1 026 856 25.07 % 2 884 042  Title III 4 560 754 4 402 318 96.53 % 3 296 964 72.29 % 1 105 354  TOTAL 16 292 952 15 771 526 96.80 % 11 424 194 70.12 % 4 347 332  (*) Title II does not include the 2019 subsidy of EUR 435 844 received from the Hellenic authorities for the rent of the building (as  stipulated in the host country agreement).  Further details on budget execution are provided in Annex 2.   c. Amending budget / budgetary transfers  According to the Article 26 of ENISA’s applicable  financial rules, the executive director may transfer  appropriations from one title to another of up to  a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the  financial year allocated to the title from which the  transfer is made. Transfers within the same title are  also permitted, without limit.  Beyond the limit referred to above, the executive  director may propose transfers of appropriations  from one title to another to the Management Board.  The Management Board has 2 weeks to oppose  the proposed transfers. After that time limit, the  proposed transfers are deemed to be adopted.  At the beginning of 2019 ENISA had an original  budget of EUR 11 million. With the adoption of the  CSA, conferring a revised mandate with greater  competences and resources on the agency, its budget  increased to EUR 16.3 million. The Management  Board amended the budget accordingly by written  procedure on 31 May 2019. The agency integrated  and started using the full appropriations provided for  2019 after the decision was made.  During 2019, the executive director made four  transfers within the initial budget and six transfers  within the amended budget. An additional transfer  between titles was approved by the Management  Board on 21 November 2019, transferring  EUR 1.6 million from Title I to Title II. This transfer  was the result of savings under Title I, ‘Staff  expenditure’, mainly due to the late entry into force  of the CSA. This delayed the recruitment planning.  In order to meet all the requirements of ENISA’s new  mandate, a revision and update of the agency’s IT  infrastructure was also needed.  5858  d. Carry-forward of commitment appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not fully  paid at the end of 2018 were carried forward to 2019  (C8 appropriations).  Compared to 2018, there was an increase of 1  percentage point in the commitment execution  (94.93 % in 2019 compared to 93.98 % in 2018) and of  2.6 percentage points in payment execution (94.93 %  in 2019 compared to 92.33 % in 2018), showing an  improvement in finance management in this regard.  The table below summarises the changes to the budget in 2019.  2019 budget (C1) (in EUR)  2019 area of  budget allocation  Initial budget Amended budget Transfers  approved by the  Management  Board and the  executive director  Final budget  Title I 7 133 783 9 387 948 – 1 751 585 7 636 363  Title II (*) 964 101 2 037 000 2 058 835 4 095 835  Title III 2 901 000 4 868 004 – 307 250 4 560 754  TOTAL 10 998 884 16 292 952 0 16 292 952  (*) Title II does not include the 2019 subsidy of EUR 435 844 received from the Hellenic authorities to cover ENISA’s office rental costs as  established in the host country agreement.  The following table shows the commitment execution and payment execution in 2019.  2019 budget (C8)  2019 area of  budget allocation  Appropriations  carried forward  from 2018 to 2019  (in EUR)  Payment amount  (in EUR)  Percentage paid Amount cancelled  (in EUR)  Title I 527 606 505 549 95.82 % 22 057  Title II 323 628 323 122 99.84 % 505  Title III 381 029 341 071 89.51 % 39 958  TOTAL 1 232 263 1 169 742 94.93 % 62 521  4 DELEGATION AND SUBDELEGATION  The executive director has delegated the power  for budget implementation of a maximum of  EUR 500 000 for an unlimited period to the head of  the Resources Department for Titles I and II and to  the head of the Core Operations Department for  Title III. Further financial delegations of a maximum  of EUR 100 000 have been granted to heads of unit  to implement the budget for an unlimited period for  budget items relevant to their assigned tasks.  No further subdelegations have been implemented  at ENISA.  Controls on these delegation rights are mainly done  through a periodical revision of the rights granted in  the main financial system, ‘ABAC41’.  5 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  The Human Resources Unit supports the operational  and administrative goals of the agency in terms of  staff acquisition and development. The planning of,  execution of and accounting for the long- and short-  41 ABAC (Accrual Based Accounting): the acronym of the European  Commission’s project to switch from cash-based to accrual  accounting, and of the new accounting system introduced.  https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/ modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 59ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 59  PART II. Management  term needs of the agency form the majority of the  unit’s regular activities. In this regard, the Human  Resources Unit carries out its tasks in relation to the  management of ENISA’s statutory staff along with  its external staff (e.g. trainees) in line with the staff  regulations / conditions of employment of other  servants of the European Union, as appropriate.  In 2019, ENISA carried out tasks in support of the  deployment of the Commission’s information  management system for human resources (‘Sysper’).  Compliance remained a priority for the Human  Resources Unit both in terms of meeting audit and  internal control recommendations and in terms of  meeting statutory requirements such as in the area of  personal data protection.  In 2019, ENISA increased its efforts to recruit staff  to fill all posts according to the establishment plan  pursuant to the CSA and to lay the groundwork for  recruitment in 2020.  The table below shows ENISA’s planned recruitment goals for 2019 to 2021.  Area Objective 2019 target 2020 target 2021 target  Efficient management  of selection procedures  Reduction of time taken to hire (in line  with the standard EU human resources  definition, this is the timeframe set from the  deadline of the vacancy for candidates to  submit applications until the signing of the  reserve list by the executive director)  ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months  Turnover of staff Reduced turnover rate of statutory staff  (temporary agents and contract agents)  < 15 % < 15 % < 15 %  Staff performance  management  Implementation and monitoring of the  appraisal and reclassification exercises  (launching and completion of the exercises)  100 % 100 % 100 %  6 STRATEGY FOR EFFICIENCY GAINS  ENISA is committed to continuously implementing  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  For this purpose, the agency launched coordinated  initiatives (notably with other EU institutions and  bodies) to create synergies and seek to rationalise  its internal processes to improve its overall efficiency  and to follow the benchmark best practices in the EU  agencies.  In addition, further efficiency gains are planned  for the future, based on the deployment and  enhancing of IT tools and internal procedures (such  as Sysper, the Missions Integrated Processing System,  e-recruitment, etc.).  7 EX POST EVALUATION RESULTS DURING  THE REPORTING YEAR  Ex post audit control and exceptions  In 2019, ENISA performed ex post controls, as part of  the internal control framework, for the 2018 financial  year. A total of 180 financial transactions were  scrutinised, representing 10.67 % of all of the agency’s  financial transactions and 67.72 % of the agency’s  2018 budget. As a result, recommendations were  issued as follows.  Four recommendations were made pertaining to  observations on administrative procedures for which  corrective measures had already been implemented.  One recommendation was related to financial  management, revealing a weakness in forecasting  expenditures for non-fixed costs.  The final recommendation related to the late  payment of the rent subsidy by the Hellenic  authorities, as it delayed the payment from the  agency to the property owner.  In 2019 the agency recorded 38 exceptions: 33 of  these were below the relevant materiality level (less  than EUR 15 000) and of a minor administrative  nature with no financial impact. The remaining five  exceptions were linked to a posteriori commitments.  Reminders and additional information/training  were delivered to the respective project managers  and authorising officers by delegation on the  applicable financial rules and ENISA will look into the  accountability procedure for future events. In relation  to the above, controls for the 2020 carry-forward will  be improved.  6060  The ECA is in charge of the annual audit of the  agency. It compiles its conclusions in the publication  of an annual report in accordance with the provisions  of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union.  For several consecutive years, the ECA’s reports  have confirmed improvement in the agency’s overall  internal control environment and performance.  8 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT AND FOLLOW- UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTION  PLANS FROM AUDITS  This section discloses and assesses the observations,  opinions and conclusions published by auditors in  their reports, along with the limited conclusion of  the internal auditor on the state of internal control,  that may have a material impact on the achievement  of the internal control objectives, and therefore on  assurance, together with any management measures  taken in response to the audit recommendations.  Internal Audit Service  The IAS audit report on human resources  management and ethics was issued in September  2019. Four important and three very important  recommendations were issued in this audit. An action  plan was devised and agreed with the IAS. All issues  should be addressed by the end of 2020.  The IAS audit report on stakeholder involvement  in deliverables was issued in June 2018. Five  recommendations42 were issued during this audit.  ENISA set up a specific task force to ensure the  adequate implementation of the action plan  agreed with the IAS. As of the end of 2019, four  recommendations were considered closed by the IAS.  One important recommendation43 was still pending  as relevant procedures needed to be revised and  approved internally.  European Court of Auditors  Issued in 2019, the ECA report on the 2018 annual  accounts did not contain any critical audit findings.  The agency continued to engage in the improvement  of its internal systems and remained vigilant for  42 Three of these five recommendations have been assessed  as important while the remaining two were deemed very  important.  43 This recommendation was downgraded from very important  to important in 2019 as most of the underlying issues had  been addressed during the year.  potential risks in its activities within the internal legal  and financial framework, in order to strive for the  level of non-compliance issues recommended by the  IAS and the ECA.  9 FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  ISSUED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS BY  THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE  One recommendation issued by the European Anti- Fraud Office relating to a recovery order of EUR 5 600  to a supplier has been actively pursued by ENISA and  is expected to be positively resolved by end of 2020.  10 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  In relation to the 2018 discharge as decided by the  European Parliament, the executive director of the  agency was granted discharge in respect of the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the 2018  financial year. The closure of the agency’s accounts  for the 2018 financial year was also approved.  11 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  While ENISA has not yet adopted a formal  environmental management policy, the agency still  implemented greening measures in 2019 such as:  recycling of office materials, reduction in electricity  usage for lighting and heating/cooling, the use of  video conferencing equipment instead of face-to- face meetings involving travel, use of teleworking,  provision of bicycle racks to promote the use of  public transport and implementing green public  procurement.  All the measures were taken within the scope of the  agency’s activities and to the greatest extent allowed  by its infrastructure and location.  ENISA presently occupies part of a leased building  in Athens. This does not allow the agency to control  the heating/cooling system or to access autonomous  electricity meters. The agency is therefore unable to  directly monitor those systems and assess the impact  of the greening measures implemented.  Therefore, ENISA could not seek to obtain the eco- management and audit scheme certification for its  main office building given the leasing restrictions.  However, achieving this certification will be envisaged  for the new premises to be provided by the Hellenic  authorities.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 61ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 61  PART II. Management  12  COMPLIANCE REGARDING  TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND  INTEGRITY  The agency is committed to maintaining its vigilance  and to ensuring openness and transparency. ENISA  publishes a wide range of documents and other  relevant information on its website (https://www. enisa.europa.eu) to show how the agency is managed  and held accountable. This is done with the objective  of helping the EU public and any other stakeholder  understand how the agency is managed and being  held accountable.  As provided for by the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 2019/881), the Management Board is the  governing body of the agency. It is composed of  representatives of the EU Member States and the  Commission. Its main role is to ensure that the  agency carries out its tasks in accordance with its  operational and strategic objectives, as adopted  through the agency’s annual and multiannual work  programme. It also supervises all budgetary and  administrative matters.  To ensure the transparency of the decisions adopted,  the following documents are published on ENISA’s  website: the internal rules of procedure for the  Management Board, the list of its representatives  and alternates, the minutes of meetings and the  decisions adopted (including annual and multiannual  work programmes).  The Management Board has the responsibility  of appointing the executive director, who is  responsible for implementing the decisions adopted  by the Management Board and for the day-to-day  administration of the agency.  To ensure the transparency and accountability of the  executive function, one of the duties of the executive  director is to provide an annual activity report; this  report is given to the Management Board for analysis  and assessment.  Once approved, and no later than 30 June of the year  following the year under review, the annual activity  report is formally adopted and communicated to  the relevant stakeholders (namely the European  Parliament, the European Council, the Commission  and the ECA). The report outlines the achievements  of the year and the resources used. Once approved,  it is made publicly available through ENISA’s website.  Both the annual accounts (including the budgetary  execution report) and the annual adopted budget are  published on the website.  The executive director, representing the agency,  is accountable to the European Parliament for the  execution of the annual budget. The executive  director must provide the Parliament with all the  information necessary for the discharge procedure.  The discharge procedure is a tool whereby the  Members of the European Parliament check how  public funds were spent and for what purpose. The  Parliament can then decide to grant, postpone or  refuse a discharge for the specific year.  To help the Parliament in the discharge procedure,  independent reviews of the agency are carried out.  On an annual basis, the ECA provides assurance  of the reliability of the annual financial statements  and of the legality and regularity of the transactions  conducted by the agency for the year under review.  The IAS conducts periodic audits on specific topics,  selected based on a risk assessment. The results  and follow-up of these audits must be included in  the annual activity report (see previous sections).  Complementing the external and internal audits,  independent evaluations are carried out to assess  the performance and long-term impact of the  agency’s operations.  To avoid situations that might impair its  independence or impartiality, the agency has  implemented a comprehensive set of rules on  preventing and managing conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, ENISA’s Management Board, Advisory  Group, executive director and officials seconded  The agency is  committed to  maintaining its  vigilance and to  ensuring openness  and transparency.  ENISA publishes a wide  range of documents  and other relevant  information on its  website to show how  the agency is managed  and held accountable.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu https://www.enisa.europa.eu  6262  from Member States on a temporary basis  need to make a declaration of commitments  and a declaration of any interests that might be  considered to be prejudicial to their independence.  These declarations are made in writing.  ENISA adopted an anti-fraud strategy and action  plan in 2014. It achieved significant results in terms  of awareness raising by preparing and delivering  internal training on fraud prevention to its entire  staff. Training is delivered periodically to ensure  that all staff are regularly informed about fraud  prevention. As from 2018, fraud awareness training  sessions are included in the agency’s yearly training  plan, together with the training on ethics and integrity  that is compulsory for all staff. The anti-fraud strategy  is expected to be updated and adopted in 2020.  In addition to the staff regulations, the agency has  to adhere to the Commission code of conduct for all  staff. The code offers comprehensive information and  advice on a variety of issues, ranging from ethics to  compliance with legal obligations. The objective of the  code is to ensure that all employees share the values  of ENISA as an open, accessible and transparent  organisation. Furthermore, in accordance with the  code of good administrative conduct issued by the  European Ombudsman, ENISA intends to commit  to a 2-week deadline for answering requests from  members of the public.  13 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  Generally performance was very good and in line with  expectations, especially given the fact that the agency  delivered on its annual work programme while  simultaneously managing the transition to the new  legal framework.  In this respect, a proactive approach to preparing for  the new tasks, notably in the area of cybersecurity  certification, proved to be well worth the effort. The  work on certification is now proceeding smoothly,  with clear goals for 2020 and a team that is up  to speed.  Work in other key areas, such as implementation  of the NISD and the eIDAS regulation, continue to  develop well. Indeed, in the implementation of the  NISD, ENISA’s role is clearly growing, in terms of  support for both the NIS CG and the CSIRT Network.  The fact that the agency was not able to commit the  budget associated with the CSA until the act had  come into force was a major challenge as the budget  allocation effectively covered the full year.  Other significant challenges included the  Commission’s 5G action plan and the cybersecurity  exercise that the agency organised in order to  support the European Parliament elections. Both  these tasks required significant changes to planning  and both were done at extremely short notice.  Last but not least, the transition to the new director  was very smooth, allowing all annual activities to  finish on time.  In addition to the  staff regulations,  the agency has  to adhere to the  Commission code  of conduct for all  staff. The code offers  comprehensive  information and advice  on a variety of issues,  ranging from ethics  to compliance with  legal obligations.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 63ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 63  PART II. Management  64  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 65  a. Effectiveness of internal control systems  ENISA set up the internal control framework at the  end of 2019.  ENISA has adopted an internal control framework,  based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission’s framework and  on international best practices, following the  Commission’s revision in 2017. The financial  regulation requires the organisational structure  and the internal control systems used for the  implementation of the budget to be set up in  accordance with these principles (Article 36). ENISA  has assessed the internal control systems during the  reporting year and has concluded that the internal  control principles are implemented correctly for  its purposes and in adequate proportion to the  identified risks.  The current instruments used are the following:    100 % verification of financial transactions (ex ante  controls);    internal electronic workflows, assurance of  segregation of duties and several layers of review  and checks;    a register of exceptions;    ex post control report and follow-up measures;    independent audit from the ECA;    independent audit from the IAS (performed by the  European Commission).  These instruments provide adequate and sufficient  assurance as to the completeness and reliability of  the information reported.  ENISA adopted the revised internal control framework  at the end of 2019. The revised framework follows  that of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission as adopted by the  European Commission, and consists of five internal  control components and 17 internal control  principles.  The effective internal control system of processes and  procedures ensures the appropriate management of  the risks in relation to the legality and regularity of the  underlying transactions, and the nature of payments.  The internal control system designed provides  reasonable assurance of achieving effectiveness,  efficiency and economy of operations, reliability of  reporting, safeguarding of assets and information,  and prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of  fraud and irregularities.  The established internal control system is based  on segregation of duties, the risk management and  control strategy, avoidance of conflicts of interest,  appropriate audit trails and data integrity in data  systems, and established procedures for monitoring  PART III ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  66  performance and for follow-up of identified internal  control weaknesses and threats.  Financial management and control is rooted in  such core processes as procurement (from the  assessment of needs to the selection of suppliers  to the award decision), financial operations (all  processes establishing the financial commitment to  payment, contract monitoring and recoveries with ad  hoc procedures in place are 100 % verified through ex  ante verification) and supervisory measures (including  ex post controls and audits), which form the basis for  achieving sound financial management.  Legality and regularity is audited independently by  the ECA.  b. Conclusions of assessment of internal  control systems  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that the objective to constantly enhance  the assurance of reliability of performance, legality  and regularity based on the legal and financial  framework was realised and working as intended in  2019. Internal risks were identified and appropriately  monitored, and mitigation measures were  implemented.  c. Statement of the internal control coordinator in  charge of risk management and internal control  I, the undersigned,  manager in charge of risk management and internal  control within the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA),  in my capacity as manager in charge of risk  management and internal control, declare that, in  accordance with ENISA’s internal control framework,  I have reported my advice and recommendations on  the overall state of internal control in the agency to  the executive director.  I hereby certify that the information provided in the  present consolidated annual activity report and in its  annexes is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate,  reliable and complete.

Review of the elements supporting assurance  The declaration of assurance, provided by the  authorising officer, is mainly based on the following  three pillars:  1.  regular monitoring of the KPIs set for operational,  administrative and financial tasks through the  formal periodical management reporting;  2.  effectiveness of the internal controls and  processes to detect weaknesses and to identify  areas for improvement;  3.  assessment and reports from independent bodies  (external evaluators, financial auditors (ECA,  complemented by a private audit firm), internal  auditors (IAS), etc.).  As highlighted in the previous sections, by the  operational, administrative and financial KPIs, and  by the positive opinion of the ECA on the reliability of  the accounts and on the legality and regularity of the  transaction, and as no critical observations have been  formulated by the IAS, management has sufficient  assurance that ENISA is adequately managed so as to  safeguard its financial resources and to pursue the  tasks with which it has been entrusted.  b. Overall conclusion on assurance  Considering the results of the 2019 annual audits  performed by the ECA and the IAS, the 2019 results  of the internal controls (ex post controls and review  of the register of exceptions) and the 2019 results  of the key financial and operational indicators,  the authorising officer can conclude that ENISA  operated in 2019 in such a way as to appropriately  manage the risks.  In addition, the authorising officer has reasonable  assurance that the allocated resources were used for  their intended purpose, in compliance with the legal  framework and in accordance with the principle of  sound financial management.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  70  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2019 71  I, the undersigned,  Juhan LEPASSAAR,  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair (44) view of the state of the agency’s  affairs, and state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in  this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial  management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality  and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year  of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the agency.  Athens, 30 June 2019  [signed]  Juhan LEPASSAAR  Executive Director  44  True and fair in this context means reliable, complete and accurate.

Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT products, services  and processes with cybersecurity certifi cation schemes, cooperates with Member States  and EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through  knowledge sharing, capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with  its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to boost resilience of the  Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

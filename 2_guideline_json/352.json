BIBLIOGRAPHY 18  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  4  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Power systems utilize precise timing measurements to monitor grid operation, power balancing  and the state of underlying stations during transmission as well as distribution of energy. In  modern smart grids, power data acquisition and synchronization need to share time sources to  enable decentralized analysis and effective coordination of power production.  Cyber-attacks against time services might have a big impact on power grids and the current  publication demonstrates such a scenario. The scenario mostly focuses on modern phasor  measurement technologies, since automation trends dictate that these types of devices are  considered more appropriate to support the power grid of the future. The presented scenario  also takes into account some major legacy input vectors although this publication does not  delve into extended details concerning legacy systems. The goal of this scenario is to highlight  the importance of quality timing in power distribution, identify risks and present guidelines for  consistent time synchronisation.  To do so, this publication is providing an introduction to the technologies used for getting  measurements and it continues with the description of a typical architecture which supports the  measurement service. Then it describes the threats as well as the attacks against the CIA  (confidentiality, integrity, availability) of the service and it provides a set of mitigation measures.  Finally, it concludes with some recommendations to technology vendors and energy operators.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  5  1. TIME MEASUREMENT  TECHNOLOGIES  Measurements are necessary for various tasks such as power load analysis, differential  protection, condition monitoring over time as well as identification of unwanted events, such as  physical phenomena or system failures that affect the power grid1,2. Due to the usually large  geographical area being covered by multiple substations, different measurements need to be  synchronised to common time references to facilitate the analysis of data. As a result, the  automated processing of substation data is becoming a mission-critical task. Electric power  utilities must synchronize across large-scale distributed power grids to enable grid and  production balance.  Substation devices can utilize various technologies to create time-sensitive measurements, from  legacy Medium-Wave (AM) radio time sources that send timing data using AM frequencies to  NTP/PTP servers and modern phasor measurement units (PMUs) able to create phase-angle  measurements in real-time. A NTP server uses various time sources and the Network Time  Protocol (NTP) to circulate accurate time information to sub-devices for clock synchronization.  PMUs are commonly used, amongst other technologies, to time-stamp measurements  against a time source such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), load balancing, and  operator decision support and power distribution. Other (legacy) implementations of underlying  networks may also utilise the Network Time Protocol (NTP) with relevant servers to  communicate data between stations and distribution centres.  PMU measurements are becoming increasingly valuable, since they provide real-time  information and enable enhanced monitoring and decision support for automating processes by  providing feedback of high accuracy; most often by sampling power-time measurements more  than 30 times per second. A cyberattack on these systems can potentially lead to  synchronization failures and monitoring errors between the Transmission/ Distribution operator  and the power stations.  1 Time Synchronization in the Electric Power System, Report, NASPI Time Synchronization Task Force, The North  American Synchrophasor Initiative, March 2017.  2 Konstantinou, Charalambos, et al. \"GPS spoofing effect on phase angle monitoring and control in a real-time digital  simulator-based hardware-in-the-loop environment.\" IET Cyber-Physical Systems: Theory & Applications 2.4 (2017): 180- 187. POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY: TIME SYNCHRONISATION ATTACKS  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  6  2. POWER SECTOR  DEPENDENCY: SCENARIO  DESCRIPTION  2.1. ARCHITECTURE  Figure 1 presents the functional architecture upon which the attack scenario is based. Still, it  should be noted that potential risks depend on the type of systems and their implementations at  each substation. Dependencies of the power sector on telecommunications differ based on  technologies used (e.g. Phasor Measurement Units or NTP/PTP servers), actors involved  (manufacturers, government sectors etc.) as well as the actual setup of devices and systems.  Figure 1: Functional architecture of time-phase data processing on the power grid  Communication between a power station and the control centre can either be one-way or two-  way. Concerning substations, slave equipment can either be PMUs or legacy controllers and/ or  similar remote terminal units (RTUs). One-way communications usually involve receiving data  from a SCADA system while two-way communications involve both receiving data from a  SCADA system and sending back commands through different channels. Industrial controllers  (also known as industrial automation controllers, IACs) are often used as middleware between  the substation and the control centre, acting as a filter for unifying device protocols and relayed  commands. This means that potential attackers must also compromise the (often proprietary)  software and systems of the IAC before being able to manipulate any PMUs at the substation.  PMU applications involve the visualisation of wide-area power systems and modelling, modal  analysis of power balancing and production, post-event analysis that may trigger relay trip-close  functionality, synch checks for substations and flow analysis. One of the most prevalent and  often used application involves the detection of oscillations before major system failures3.  It is noteworthy that potential cyber attacks that exploit the dependency of the power sector on  telecommunications are different to engineering challenges. Attacks are triggered by malicious  intent and may exploit engineering issues, but they always focus on instances and  3 Novosel, Damir, Miroslav M. Begovic, and Vahid Madani. \"Shedding light on blackouts.\" IEEE Power and Energy  Magazine 2.1 (2004): 32-43.  MIND THE  SETUP  Different threats  affect different  implementations.  Potential attacks  differ based on  technologies used  (e.g. Phasor  Measurement Units  or NTP/PTP servers),  actors involved  (manufacturers,  government sectors  etc.) as well as due to  the actual setup of  devices and systems.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  7  implementations of systems and technologies. Engineering challenges are shortcomings and  current functional limitations in modern technologies and should be approached with a more  macroscopic point of view.  2.2. RISK OF POTENTIAL ATTACKS AGAINST TIME SYNCHRONISATION  The threat list (see section 2.2.2) takes into account multiple input vectors and different  technologies based on the functional diagram depicted in Figure 1. We consider both legacy  technologies along with systems and services that will be widely used in the near future for  power grid automation. In general, attacks can occur in various stages of obtaining  measurements. Attackers will search to exploit the weakest input vector, which can occur both  at the communications network as well as in systems and devices used within the power  stations. A key issue with attacks on the power grid relates to stability and provision of power to  consumers and to the industry. Both unintentional as well as malicious threats can have an  impact on both the integrity and availability of measurements, thus affecting the overall stability  of the system in cases where high automation relies on power measurements for decision  support and control.  Today, energy operators are more dependent on telecommunication services than they were in  the past due to the development of the smart grids. For example, power stations are spread  over large geographical areas and devices usually only communicate one-way to send  measurement data to control centres. Consequently, decisions and data analysis are performed  in centralised systems that may be unaware of the state of GPS receivers, NTP servers and  relays in remote stations. Moreover, different stations utilize different technologies. With the  advent of phasor measurement units (PMUs), power systems are automating processes and  some decisions are now being made on-the-fly without human interruption. As automation  spreads to all distribution and transmission systems, the impact from integrity errors and attacks  on measurement data will increase proportionally. These features increase the risk of the  dependency and at the same time shape potential attack routes and vectors.  Specifically, for PMUs, it is expected that a large part of the power industry will increase their  use in the coming years, in an effort to cope with the needs for automating monitoring  processes in the distribution and transmission layers, to better control load balancing and  service provisions to customers.  2.2.1. Assumptions  The following assumptions are valid for the scenario:   scenario considers a modern power (smart) grid with PMUs and industrial controllers;   the grid supports information for automated decision-making concerning power  distribution in large urban areas; and   none to minimum security measures are in place, so as to properly reflect the worst-  case scenario of adverse effects.  The presented scenario focuses on attacks at the distribution and transmission layers. Attacks  on the consumer end (e.g. smart meters) are considered out of scope.  2.2.2. Threats and attack vectors  Different input vectors exist and different threats may manifest, depending on:  (i) the technology and devices used in the substations;  (ii) intermediate systems and actors; and  (iii) the overall grid structure. Typical implementations utilize a master-slave  architecture. Even simpler implementations still use simple internal clocks on  substation slaves over radio signals.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  8  The following are some examples of these threats:  (i) If the architecture utilizes PMUs, then the GPS receiver can act as an input vector for  spoofing the GPS signal and attacking the integrity of the phase measurement data.  This can result in erroneous clock offsets within the PMU, which in turn will introduce  an error in the PMU's phase measurement4. Depending on the utilization of PMU data  and the level of automation on the power grid, these errors can affect control points  and even provide a means towards grid destabilization.  (ii) GPS jamming can also be used to attack the availability of data measurements. Some  PMUs will revert to local oscillators to determine time and compute phasor  measurements. Over time, potential drifting of measurements or incorrect time-stamps  may introduce errors in phase angle calculations that will probably increase over time5.  Moreover, GPS jamming (blocking the reception of GPS L1 1575.42MHz signals) and  GPS spoofing, continue to cause serious threats to the precision and accuracy of the  timing deriving by GPS. Apart from the potential drifting of measurements and/ or  incorrect timing, the jam-to-spoof of the GPS input could potentially trigger real-time  process control equipment, like circuit breakers and relays, to shutdown substations  and create a blackout.  (iii) Implementations that utilize an NTP/PTP server for producing measurements at the  substation are potentially vulnerable to integrity attacks on the supplied data, either at  the network level, the application level or both.  (iv) Remotely and directly spoofing and affecting the circuit breaker could potentially  disturb the sequence of the timestamps. As a result, the relevant platform for  monitoring and analyzing such events will indicate the disturbance. Any attempt to  restore and repair such an event, could potentially introduce errors into the systems.  Following the previous analysis and based on the architecture presented in Figure 1, the  following list of attack vectors are feasible. All attack vectors presented are based on selected  technologies, taking into account both legacy and modern smart grid devices.

Attack scenarios on modern over-the-air communication  mediums mostly involve attacks against availability, with the most prominent ones  being jamming through malicious node interference and rogue base stations, as well  as man-in-the-middle integrity and confidentiality attacks. Confidentiality attacks on  legacy systems are also possible through eavesdropping with voltage detectors over  cable, although these attacks are known to generate too much noise on the tampered  line.  b) Attack vectors also exist on the numerous protocols that can be used for transmitting  data. Industrial protocols (such as DNP3, MODBUS etc.) can be implemented in  various ways. Some implementations utilize connections over TCP or UDP. These  implementations are subject to threats common in IT networks in general, e.g. IP  spoofing, TCP session hijacking, Man-In-The-Middle, and RST/ FIN attacks.  Concerning industrial protocols themselves, some availability attacks exist, namely  network Denial of Service (DoS) and/ or jamming of measurement packets by deletion  of packets. Integrity attacks focus mostly on packet insertion or packet replay attacks  to introduce offsets and data mismatch in magnitude of seconds. Confidentiality  attacks on protocols include eavesdropping of commands and measurements over  protocol implementations. In some cases, eavesdropping can also be executed over  encrypted MODBUS traffic7.  c) Some attack vectors are related to the devices used in substations. Attacking the  integrity of GPS signals can affect PMU measurements and cause an increasing phase  angle difference, able to divert decision controls and trigger load shedding or otherwise  affect system executions8. Such attacks are considered sophisticated, since they  require Software Defined Radio (SDR) and radio frequency (RF) devices, on-site close  proximity to the PMUs and partial knowledge of device functionality. Attacking solely  the availability of time-sensitive measurements is an easier task in comparison; e.g.  jamming. GPS unavailability will potentially trigger fall-back to other sources  (oscillators). Devices can then also synchronize to spoofed time signals and insert an  incorrect stream of time-stamps. Other device attacks at the substation include wire  cuts between the GPS receiver and the PMU and/ or manipulation of control loop  packets at the slave. This can result in incorrect estimation measurements and  potential drifting of measurements over time. Delaying the slave clock can cause an  offset of μs, which escalates in the order of mrad in the synchrophasor estimation.  PMUs at the substation can convert GPS signals into various protocols (such as NTP or PTP)  for further use within the substation or even use other sources for NTP time measurements.  Similar attacks on packet crafting affect all NTP protocol/ server implementations. Replay  attacks on network time packets can affect measurement data integrity. The master server will  seem to announce the wrong time and will affect both sync and response packets. NTP has  been used to manipulate logs and change the time on computer systems, thus altering the  sequence of events. When clocks are not synchronized, distributors have a much harder time  7 Tsalis, N., Stergiopoulos, G., Bitsikas, E., Gritzalis, D., & Apostolopoulos, T. K.. Side Channel Attacks over Encrypted  TCP/IP Modbus Reveal Functionality Leaks.

POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  11  performing data correlation across disparate systems for automation of processes. Using NTP  or PTP protocols and servers can result in constant measurement biases if multiple,  independent sources are not used. Optimally, the IEEE C37.118 requirement of 1μs accuracy  can be met through GPS signals9. Backdoor access on vendor devices and integrity attack  through software are also considered a possible attack vector, where the attacker can take  control of measurements and affect decision making at the distribution layer.  2.2.3. Impact analysis  Impact of potential attacks varies according to the attack vector, system specifications and the  type of services that is being affected. Modern implementations that utilize PMUs to automate  load balancing and monitor for system failures for decision support, exhibit higher impact than  traditional and legacy systems due to the increased level of automation. The most important  technical errors that can be introduced through the aforementioned attacks can be summarised  as follows:   Inaccurate monitoring and control functions of PMU-based load and grid stability;   Erroneous or overly delayed timing data in NTP-based stations can be discarded from  the operator and, if the number of dropped packets increases, power grid balancing  may be less effective and trustworthy;   Overflow of timing data can result in buffer overloads from too many time-stamps for  the same instant for the same channel and PMU. This can lead to system  unavailability;   Incoherent timing data about time and grid condition will produce incorrect results and  leap second events; and   Man-in-the-middle or spoofing attacks lead to erroneous estimations and incorrect  phase angle computations, which in turn can cause an unnecessary generator trip.  Potential failures can cause varying levels of impact. Effects can vary based on system  specifications and devices used and can range from simple miscalculations on substation power  data that can be mitigated through error checks, to area blackouts. In automated grids that  utilize PMUs, the introduction of false measurements (either by accident or on purpose) can  possibly trigger control actions and even cause grid instability10.  All the attack scenarios of this dependency were circulated to subject matter experts from the  public and private sector, including telecommunications and energy experts and other  stakeholders. The following table depicts the likelihood and impact for each scenario based on  the average of the given answers of the relevant stakeholders.

SECURITY GOOD PRACTICES  Transmission as well as distribution operators need to implement specific security measures in  order to protect systems in a power grid, especially when automation is widely used (e.g. in  smart grids). Good practices and relevant security measures are broken down into separate  groups, allowing a more focused approach on different technologies and devices.  Most widely known measures relevant to network security also apply to IT networks in power  grids. Also, we should note that, apart from the scenario specific measures, common  organisational security measures such as security governance models, security policies and  procedures, standards and certifications, training and awareness-raising, risk management,  audits and assessments and contractual clauses, also apply to the power sector.  Technical measures specific to technologies presented in the aforementioned scenarios  include, among others, device and configuration management, network monitoring, patching  and updating, network segmentation and authentication, and network security (certificates,  protocol configuration etc.).  The NTP protocol measures synchronisation distance from primary time sources using Stratum  levels. Stratum 0 devices (like GPS clocks) are usually used as a reference clock (or  synchronisation source) for a Stratum time server11. Some best practices concerning NTP  servers and their underlying protocol are listed below8,12.  11 Mills D., et al, RFC 5905: Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification, Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF), ISSN:2070-1721 (2010)  12 Snoke T., Best Practices for NTP Services, Carnegie Mellon University, Software Engineering Institute,  https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/04/best-practices-for-ntp-services.html  https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/04/best-practices-for-ntp-services.html  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  13  Table 7: Technical good practices based on scenario technologies  Technical good practices  Category Good Practice  Phasor  Measurement  Units (PMU)   Establish an Electronic Security Perimeter   Minimize number of electronic access points   Utilize network segregation for PMUs and substation LAN   Firewalls with white list (deny by default)   PDC provides a security layer  o Users access PDC not PMUs  o Security upgrades occur at PDC rather than a PMUs   Take into account IEEE C37.118.1-2011 - IEEE Standard for Synchrophasor  Measurements for Power Systems   Implement IPSEC on substation gateway device   Anti-spoofing and anti-jamming for PMU at the hardware level.

For instance, it is recommended to  separate PMU and IAC devices from other IT  systems in substation equipment.  In general, it needs to be evaluated if the  benefits of connecting a specific device to the  network outweigh the risks.  Use of multiple time sources Using multiple source for time information lowers  the risk of unavailability (and sometimes  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  14  Generic good practices  Category Good Practice  integrity) attacks. Various sources include:  Internal, local clocks, GNSS/ GPS, NTP servers,  Optical Transport Networks (OTN) over telecom  networks, etc.  Check that the alternative time sources work  Checks should be conducted on regular  intervals to verify that all used time sources are  up and running. Additionally, utilize more than  one time signal sources so as to increase the  accuracy and availability, e.g. GPS and NTP or  GPS and DCF77/ radio.  Antivirus and antimalware software  IT systems should run antimalware and anti- spam software to detect and remove or  quarantine malicious software.  Device configuration and management  Utilize ICS-based asset inventories to ensure a  sound understanding of the grid’s systems and  their components. Such inventories also allow  changing configurations and creating and  evaluating logs of system events.  Apply patching and updating procedures  Regular patching and updating of software and  devices are essential to avoid the exploitation of  known vulnerabilities as well as to ensure the  detection of attacks using know paths.  Encrypt data  It needs to be evaluated if the use of encryption  is necessary to protect critical processes and  decision making, especially at the distribution  layer. If so, cryptography must be used following  international standards.

Assurance through product  integration and installation can also aid in securing timing functionalities, through proper use  and configuration of devices and oscillators13.  13 Kevin M.

Such attacks can result to monetary loss, grid imbalance and even power outages. They can also produce “false interpretations of grid conditions  and inappropriate control actions”4. Unrecorded oscillations can lead to equipment failure and contribute to large-scale blackout.  14 https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/time-synchronization-substation-automation  https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/time-synchronization-substation-automation  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  16  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS  Good  practices   Resilience: Timing sources and technology must ensure high availability in the event of loss of time synchronisation from one or more  substations.   Security: Ensure the integrity of input sources and synchronisation data.   Accuracy: Need for identification of data corruption, both at GPS and network levels.   Use of alternate timing sources.   Adhere to relevant standards (e.g. IEEE C37.118.1-2011)  Challenges and gaps   Challenge 1 – Lack of built-in anti-jamming components   Challenge 2 – Need to defend against rogue base stations and spoofing attacks   Challenge 3 – Lack of network security measures for protecting data transmission   Challenge 4 – Low pace of standardisation   Challenge 5 – Lack of high resilience and automated detection of errors:  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  17  3. CHALLENGES AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  Identifying good practices per technology used leads to the identification of open security issues  in the synchronisation of the aforementioned systems. Enhancing security in the near future  equals mitigating the risks introduced by modern technologies, automation and the geographical  disparity between power substations. The most important challenges for modern power stations  as well as the future work can be summarised as follows:  Challenge 1: Lack of built-in anti-jamming components  Recommendation: Vendors should design modern devices for substation automation (including  GPS receivers) with security in mind. Built-in anti-jamming components such as lockouts for  extended periods of time, dynamic reconfiguration etc. are necessary to mitigate risks from  close-proximity jamming attacks.  Challenge 2: Need to defend against rogue base stations and spoofing attacks  Recommendation: Operators should establish electronic perimeters and implementing  measures against spoofing attacks, such as signal processing techniques are necessary to  protect substation synchronisation. Vendors and operators should utilize technologies to detect  and correct measurement data against spoofing attacks; primarily for GPS timestamps. They  should also apply mandatory security patches for lifetime on sensors/ devices.  Challenge 3: Lack of network security measures for protecting data transmission  Recommendation: Operators should always implement basic measures for substations in  order to protecting underlying networks and protocols, such as network segregation, filtering  and access rules. Firewalls and industrial controllers acting as intermediate filters should be in  place in all substations. Grid automation also needs to incorporate control checks on functional.  Challenge 4: Low pace of standardisation  Recommendation: Current certifications and standards are not up to speed with the rate of  adoption of automation in modern smart grids. Vendors should design modern devices used for  automation in a way that meets universally accepted requirements and implements selected  security measures through proper standardisation procedures. This will aid in creating a  normalised security level across power grids in the entire EU while supporting new  technologies.  Challenge 5: Lack of high resilience and automated detection of errors  Recommendation: Transmission and distribution layers are beginning to automate load  balancing and monitoring of power grids through real-time PMU measurements. This  automation needs adequate monitoring processes. Operators must adopt tools and procedures  that will enhance power grid’s resilience against malformed and/ or injected data that can affect  decision making in modern smart grids. Data validation should be implemented in mission-  critical processes.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  18  4.

BIBLIOGRAPHY 18  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  4  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Power systems utilize precise timing measurements to monitor grid operation, power balancing  and the state of underlying stations during transmission as well as distribution of energy. In  modern smart grids, power data acquisition and synchronization need to share time sources to  enable decentralized analysis and effective coordination of power production.  Cyber-attacks against time services might have a big impact on power grids and the current  publication demonstrates such a scenario. The scenario mostly focuses on modern phasor  measurement technologies, since automation trends dictate that these types of devices are  considered more appropriate to support the power grid of the future. The presented scenario  also takes into account some major legacy input vectors although this publication does not  delve into extended details concerning legacy systems. The goal of this scenario is to highlight  the importance of quality timing in power distribution, identify risks and present guidelines for  consistent time synchronisation.  To do so, this publication is providing an introduction to the technologies used for getting  measurements and it continues with the description of a typical architecture which supports the  measurement service. Then it describes the threats as well as the attacks against the CIA  (confidentiality, integrity, availability) of the service and it provides a set of mitigation measures.  Finally, it concludes with some recommendations to technology vendors and energy operators.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  5  1. TIME MEASUREMENT  TECHNOLOGIES  Measurements are necessary for various tasks such as power load analysis, differential  protection, condition monitoring over time as well as identification of unwanted events, such as  physical phenomena or system failures that affect the power grid1,2. Due to the usually large  geographical area being covered by multiple substations, different measurements need to be  synchronised to common time references to facilitate the analysis of data. As a result, the  automated processing of substation data is becoming a mission-critical task. Electric power  utilities must synchronize across large-scale distributed power grids to enable grid and  production balance.  Substation devices can utilize various technologies to create time-sensitive measurements, from  legacy Medium-Wave (AM) radio time sources that send timing data using AM frequencies to  NTP/PTP servers and modern phasor measurement units (PMUs) able to create phase-angle  measurements in real-time. A NTP server uses various time sources and the Network Time  Protocol (NTP) to circulate accurate time information to sub-devices for clock synchronization.  PMUs are commonly used, amongst other technologies, to time-stamp measurements  against a time source such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), load balancing, and  operator decision support and power distribution. Other (legacy) implementations of underlying  networks may also utilise the Network Time Protocol (NTP) with relevant servers to  communicate data between stations and distribution centres.  PMU measurements are becoming increasingly valuable, since they provide real-time  information and enable enhanced monitoring and decision support for automating processes by  providing feedback of high accuracy; most often by sampling power-time measurements more  than 30 times per second. A cyberattack on these systems can potentially lead to  synchronization failures and monitoring errors between the Transmission/ Distribution operator  and the power stations.  1 Time Synchronization in the Electric Power System, Report, NASPI Time Synchronization Task Force, The North  American Synchrophasor Initiative, March 2017.  2 Konstantinou, Charalambos, et al. \"GPS spoofing effect on phase angle monitoring and control in a real-time digital  simulator-based hardware-in-the-loop environment.\" IET Cyber-Physical Systems: Theory & Applications 2.4 (2017): 180- 187. POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY: TIME SYNCHRONISATION ATTACKS  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  6  2. POWER SECTOR  DEPENDENCY: SCENARIO  DESCRIPTION  2.1. ARCHITECTURE  Figure 1 presents the functional architecture upon which the attack scenario is based. Still, it  should be noted that potential risks depend on the type of systems and their implementations at  each substation. Dependencies of the power sector on telecommunications differ based on  technologies used (e.g. Phasor Measurement Units or NTP/PTP servers), actors involved  (manufacturers, government sectors etc.) as well as the actual setup of devices and systems.  Figure 1: Functional architecture of time-phase data processing on the power grid  Communication between a power station and the control centre can either be one-way or two-  way. Concerning substations, slave equipment can either be PMUs or legacy controllers and/ or  similar remote terminal units (RTUs). One-way communications usually involve receiving data  from a SCADA system while two-way communications involve both receiving data from a  SCADA system and sending back commands through different channels. Industrial controllers  (also known as industrial automation controllers, IACs) are often used as middleware between  the substation and the control centre, acting as a filter for unifying device protocols and relayed  commands. This means that potential attackers must also compromise the (often proprietary)  software and systems of the IAC before being able to manipulate any PMUs at the substation.  PMU applications involve the visualisation of wide-area power systems and modelling, modal  analysis of power balancing and production, post-event analysis that may trigger relay trip-close  functionality, synch checks for substations and flow analysis. One of the most prevalent and  often used application involves the detection of oscillations before major system failures3.  It is noteworthy that potential cyber attacks that exploit the dependency of the power sector on  telecommunications are different to engineering challenges. Attacks are triggered by malicious  intent and may exploit engineering issues, but they always focus on instances and  3 Novosel, Damir, Miroslav M. Begovic, and Vahid Madani. \"Shedding light on blackouts.\" IEEE Power and Energy  Magazine 2.1 (2004): 32-43.  MIND THE  SETUP  Different threats  affect different  implementations.  Potential attacks  differ based on  technologies used  (e.g. Phasor  Measurement Units  or NTP/PTP servers),  actors involved  (manufacturers,  government sectors  etc.) as well as due to  the actual setup of  devices and systems.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  7  implementations of systems and technologies. Engineering challenges are shortcomings and  current functional limitations in modern technologies and should be approached with a more  macroscopic point of view.  2.2. RISK OF POTENTIAL ATTACKS AGAINST TIME SYNCHRONISATION  The threat list (see section 2.2.2) takes into account multiple input vectors and different  technologies based on the functional diagram depicted in Figure 1. We consider both legacy  technologies along with systems and services that will be widely used in the near future for  power grid automation. In general, attacks can occur in various stages of obtaining  measurements. Attackers will search to exploit the weakest input vector, which can occur both  at the communications network as well as in systems and devices used within the power  stations. A key issue with attacks on the power grid relates to stability and provision of power to  consumers and to the industry. Both unintentional as well as malicious threats can have an  impact on both the integrity and availability of measurements, thus affecting the overall stability  of the system in cases where high automation relies on power measurements for decision  support and control.  Today, energy operators are more dependent on telecommunication services than they were in  the past due to the development of the smart grids. For example, power stations are spread  over large geographical areas and devices usually only communicate one-way to send  measurement data to control centres. Consequently, decisions and data analysis are performed  in centralised systems that may be unaware of the state of GPS receivers, NTP servers and  relays in remote stations. Moreover, different stations utilize different technologies. With the  advent of phasor measurement units (PMUs), power systems are automating processes and  some decisions are now being made on-the-fly without human interruption. As automation  spreads to all distribution and transmission systems, the impact from integrity errors and attacks  on measurement data will increase proportionally. These features increase the risk of the  dependency and at the same time shape potential attack routes and vectors.  Specifically, for PMUs, it is expected that a large part of the power industry will increase their  use in the coming years, in an effort to cope with the needs for automating monitoring  processes in the distribution and transmission layers, to better control load balancing and  service provisions to customers.  2.2.1. Assumptions  The following assumptions are valid for the scenario:   scenario considers a modern power (smart) grid with PMUs and industrial controllers;   the grid supports information for automated decision-making concerning power  distribution in large urban areas; and   none to minimum security measures are in place, so as to properly reflect the worst-  case scenario of adverse effects.  The presented scenario focuses on attacks at the distribution and transmission layers. Attacks  on the consumer end (e.g. smart meters) are considered out of scope.  2.2.2. Threats and attack vectors  Different input vectors exist and different threats may manifest, depending on:  (i) the technology and devices used in the substations;  (ii) intermediate systems and actors; and  (iii) the overall grid structure. Typical implementations utilize a master-slave  architecture. Even simpler implementations still use simple internal clocks on  substation slaves over radio signals.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  8  The following are some examples of these threats:  (i) If the architecture utilizes PMUs, then the GPS receiver can act as an input vector for  spoofing the GPS signal and attacking the integrity of the phase measurement data.  This can result in erroneous clock offsets within the PMU, which in turn will introduce  an error in the PMU's phase measurement4. Depending on the utilization of PMU data  and the level of automation on the power grid, these errors can affect control points  and even provide a means towards grid destabilization.  (ii) GPS jamming can also be used to attack the availability of data measurements. Some  PMUs will revert to local oscillators to determine time and compute phasor  measurements. Over time, potential drifting of measurements or incorrect time-stamps  may introduce errors in phase angle calculations that will probably increase over time5.  Moreover, GPS jamming (blocking the reception of GPS L1 1575.42MHz signals) and  GPS spoofing, continue to cause serious threats to the precision and accuracy of the  timing deriving by GPS. Apart from the potential drifting of measurements and/ or  incorrect timing, the jam-to-spoof of the GPS input could potentially trigger real-time  process control equipment, like circuit breakers and relays, to shutdown substations  and create a blackout.  (iii) Implementations that utilize an NTP/PTP server for producing measurements at the  substation are potentially vulnerable to integrity attacks on the supplied data, either at  the network level, the application level or both.  (iv) Remotely and directly spoofing and affecting the circuit breaker could potentially  disturb the sequence of the timestamps. As a result, the relevant platform for  monitoring and analyzing such events will indicate the disturbance. Any attempt to  restore and repair such an event, could potentially introduce errors into the systems.  Following the previous analysis and based on the architecture presented in Figure 1, the  following list of attack vectors are feasible. All attack vectors presented are based on selected  technologies, taking into account both legacy and modern smart grid devices.

Attack scenarios on modern over-the-air communication  mediums mostly involve attacks against availability, with the most prominent ones  being jamming through malicious node interference and rogue base stations, as well  as man-in-the-middle integrity and confidentiality attacks. Confidentiality attacks on  legacy systems are also possible through eavesdropping with voltage detectors over  cable, although these attacks are known to generate too much noise on the tampered  line.  b) Attack vectors also exist on the numerous protocols that can be used for transmitting  data. Industrial protocols (such as DNP3, MODBUS etc.) can be implemented in  various ways. Some implementations utilize connections over TCP or UDP. These  implementations are subject to threats common in IT networks in general, e.g. IP  spoofing, TCP session hijacking, Man-In-The-Middle, and RST/ FIN attacks.  Concerning industrial protocols themselves, some availability attacks exist, namely  network Denial of Service (DoS) and/ or jamming of measurement packets by deletion  of packets. Integrity attacks focus mostly on packet insertion or packet replay attacks  to introduce offsets and data mismatch in magnitude of seconds. Confidentiality  attacks on protocols include eavesdropping of commands and measurements over  protocol implementations. In some cases, eavesdropping can also be executed over  encrypted MODBUS traffic7.  c) Some attack vectors are related to the devices used in substations. Attacking the  integrity of GPS signals can affect PMU measurements and cause an increasing phase  angle difference, able to divert decision controls and trigger load shedding or otherwise  affect system executions8. Such attacks are considered sophisticated, since they  require Software Defined Radio (SDR) and radio frequency (RF) devices, on-site close  proximity to the PMUs and partial knowledge of device functionality. Attacking solely  the availability of time-sensitive measurements is an easier task in comparison; e.g.  jamming. GPS unavailability will potentially trigger fall-back to other sources  (oscillators). Devices can then also synchronize to spoofed time signals and insert an  incorrect stream of time-stamps. Other device attacks at the substation include wire  cuts between the GPS receiver and the PMU and/ or manipulation of control loop  packets at the slave. This can result in incorrect estimation measurements and  potential drifting of measurements over time. Delaying the slave clock can cause an  offset of μs, which escalates in the order of mrad in the synchrophasor estimation.  PMUs at the substation can convert GPS signals into various protocols (such as NTP or PTP)  for further use within the substation or even use other sources for NTP time measurements.  Similar attacks on packet crafting affect all NTP protocol/ server implementations. Replay  attacks on network time packets can affect measurement data integrity. The master server will  seem to announce the wrong time and will affect both sync and response packets. NTP has  been used to manipulate logs and change the time on computer systems, thus altering the  sequence of events. When clocks are not synchronized, distributors have a much harder time  7 Tsalis, N., Stergiopoulos, G., Bitsikas, E., Gritzalis, D., & Apostolopoulos, T. K..

POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  11  performing data correlation across disparate systems for automation of processes. Using NTP  or PTP protocols and servers can result in constant measurement biases if multiple,  independent sources are not used. Optimally, the IEEE C37.118 requirement of 1μs accuracy  can be met through GPS signals9. Backdoor access on vendor devices and integrity attack  through software are also considered a possible attack vector, where the attacker can take  control of measurements and affect decision making at the distribution layer.  2.2.3. Impact analysis  Impact of potential attacks varies according to the attack vector, system specifications and the  type of services that is being affected. Modern implementations that utilize PMUs to automate  load balancing and monitor for system failures for decision support, exhibit higher impact than  traditional and legacy systems due to the increased level of automation. The most important  technical errors that can be introduced through the aforementioned attacks can be summarised  as follows:   Inaccurate monitoring and control functions of PMU-based load and grid stability;   Erroneous or overly delayed timing data in NTP-based stations can be discarded from  the operator and, if the number of dropped packets increases, power grid balancing  may be less effective and trustworthy;   Overflow of timing data can result in buffer overloads from too many time-stamps for  the same instant for the same channel and PMU. This can lead to system  unavailability;   Incoherent timing data about time and grid condition will produce incorrect results and  leap second events; and   Man-in-the-middle or spoofing attacks lead to erroneous estimations and incorrect  phase angle computations, which in turn can cause an unnecessary generator trip.  Potential failures can cause varying levels of impact. Effects can vary based on system  specifications and devices used and can range from simple miscalculations on substation power  data that can be mitigated through error checks, to area blackouts. In automated grids that  utilize PMUs, the introduction of false measurements (either by accident or on purpose) can  possibly trigger control actions and even cause grid instability10.  All the attack scenarios of this dependency were circulated to subject matter experts from the  public and private sector, including telecommunications and energy experts and other  stakeholders. The following table depicts the likelihood and impact for each scenario based on  the average of the given answers of the relevant stakeholders.

SECURITY GOOD PRACTICES  Transmission as well as distribution operators need to implement specific security measures in  order to protect systems in a power grid, especially when automation is widely used (e.g. in  smart grids). Good practices and relevant security measures are broken down into separate  groups, allowing a more focused approach on different technologies and devices.  Most widely known measures relevant to network security also apply to IT networks in power  grids. Also, we should note that, apart from the scenario specific measures, common  organisational security measures such as security governance models, security policies and  procedures, standards and certifications, training and awareness-raising, risk management,  audits and assessments and contractual clauses, also apply to the power sector.  Technical measures specific to technologies presented in the aforementioned scenarios  include, among others, device and configuration management, network monitoring, patching  and updating, network segmentation and authentication, and network security (certificates,  protocol configuration etc.).  The NTP protocol measures synchronisation distance from primary time sources using Stratum  levels. Stratum 0 devices (like GPS clocks) are usually used as a reference clock (or  synchronisation source) for a Stratum time server11. Some best practices concerning NTP  servers and their underlying protocol are listed below8,12.  11 Mills D., et al, RFC 5905: Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification, Internet Engineering  Task Force (IETF), ISSN:2070-1721 (2010)  12 Snoke T., Best Practices for NTP Services, Carnegie Mellon University, Software Engineering Institute,  https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/04/best-practices-for-ntp-services.html  https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/04/best-practices-for-ntp-services.html  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  13  Table 7: Technical good practices based on scenario technologies  Technical good practices  Category Good Practice  Phasor  Measurement  Units (PMU)   Establish an Electronic Security Perimeter   Minimize number of electronic access points   Utilize network segregation for PMUs and substation LAN   Firewalls with white list (deny by default)   PDC provides a security layer  o Users access PDC not PMUs  o Security upgrades occur at PDC rather than a PMUs   Take into account IEEE C37.118.1-2011 - IEEE Standard for Synchrophasor  Measurements for Power Systems   Implement IPSEC on substation gateway device   Anti-spoofing and anti-jamming for PMU at the hardware level.

For instance, it is recommended to  separate PMU and IAC devices from other IT  systems in substation equipment.  In general, it needs to be evaluated if the  benefits of connecting a specific device to the  network outweigh the risks.  Use of multiple time sources Using multiple source for time information lowers  the risk of unavailability (and sometimes  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  14  Generic good practices  Category Good Practice  integrity) attacks. Various sources include:  Internal, local clocks, GNSS/ GPS, NTP servers,  Optical Transport Networks (OTN) over telecom  networks, etc.  Check that the alternative time sources work  Checks should be conducted on regular  intervals to verify that all used time sources are  up and running. Additionally, utilize more than  one time signal sources so as to increase the  accuracy and availability, e.g. GPS and NTP or  GPS and DCF77/ radio.  Antivirus and antimalware software  IT systems should run antimalware and anti- spam software to detect and remove or  quarantine malicious software.  Device configuration and management  Utilize ICS-based asset inventories to ensure a  sound understanding of the grid’s systems and  their components. Such inventories also allow  changing configurations and creating and  evaluating logs of system events.  Apply patching and updating procedures  Regular patching and updating of software and  devices are essential to avoid the exploitation of  known vulnerabilities as well as to ensure the  detection of attacks using know paths.  Encrypt data  It needs to be evaluated if the use of encryption  is necessary to protect critical processes and  decision making, especially at the distribution  layer. If so, cryptography must be used following  international standards.  Protect remote connections and systems  Remote connections to substation systems need  to be adequately protected with strong access  control, authentication mechanisms and relevant  network security measures.  Assess the risk  The understanding and management of risk are  key issues for the electric sector organizations.  Therefore, a harmonised risk methodology  across the organizations is recommended.  Information sharing  Ensure the implementation of effective  information sharing models between the sectors.  Prioritization of energy supply  Discussing and prioritising supply of services  (based on network topology). More specifically:   ensure energy supply to critical Telco  location; and   ensure communication services to critical  locations (substation control centre).  GPS timing can be secured using a multi-layered approach. Anti-jamming and anti-spoofing  mechanisms can protect the antenna, while software assurance can provide similar anti-  jamming as well as anti-spoofing measures to device components. Assurance through product  integration and installation can also aid in securing timing functionalities, through proper use  and configuration of devices and oscillators13.  13 Kevin M.

Assets affected  (Telecommunications and  positioning services)  The assets primarily affected by cyber-attacks in our scenario include:   Network Time Protocol, Precision Time Protocol and relevant communication protocols.   Various telemetry equipment and components   Underlying telecommunication lines, e.g. fixed lines, LTE - 4G equipment etc..   GPS embedded location modules.  Assets affected (Energy  sector)  The assets primarily depended on the telecommunications provider assets that are affected include:   PMU, Circuit breakers, Relays;   GNSS, GPS Antenna/ Antenna Diplexer;   Industrial Automation Controllers (IACs)   SCADAs;   Data processing modules and servers  Criticality  Incorrect timing, either introduced by failures or malicious actions can cause numerous issues during data analysis:   Inaccurate monitoring and control functions of PMU-based load and grid stability.   Erroneous or overly delayed timing data in NTP-based stations can be discarded from the operator and, if the number of dropped packets  increases, power grid balancing may be less effective and trustworthy.   Overflow of timing data can result to buffer overloads from too many time-stamps for the same instant for the same channel and PMU.  This can lead to system unavailability.   Incoherent timing data about time and grid condition will produce incorrect results and leap second events.   Man-in-the-middle or spoofing attacks lead to erroneous estimations and incorrect phase angle computations, which in turn can cause  an unnecessary generator trip.  Such attacks can result to monetary loss, grid imbalance and even power outages. They can also produce “false interpretations of grid conditions  and inappropriate control actions”4. Unrecorded oscillations can lead to equipment failure and contribute to large-scale blackout.  14 https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/time-synchronization-substation-automation  https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/time-synchronization-substation-automation  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  16  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS  Good  practices   Resilience: Timing sources and technology must ensure high availability in the event of loss of time synchronisation from one or more  substations.   Security: Ensure the integrity of input sources and synchronisation data.   Accuracy: Need for identification of data corruption, both at GPS and network levels.   Use of alternate timing sources.   Adhere to relevant standards (e.g. IEEE C37.118.1-2011)  Challenges and gaps   Challenge 1 – Lack of built-in anti-jamming components   Challenge 2 – Need to defend against rogue base stations and spoofing attacks   Challenge 3 – Lack of network security measures for protecting data transmission   Challenge 4 – Low pace of standardisation   Challenge 5 – Lack of high resilience and automated detection of errors:  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  17  3. CHALLENGES AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  Identifying good practices per technology used leads to the identification of open security issues  in the synchronisation of the aforementioned systems. Enhancing security in the near future  equals mitigating the risks introduced by modern technologies, automation and the geographical  disparity between power substations. The most important challenges for modern power stations  as well as the future work can be summarised as follows:  Challenge 1: Lack of built-in anti-jamming components  Recommendation: Vendors should design modern devices for substation automation (including  GPS receivers) with security in mind. Built-in anti-jamming components such as lockouts for  extended periods of time, dynamic reconfiguration etc. are necessary to mitigate risks from  close-proximity jamming attacks.  Challenge 2: Need to defend against rogue base stations and spoofing attacks  Recommendation: Operators should establish electronic perimeters and implementing  measures against spoofing attacks, such as signal processing techniques are necessary to  protect substation synchronisation. Vendors and operators should utilize technologies to detect  and correct measurement data against spoofing attacks; primarily for GPS timestamps. They  should also apply mandatory security patches for lifetime on sensors/ devices.  Challenge 3: Lack of network security measures for protecting data transmission  Recommendation: Operators should always implement basic measures for substations in  order to protecting underlying networks and protocols, such as network segregation, filtering  and access rules. Firewalls and industrial controllers acting as intermediate filters should be in  place in all substations. Grid automation also needs to incorporate control checks on functional.  Challenge 4: Low pace of standardisation  Recommendation: Current certifications and standards are not up to speed with the rate of  adoption of automation in modern smart grids. Vendors should design modern devices used for  automation in a way that meets universally accepted requirements and implements selected  security measures through proper standardisation procedures. This will aid in creating a  normalised security level across power grids in the entire EU while supporting new  technologies.  Challenge 5: Lack of high resilience and automated detection of errors  Recommendation: Transmission and distribution layers are beginning to automate load  balancing and monitoring of power grids through real-time PMU measurements. This  automation needs adequate monitoring processes. Operators must adopt tools and procedures  that will enhance power grid’s resilience against malformed and/ or injected data that can affect  decision making in modern smart grids. Data validation should be implemented in mission-  critical processes.  POWER SECTOR DEPENDENCY ON TIME SERVICE  April 2020  18  4.

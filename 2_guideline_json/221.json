ENISA works with the EU, its member states, the private sector and Europe’s  citizens to develop advice and recommendations on good practice in information security. It assists  EU member states in implementing relevant EU legislation and works to improve the resilience of  Europe’s critical information infrastructure and networks. ENISA seeks to enhance existing expertise  in EU member states by supporting the development of cross-border communities committed to  improving network and information security throughout the EU.  Since 2019, it has been drawing up  cybersecurity certification schemes. More information about ENISA and its work can be found at  www.enisa.europa.eu.

ISBN: 978-92-9204-589-0  DOI: 10.2824/211856  Catalogue number: TP-04-22-152-EN-N  CYBERSECURITY ACT (CSA)  The CSA establishes a cybersecurity certification framework and introduces rules for EU-wide  certification of ICT products, processes and services. Additionally, it grants ENISA a permanent  mandate and increased responsibilities and resources to support cybersecurity across the Union.  GOVERNANCE  Governance describes a complex system, defining roles, responsibilities, processes and relationships.  Governance includes stakeholders from and covers the private sector, the public administration as  well as the civil society and spans over different topics such as economic, social and political  priorities.  CYBER GOVERNANCE  “Operation of decision-making processes” which increase and ensure “participation, transparency, and  accountability in taking measures related to cyberspace together with the mechanism of international  agreements, strategies, laws, measures, regulations, and standards that interlock in the best way”  (Efe & Bensghir, 2019).  GOVERNANCE MODEL A governance model provides a framework to systemise and organise stakeholders, actions,  processes, and relationships to reach defined objectives of a policy, strategy or political system. This  study assesses governance models based on their political, strategic, operational and technical  elements to reach the objectives of the NCSS.  DEFINITIONS  The EU Cybersecurity Act states that ENISA shall support the Member States in developing national  strategies on the security of network and information systems, promote the correct deployment of  those strategies and set up a governance framework that ensures the sustainability of national  strategies (National Cybersecurity Strategy - NCSS).  As part of this mandate, ENISA launched this  study to perform a systematic review of the governance models relevant to the deployment of an  NCSS to identify and select the most relevant instances, lessons learned, and good practices from  the Member States.  This study aims to collect insights on the definition of processes, roles and responsibilities, the  subsequent deployment of monitoring measures and what are the main challenges and good  practices that the European countries put in place to ensure an effective governance framework for  the implementation of current and future NCSSs of the EU Member States.  SCOPE, OBJECTIVES & AIM  1  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  SCOPE AND OBJECTIVESMETHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  Desk Research: The desk research has been  focused on good practices adopted in the EU  Member States, while insights collected from  around the world complement the analysis.  Collection of experts and stakeholders'  points of view: In this context, 19  stakeholders from 18 EU Member  States have been interviewed. The  national stakeholders have all been part  of the national authority or government  body in charge of the cybersecurity  strategy.  1 2  3  Analysis of data: The data collected through  desk research and interviews was analysed  to identify good practices in the design of a  governance framework.  Definition of good practices for  governance: Thereafter, good practices  and trends in setting up governance  models have been defined and validated  by national experts, before publication.  18 Member States interviewed  Austria Belgium Croatia Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland Germany  INTERVIEWED MEMBER STATES  Greece Ireland Italy Lithuania Malta Netherlands Slovakia Spain Sweden  4  2  Out of the 27 Member States: 9 Member States have 3rd or  later generation NCSS; 14 Member States have a 2nd  generation NCSS; 4 Member States are at their first  NCSS.  NCSS generation in the EU  The creation of a central body in charge of the  successful deployment of the NCSS is uniquely  affected by the type of government or its self- governance.  Some of the factors that play a role in the  definition of the mandate of such a body are  related to the dimension of the country, stage of  maturity and the country's self-governance.  100% of the interviewed  stakeholders have in  place a central  cybersecurity body.  3  THE NCSSs in the EU  Every EU Member State is obliged, following the NIS Directive, to develop and implement a  National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) to ensure fostering security of network and information  systems across the Union. Each NCSS aims to set out a plan of actions to improve the security  and resilience of national infrastructure systems and services. It aims to provide a high-level top- down approach to cybersecurity and to establish a range of national objectives and priorities.  However, the fast and ever-evolving cyberspace calls for constantly developing and adopting the  NCSS and hence consistent monitoring and evaluation of the NCSS is necessary.  Additionally, establishing a functioning and effective governance model for the implementation of  the current and future NCSSs is essential to foster cybersecurity across the Union and to reach  the national strategies' as well as the institutions' objectives in this relation.  4  DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR  NCSSs  GOVERNANCE  MODEL  FOR NCSSs  STRATEGIC  GOVERNANCE  TECHNICAL  GOVERNANCE  OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE  POLITICAL  GOVERNANCE  Provides general and  legal framework and establishes processes,  roles and responsibilities.

Ensures translation of  NCSSs into actions to  improve cybersecurity  across the society.

Use of Tools, Technology, and Certification Schemes  Overview of the implementation status across the interviewed EU Member States  Use certification schemes for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, especially for all the services or  activities provided by essential entities. The competent authorities should be empowered to apply sanctions  consisting of the suspension of a certification or authorisation concerning part or all the services provided by an  essential entity.  Put in place in the NCSS action plan a group of tasks focused on using tools and technologies in respect to  human rights, particularly to GDPR.

When developing this section, specify which technical standards should be used, and define clear  roles and responsibilities.  USE OF TOOLS, TECHNOLOGY AND CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  International Standards and Technical Guidelines  Have in place a body that supervises the compliance of regulated entities with the European and international  requirements.  Use of Tools, Technology, and Certification Schemes  Overview of the implementation status across the interviewed EU Member States  Use certification schemes for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, especially for all the services or  activities provided by essential entities. The competent authorities should be empowered to apply sanctions  consisting of the suspension of a certification or authorisation concerning part or all the services provided by an  essential entity.  Put in place in the NCSS action plan a group of tasks focused on using tools and technologies in respect to  human rights, particularly to GDPR.

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the good practices around the set-up and deployment of a governance framework to support the implementation of the NCSS in the EU. The main aim of this statistical outline is to give an overview of the key findings of the study, link them with the main elements of the proposed governance framework and support them by sharing insightful statistics. Moreover, this lightweight report highlights a collection of good practices for the different elements of governance that the European countries put in place to ensure an effective framework for the implementation of current and future NCSSs of the EU Member States."

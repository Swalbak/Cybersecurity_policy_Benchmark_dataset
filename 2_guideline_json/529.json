This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2014 and it gives an aggregated analysis of the incident reports  about severe outages across the EU. This report does not include details about individual countries or providers.  The aim of the incident reporting scheme is to provide transparency to society and to learn from past incidents in  the electronic communications sector in order to systematically improve the security in the networks and services.  This report provides an overview on an aggregated level of what services and network assets are impacted and the  root causes of the incidents. Conclusions on the main patterns of incidents are drawn, contributing to discussions  at policy level on strategic measures to improve the security in the electronic communications sector.  The main conclusions from this year’s incident reporting are the following:   137 major incidents reported: This year 25 countries including one EFTA country reported 137 significant  incidents that occurred in 2014 while four countries reported they had no significant incidents.   Fixed telephony most affected: In 2014 most incidents affected fixed telephony (Nearly half of all reported  incidents). This was a change compared with the previous reporting years, when mobile telephony and  mobile Internet represented the services most impacted by incidents.   Impact on emergency calls: 29 % of the major incidents also had an impact on 112 emergency calls.   Technical failures cause most outages: Most of the incidents were caused by technical failures (65 % of all  reported incidents), mainly software bugs and hardware failures affecting switches and routers.   Faulty software changes and updates have most impact: Incidents caused by human errors and  particularly faulty software changes and updates had most impact in terms of users impacted in  combination with the duration of the incidents.  These patterns need particular attention when carrying out risk and vulnerability assessments in the electronic  communications sector.  Based on results from the annual incident reports, ENISA has over the years studied and provided  recommendations in the areas of: power supply dependencies, national roaming for resilience, ICT procurement in  the telecom sector, and mitigating cable cuts.  This year ENISA is assessing the impact of the implementation of the incident reporting scheme mandated in  Article 13a of the EU Telecom Framework Directive. ENISA is also studying what indicators are being used when  measuring the impact of incidents in the telecom sector. Thirdly, ENISA is providing a vocabulary covering the  relevant threats to the continuity of telecom networks and services and the relevant network assets that are at  risk.  ENISA chairs since 2010 the NRA Article 13a Expert Group that meets periodically to draft technical guidelines in  the area of Article 13a. This NRA group of experts also exchanges experiences and good practices regarding  security requirements, incident reporting and how providers and NRAs have addressed certain major incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  05  ENISA, together with the European Commission and NRAs in the EU Member States, will continue addressing  specific incidents in more detail within the Article 13a Expert Group. ENISA will also continue to give support to  other sectors that are developing network and information security incident reporting schemes.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  06  1. Introduction  This is the fourth iteration of the report “Annual Incident Reports”, which summarises significant outage incidents  reported to ENISA and the European Commission (Commission), under Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC), a new article introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic  communications. This year ENISA and the Commission received 137 incident reports from NRAs, about severe  outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks or services which occurred in 2013. This report provides  an aggregate analysis of these 137 incidents.  Please note that in this document we do not provide details from the individual incident reports. The analysis is  only an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU, and it does not contain references to  specific countries or specific providers. Individual incidents are discussed in more detail with the NRAs in the  Article 13a Expert Group.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the details of the  technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by the different NRAs of the EU  Member States. Section 4 analyses the incidents from 2014 which were reported to ENISA and the Commission  and provides examples of incidents. Section 5 provides the conclusions.  In annex A-D we show graphs with the trend over the years to allow for the reader to make a comparison with  data from previous years. This comparison should however be done with caution, as the methodology for details in  the reporting has been improved over the years and the thresholds have been lowered year by year allowing for  more incidents to be reported.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  07  2. Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009 and was  transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework Directive. Article 13a  addresses the security and integrity1 of public electronic communications networks and services. The legislation  concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications networks and  services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to guarantee  security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of integrity that  have had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary, for  example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram below. This  document analyses the incidents from 2014 that have been reported to ENISA and the Commission (the black  dashed arrow).

Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure  In 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve a  harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Framework directive. In these meetings, a group of experts from  NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non-binding technical documents providing  guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting2   Technical Guideline on Security Measures3  Later on, in 2014, the group of experts agreed on the third non-binding technical document:   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets4.  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to develop the technical guidelines and to  discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications  sector) and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  Incident reporting procedure  In spring 2012, the Commission agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the Communications  Committee, COCOM) to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011 incidents impacting the  continuity of supply of electronic communications services. The decision included a recommendation to use the  reporting template agreed within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM  meeting, ENISA implemented the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article  13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual  reporting would be carried out by the end of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaces the electronic  forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data reported and provides the  NRAs with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU. In 2015 ENISA is providing the possibility  for the NRAs to extract graphs from CIRAS based on their search results.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting, which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.1 Services in scope  NRAs should report about incidents affecting the following electronic communication services:   Fixed telephony (e.g. PSTN, VoIP over DSL, Cable, Fibre, etc.),   Mobile telephony (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, etc.),   Fixed Internet access (e.g. over DSL, Fibre, Cable, etc.),   Mobile Internet access (e.g. GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, LTE, etc.)  2 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  3 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  09  NRAs may also report about incidents affecting other types of services, e.g. TV broadcast, SMS and e-mail,  however these services are not in scope of this report.  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs should report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of electronic  communications services.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines in their  country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up5:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and Internet access, and  which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are purchased  separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  3.1.4 Thresholds  The threshold for the annual summary reporting is based on the duration and the number of users of a service  affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1h <...<2  h  2h <...<4  h  4h <...<6  h  6h <...<8  h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Figure 2: Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  5 Reference is made to the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  10  The threshold should be understood on a “per service” basis. In other words, if an incident impacts multiple  services, then for one of the services the threshold should be passed in order to trigger the reporting mechanism.  NRAs have the discretion to also report incidents with impact graded below the threshold.  For 2013, we introduced a new optional threshold for annual summary reporting, based on absolute impact, in  order to allow for NRAs in large Member States to include larger incidents but that would not exceed the relative  thresholds. This absolute threshold has been lowered for 2014 and has now become mandatory. NRAs should  include incidents when the product of duration and number of user connections affected exceeds 60 million user  minutes, or 1 million user hours. Note that the introduction of this mandatory and lowered absolute threshold has  led to an increase in the number of reported incidents to ENISA and the Commission.  3.1.5 Root cause categories  In the incident reports four categories of root causes have been outlined plus one category that is used in  conjunction with one of the other four categories.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of the provider  or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of  procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation, e.g. a Denial of Service attack disrupting the service, or a cable theft.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example  caused by hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third party. The  category is used in conjunctions with one of the other four root cause categories.  3.1.6 Detailed causes  In the incident reports, detailed causes are specified in terms of “initial cause” and “subsequent cause”.  “Initial  cause” is the event or factor that triggered the incident. Often incidents involve a chain of events or factors, and by  specifying a “subsequent cause” NRAs may indicate a cause that subsequently played a role in the incident. In the  ENISA annual reports the initial and subsequent causes are equally presented in the graphs of the detailed causes.  These detailed causes are referred to as “threats” in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets6. In  the report, which is used by the NRAs as a guide for the annual summary reporting, the causes/threats are listed  and described.  3.1.7 Assets affected  Optionally NRAs may indicate what network assets were affected by the incidents, e.g. HLRs, routers and switches,  underground cables etc. These assets are listed and described in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and  Assets.  6 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  11  4. Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 1 EFTA country participated in this process. Of these, 24 Member States and  1 EFTA country reported in total 137 significant incidents and 4 countries reported there were no significant  incidents.  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting over 2013.  In this section, the 137 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per service is analysed (in  Section 4.1), then the impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.2), and in Section 4.3 detailed causes  are examined. In Section 4.3.5 the impact, as a product of user connections affected and duration of the incidents,  is analysed, and in Section 4.4 the components or assets affected by the incidents are considered. Throughout the  text we provide anonymized descriptions (in blue italic) of actual large-scale incidents which occurred in 2014. In  annex A-D we show graphs including the previous two years to allow the reader to make a comparison. This  comparison should however be done with caution, see below.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the statistics in  this report. In particular, they should take into account that:  1. The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the continuity  of public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other types of incidents with  an impact on security of services and networks which are not in scope of annual reporting. For example, if  attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing any outages, then such a security incident would  not be included in the annual reporting.  2. The scope of reporting includes major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed reporting  thresholds. Smaller incidents are not reported at EU level, meaning that the view is skewed towards the  larger incidents.  3. Year by year we are in collaboration with the NRAs lowering the thresholds for the annual summary  reporting. This fact, in combination with continuously improved national reporting mechanisms, lead to  increasing numbers of reports submitted to ENISA and the Commission each year. This doesn’t necessarily  mean that the number of incidents throughout the EU is increasing.  4. We are continuously working in collaboration with the NRAs for improved quality in the incident reporting.  There are still changes, more details and improvements in the way national and EU reporting is being  implemented, including the lowering of reporting thresholds and refinements of parameters for reporting.  Statistical conclusions about multi-annual trends should therefore be drawn with caution.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  12  Impact of incidents  First we look at the electronic communications services and compare them with each other in terms of incidents.  4.1.1 Impact per service  In 2014 most of the reported incidents affected fixed telephony although there was quite an even spread among  the services. This is a break in the trend compared to the earlier reporting years when most incidents affected  mobile communications (see Annex A.1).  Figure 4: Incidents per service (percentage)  Note that most reported incidents usually have an impact on more than one service in the same incident (which is  why the percentages in the chart add up to more than 100 %).  A software bug caused fixed telephony to fail for millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause:  system failure): A metro router7 in an exchange suffered a software crash and lost connection to the core network  but continued to advertise available BGP routes to access network swtiches. Some more exchanges continued to be  affected but they were misdiagnosed as fixed, which delayed restoring the service.  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile Internet outages affected most user connections compared to the other services, with an average of 1.7  million user connections affected per reported incident. Also in past reporting years mobile internet failures  affected most user connections, and mobile telephony failures came in second place, see Annex A.2.  7 Metro router = system for routing traffic in metropolitan area networks.  Figure 5: Average number of user connections affected per incident per service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  13  Note that the averages in these diagrams include both small and large countries, so EU averages shown in the  diagram above are not necessarily representative for the size of incidents occurring nationally. The average size of  national incidents can be very different, depending on the size of the population and the national network  topology. What is interesting to note is the comparison between the affected services in terms of affected user  connections.  The difference between mobile  and fixed may partly be due to the fact that some of the impacted components,  we call them assets, in the mobile networks, were more centrally located parts of the networks as compared to the  failed assets for fixed services, thus affecting more user connections per incident. We can see this pattern for the  last three years, see Annex A.2.  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile Internet outages impacted about 13 % of the national user base for mobile Internet user connections on  average, which is a slight increase compared to the previous year, see annex A.3. Despite an increased number of  smaller incidents  reported in 2014 compared to earlier years, due to lowered reporting thresholds, the percentage  of the national user base affected increased. All four years, mobile Internet has been reported to suffer the most  impact in terms of percentage of its national user base compared to the other services.  Distributed Denial of Service attack caused mobile Internet to fail (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause:  Malicious action): Intermittent DDos attacks were carried out by hijacking customer equipment. The equipment  was used to create an amplification attack by issuing malicious DNS requests towards certain customers’ domains.  The amplification attack created an overload situation in the load balancers for the DNS servers which caused the  mobile Internet services to fail for approximately 50 % of the customers, although the provider was not the target  of the attack.  Figure 6: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  14  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  In 29 % of incidents reported, emergency calls were impacted - i.e. the possibility for users to contact emergency  call-centres using the emergency number 112. Compared to the previous year this figure has increased, see Annex  A.4.  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 12 % of incidents reported there was an impact on interconnections between providers.  Compared to previous  year also this figure has increased, see Annex A.5. This calls for incentives for information sharing between  interconnected providers to inform about disruptions and to share mitigation measures.  Figure 7: Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 8: Impact on interconnections  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  15  Root cause categories  In this section we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. For a description of the root cause  categories, see section 3.1.5.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  In 2014 most of the reported incidents, 65 % of the incidents, were in the root cause category system failures or  technical failures, a ratio which is consistent compared to the previous year, see Annex B.1. For all reporting years,  system failures has been the most commonly impacted root cause category. In second place, 20 % of the incidents  were caused by human errors, also this was consistent with previous years. In 9 % of the reported incidents  ”malicious actions” were detected, which is a slight increase compared with the previous year. Last year this  category surpassed ”natural phenomena”, which had a decrease compared to the earlier years.  Hardware failure caused disruptions for millions of mobile telephony users (duration: hours, connections:  millions, cause: system failure): A failure in some cross-connector circuits in town X isolated a Mobile Switching  Centre, MSC, from the rest of the network, causing overload in the Home Location Register, HLR. Due to this  overload, millions of users across the country were not able to make phone calls for several hours.  Figure 9: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  16  4.2.2 Third party failures  About 16 % of the incidents reported were categorized as third party failures, a slight increase compared to the  previous year, see Annex B.2.  Below we show the root cause categories for the reported third party failures.  In 2014 third party failures basically had the same distribution of root causes as the reported incidents in general,  with system failures as the most common type of third party failures. Human errors, however, were more frequent  in third party failures than in the reported incidents in general.  External power failure caused fixed telephony and internet to fail (duration: hours, connections: thousands:  cause: third party system failure): The incident was caused by a power failure from the energy supplier and power  surges coming from the power network. This affected a number of central systems, applications and circuits that  had to be reestablished and in some cases repaired.  Figure 10: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  Figure 11: Third party root causes (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  17  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  In this section we look at the root causes for each of the four services separately: fixed telephony, fixed Internet  access, mobile telephony and mobile Internet access.  In 2014, system failures was the dominant root cause for all services respectively. For mobile telephony and  mobile internet, this was the case also the previous years, whereas the dominant root cause for fixed telephony  and fixed internet the previous years was natural phenomena, see Annex B.3.  4.2.3.1 Fixed Telephony  4.2.3.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 12: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).

Figure 14: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  19  4.2.4 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  In 2014 human errors affected most user connections, on average about 3 million user connections per incident. In  the previous year, system failures affected most connections.  Excavator cut a cable causing all services to fail for millions of users for several hours (duration: hours,  connection: millions, cause: human error and third party failure): An electricity company was doing excavation  works, and in order to avoid cable damages, it had asked the relevant telecom provider to come and show where in  the ground it had its infrastructure. The provider didn’t show one interconnection cable between the two countries,  and it was cut. Soon after, it was discovered that due to a configuration error in a router in the capital of the other  country, the traffic didn't route automatically to the secondary interconnection. This caused major lack of capacity  in the abroad connections.  4.2.5 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  The reported incidents caused by natural phenomena had the longest recovery time on average per incident (81  hours), the highest figure since the annual incident reporting started, see Annex B.4. The trend is unsurprisingly  that incidents caused by natural phenomena are the most difficult incidents to manage in terms of recovery time.  Ice storm caused outages in all services for up to two weeks (duration: weeks, connection: thousands, cause:  natural phenomena): Due to heavy sleet and fierce ice storms, providers experienced a lengthy interruption of  Figure 16: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  Figure 17: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  20  services. Affected were users in the wide area of the country. The loss of services was impacting users for one day  up to two weeks. The main cause for the loss of services was the interruption of power supply, because heavy ice on  cables destroyed a large number of power lines and pillars. All services including the emergency call service were  interrupted.  Heavy snow shut down power supply causing mobile networks to fail (duration: days, connection: thousands,  cause: natural phenomena and third party failure): Due to severe weather conditions with heavy snow and ice, the  electricity supplier was affected. Because of the lack of power supply, the equipment became inoperable until the  situation was remedied by the supplier. Due to the weather conditions, roads were closed. This made the access to  base station sites with problems very difficult, so the actions taken to remedy the situation were delayed.  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Considering the number of user connections affected and the duration of the incident, yields a value that allows us  to measure the total impact of an incident. We call the latter ”user hours lost”. In 2014 human error clearly had  most impact in terms of user hours lost. However, the previous year natural phenomena had most impact.  A procedure flaw caused fixed network to fail: (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: human error):  Provider Edge routers at two POP sites became isolated due to planned optical fibre works by third party fibre  provider. Planned works ran over schedule and upon completion of works the provider equipment was not correctly  reconnected.  Figure 18: Average user hours lost per incident per root cause category.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  21  Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad but give a good summary of the most common types of incidents. In this  section we break down the root cause categories in predefined detailed causes of incidents.  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but often by multiple causes and a chain of causes. For  instance an incident may initially be triggered by heavy winds, which tear down power supply infrastructure  causing a power cut, which in turn leads to an outage. For this incident both heavy winds and power cut are  detailed causes. These detailed causes are equally represented in the statistics, because both causes may be  addressed by the provider in terms of security measures.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2014, the most common causes of incidents were software bugs and hardware failures. This can now be  considered a trend as this has been the case all the previous years. Also cable cuts were among the top four causes  during all three years as well as power cuts. Denial of service attacks increased to being the seventh most common  cause for service disruptions.  Software bug/vulnerability in CPEs8 caused DDOS attacks outside operator’s network (duration: hours,  connections: thousands, cause: software bug): Compromised CPEs generated DDoS to domain outside operator's  own network. Grown traffic affected operator's DNS-servers so that occasionally DNS requests could not be  answered.  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  In this section we show the detailed causes of incidents for each of the four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) - see figures 20 to 23 below. Software bugs and hardware failures  were the most common causes for failures in three of the four services; fixed telephony, mobile telephony and  mobile internet. For fixed Internet the most common cause was power cuts. Fixed Internet was also compared  8 Customer Premises Equipment (e.g. home routers)  Figure 19: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  22  with the other services and in absolute terms quite significantly impacted by denial of service attacks and this  trend has increased over the years.  4.3.2.1 Fixed Telephony  4.3.2.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 21: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).  Figure 20: Detailed causes for fixed telephony (percentage).  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  23  4.3.2.3 Mobile Telephony  4.3.2.4 Mobile Internet  Figure 22: Detailed causes for mobile telephony (percentage).  Figure 23: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  24  4.3.3 Average number of user connections affected per detailed cause  In 2014 there was a small number of reported incidents caused by cooling outage affecting over 6 million user  connections on average. Otherwise the number of user connections affected per incident was quite evenly spread  over policy/procedure flaws, overload, denial of service attacks and software bugs.  Faulty air conditioning led to power failure causing outage for millions of mobile Internet users (duration: hours,  connections: millions, cause: cooling outage): There was a power failure at a Provider’s data centre. This impacted  the mobile Internet service for millions of users for several hours. The loss of power resulted in customers  experiencing problems when trying to make new data connections and when sending SMS/MMS. Mobile virtual  network operators also experienced issues making voice calls. The initial cause was faulty air conditioning units  which resulted in overheating, leading to a power failure. Temporary air conditioning units were set up in the  rooms to reduce temperature while the air conditioning units were repaired. When temperatures returned to  normal, power was restored and services started to restore. Full service was restored after six hours.  DDoS-attack on website caused loss of mobile internet for all customers  (duration: hours, connections: millions,  causes: Denial of Service attack): A distributed denial of service attack was carried out on a foreign gaming-site  through old ADSL-modems. This caused DNS-overload and subsequently total loss of mobile data for the provider’s  customers all over the country.  Figure 25: Average number of user connections affected per incident per detailed cause (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  25  4.3.4 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause  For 2014, reported incidents caused by faulty software changes and updates had the longest duration (almost 5  days per incident on average).  This figure should be considered with caution, as one of the incidents caused by  faulty software changes and updates had a considerably high duration driving up the average figure. Heavy  snowfall had the second longest average duration per incident (4 days) followed by heavy winds (3 days), fire and  hardware failures (2,5 days).  Faulty software update caused a large scale mobile communication failure: (duration: days, connections:  thousands, cause: faulty software update):  After migration of a HLR on to a new platform, subscribers  experienced difficulties registering to the network and thus using the services. Subscribers didn’t manage to setup  calls and transfer data, etc.  Figure 24: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  26  4.3.5 User hours lost per detailed cause  This graph shows the impact in terms of user hours lost per detailed cause. Faulty software changes and updates  was for 2014 the cause having the most impact among the incidents. The previous year it was power cuts. This  points towards the dependency on ICT equipment and services and the need to have security measures in place to  deal with software changes and upgrades, such as good agreements with third party vendors, educated personnel,  test environments, redundant systems and roll back routines etc.  Faulty upgrade caused service failure for mobile communications (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: faulty software change/update): While upgrading software affecting the Provider Edge (PE) in routing  elements, there was a failure and redundant data paths did not work correctly.  Faulty configuration caused outage in all services for millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions,  cause: human error): A faulty executed command caused massive propagation of wrong configuration across an IP  backbone of a provider. The incident originated from a network element and then flooded as a domino effect on  other nodes of the operator’s IP backbone, causing lack of IP connectivity among switches and HLRs and on the  signaling network. The incident impacted access to mobile and fixed services for millions of users in parts of the  national territory for several hours.  Figure 26: Average user hours lost per incident per detailed cause.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  27  Assets affected  For the third year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the electronic  communications networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more information about the nature  of the outages and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily involved in them.  4.4.1 Assets affected overall  In 2014 switches and routers were the assets most affected by incidents. The previous year it was base stations  and controllers, followed by switches and routers, see Annex D.1. In 2014 there were also many problems affecting  underground cables.  Software bug caused outage in VoIP services for thousands of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: Software bug): Failure of both SIP9 Session Management processes on the main Operator SIP Switch prevented  set up of all inbound and outbound calls.  9 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for signaling and controlling multimedia communication  sessions.  Figure 27: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  28  4.4.2 Affected assets in system failures  As for all previous reporting years, system failures (or technical failures), was the most common root cause  category in 201410. In these system failures the most common assets that failed were switches and routers, mobile  switches (MSC), transmission nodes, power supply equipment and mobile user and location registers (e.g. HLR).  Also the previous year mobile switches, and switches and routers were the most common assets to fail in this root  cause category.  Software bug caused outage in VoIP services for thousands of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: Software bug): Thousands of xDSL-users could not use the VoIP service. A software bug of the switch  appliance caused the outage. After the error had been identified, the appliance was relaunched.  10 The root cause System failure includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example caused by  hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.  Figure 28: Assets affected by system failures (percentages).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  29  4.4.3 VoIP versus PSTN  We also split the service fixed telephony into traditional circuit switched fixed telephony (PSTN) and fixed IP based  telephony (VoIP) to see if the detailed causes show any particular differences. Both PSTN and VoIP were mostly  affected by software bugs last year and PSTN had more problems compared to VoIP. PSTN was also more affected  by hardware failures compared to VoIP, and both PSTN and VoIP were affected by cable cuts. VoIP had more  problems than PSTN with policy/procedure flaws.  Figure 29: Detailed causes for incidents affecting PSTN and VoIP (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  30  5. Conclusions  In this Report ENISA summarized and analysed the outage incidents that were sent by the National Regulatory  Authorities, NRAs, to ENISA and the European Commission in 2015 concerning incidents in 2014, as mandated by  Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC). ENISA and the Commission received, as part of the fourth  round of reporting from the NRAs, 137 reports about major outages/disruptions impacting electronic  communications services that occurred in 2014.  From the 137 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the Commission, the following conclusions can be drawn,  first looking at services and network assets affected and then at the causes of the incidents.  Services and network assets affected:   Fixed telephony most affected: In 2014 most incidents affected fixed telephony (47 % of all reported  incidents). This was a change compared with the previous reporting years, when mobile telephony and  mobile Internet represented the services most impacted by incidents.   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile Internet or mobile telephony  affected most users (around 1.7 million users and 1.2 million users respectively per incident). Centrally  located network assets seemed to constitute single points of failure.   Emergency Services are affected by incidents: In 29 % of the incidents there were problems in reaching  the 112 emergency services, a small increase since the previous year.   Interconnections between providers are affected by incidents: In 12 % of the incidents there were  problems in interconnecting between providers, an increase compared with previous years. This calls for  enhancing cooperation between providers in terms of information sharing and mitigation measures.   Switches and routers most affected by incidents: Overall, switches and routers were the network  components most affected by incidents.  Causes of incidents:   System failures are the dominant causes of incidents: Most incidents were caused by causes in the root  cause category system failures or technical failures (65 % of the incidents). This has been the dominant  root cause all the reporting years so far. System failures was also the most common root cause for all the  services when looking at them separately. In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware  failures were the most common causes. The assets most often affected by system failures were switches  and routers, and mobile switches. System failures followed by human errors, e.g. cable cuts and faulty  software updates, were the most common root cause category for third party failures, which calls for  improved cooperation between providers, construction workers and third party vendors of equipment and  managed services.   Human errors affect many users: Last year human errors was the root cause category involving most users  affected, around 3 million user connections on average per incident.   Natural phenomena cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by natural phenomena (mainly heavy  snow/ice and heavy winds) had, like for all previous years and not surprisingly, most impact in terms of  duration, on average over three days per incident.   Faulty software changes and updates have most impact: Incidents caused by human errors and  particularly faulty software changes and updates had most impact taking into account user connections  affected and the duration of the incidents.  These patterns and trends need particular attention in the risk and vulnerability assessments carried out in the  electronic communications sector.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  31  Based on the annual summary reporting of 2011 and 2012 incidents, ENISA analysed in 2013 the dependencies in  the electronic communications sector on power supply and issued recommendations regarding the sector’s ability  to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts. ENISA also studied in 2013 national roaming for increased  resilience in mobile networks. Last year, based on the annual summary reporting of 2012 and 2013 incidents,  ENISA has issued recommendations for providers about how to manage security requirements for vendors of ICT  equipment and outsourced services used for core operations. Based on the 2012 and 2013 summary reporting  ENISA has also studied national initiatives to reduce the number of underground cable breaks caused by mistakes.  In 2015 ENISA is assessing the impact of the Article 13a Incident Reporting Scheme in the EU. A study is also being  carried out this year to analyse alternative indicators for measuring impact in electronic communications services.  Thirdly, ENISA is providing a guideline on relevant threats to the continuity of telecom networks and services and  the relevant network assets to secure.  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group, will continue discussing specific incidents in more detail with  the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, Ministries and the European Commission for a fruitful  collaboration and we look forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve the security and  resilience of the electronic communications sector in the EU and more generally for supervision of security also in  other critical sectors.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new-report-on-power-supply-dependencies http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  32  References  Related ENISA papers   The Article 13a Expert Group technical guidelines on incident reporting, security measures, and threats  and assets respectively: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s reports about the 2011 and 2012 incidents, reported under Article 13a:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports   ENISA’s study 2013 on Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply- dependencies   ENISA’s study 2013 on National Roaming for Resilience: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience- and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience   ENISA’s study and guide 2014 to Electronic Communications Providers when procuring ICT products and  outsourced services for core operations: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors   ENISA’s study 2014 on information sharing systems for announcing civil works in order to protect  underground communications infrastructure from cable cuts:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of- underground-infrastructure   ENISA’s whitepaper from 2012 on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security measures:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting- in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of the situation in  the EU 6 years ago: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/good- practice-guide-on-incident-reporting/good-practice-guide-on-incident-reporting-1  EU legislation   Article 13a of the Framework directive of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140   The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications (incorporating the Framework Directive  including Article 13a):  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013 %20NO%20CROPS.pdf   In 2013 the European Commission issued a European Cyber Security Strategy and proposed a directive on  Cyber Security.

Conclusions 30  References 32  Annex 33  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  04  Executive Summary  For the fourth year, ENISA publishes the annual report about significant outage incidents in the European  electronic communications sector, which are reported to ENISA and the European Commission under Article 13a of  the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the different EU  Member States.  This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2014 and it gives an aggregated analysis of the incident reports  about severe outages across the EU. This report does not include details about individual countries or providers.  The aim of the incident reporting scheme is to provide transparency to society and to learn from past incidents in  the electronic communications sector in order to systematically improve the security in the networks and services.  This report provides an overview on an aggregated level of what services and network assets are impacted and the  root causes of the incidents. Conclusions on the main patterns of incidents are drawn, contributing to discussions  at policy level on strategic measures to improve the security in the electronic communications sector.  The main conclusions from this year’s incident reporting are the following:   137 major incidents reported: This year 25 countries including one EFTA country reported 137 significant  incidents that occurred in 2014 while four countries reported they had no significant incidents.   Fixed telephony most affected: In 2014 most incidents affected fixed telephony (Nearly half of all reported  incidents). This was a change compared with the previous reporting years, when mobile telephony and  mobile Internet represented the services most impacted by incidents.   Impact on emergency calls: 29 % of the major incidents also had an impact on 112 emergency calls.   Technical failures cause most outages: Most of the incidents were caused by technical failures (65 % of all  reported incidents), mainly software bugs and hardware failures affecting switches and routers.   Faulty software changes and updates have most impact: Incidents caused by human errors and  particularly faulty software changes and updates had most impact in terms of users impacted in  combination with the duration of the incidents.  These patterns need particular attention when carrying out risk and vulnerability assessments in the electronic  communications sector.  Based on results from the annual incident reports, ENISA has over the years studied and provided  recommendations in the areas of: power supply dependencies, national roaming for resilience, ICT procurement in  the telecom sector, and mitigating cable cuts.  This year ENISA is assessing the impact of the implementation of the incident reporting scheme mandated in  Article 13a of the EU Telecom Framework Directive. ENISA is also studying what indicators are being used when  measuring the impact of incidents in the telecom sector. Thirdly, ENISA is providing a vocabulary covering the  relevant threats to the continuity of telecom networks and services and the relevant network assets that are at  risk.  ENISA chairs since 2010 the NRA Article 13a Expert Group that meets periodically to draft technical guidelines in  the area of Article 13a. This NRA group of experts also exchanges experiences and good practices regarding  security requirements, incident reporting and how providers and NRAs have addressed certain major incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  05  ENISA, together with the European Commission and NRAs in the EU Member States, will continue addressing  specific incidents in more detail within the Article 13a Expert Group. ENISA will also continue to give support to  other sectors that are developing network and information security incident reporting schemes.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  06  1. Introduction  This is the fourth iteration of the report “Annual Incident Reports”, which summarises significant outage incidents  reported to ENISA and the European Commission (Commission), under Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC), a new article introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic  communications. This year ENISA and the Commission received 137 incident reports from NRAs, about severe  outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks or services which occurred in 2013. This report provides  an aggregate analysis of these 137 incidents.  Please note that in this document we do not provide details from the individual incident reports. The analysis is  only an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU, and it does not contain references to  specific countries or specific providers. Individual incidents are discussed in more detail with the NRAs in the  Article 13a Expert Group.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the details of the  technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by the different NRAs of the EU  Member States. Section 4 analyses the incidents from 2014 which were reported to ENISA and the Commission  and provides examples of incidents. Section 5 provides the conclusions.  In annex A-D we show graphs with the trend over the years to allow for the reader to make a comparison with  data from previous years. This comparison should however be done with caution, as the methodology for details in  the reporting has been improved over the years and the thresholds have been lowered year by year allowing for  more incidents to be reported.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  07  2. Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009 and was  transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework Directive. Article 13a  addresses the security and integrity1 of public electronic communications networks and services. The legislation  concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications networks and  services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to guarantee  security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of integrity that  have had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary, for  example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram below. This  document analyses the incidents from 2014 that have been reported to ENISA and the Commission (the black  dashed arrow).

Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure  In 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve a  harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Framework directive. In these meetings, a group of experts from  NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non-binding technical documents providing  guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting2   Technical Guideline on Security Measures3  Later on, in 2014, the group of experts agreed on the third non-binding technical document:   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets4.  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to develop the technical guidelines and to  discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications  sector) and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  Incident reporting procedure  In spring 2012, the Commission agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the Communications  Committee, COCOM) to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011 incidents impacting the  continuity of supply of electronic communications services. The decision included a recommendation to use the  reporting template agreed within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM  meeting, ENISA implemented the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article  13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual  reporting would be carried out by the end of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaces the electronic  forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data reported and provides the  NRAs with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU. In 2015 ENISA is providing the possibility  for the NRAs to extract graphs from CIRAS based on their search results.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting, which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.1 Services in scope  NRAs should report about incidents affecting the following electronic communication services:   Fixed telephony (e.g. PSTN, VoIP over DSL, Cable, Fibre, etc.),   Mobile telephony (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, etc.),   Fixed Internet access (e.g. over DSL, Fibre, Cable, etc.),   Mobile Internet access (e.g. GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, LTE, etc.)  2 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  3 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  09  NRAs may also report about incidents affecting other types of services, e.g. TV broadcast, SMS and e-mail,  however these services are not in scope of this report.  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs should report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of electronic  communications services.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines in their  country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up5:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and Internet access, and  which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are purchased  separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  3.1.4 Thresholds  The threshold for the annual summary reporting is based on the duration and the number of users of a service  affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1h <...<2  h  2h <...<4  h  4h <...<6  h  6h <...<8  h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Figure 2: Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  5 Reference is made to the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  10  The threshold should be understood on a “per service” basis. In other words, if an incident impacts multiple  services, then for one of the services the threshold should be passed in order to trigger the reporting mechanism.  NRAs have the discretion to also report incidents with impact graded below the threshold.  For 2013, we introduced a new optional threshold for annual summary reporting, based on absolute impact, in  order to allow for NRAs in large Member States to include larger incidents but that would not exceed the relative  thresholds. This absolute threshold has been lowered for 2014 and has now become mandatory. NRAs should  include incidents when the product of duration and number of user connections affected exceeds 60 million user  minutes, or 1 million user hours. Note that the introduction of this mandatory and lowered absolute threshold has  led to an increase in the number of reported incidents to ENISA and the Commission.  3.1.5 Root cause categories  In the incident reports four categories of root causes have been outlined plus one category that is used in  conjunction with one of the other four categories.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of the provider  or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of  procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation, e.g. a Denial of Service attack disrupting the service, or a cable theft.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example  caused by hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third party. The  category is used in conjunctions with one of the other four root cause categories.  3.1.6 Detailed causes  In the incident reports, detailed causes are specified in terms of “initial cause” and “subsequent cause”.  “Initial  cause” is the event or factor that triggered the incident. Often incidents involve a chain of events or factors, and by  specifying a “subsequent cause” NRAs may indicate a cause that subsequently played a role in the incident. In the  ENISA annual reports the initial and subsequent causes are equally presented in the graphs of the detailed causes.  These detailed causes are referred to as “threats” in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets6. In  the report, which is used by the NRAs as a guide for the annual summary reporting, the causes/threats are listed  and described.  3.1.7 Assets affected  Optionally NRAs may indicate what network assets were affected by the incidents, e.g. HLRs, routers and switches,  underground cables etc. These assets are listed and described in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and  Assets.  6 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  11  4. Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 1 EFTA country participated in this process. Of these, 24 Member States and  1 EFTA country reported in total 137 significant incidents and 4 countries reported there were no significant  incidents.  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting over 2013.  In this section, the 137 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per service is analysed (in  Section 4.1), then the impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.2), and in Section 4.3 detailed causes  are examined. In Section 4.3.5 the impact, as a product of user connections affected and duration of the incidents,  is analysed, and in Section 4.4 the components or assets affected by the incidents are considered. Throughout the  text we provide anonymized descriptions (in blue italic) of actual large-scale incidents which occurred in 2014. In  annex A-D we show graphs including the previous two years to allow the reader to make a comparison. This  comparison should however be done with caution, see below.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the statistics in  this report. In particular, they should take into account that:  1. The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the continuity  of public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other types of incidents with  an impact on security of services and networks which are not in scope of annual reporting. For example, if  attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing any outages, then such a security incident would  not be included in the annual reporting.  2. The scope of reporting includes major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed reporting  thresholds. Smaller incidents are not reported at EU level, meaning that the view is skewed towards the  larger incidents.  3. Year by year we are in collaboration with the NRAs lowering the thresholds for the annual summary  reporting. This fact, in combination with continuously improved national reporting mechanisms, lead to  increasing numbers of reports submitted to ENISA and the Commission each year. This doesn’t necessarily  mean that the number of incidents throughout the EU is increasing.  4. We are continuously working in collaboration with the NRAs for improved quality in the incident reporting.  There are still changes, more details and improvements in the way national and EU reporting is being  implemented, including the lowering of reporting thresholds and refinements of parameters for reporting.  Statistical conclusions about multi-annual trends should therefore be drawn with caution.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  12  Impact of incidents  First we look at the electronic communications services and compare them with each other in terms of incidents.  4.1.1 Impact per service  In 2014 most of the reported incidents affected fixed telephony although there was quite an even spread among  the services. This is a break in the trend compared to the earlier reporting years when most incidents affected  mobile communications (see Annex A.1).  Figure 4: Incidents per service (percentage)  Note that most reported incidents usually have an impact on more than one service in the same incident (which is  why the percentages in the chart add up to more than 100 %).  A software bug caused fixed telephony to fail for millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause:  system failure): A metro router7 in an exchange suffered a software crash and lost connection to the core network  but continued to advertise available BGP routes to access network swtiches. Some more exchanges continued to be  affected but they were misdiagnosed as fixed, which delayed restoring the service.  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile Internet outages affected most user connections compared to the other services, with an average of 1.7  million user connections affected per reported incident. Also in past reporting years mobile internet failures  affected most user connections, and mobile telephony failures came in second place, see Annex A.2.  7 Metro router = system for routing traffic in metropolitan area networks.  Figure 5: Average number of user connections affected per incident per service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  13  Note that the averages in these diagrams include both small and large countries, so EU averages shown in the  diagram above are not necessarily representative for the size of incidents occurring nationally. The average size of  national incidents can be very different, depending on the size of the population and the national network  topology. What is interesting to note is the comparison between the affected services in terms of affected user  connections.  The difference between mobile  and fixed may partly be due to the fact that some of the impacted components,  we call them assets, in the mobile networks, were more centrally located parts of the networks as compared to the  failed assets for fixed services, thus affecting more user connections per incident. We can see this pattern for the  last three years, see Annex A.2.  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile Internet outages impacted about 13 % of the national user base for mobile Internet user connections on  average, which is a slight increase compared to the previous year, see annex A.3. Despite an increased number of  smaller incidents  reported in 2014 compared to earlier years, due to lowered reporting thresholds, the percentage  of the national user base affected increased. All four years, mobile Internet has been reported to suffer the most  impact in terms of percentage of its national user base compared to the other services.  Distributed Denial of Service attack caused mobile Internet to fail (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause:  Malicious action): Intermittent DDos attacks were carried out by hijacking customer equipment. The equipment  was used to create an amplification attack by issuing malicious DNS requests towards certain customers’ domains.  The amplification attack created an overload situation in the load balancers for the DNS servers which caused the  mobile Internet services to fail for approximately 50 % of the customers, although the provider was not the target  of the attack.  Figure 6: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  14  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  In 29 % of incidents reported, emergency calls were impacted - i.e. the possibility for users to contact emergency  call-centres using the emergency number 112. Compared to the previous year this figure has increased, see Annex  A.4.  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 12 % of incidents reported there was an impact on interconnections between providers.  Compared to previous  year also this figure has increased, see Annex A.5. This calls for incentives for information sharing between  interconnected providers to inform about disruptions and to share mitigation measures.  Figure 7: Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 8: Impact on interconnections  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  15  Root cause categories  In this section we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. For a description of the root cause  categories, see section 3.1.5.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  In 2014 most of the reported incidents, 65 % of the incidents, were in the root cause category system failures or  technical failures, a ratio which is consistent compared to the previous year, see Annex B.1. For all reporting years,  system failures has been the most commonly impacted root cause category. In second place, 20 % of the incidents  were caused by human errors, also this was consistent with previous years. In 9 % of the reported incidents  ”malicious actions” were detected, which is a slight increase compared with the previous year. Last year this  category surpassed ”natural phenomena”, which had a decrease compared to the earlier years.  Hardware failure caused disruptions for millions of mobile telephony users (duration: hours, connections:  millions, cause: system failure): A failure in some cross-connector circuits in town X isolated a Mobile Switching  Centre, MSC, from the rest of the network, causing overload in the Home Location Register, HLR. Due to this  overload, millions of users across the country were not able to make phone calls for several hours.  Figure 9: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  16  4.2.2 Third party failures  About 16 % of the incidents reported were categorized as third party failures, a slight increase compared to the  previous year, see Annex B.2.  Below we show the root cause categories for the reported third party failures.  In 2014 third party failures basically had the same distribution of root causes as the reported incidents in general,  with system failures as the most common type of third party failures. Human errors, however, were more frequent  in third party failures than in the reported incidents in general.  External power failure caused fixed telephony and internet to fail (duration: hours, connections: thousands:  cause: third party system failure): The incident was caused by a power failure from the energy supplier and power  surges coming from the power network. This affected a number of central systems, applications and circuits that  had to be reestablished and in some cases repaired.  Figure 10: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  Figure 11: Third party root causes (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  17  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  In this section we look at the root causes for each of the four services separately: fixed telephony, fixed Internet  access, mobile telephony and mobile Internet access.  In 2014, system failures was the dominant root cause for all services respectively. For mobile telephony and  mobile internet, this was the case also the previous years, whereas the dominant root cause for fixed telephony  and fixed internet the previous years was natural phenomena, see Annex B.3.  4.2.3.1 Fixed Telephony  4.2.3.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 12: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  18  4.2.3.3 Mobile telephony  4.2.3.4 Mobile internet  Figure 15: Root cause categories for mobile Internet (percentage).  Figure 14: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  19  4.2.4 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  In 2014 human errors affected most user connections, on average about 3 million user connections per incident. In  the previous year, system failures affected most connections.  Excavator cut a cable causing all services to fail for millions of users for several hours (duration: hours,  connection: millions, cause: human error and third party failure): An electricity company was doing excavation  works, and in order to avoid cable damages, it had asked the relevant telecom provider to come and show where in  the ground it had its infrastructure. The provider didn’t show one interconnection cable between the two countries,  and it was cut. Soon after, it was discovered that due to a configuration error in a router in the capital of the other  country, the traffic didn't route automatically to the secondary interconnection. This caused major lack of capacity  in the abroad connections.  4.2.5 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  The reported incidents caused by natural phenomena had the longest recovery time on average per incident (81  hours), the highest figure since the annual incident reporting started, see Annex B.4. The trend is unsurprisingly  that incidents caused by natural phenomena are the most difficult incidents to manage in terms of recovery time.  Ice storm caused outages in all services for up to two weeks (duration: weeks, connection: thousands, cause:  natural phenomena): Due to heavy sleet and fierce ice storms, providers experienced a lengthy interruption of  Figure 16: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  Figure 17: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  20  services. Affected were users in the wide area of the country. The loss of services was impacting users for one day  up to two weeks. The main cause for the loss of services was the interruption of power supply, because heavy ice on  cables destroyed a large number of power lines and pillars. All services including the emergency call service were  interrupted.  Heavy snow shut down power supply causing mobile networks to fail (duration: days, connection: thousands,  cause: natural phenomena and third party failure): Due to severe weather conditions with heavy snow and ice, the  electricity supplier was affected. Because of the lack of power supply, the equipment became inoperable until the  situation was remedied by the supplier. Due to the weather conditions, roads were closed. This made the access to  base station sites with problems very difficult, so the actions taken to remedy the situation were delayed.  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Considering the number of user connections affected and the duration of the incident, yields a value that allows us  to measure the total impact of an incident. We call the latter ”user hours lost”. In 2014 human error clearly had  most impact in terms of user hours lost. However, the previous year natural phenomena had most impact.  A procedure flaw caused fixed network to fail: (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: human error):  Provider Edge routers at two POP sites became isolated due to planned optical fibre works by third party fibre  provider. Planned works ran over schedule and upon completion of works the provider equipment was not correctly  reconnected.  Figure 18: Average user hours lost per incident per root cause category.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  21  Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad but give a good summary of the most common types of incidents. In this  section we break down the root cause categories in predefined detailed causes of incidents.  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but often by multiple causes and a chain of causes. For  instance an incident may initially be triggered by heavy winds, which tear down power supply infrastructure  causing a power cut, which in turn leads to an outage. For this incident both heavy winds and power cut are  detailed causes. These detailed causes are equally represented in the statistics, because both causes may be  addressed by the provider in terms of security measures.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2014, the most common causes of incidents were software bugs and hardware failures. This can now be  considered a trend as this has been the case all the previous years. Also cable cuts were among the top four causes  during all three years as well as power cuts. Denial of service attacks increased to being the seventh most common  cause for service disruptions.  Software bug/vulnerability in CPEs8 caused DDOS attacks outside operator’s network (duration: hours,  connections: thousands, cause: software bug): Compromised CPEs generated DDoS to domain outside operator's  own network. Grown traffic affected operator's DNS-servers so that occasionally DNS requests could not be  answered.  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  In this section we show the detailed causes of incidents for each of the four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) - see figures 20 to 23 below. Software bugs and hardware failures  were the most common causes for failures in three of the four services; fixed telephony, mobile telephony and  mobile internet. For fixed Internet the most common cause was power cuts. Fixed Internet was also compared  8 Customer Premises Equipment (e.g. home routers)  Figure 19: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  22  with the other services and in absolute terms quite significantly impacted by denial of service attacks and this  trend has increased over the years.  4.3.2.1 Fixed Telephony  4.3.2.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 21: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).

Figure 23: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  24  4.3.3 Average number of user connections affected per detailed cause  In 2014 there was a small number of reported incidents caused by cooling outage affecting over 6 million user  connections on average. Otherwise the number of user connections affected per incident was quite evenly spread  over policy/procedure flaws, overload, denial of service attacks and software bugs.  Faulty air conditioning led to power failure causing outage for millions of mobile Internet users (duration: hours,  connections: millions, cause: cooling outage): There was a power failure at a Provider’s data centre. This impacted  the mobile Internet service for millions of users for several hours. The loss of power resulted in customers  experiencing problems when trying to make new data connections and when sending SMS/MMS. Mobile virtual  network operators also experienced issues making voice calls. The initial cause was faulty air conditioning units  which resulted in overheating, leading to a power failure. Temporary air conditioning units were set up in the  rooms to reduce temperature while the air conditioning units were repaired. When temperatures returned to  normal, power was restored and services started to restore. Full service was restored after six hours.  DDoS-attack on website caused loss of mobile internet for all customers  (duration: hours, connections: millions,  causes: Denial of Service attack): A distributed denial of service attack was carried out on a foreign gaming-site  through old ADSL-modems. This caused DNS-overload and subsequently total loss of mobile data for the provider’s  customers all over the country.  Figure 25: Average number of user connections affected per incident per detailed cause (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  25  4.3.4 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause  For 2014, reported incidents caused by faulty software changes and updates had the longest duration (almost 5  days per incident on average).  This figure should be considered with caution, as one of the incidents caused by  faulty software changes and updates had a considerably high duration driving up the average figure. Heavy  snowfall had the second longest average duration per incident (4 days) followed by heavy winds (3 days), fire and  hardware failures (2,5 days).  Faulty software update caused a large scale mobile communication failure: (duration: days, connections:  thousands, cause: faulty software update):  After migration of a HLR on to a new platform, subscribers  experienced difficulties registering to the network and thus using the services. Subscribers didn’t manage to setup  calls and transfer data, etc.  Figure 24: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  26  4.3.5 User hours lost per detailed cause  This graph shows the impact in terms of user hours lost per detailed cause. Faulty software changes and updates  was for 2014 the cause having the most impact among the incidents. The previous year it was power cuts. This  points towards the dependency on ICT equipment and services and the need to have security measures in place to  deal with software changes and upgrades, such as good agreements with third party vendors, educated personnel,  test environments, redundant systems and roll back routines etc.  Faulty upgrade caused service failure for mobile communications (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: faulty software change/update): While upgrading software affecting the Provider Edge (PE) in routing  elements, there was a failure and redundant data paths did not work correctly.  Faulty configuration caused outage in all services for millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions,  cause: human error): A faulty executed command caused massive propagation of wrong configuration across an IP  backbone of a provider. The incident originated from a network element and then flooded as a domino effect on  other nodes of the operator’s IP backbone, causing lack of IP connectivity among switches and HLRs and on the  signaling network. The incident impacted access to mobile and fixed services for millions of users in parts of the  national territory for several hours.  Figure 26: Average user hours lost per incident per detailed cause.  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  27  Assets affected  For the third year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the electronic  communications networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more information about the nature  of the outages and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily involved in them.  4.4.1 Assets affected overall  In 2014 switches and routers were the assets most affected by incidents. The previous year it was base stations  and controllers, followed by switches and routers, see Annex D.1. In 2014 there were also many problems affecting  underground cables.  Software bug caused outage in VoIP services for thousands of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: Software bug): Failure of both SIP9 Session Management processes on the main Operator SIP Switch prevented  set up of all inbound and outbound calls.  9 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for signaling and controlling multimedia communication  sessions.  Figure 27: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  28  4.4.2 Affected assets in system failures  As for all previous reporting years, system failures (or technical failures), was the most common root cause  category in 201410. In these system failures the most common assets that failed were switches and routers, mobile  switches (MSC), transmission nodes, power supply equipment and mobile user and location registers (e.g. HLR).  Also the previous year mobile switches, and switches and routers were the most common assets to fail in this root  cause category.  Software bug caused outage in VoIP services for thousands of users (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: Software bug): Thousands of xDSL-users could not use the VoIP service. A software bug of the switch  appliance caused the outage. After the error had been identified, the appliance was relaunched.  10 The root cause System failure includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example caused by  hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.  Figure 28: Assets affected by system failures (percentages).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  29  4.4.3 VoIP versus PSTN  We also split the service fixed telephony into traditional circuit switched fixed telephony (PSTN) and fixed IP based  telephony (VoIP) to see if the detailed causes show any particular differences. Both PSTN and VoIP were mostly  affected by software bugs last year and PSTN had more problems compared to VoIP. PSTN was also more affected  by hardware failures compared to VoIP, and both PSTN and VoIP were affected by cable cuts. VoIP had more  problems than PSTN with policy/procedure flaws.  Figure 29: Detailed causes for incidents affecting PSTN and VoIP (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  30  5. Conclusions  In this Report ENISA summarized and analysed the outage incidents that were sent by the National Regulatory  Authorities, NRAs, to ENISA and the European Commission in 2015 concerning incidents in 2014, as mandated by  Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC). ENISA and the Commission received, as part of the fourth  round of reporting from the NRAs, 137 reports about major outages/disruptions impacting electronic  communications services that occurred in 2014.  From the 137 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the Commission, the following conclusions can be drawn,  first looking at services and network assets affected and then at the causes of the incidents.  Services and network assets affected:   Fixed telephony most affected: In 2014 most incidents affected fixed telephony (47 % of all reported  incidents). This was a change compared with the previous reporting years, when mobile telephony and  mobile Internet represented the services most impacted by incidents.   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile Internet or mobile telephony  affected most users (around 1.7 million users and 1.2 million users respectively per incident). Centrally  located network assets seemed to constitute single points of failure.   Emergency Services are affected by incidents: In 29 % of the incidents there were problems in reaching  the 112 emergency services, a small increase since the previous year.   Interconnections between providers are affected by incidents: In 12 % of the incidents there were  problems in interconnecting between providers, an increase compared with previous years. This calls for  enhancing cooperation between providers in terms of information sharing and mitigation measures.   Switches and routers most affected by incidents: Overall, switches and routers were the network  components most affected by incidents.  Causes of incidents:   System failures are the dominant causes of incidents: Most incidents were caused by causes in the root  cause category system failures or technical failures (65 % of the incidents). This has been the dominant  root cause all the reporting years so far. System failures was also the most common root cause for all the  services when looking at them separately. In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware  failures were the most common causes. The assets most often affected by system failures were switches  and routers, and mobile switches. System failures followed by human errors, e.g. cable cuts and faulty  software updates, were the most common root cause category for third party failures, which calls for  improved cooperation between providers, construction workers and third party vendors of equipment and  managed services.   Human errors affect many users: Last year human errors was the root cause category involving most users  affected, around 3 million user connections on average per incident.   Natural phenomena cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by natural phenomena (mainly heavy  snow/ice and heavy winds) had, like for all previous years and not surprisingly, most impact in terms of  duration, on average over three days per incident.   Faulty software changes and updates have most impact: Incidents caused by human errors and  particularly faulty software changes and updates had most impact taking into account user connections  affected and the duration of the incidents.  These patterns and trends need particular attention in the risk and vulnerability assessments carried out in the  electronic communications sector.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  31  Based on the annual summary reporting of 2011 and 2012 incidents, ENISA analysed in 2013 the dependencies in  the electronic communications sector on power supply and issued recommendations regarding the sector’s ability  to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts. ENISA also studied in 2013 national roaming for increased  resilience in mobile networks. Last year, based on the annual summary reporting of 2012 and 2013 incidents,  ENISA has issued recommendations for providers about how to manage security requirements for vendors of ICT  equipment and outsourced services used for core operations. Based on the 2012 and 2013 summary reporting  ENISA has also studied national initiatives to reduce the number of underground cable breaks caused by mistakes.  In 2015 ENISA is assessing the impact of the Article 13a Incident Reporting Scheme in the EU. A study is also being  carried out this year to analyse alternative indicators for measuring impact in electronic communications services.  Thirdly, ENISA is providing a guideline on relevant threats to the continuity of telecom networks and services and  the relevant network assets to secure.  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group, will continue discussing specific incidents in more detail with  the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, Ministries and the European Commission for a fruitful  collaboration and we look forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve the security and  resilience of the electronic communications sector in the EU and more generally for supervision of security also in  other critical sectors.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new-report-on-power-supply-dependencies http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2014  August 2015  32  References  Related ENISA papers   The Article 13a Expert Group technical guidelines on incident reporting, security measures, and threats  and assets respectively: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s reports about the 2011 and 2012 incidents, reported under Article 13a:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports   ENISA’s study 2013 on Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply- dependencies   ENISA’s study 2013 on National Roaming for Resilience: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience- and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience   ENISA’s study and guide 2014 to Electronic Communications Providers when procuring ICT products and  outsourced services for core operations: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors   ENISA’s study 2014 on information sharing systems for announcing civil works in order to protect  underground communications infrastructure from cable cuts:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of- underground-infrastructure   ENISA’s whitepaper from 2012 on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security measures:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting- in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of the situation in  the EU 6 years ago: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/good- practice-guide-on-incident-reporting/good-practice-guide-on-incident-reporting-1  EU legislation   Article 13a of the Framework directive of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140   The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications (incorporating the Framework Directive  including Article 13a):  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013 %20NO%20CROPS.pdf   In 2013 the European Commission issued a European Cyber Security Strategy and proposed a directive on  Cyber Security.

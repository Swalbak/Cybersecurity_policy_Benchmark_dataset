In 2010, the European Commission published a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament  and the Council on attacks against information systems1. This proposal was intended to further  streamline the legal framework in the Member States in relation to the definition and punishment of  certain cybercrime incidents, and tackled several challenges which were not adequately dealt with  under prior rules, such as notably the creation, use and dissemination of cybercrime tools, the  penalisation of illegal interception, the use of botnets, and identity theft.  The proposal was adopted by the European Parliament on 22 July 2013 and published in the Official  Journal on 14 August 2013 as Directive 2013/40/EU. The Directive, which Member States will need  to transpose by 4 September 2015, imposes new obligations, tasks and expectations on certain key  stakeholders, including CERTs/CSIRTs, LEAs, security specialists, telecommunications service  providers, etc.  This report serves two major goals, which both aim at supporting CERTs/CSIRTs:   Firstly to provide an analysis of the legal framework created by the Directive, coupled with a  stock taking on relevant existing national activities and good practices;   Secondly, the identification of key areas and, where appropriate, guidelines and  recommendations derived from these good practices  In this manner, the Collection endeavours to be a useful support tool for all stakeholders.  Disclaimer  This document provides background information mainly for the attention and digestion of members  of CERTs in the EU Member States. It aims at explaining the potential outcomes and implications  raised by the new Directive, in order to raise awareness. It by no means aims at giving guidance for  the implementation process directly, but it will hopefully enable key players to make sound decision  based on the information in this Collection.  1  European Commission. 2010.

Furthermore, a series of workshops have been organised10, including in cooperation with Europol,  and will continue to be organised in the future in order to strengthen the effectiveness of CERTs.  The present Study aims to build upon these outputs by examining a new challenge. In 2010 already,  the Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on  attacks against information systems11. This proposal was intended to further streamline the legal  framework in the Member States in relation to the definition and punishment of certain cybercrime  incidents, and tackled several challenges which were not adequately dealt with under prior rules,  2  ENISA overview of support for CERTs: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support [Last accessed  0ctober 14, 2013]  3  ENISA. 2006. ‘A step-by-step approach on how to set up a CSIRT’.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/guide [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  4  Basic set of good practice on how to successfully run a Computer Security and Incident Response team  (CSIRT): http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/guide2  5  ENISA. 2011. ‘A flair for sharing – encouraging information exchange between CERTs’  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing [Last  accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  6  ENISA. 2012. ‘The Fight against Cybercrime Cooperation between CERTs and Law Enforcement Agencies in  the fight against cybercrime’ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against- cybercrime/supporting-fight-against-cybercrime [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  7  ENISA. 2012. ‘Give and Take Good Practice Guide for Addressing Network and Information Security Aspects of  Cybercrime’ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice- guide-for-addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime [Last accessed 0ctober 14,  2013]  8  ENISA National/governmental CERTs - Baseline Capabilities:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  9  ENISA. 2010.

COM(2010)  517: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/policies/crime/1_en_act_part1_v101.pdf [Last accessed 0ctober  14, 2013]  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  2  such as notably the creation, use and dissemination of cybercrime tools, the penalisation of illegal  interception, the use of botnets, and identity theft. As such, the proposed Directive would also  repeal the existing legal framework at the EU level, specifically the Framework Decision on attacks  against information systems.  The proposal was adopted by the European Parliament on 22 July 2013, and the final text was signed  on 12 August 201312. It was published in the Official Journal on 14 August 2013 as Directive  2013/40/EU13, entering into force on 4 September 2013. The Directive, which Member States will  need to transpose by 4 September 2015, imposes new obligations, tasks and expectations on certain  key stakeholders, including CERTs/CSIRTs, LEAs, security specialists, telecommunications service  providers, etc. These relate mainly to the operation of the existing 24/7 contact points (introducing a  response deadline obligation), improving criminal justice/police cooperation, and the obligation to  strengthen statistical data collection in order to support accountability and rational policy making.  Some of these stakeholders will already have significant experiences on these points and will thus be  likely to satisfy these requirements with relative ease. Others however will not have appropriate  legislation, budget, experience, know-how, operational expertise or technological tools in place, and  could therefore benefit in particular from good practices, including from other Member States.  This Study therefore comprised two main activities to support the implementation process, with  particular view on supporting CERTs:   Firstly the analysis of the legal framework and collection of data on relevant national  activities  and good practices;   Secondly the identification of guidelines and recommendations derived from these good  practices in order to support the Member States and their CERTs.  In the following subsections our approach towards these two activities will be presented.  The Directive and potential challenges  1.1.1  As noted in the introductory section above, Directive 2013/40/EU was already proposed as early as  30 September 2010, and replaces Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA of 24 February 2005  on attacks against information systems14. The new Directive retains most of the key features of the  Framework Decision, but also introduces some new elements.  With respect to substantive criminal law, the Directive retained prior crimes from the Framework  Decision – namely the penalisation of illegal access, illegal system interference and illegal data  interference – but added criminalisation of certain tools for committing offenses, as well as the  notion of ‘illegal interception’. This will help keep EU level legislation in line with other international  cybercrime initiatives, such as the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Convention, also known as the  12  European Parliament. 2013.

The Directive raises the level of criminal penalties to a maximum term of imprisonment of at least  two years. Instigation, aiding, abetting and attempt of those offences will become penalised as well.  Finally, the Directive also introduces new and harmonised rules in relation to certain aggravating  circumstances which result in an increased maximum term of imprisonment of at least five years  (rather than two years, as foreseen by Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA). These aggravating  circumstances again target primarily trends which are increasingly observed in the cybercrime field  over recent years, and specifically include crimes:  (a) committed within the framework of a criminal organisation, as defined in Framework  Decision 2008/841/JHA;  (b) that cause serious damage; or  (c) committed against a critical infrastructure information system.  Similarly, a new aggravating circumstance is introduced for crimes committed by misusing the  personal data of another person, with the aim of gaining the trust of a third party, thereby causing  prejudice to the rightful identity owner, a new provision which aims to tackle identity theft incidents  by treating identity theft as an ancillary aggravating circumstance committed in conjunction with  other crimes, such as fraud, hacking, etc.  Finally, a new substantive criminalisation was introduced in relation to botnets, described as  committing the crimes of illegal system access or illegal system interference “where a significant  number of information systems have been affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7,  designed or adapted primarily for that purpose” (Article 9.3). This new provision aims to more  effectively target botnet operators and/or (Distributed) Denial of Service ((D)DoS) attacks16.  These substantive criminal law provisions, being included in a Directive, require transposition at the  national level. This raises challenges of harmonisation, as divergences in phrasing or interpretation  could lead to gaps in national cybercrime laws. For this reason, it is useful to consult stakeholders on  what they perceive to be the main challenges in the implementation and application of these laws.  This is highly relevant for the Directive, as some of the new provisions are somewhat contentious,  such as e.g. the criminalisation of certain tools, which can be hard to apply considering the  importance of such tools for penetration testing or white hat hacking17, or the provisions on identity  theft, which need to take into account nationally diverging stances on e.g. the permissibility of  parody user accounts and satire (i.e. user accounts created under existing celebrity names that are  used to clearly exaggerated positions that parody or satirize real opinions of the celebrity). Similarly,  15  Convention 185 on Cybercrime, Budapest, 23 November 2001:  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  16  Defined as “ an attack in which one or more machines target a victim and attempt to prevent the victim  from doing  useful work” in IETF RFC 4732; see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4732 [Last accessed 0ctober 22,  2013]  17  Also referred to as ethical hacking, the term generally refers to hacking undertaken without malicious intent  and the particular objective of testing and improving the security of an information system; see e.g.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) and  http://www.eccouncil.org/Certification/certified-ethical-hacker [Last accessed 0ctober 22, 2013]  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4732 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) http://www.eccouncil.org/Certification/certified-ethical-hacker  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  4  the Directive frequently relies on the notion of ‘without right’18, which is a concept that risks being  applied in diverging ways. While some national differences are acceptable and expected (given the  choice of a Directive as a regulatory instrument), alignment through the sharing of good practices is  clearly advisable.  The same observations can be applied to the Directive’s procedural criminal law provisions.  Specifically, the Directive aims to improve European criminal justice/police cooperation by:   strengthening the existing structure of 24/7 contact points, including an obligation to answer  within 8 hours to urgent requests (at least in terms of whether the request will be answered,  and the form and estimated time of the answer);   introducing an obligation to collect basic statistical data on cybercrimes.  While these provisions were already introduced in the 2010 draft, their application in practice will be  strongly affected through more recent policy developments, including the Commission’s recent  Communication on a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) on 28 March 201219. The Centre, which has  started operations in January 201320 following a feasibility study conducted by RAND Europe21, is to  act as the focal point in the fight against cybercrime in the Union, serving four core functions:   it should serve as the European cybercrime information focal point;   it should pool European cybercrime expertise to support Member States;   it should provide support to Member States' cybercrime investigations;   it should become the collective voice of European cybercrime investigators across law  enforcement and the judiciary.  These functions imply that the EC3 could play a supporting role for the Member States, especially in  facilitating their compliance with the procedural obligations imposed on the key stakeholders by the  Directive. It is therefore useful to determine in the context of this study which of the stakeholders  already have the necessary capabilities in places, and which good practices, recommendations or  tips they can provide to their colleagues in other Member States.  Key Stakeholders for the Directive  1.1.2  As noted in the tender specifications, the Directive can have a significant impact on a number of  stakeholders. Obviously, the direct addressees of the Directive are the legislators who will have to  transpose the Directive into national law.  At the more operational level, the transposition will affect the decision and policy making bodies in  EU Member States who are responsible for the establishment and operation of the  national/governmental CERTs, and the national/governmental CERTs themselves. These are most  18  Defined in the Directive as “conduct referred to in this Directive, including access, interference, or  interception, which is not authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or of part of it, or  not permitted under national law”, Article 2 (d).  19  European Commission. 2012. Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European  Parliament: Tackling Crime in our Digital Age: Establishing a European Cybercrime Centre:  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we- do/policies/pdf/communication_european_cybercrime_centre_en.pdf#zoom=100 [Last accessed 0ctober 14,  2013]  20  European Cybercrime Centre (EC3): https://www.europol.europa.eu/ec3 [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  21  The Feasibility study can be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/home- affairs/doc_centre/crime/docs/20120311_final_report_feasibility_study_for_a_european_cybercrime_centre. pdf [Last accessed 0ctober 22, 2013]  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  5  directly impacted by the operational changes envisaged by the Directive, and were therefore the  largest group of stakeholders contacted during the data collection of this Study.  Apart from the national/governmental CERTs, private CERTs who lack a formal governmental  mandate could also play a significant role in ensuring the correct functioning of key national  communication networks. In the course of their operations, they commonly need to work with  national/governmental CERTs, law enforcement agencies, or other enforcement bodies such as data  protection authorities (DPAs) and telecommunications supervisory bodies. Therefore, they  constitute a group of stakeholders that should be considered as well.  Given the pivotal role that law enforcement will play in the application of national transpositions, it  is important, in order to get the most complete possible picture, to chart in an appropriate manner  the opinions and best practices within national law enforcement bodies, and their current and future  collaboration mechanisms at the cross border level, including via the recently formed EC3, operating  within Europol.  The composition of the stakeholders consulted throughout the data collection reflected this  heterogeneity, covering not only national/governmental CERTs, but also other CERTs, law  enforcement bodies, policy makers and other sectoral supervisory/policing bodies such as DPAs and  telecommunications supervisors. In the methodological sections below, we will explain how this goal  was achieved, and a list of interlocutors will be provided.  1.2 Good Practice Collection  Objectives of the Collection  1.2.1  This Good Practice Collection identifies the potential implications of the Directive on stakeholders as  identified above. Proposals and recommendations to the stakeholders are included in this Collection  when appropriate, based on observed and identified best practices in the Member States, as well as  requests and observations on gaps made by interviewees. Opinions on the above therefore come  directly from the potentially affected stakeholders.  As a practical point to assist in the interpretation of the report, it should be noted that data was  collected and analysed prior to the adoption of the Directive. The questions and analysis below were  therefore conducted on the basis of the draft text of the Directive22, which underwent minor  phrasing/structuring changes during its finalisation. The analysis below has been updated to reflect  the final version of the Directive, and the findings have been validated through a workshop held on  the 4th October in The Hague, The Netherlands, to ensure that they remain relevant. However, some  of the questions below refer to proposed changes that were not ultimately retained in the finalised  Directive; in such cases, this is clearly identified in the analysis itself.  The Collection specifically focuses on potential implications of the Directive in the Member States  based on their existing legislation and practices23 and addresses how it is relevant for CERTs and  other stakeholders, and what potential future actions could be taken by all of them.  22  European Commission. 2010.

The representatives were taken  from a wide range of stakeholder groups to ensure that all relevant perspectives were taken into  consideration.  Ultimately, feedback was obtained from 18 Member States. While some participants indicated that  they would prefer not to be identified and the list below is therefore not exhaustive, the following  stakeholders among others contributed to the data used in this study:  Member State Affiliation  Belgium FCCU  Bulgaria  International Cyber Investigation Training  Academy  Cyprus Cyprus Research and Academic Network Security  CSIRT  Czech Republic National Police Academy of the Czech Republic  France Coordinator of the Investigations Plateau of  Cybercrime and Digital Analysis (Plateau  d'Investigation Cybercriminalité & Analyses  Numériques – PI CyAN), and Head of the  Department for the Fight against Cybercrime  Greece Hellenic Data Protection Authority  Ireland UCD Centre for Cybersecurity and Cybercrime  Investigation  Italy Ministry of the Interior  Luxembourg CIRCL  Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit (Team High Tech  Crime)  National Crime Squad (Dienst Landelijke  Recherche)  Netherlands' Police (Nationale Politie, landelijke  eenheid)  Portugal FCCN.PT  Romania CERT-RO  Slovakia National Security Authority  Slovenia SI-CERT  Spain CNPIC  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  7  Sweden Swedish Defence Research Institute  United Kingdom Janet  Each interview was summarised in a brief (3-5 page) report, which was subsequently sent back to  each interviewee for validation.  The present report contains a comparative analysis of the responses, structured along the same  topics as the interviews themselves, i.e. the substantive criminal provisions of the Directive (section  2 below), the aggravating circumstances surrounding botnets and identity theft (ID theft) (section 3),  international cooperation and information exchange (section 4), and finally data collection and  reporting (section 5). In each of these sections, we have set out:   A summary of the interview outcomes, i.e. frequently recurring responses and general  trends in the feedback; this may contain both positive and negative feedback on the  Directive from the interviewees, as well as their lessons and experiences on each topic;   Identified good practices, i.e. positive lessons from specifically identified countries that may  be transposable to other countries; these are typically grouped per stakeholder;   Recommendations for the implementation, i.e. guidance towards Member States on  implementation choices, generally containing both the good practices identified earlier and  any additional recommendations that have been suggested by interviewees, even if there  was no existing good practice in any Member State yet. Thus, the recommendations not only  identify what exists in at least some Member States, but also indicate any gaps that need to  be filled in the future. As with the good practices, recommendations are typically grouped  per stakeholder.  Through this methodology, the Good Practice Collection presents an overview of the state of the art,  including the lessons learned by the various stakeholders, and aims to provide useful suggestions  and guidance for implementation activities.  This report was circulated among the ENISA Expert Group, constituted largely of persons interviewed  in the course of this Study, in order to ensure the validity and representative character of the  findings and recommendations. The report was thereafter discussed during an Expert Group  meeting in The Hague on 4 October 2013, and subsequently updated to reflect the suggestions. It  should be noted however that this report contains opinions, suggestions and recommendations  originating from various parties, and that these do not necessarily reflect any ENISA position.

This will help keep EU level legislation in line with other international  cybercrime initiatives, such as notably the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Convention, and more  importantly will allow to act more effectively against more recent developments of cybercrime  which were not yet adequately accounted for in the Framework Decision, such as the increased use  of botnets, which could be qualified as a criminal tool under the Directive’s provisions.  2.2 Illegal access  With respect to the crime of illegal access (hacking), the initially proposed Directive brought an  interesting change as compared to the prior Framework Decision. The Framework Decision allowed  Member States to decide that the conduct was incriminated only where a security measure was  breached (i.e. unlawfully accessing an unprotected information system was not required to be  criminalised in the Member States). The proposal for a Directive as studied below did not retain this  option, and illegal access would always be considered as a crime, irrespective of whether a security  measure was breached.  However, the ultimately adopted Directive (finalised after the interviews in this study were already  completed) reintroduced the terminology of the Framework Decision, noting that criminalisation of  illegal access was only needed “where committed by infringing a security measure”. The legal  framework was thus ultimately not changed, and the comments below are therefore mainly useful  as an exercise examining the potential impacts of changing this rule.  Summary of interview outcomes 2.2.1  The interviews showed that the legal framework in most countries was brought in line with the  requirements of the original proposal for a new Directive: either the legislation never required a  breach of security measures, or such a requirement had been removed in preceding years (e.g. in  the Netherlands). Of the 18 interviewed countries, only the Czech Republic indicated that a security  breach requirement was retained as a requirement in the law. Bulgaria noted that its legislation was  generally very strictly interpreted by judges, and that the ‘without permission’ criterion would  generally be interpreted as requiring that there is a lock or other security measure which needs to  be broken.  Interviewees in other countries (e.g. France and Italy) noted a similar perspective: even in the  absence of an explicit legal requirement, security breaches would always play a significant role in the  assessments made by judges: in the absence of security measures, the unlawfulness of access  attempts would be significantly harder to demonstrate.  As noted above, the Directive does not require any changes as compared to the Framework  Decision, and legislation in all Member States can thus remain ‘as is’.  Identified good practices 2.2.2  The primary challenge in relation to this provision in the Directive clearly relates to the  interpretation of unlawfulness of access attempts: especially in the absence of security measures  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  10  that were breached, it can be hard for prosecutors to decide when to initiate legal proceedings in  countries that permit prosecutors to exercise discretion on this point.  The presence of security measures can be indicative: in the absence of security measures, accidental  access is more likely. E.g. a recent decision from a French court found that access to documents on  an unsecured webserver did not constitute illegal access, since they were made freely accessible to  the public24.  Coherence on this issue is important to avoid arbitrary enforcement, and to avoid courts being  overburdened with seemingly trivial cases.  A number of countries have therefore reported the existence of prosecution guidelines that assist in  the interpretation and the application of the law. E.g. the United Kingdom reported the existence of  prosecution guidelines within the Crown Prosecution Service, which help in the interpretation of  laws and prioritisation of prosecutions25. Similar but non-public guidelines were reported in Sweden,  and Portugal reported the existence of guidance documents for judges (but not for prosecutors).  Reflections on the findings 2.2.3  2.3 Illegal interception  The offense of illegal interception was newly introduced in the Directive. It requires Member States  “to ensure that the intentional interception by technical means, of non-public transmissions of  computer data to, from or within an information system, including electromagnetic emissions from  an information system carrying such computer data, is punishable as a criminal offence when  committed without right.”  Summary of interview outcomes 2.3.1  The provision is very similar to Article 3 of the Cybercrime Convention on which it was based. As a  result, most countries could logically be expected to already have implemented suitable legislation.  24  Tribunal de Grande instance de Créteil 11ème chambre correctionnelle Jugement du 23 avril 2013:  http://www.legalis.net/spip.php?page=jurisprudence-decision&id_article=3739 [Last accessed 0ctober 14,  2013]  25  The Crown Prosecution Service. Computer Misuse Act 1990:  http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/computer_misuse_act_1990/ [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  To reduce legal uncertainty, it could be advisable for countries to publish guidance on the  interpretation and application of the unlawful access provisions, and particularly on the  element of intent (i.e. the unlawfulness – without right) in cases where no security measures  were breached, if this is permitted under national law. This can be done in the form of  prosecution guidelines in countries that permit this, and/or in the form of jurisprudence  overviews to show how courts apply the law in reality.  Collection and dissemination of such guidance at the EU level could also help to ensure  homogeneous application of the law across the European territory.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  11  The interview summaries showed that this was indeed the case: no interviewee indicated that  legislation covering illegal interception was unavailable in their jurisdiction. However, a small  number of countries (notably Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Slovakia) noted that their legislation on this  offense was currently being revised or tightened, as a part of the implementation of the Budapest  Convention, or in response to recent incidents where wiretaps were used inappropriately. This  illustrates a broader trend: many of the respondents spontaneously linked provisions on wiretaps  organised by law enforcement as an investigative measure to provisions on illegal interception as  envisaged by the Directive; likely because transgressions of rules on the former would result in a  violation of the latter.  The CERT from Luxembourg noted a particular concern, namely that excessively broad legislation  could impact e.g. the analysis of how malware works. What is non-public communication, e.g. in a  company network? Is monitoring how malware works in a system illegal interception? The law on  this point should be clear, to ensure that CERTs (or other investigators outside of law enforcement)  are not accused of interception simply because of an investigation of hacker activity. The provision in  the Directive states that only acts committed without right are considered unlawful, and regular  activities of CERTs should therefore not be interfered with. None the less, the CERT noted that there  should be more explicit guidance to ensure that the normal activities of CERTs aren’t considered to  be criminal, not so much because of a real risk of criminal investigation to CERTs, but mainly because  such discussions take up time and resources.  Identified good practices  2.3.2  No unique good practices were identified on this topic, but the concern outlined above by  Luxembourg could be similarly addressed by guidance documents. Thus, the same good practices as  discussed above under illegal interception could apply here as well.  Reflections on the findings 2.3.3  2.4 Tools for committing offenses  The Directive introduces a new offence related to tools used for committing offences, defined as  follows: Member States must “ensure that the intentional production, sale, procurement for use,  import, distribution or otherwise making available, of one of the following tools, without right and  with the intention that it be used to commit any of the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 6, is  punishable as a criminal offence, at least for cases which are not minor:”  (a) a computer programme, designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of committing  any of the offences above;  Similar to the above, uncertainty could be reduced through the publication of guidance  on the interpretation and application of the illegal interception provisions, and  particularly on the legitimacy of the activities of CERTs and network operators  themselves.  Collection and dissemination of such guidance at the EU level could also help to ensure  homogeneous application of the law across the European territory.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  12  (b) a computer password, access code, or similar data by which the whole or any part of an  information system is capable of being accessed.  Summary of interview outcomes 2.4.1  As with the offence of illegal interception above, this provision is very similar to Article 6 of the  Cybercrime Convention on which it was based26. Thus, it could again be expected that most  countries had already implemented it prior to the adoption of the Directive.  Indeed, the feedback obtained during the interviews confirmed that this was the case: of all the  interviewed respondents, none indicated that provisions on tools for committing offenses were  missing in their jurisdictions. However:   One respondent (Sweden) was not sufficiently aware of legislation on this point, and thus  could not provide conclusive information on Swedish law.   Three respondents (Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia) indicated that there was no unique  provision on ICT tools specifically, but rather that existing generic provision on tools for  committing crimes were applied. E.g. in Slovenian law the applicable provision is the articles  on the manufacture or production of weapons for a criminal act: the same rules are applied  to possession, manufacturing, selling, distributing, importing/exporting of tools for illegal  access to information systems.   Some respondents however also indicated that the existing rules were somewhat too  generic to be applied consistently. This was the case for the legislation in Bulgaria and  Slovakia. In Bulgaria for instance, a challenge is that the concept of a ‘tool’ is not defined in  Bulgarian law (or in EU law). As a result, judges are very careful in applying this concept. It is  thus likely that Bulgarian criminal law will need to be made more explicit to address this  issue before judges are systematically willing to apply/enforce it.   Other countries signalled either no need to update their legislation at all, or only on minor  points (e.g. procurement for use of tools is not yet included in Portuguese law whereas it is  included in the Directive; thus, the law would need to be amended on this point).  The interviewees were also polled on the well-known debate of whether the Directive’s rules were  sufficiently clear to ensure that CERTs, academic researchers, security professionals etc. could  operate lawfully. Whether this is the case or not depends on the interpretation of the Directive’s  language, and specifically on whether the tools are produced, sold,  etc.  ‘without right for the  purpose of committing any of the offences’. Here, there was a distinction between respondent  profiles:   Respondents representing law enforcement or policy makers almost unanimously noted that  this debate was largely academic, and that there were no known cases of actual  unwarranted prosecutions in practice. They were satisfied that the language of the Directive  would be appropriate and sufficient to safeguard lawful activities.   Respondents representing CERTs were less certain: while most were confident that the  provisions would never be applied to them, some still expressed doubts. This was notably  the case in Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. These respondents called for a clearer  confirmation that the normal activities of CERTs, academic institutions, researchers, network  operators and security service professionals would be exempted from the scope of  26  Convention 185 on Cybercrime, Budapest, 23 November 2001:  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  13  application of this provision, as should any actions at the lawful request of businesses,  governments and end users.  A respondent from Ireland also noted a separate concern, namely the involuntary use of such tools,  such as the JS-LOIC tool (a javascript implementation of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon software used to  commit DDoS-attacks). Once integrated on a website, any visitor of that website automatically and  possibly unknowingly participates in a DDoS-attack on a preconfigured target. The provisions on  tools could target unwitting participants in such attacks, since law enforcement and criminal  investigators have no way of distinguishing such unwitting users (who have no criminal intent and  therefore would not be targeted by the criminal provisions of the Directive) from willing participants  (who visit the site with the intent to participate in a DDoS attack and therefore would fall within the  scope of the Directive). The provision could thus be hard to apply in such cases.  Thus, while the purpose-oriented language was seen as positive, more explicit legal carve-outs  (excluding criminal liability for clearly lawful activities) were seen as desirable for some respondents.  Identified good practices 2.4.2  Most countries had directly implemented the legislation already, and notable good practices were  therefore rare. However, the French experiences were instructive: the applicable provision in French  criminal law states that creation, owning, distribution without legal motive is a crime. The  interviewee noted that practical cases on this issue were rare, this is probably because the  Parliament in France explicitly discussed the fact that security and research purposes constituted a  lawful motive for keeping the tools, removing most of the doubt. The uncertainty thus seemed to be  largely theoretical. Cases do still occur, however: in a practical case, a company was prosecuted for  publishing exploits and actual code that allowed their exploitation; this was considered unlawful27.  None the less, the clear Parliamentary debate seemed to have deflected some of the concerns.  Reflections on the findings  2.4.3  27  Criminalités numériques weblog. 2009. ‘Est-il illégal de publier des failles de sécurité?’  http://blog.crimenumerique.fr/2009/12/24/est-il-illegal-de-publier-des-failles-de-securite [Last accessed  0ctober 14, 2013]  Based on the observed feedback, three sets of suggestions could be forwarded which are  based on good practices or suggestions from interviewees:   Firstly, implementing legislation should be clear and explicit, and include clear  carve-outs of the applicability of the provision for the normal activities of  CERTs, academic institutions, researchers, network operators and security  service professionals, and any actions undertaken at the lawful request of  businesses, governments and end users.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  14   The respondent from one of the countr suggested that a pure legislation  based solution would not be ideal, as legislation would never be able to  consider every abstract possibility that might occur in practice. Rather, he  suggested that it should be up to the security community itself to come up  with guidelines and recommendations on how to comply with the law, e.g.  on responsible disclosure. It is not the task of lawmakers or prosecutors to  define all the details through legislation or interpretative documents. This  recommendation should be applied at the international level: it would be  beneficial for the industry and academia itself to formalise its good practices  to remove or at least reduce any sense of unease. That would give judges a  baseline of criteria to appreciate cases.   The Irish respondent suggested that future initiative might further consider  the responsibility and liability of service providers, e.g. operators of  websites which run outdated software with known security vulnerabilities.  The interviewee noted that it could be useful to at least place some degree  of responsibility/liability for damages resulting from the hacking of such  systems with the operators. Irrespective of technical awareness of the  website operator, they should at least have some responsibility for  choosing/maintaining functioning and secure systems. A similar suggestion  of economic incentivisation was provided by the national CERT from  Luxembourg, noting that the original owner of a breached system should  perhaps bear some liability as well, in order to incentivise proper security  practices. Perhaps even financial/fiscal incentives could be considered to  encourage security investments. While technically out of scope of the  implementation of the Directive, the suggestion may still be useful for future  cybersecurity policy actions.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  15  3 Aggravating circumstances in the Directive  3.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  The Directive aims to increase the penalties for certain crimes, and introduced a new set of  aggravating circumstances in order to more effectively address identity theft and botnets.  Specifically:   Under the Framework Decision, the maximum penalty for committing crimes in the  framework of a criminal organization was at least 2-5 years. In the Directive, this is uniformly  set at 5 years, i.e. the upper bound of the previous range. This should increase penalties for  organized criminal activity, and would thus help the fight against criminal gangs engaged in  identity theft or the use of botnets.   The Framework Decision allowed (but did not require) the same penalty (2-5 years) when  the offense caused serious damages or has affected essential interests. The Directive  requires the same uniform (5 year) penalty for the same circumstance, as well as when the  crimes are committed against a critical infrastructure information system.   In addition, a 3 year penalty applies when botnets are used (“where a significant number of  information systems have been affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7,  designed or adapted primarily for that purpose”);   Finally, for identity theft (“by misusing the personal data of another person, with the aim of  gaining the trust of a third party, thereby causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner”),  Member States must ensure that this may be qualified as an aggravating circumstance under  national law.  Given that the increase in maximum penalties is not susceptible to good practices (all penalties are  merely required to be increased when needed, without much margin for creativity), the interviews  mainly focused on provisions and practices in relation to botnets and identity theft. The outcomes  will be briefly discussed below.  3.2 Botnets  Summary of interview outcomes 3.2.1  Under the Directive, Member States are required to ensure that the crimes of illegal system  interference and illegal system access “are punishable by criminal penalties of a maximum term of  imprisonment of at least three years where a significant number of information systems have been  affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7, designed or adapted primarily for that  purpose” (Article 9.3). Thus, botnets are addressed as the outcome of a tool (namely the software  used to take over the systems constituting the botnet) designed to launch attacks via the botnet (‘a  significant number of information systems’).  To identify good practices, interviewees were mainly asked whether their countries had already  implemented legislation addressing botnets (including as an aggravating circumstance), and what  the operational practices in their countries were that could be used as a good practice.  With respect to existing legislation, none of the interviewees indicated that specific legislation had  been adopted in their respective countries to address botnets, either as a separate crime or as an  aggravating circumstance. In practice, botnet attacks are universally dealt with at this time through  existing legislation, such as illegal access (hacking), fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit a crime etc.,  depending on the impact of botnet activity.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  16  In the UK however, existing legislation was amended to ensure that botnets could be  comprehensively addressed, without mentioning or defining botnets precisely: up until 2006,  builders of botnets were clearly committing an offense, but users of botnets (the botnet herders)  weren’t necessarily. Existing provisions focused on unlawful access, and builders (who infected third  party machines) were guilty of that crime. However, botnet herders who launched e.g. DDoS attacks  didn’t fall under this rule. Therefore, changes in the legislation were needed, and separate rules for  (D)DoS attacks were introduced.  Under the amended Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act28, it is  an offence to deliberately or recklessly impair the operation of any computer or program, or  reliability of data, or to prevent or hinder access to data. That includes both the previous offence of  unlawful modification of data, and any additional DoS activities.  Several interviewees expressed concerns or reservations about amending legislation: both Bulgaria  and Luxembourg indicated that botnets would fall under the broader umbrella of unlawful tools, and  that this is a notion that is not very clearly defined under the Directive. For instance, the question  could be presented whether grids29 are also a form of botnet, or peer-to-peer (P2P) networks30, or  partially distributed communication networks such as Skype? There is a clear concern that newer  and more specific legislation could inadvertently create new legal discussions rather than solving  them: the Belgian interviewee noted that the definition in the Directive could actually make it harder  to pursue cases, because defendants might try to argue on technicalities: e.g. what is “a significant  number of information systems”? The inclusion of these criteria in the law could actually have an  adverse effect of giving defendants new elements to attack in their prosecution. Thus, any new  legislation should be implemented only if strictly necessary to achieve the objectives of the  Directive, and would need to be sufficiently precise to avoid creating new loopholes.  With respect to operational practices, the feedback provided by the interviewees was more  substantive and contained useful guidance from the perspective of CERTs, law enforcement bodies,  data protection supervisors and policy makers:   CERTs often face the practical challenge of what they are allowed to do in case of botnet  incidents. Some CERTs note that they did not report incidents to law enforcement  proactively, leaving this up to the victims, whereas others would inform law enforcement  themselves independent of any complaints. Taking forceful action by disconnecting infected  systems was only done by CERTs that had been explicitly authorised to supervise and police  well-defined networks, such as academic or military CERTs for their own academic or  military networks, and only on a limited scale. Outside of that specific context, CERTs can  only provide recommendations to network operators on how to address incidents, which  the operators could then choose to follow on a voluntary basis. However, such CERTs cannot  28  Police and Justice Act, 2006: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/48/section/36 [Last accessed 14  October, 2013]; and see Computer Misuse Act 1990:  http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/computer_misuse_act_1990/#an09 [Last accessed 14 October, 2013] for  guidance on its interpretation and application.  29  Grid computing can be defined as a system that coordinates resources that are not subject to centralized  control, using standard, open, general-purpose protocols and interfaces to deliver nontrivial qualities of  service.

Standard procedures for dealing with botnets are generally not  available.   Law enforcement bodies noted that they generally took a passive role, as active monitoring  of networks was either not legally possible or created privacy concerns. However, they  signalled that many operators (network operators or website operators) do monitor their  own networks, but are often uncertain as to what they can legally do when they see  anomalous behaviour. Passing on information to law enforcement causes them concern,  because it would require an acknowledgement that they monitor and analyse their users.  Even if this is only done to identify and address incidents, it could still give rise to privacy  concerns. For the identification of command & control nodes in a botnet, this means that  the information is often available, but operators are reluctant to hand it to law enforcement  bodies without a court order, due to privacy compliance concerns. De facto, that means that  botnet incidents can go unreported: operators are unwilling to risk the publicity of filing a  report and are content if an incident can be resolved quietly, and law enforcement is  typically unaware of incidents unless it is reported.   In some cases, botnets have been addressed through joint coordinated action between law  enforcement, CERTs and the private sector. Responses on such actions are positive,  although law enforcement bodies stress the need for their involvement. A concern has been  noted that solo-actions from the private sector (including private CERTs, security companies  etc.) without the backing of law enforcement may be effective in shutting down isolated  incidents, but ultimately leave criminals unharmed and free to resume their activities. Such  actions can furthermore harm ongoing investigations, as crucial data might be destroyed or  corrupted, making it unusable as evidence in potential criminal proceedings.   In international botnet cases, it is worth noting that the feedback universally indicated that  CERTs frequently interacted with other foreign CERTs and occasionally with foreign  operators, but virtually31 never directly with foreign law enforcement bodies. In such  international botnet cases, CERTs would work exclusively with their own national law  enforcement bodies, or would attempt to resolve the attack without involving law  enforcement at all.   As was already well established through prior studies, data sharing between operators,  CERTs and law enforcement is problematic due to data protection concerns. The  interpretation that an IP address is always personal data was mentioned as an anomaly that  raised constant issues of compliance even in the absence of significant privacy risks. E.g. if a  software company sent out a list of IP addresses that are seemingly infected with a virus  within the Zeus botnet, then the CERT felt that it would have to file notifications with its  data protection authority; the same would apply of this information was then sent on by the  CERT to ISPs. This example provided by an operational CERT, whether correct or not, shows  the need for guidance on this point. Some good practices have been observed however that  are used to address or mitigate this problem.   CERTs occasionally but not systematically work closely with data protection authorities  and/or telecommunications regulators in their countries. In e.g. the Czech Republic such  contacts were found to be useful to obtain guidance on data protection compliance. In other  countries, contacts with supervisors were limited due to the perceived lack of competences  or resources with these bodies.   A frequently related frustration from the side of CERTs was that information exchanges with  law enforcement tend to be unidirectional: from CERT to law enforcement, but rarely the  31  In a rare number of instances, CERTs reported working directly with foreign law enforcement, such as the  FBI.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  18  other way around. This is known and understood to be necessary to protect the secrecy of  ongoing investigations. However, it would still be useful to CERTs if investigators could  inform them of steps taken and expected future actions at a high level, without going into  specific details in a case, merely to know what (if anything) happened and to see how CERTs  could streamline their activities and improve their usefulness.  Identified good practices 3.2.2  With respect to legislation, only one country (the UK) had modified its legislation to ensure that  botnets could be addressed. As noted above, an update in 2006 was deemed to be necessary to  ensure that botnet herders who used a botnet without necessarily having infected any machines  themselves could also be prosecuted. This can be considered a good practice, as it covered a  legislative gap through generic language: it became an offence to deliberately or recklessly impair  the operation of any computer or program, or reliability of data, or to prevent or hinder access to  data. The provision also avoided the pitfall of introducing new technology specific concepts.  On the operational front, several good practices have been observed that could serve as examples  for other countries:   For CERTs, the definition of a clear mandate is crucial:  o Private CERTs and academic CERTs benefit from implementing clear agreements  with their constituency that define precisely what their remit and competences are.  This was e.g. observed in the UK through Janet, which can intervene within the  networks that it supervises (principally university networks), on the basis of the  policy agreements that it has concluded with the network operators. Principal  responsibility still lies with the universities, since they are the only ones who know  exactly what the impact of interventions will be.  o Public CERTs benefit from a clear legal framework that grants them clear authorities  and powers. For instance, the Swedish MilCERT has a clear legal mandate  established by law, and Swedish law requires public authorities to cooperate with  each other in the investigation of incidents. This can often facilitate interactions  between the CERT and law enforcement.   The Dutch national CERT noted the importance of working in partnership with  representatives of key sectors, including a number of large telcos and banks. This  partnership includes frequent meetings that allow all stakeholders – law enforcement,  CERTs and private companies – to identify and address issues that the private sector  faces through an ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center).   International cooperation with other CERTs is supported by the Trusted Introducer and  FIRST networks. Among others, the Romanian CERT-RO noted that these were  considered to be trust frameworks, since all member CERTs have to sign certain  paperwork and accept certain obligations.   To facilitate data sharing between operators, CERTs and law enforcement, it is worth  noting that no country reported having received clear guidance from data protection  authorities on how to comply with data protection law. It should however also be noted  that the Greek DPA that was interviewed indicated that it had not received any requests  on this point, and that it would be open to providing constructive advice, which it  believed would not be prohibitive. Positive experiences were reported notably in  Slovenia. After a recent DoS attack, the national CERT published an advisory for ISPs on  how to proceed, including a recommendation to conduct some network monitoring and  traffic analysis. This advisory resulted in a critical comment via Twitter, stating that this  advice was illegal as a violation of Slovenian data protection law. The CERT retweeted  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  19  this message to the Information Commissioner, who replied – also via Twitter – that it  considered such monitoring and analysis to be lawful and proportionate to the danger  that such an attack could cause, as the law could not be reasonably expected to define  every possible hypothesis in which data would need to be processed. This was useful,  because it resulted in a quick, public and highly visible communication towards CERTs,  ISPs and the Internet community.  More generally, the CERT noted that it was very  aware of the need to explain carefully what analysis they do and why, as this  proportionality and transparency is important to keep trust of their stakeholders. In case  of grey areas, the CERT maintains a good relationship with the Information  Commissioner to obtain quick advice when needed. This was noted to be important to  keep the trust of the community.   When addressing botnets, most CERTs lacked any standardised process or playbook for  taking appropriate action to respond to botnets, and decided on this on a case by case  basis. The Romanian CERT however noted that there was a standard procedure for  responding to botnets, which is followed in each case to ensure that all incidents are  handled in the same manner. Similarly, the French Gendarmerie reported that they are  currently devising a standard procedure for basic malware distribution (small botnets).  The idea is to help others through improved international cooperation: the collected  information could be proactively shared with international law enforcement partners.  The strategy will also include procedures for dealing with assistance requests from ISPs  or from CERTS (in France and abroad), and also push the collected information via  Europol to other countries (third countries, including Russia, Ukraine, etc.).  Reflections on the findings 3.2.3  Based on the analysis and good practice discussed above, a number of suggestions can  be derived.  With respect to legislation, given the concerns outlined above, it seems advisable to  assess whether new legislation is necessary to achieve the effects of the Directive  under existing law, and if so, to implement the required changes through generic and  technology neutral language. This would achieve the desired outcome of fighting  botnets, while avoiding the risk of putting in place language that creates new technical  discussions on what constitutes a botnet, and whether the thresholds for botnet  prosecution have been cleared. The example of the UK is instructive in that respect.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  20  Operationally, one of the main challenges is that most CERTs have no guidelines on  how botnets can be dealt with. Standardised guidance on this point, preferable on  at least the EU level, would be useful, e.g. covering the questions that CERTs would  need to ask, what information and recommendations they should provide, and what  could proportionately and lawfully be done. This would also be useful to strengthen  the image and perceived effectiveness of CERTs (and law enforcement) for criminals.  This guidance would also need to take into account the different mandates and  tasks that CERTs may have: private CERTs can benefit from contractual agreements  with their constituency as seen in the good practices noted above, whereas public  CERTs benefit from a clear relationship with law enforcement bodies (either by  liaising systematically, or by the integration of seconded law enforcement officials).  The mandate of CERTs needs to be clearly defined, taking into account the  consequences of any choices made in this respect. Private CERTs can benefit from  legal agreements with their main constituency, which can serve as a legal basis for  data sharing and which can limit the responsibilities and liabilities of the CERT. Public  CERTs can benefit from a mandate established by law that defines their  responsibilities and competences; however, their position is made more delicate  because of the need to keep the functions of CERTs and law enforcement separate.  While a close integration of CERTs and law enforcement has clear efficiency benefits,  it also means that network operators and service providers may become less willing  to share information with a CERT, due to the concern that the CERT will not only  serve its traditional ‘fire brigade’ role, but also contribute to initiating legal  proceedings. The latter may be beneficial from a public policy perspective, but can  be (perceived as) highly negative for service providers, since they lose the option of  informally consulting the CERT. Thus, if the latter approach is chosen, additional  effort will be required to set up a trust relationship with the constituency of the  public CERT.  To effectively address botnet crime, joint coordinated actions between law  enforcement, CERTs and the private sector (such as network operators) are  recommended. CERTs and the private sector should avoid taking actions without law  enforcement support, as this might solve a single attack but ultimately leaves the  criminals unharmed. The recent case of the b54 botnet operation was mentioned as  a good practice example, where Microsoft was able to work with the FBI to shut  down the Citadel botnet1. Linked to this, the organisation of frequent meetings that  allow all stakeholders – law enforcement, CERTs and private companies – to  identify and address issues that the private sector faces through an ISAC  (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) has been found to be effective, as seen in  the Dutch experiences.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  21  3.3 Identity Theft  Summary of interview outcomes  3.3.1  Under the Directive, Member States are required to “take the necessary measures to ensure that  when [the crimes of illegal system access or illegal system interference] are committed by misusing  the personal data of another person, with the aim of gaining the trust of a third party, thereby  causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner, this may, in accordance with national law, be  regarded as aggravating circumstances, unless those circumstances are already covered by another  offence, punishable under national law.” (Article 9.5). Thus, identity theft is defined in terms of two  constituent elements: misuse of personal data to gain the trust of a third party, prejudice to the  rightful identity owner.  To identify good practices, interviewees were mainly asked whether their countries had already  implemented legislation addressing identity theft (including as an aggravating circumstance), and  what the operational practices in their countries were that could be used as a good practice.  Additionally, they were also queried on how one might determine concealment of the real identity  of the perpetrator against the lawful use of pseudonyms, alter egos, avatars, usernames, or  anonymisation software, and on the determination of prejudice taking into account individual  sensitivity, satire, parody, freedom of speech rights, etc.  To facilitate cooperation between CERTs at the international level (including for  botnet incidents), the Trusted Introducer and FIRST networks act as strong enablers  which generally meet with highly positive feedback from CERTs. Membership of  these networks is thus strongly recommended.  It would be advisable to examine how feedback could be provided from law  enforcement to CERTs on any matters reported by the CERT or in which the CERT  intervened. To protect the secrecy of ongoing investigations, such information could  only be provided at the aggregate (non-case specific) level.  Finally, with respect to data sharing, pragmatic guidance at the EU level, e.g. from  the Article 29 Working Party, on the interpretation and impact of data protection  rules for CERTs and network operators in their day-to-day security related activities  is still needed. While the theoretical framework and the potential consequences are  well known, CERTs and service providers are still largely experimenting on what type  of monitoring, analysis and reporting activities are lawful, and which activities are  excessive. This has a stifling effect on the fight against cybercrime. In the absence of  such guidelines, Member States should at a minimum ensure that data protection  authorities at the national level are easily reachable to provide ad-hoc  recommendations. The best practice of Slovenia as reported above can serve as a  useful example of up-to-date, efficient and pragmatic advisory services.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  22  With respect to existing legislation, most countries indicate that they have not adopted any ID theft  specific legislation, and that incidents are addressed through existing generic criminal laws, such as  breaches of telecommunications confidentiality laws, fraud, illegal access/hacking, interfering with  computer systems, illegal interception, etc., depending on the circumstances. In rarer cases, the  applicability of data protection law is signalled, as are possible civil law qualifications (such as  violation of personality rights).  However, a smaller number of countries have reported specific legal initiatives. In Italy, legislation is  currently under discussion in Parliament, which introduces ID theft as an independent crime,  qualifying it as impersonation if there is an intent to gain a profit or to harm the identity owner. The  integration of this intent was seen generally as useful to avoid abuses. The Italian proposal remains  however subject to significant debate, and its chances of adoption are unclear.  In France, a specific provision was introduced in 2011 that covered cases of ID theft that were not  clearly covered by adequate criminal law before. Before 2011, ID theft was an offence only when it  would put a victim in a position of possibly being accused of committing an offence (also including  abuse of titles or functions, e.g. pretending to be a policeman to commit an offence was already  covered). The new legislation covers usurping the identity of a third person or to make use of one or  more data allowing the identification of that person, with a view to damage the tranquillity of  someone else, or to harm the honour or standing of that person. The law explicitly states that the  law also applies when committed on a public communication network (i.e. the Internet).  The main debate on the ID theft provision in France remains whether this opposes any right to  parody, or comic use of someone’s identity (freedom of speech). The Parliament has stated that  these rights should remain respected, so that judges need to consider this balance in actual cases.  The provision specifically aims to apply when people’s identity was being used on online forums, or  when their identity was abused by others to make people look bad.  With respect to operational practices, it is worth noting that both law enforcement and CERTs stress  the importance of good interactions with service providers such as social network sites or hosting  companies in addressing simple identity theft cases effectively. In more complex fraud cases  (including spear phishing in the financial services sector), both stakeholders noted the importance of  frequent contacts with sector specific organisations in order to rapidly disseminate information on  identified threats. Awareness raising is still seen as the primary tool in fighting identity theft, as the  main cause of successful identity theft cases is still the uninformed and insecure behaviour of end  users.  For less technically complex cases (e.g. creating Facebook under someone else’s name), a number of  countries noted the supporting role of data protection authorities, as such incidents could be  prosecuted as a violation of data protection law. The Greek DPA affirmed that a few such cases have  been brought before it, likely as a result of opinions published by the DPA on the topic. The DPA is  seen by many citizens as a lower threshold contact point that can then help them to contact the  service provider (e.g. Facebook) or by referring them to another competent DPA (e.g. the Irish DPA  in case of Facebook). Bigger cases would be addressed by law enforcement.  With respect to concealment of identities (an issue that would not be covered by the Directive’s  provisions, as they focus on the misuse of another person’s personal data), most respondents noted  that they do not consider the use of pseudonyms or anonymization networks as problematic in their  own rights, nor as indicative of any problem that makes a qualification as identity theft significantly  greater. However, it is interesting to note that at least three respondents (in France, in Slovenia and  in the Netherlands) saw a concern from the opposite angle: they noted that law enforcement  officials had no competences to use anonymisation technologies themselves, and that this was a real  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  23  need to enable them to take effective action. As this issue is outside the scope of the Directive, it will  not be examined further in this report.  Finally, with respect to determining prejudice, all interviewees were asked how grey area cases  (pseudonyms, joke accounts on Facebook, parody etc.) were addressed, and notably whether the  prejudice criterion was applied in practice. Interviewees almost unanimously noted that such cases  occurred with relative frequency, but that they were themselves rarely involved. This is likely  because the majority of interviewees were CERTs or law enforcement bodies: CERTs would not  generally be implicated in such technologically simple and relatively benign cases; and law  enforcement bodies would generally not be responsible for the assessment of prejudice, as this  would be done at a later stage by courts in case of prosecution.  Practically speaking, if any actions would be undertaken against these types of files, the interviewees  indicated that this would generally be done by the victims contacting service providers directly to  voluntarily take action, or by civil claims before civil courts. Criminal case law for such cases was  therefore noted to be extremely limited.  Identified good practices 3.3.2  Most of the good practices that were already described in the preceding sections on botnets also  apply to identity theft. However, several additional good practices can be found in the interview  outcomes.  On the legislative front, the primary good practices are the Italian example that emphasise the  intent to cause harm as a precondition for criminalisation, and the French example that was more  broadly phrased but benefited from discussions in Parliament that emphasized the importance of  respecting freedom of expression. Both of these elements (intent and freedom of expression) are  vital for the correct functioning of ID theft legislation.  Operationally, several respondents indicated that smaller ID theft cases in which no significant  interests were involved could often be addressed effectively by requesting appropriate interventions  (typically deletion of the offending materials) by the service providers themselves, as the use of false  identities in an attempt to cause harm to a third party is usually a violation of terms of service.  Reflections on the findings  3.3.3  With respect to implementing legislation, it will be important for national laws to stress  the importance of the criminal intent of the alleged ID thief, and to emphasse that the  provisions should be interpreted and applied taking into account the legitimate  exercise of the fundamental right to freedom of expression. It would not be feasible or  desirable to enumerate cases covered by this fundamental right (such as parody, satire,  societal criticism, polemic discussion, etc.), but the primacy of this fundamental right  should be recognized in order to support the development of rational and consistent  case law. Legal intervention on this point should thus be well considered. The  interpretation of this balance between criminal conduct and controversial but legal free  speech should be left to the courts; CERTs should at any rate not play a role in assessing  the balance.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  24  As noted above, ID theft cases could often be solved by requesting service providers  to take voluntary action, such as removal of the offending materials from any public  website. This approach is often more efficient than formal legal proceedings.  However, such requests must be carefully phrased in order to minimise the impact  on potential future proceedings. Deletion could result in the destruction of evidence,  making future legal actions against criminals impossible or at least substantially  harder. For this reason, information should be made inaccessible rather than deleting  it, unless it has been determined with a sufficient degree of certainty that no future  criminal or civil actions will be undertaken.  Linked to this, and similar to the recommendation with respect to botnets noted  above, the organisation of frequent meetings that allow all stakeholders – law  enforcement, CERTs and private companies – to identify and address issues that the  private sector faces through an ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) can be  effective. This is notably useful to proactively identify and address commonly recurring  ID theft attacks, such as spear phishing in the financial services industry.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  25  4 Cooperation and information exchange procedures in the Directive  4.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  With respect to procedural revisions, arguably the most significant improvements in the Directive  relate to information exchange and data collection. The Framework Decision merely specified that  Member States should “make use of the existing network of operational points of contact available  24 hours a day and seven days a week”, in accordance with data protection rules, and that Member  States should inform the General Secretariat of the Council and the Commission of its appointed  point of contact.  The tasks of the Member States on this point are significantly clarified in the new Directive. On the  exchange of information, the existing obligations are retained, and a response time obligation is  added: Member States should implement the necessary procedures to respond within a maximum  of eight hours to urgent requests. Such responses “shall at least indicate whether and in what form  the request for help will be answered and when”; thus, substantive responses are not necessarily  required in this initial response.  In the sections below, we will briefly examine the feedback from the interviewees with respect to  this update.  Summary of interview outcomes  4.1.1  Given that the obligation relates to information exchanges organised between investigative  authorities in the different Member States, the question was primarily relevant for representatives  of law enforcement bodies.  CERT interviewees on the other hand noted that they were generally able to exchange information  relatively quickly and flexibly between each other, as their interactions typically wouldn’t require  compliance with procedural law obligations, nor would their information exchanges necessarily  result in legal action. For more formal assistance requests, the CERTs generally indicated that they  only worked with law enforcement bodies in their own countries and would prefer to keep it this  way, since this simplifies trust and legal compliance.  Several CERTs (including e.g. from the UK) indicated a preference for keeping technical investigation  and legal investigations separate whenever possible, since the former (mainly between CERTs, but  also the flow of intelligence between CERTs and law enforcement) is significantly quicker and easier  than the latter (involving evidence, rather than intelligence). Intelligence and evidence should be  kept separate. A similar perspective was noted by the Slovenian CERT, indicating that CERTs could  occasionally act as rapid intelligence collectors at the request of law enforcement, who could then  use this intelligence to determine whether formal evidence would be needed. This difference in  focus is also why CERTs are not highly in favour of further regulation of CERT activities: this would  make the CERTs a separate flavour of police/law enforcement with the same disadvantages and the  same impact on their communicative efficiency. The non-legal route enabled by CERTs is sometimes  more effective, and regulation wouldn’t necessarily help them. Regulation could turn the non-legal  route into an illegal route.  As the obligation of the Directive would not formally apply to CERTs, the primary feedback was  obtained from law enforcement bodies, and CERT suggestions are not discussed in further detail  below.  Most of the law enforcement interviewees noted some reservations with respect to the Directive:  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  26   They acknowledged that the 8 hour time limit for responses to urgent requests was  generally feasible.   However, they stressed that – as permitted by the Directive – such quick responses were not  likely to be very substantive or useful to the party making the requests, as material help (e.g.  the identification of a subscriber behind an IP address) would take 24-36 hours at the most  optimistic end of the spectrum, with some respondents noting that a response time of a  week or more was more realistic. This was mainly due to the need to follow formal judicial  aid request procedures, and the requirement to obtain national court orders before any ISP  or other service provider could be required to hand over certain information.   Contacts are generally organised bilaterally (based on existing judicial assistance  agreements, and via legal aid requests through ministries of justice when necessary), or via  Europol and Interpol. The main difficulty in international collaboration (including within  Europe) is drafting the requests, which must be translated and put into a legally valid  format; this takes time and resources, even for relatively basic types of information.  Streamlining of these processes is seen as useful, although the French interviewee  questioned whether this was an appropriate topic for a cybercrime oriented initiative: policy  makers should be working on better processes and better mechanisms within Europol for  cooperation in general, i.e. in all criminal cases. Cybercrime specific rules and response  obligations therefore did not seem to be necessary, according to the interviewee.   Finally, as was noted by the interviewee from the Netherlands, the existence of a single  national high tech crime unit is highly beneficial to streamline communications: in  decentralised countries or countries with multiple contact points, information exchange  doesn’t always work well because a foreign body cannot determine reliably who should be  contacted. In principle, every country should have a single contact point; they can then  delegate any requests as necessary according to internal policy rules and principles.  Identified good practices 4.1.2  Good practices were relatively rare as most respondents indicated their basic requirement of  complying with formal rules without much margin for innovation or creativity. None the less, a few  interesting examples could be noted.  In the French Gendarmie, a current ongoing project is aiming to devise a standard procedure to  proactively address basic malware distributions (small botnets). This will fit into a more general  strategy being created right now, looking at any cases where infrastructure in France is used to  commit a crime, even if there are no known victims in France. The idea is to help others through  improved international cooperation: the collected information could be proactively shared with  international law enforcement partners. This strategy would need to be tested in a number of  cases; presently the idea is still in its early stages. The strategy will also include procedures for  dealing with assistance requests from ISPs or from CERTS (in France and abroad), and will include  proactively pushing the collected information via Europol to other countries (third countries,  including Russia, Ukraine, etc.). This approach which is currently being contemplated by the French  authorities would represent a paradigm shift from a responsive to a proactive model, which would  additionally include international non-European partners. Given that these countries are often  more likely to host criminals taking advantage of bullet proof hosting services, this will be crucial to  improve the effectiveness of anti-cybercrime measures.  The interviewee from Belgium noted that, for assistance requests sent via Europol/Interpol, the  possibility exists to append codes to the information requests that indicate which information may  be disseminated to other contact points. This is a minor but useful standardisation mechanism that  can be very effective to identify contacts and obtain their collaboration.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  27  Formal assistance networks are however not the only or even the most effective way to achieve  international cooperation. Several respondents – including e.g. in Bulgaria – noted that the  organisation of face-to-face meetings between law enforcement representatives outside of the EU  (e.g. non-EU Southeast European countries) was an important enabler, as cooperation with non-EU  countries can be more complicated and personal contacts can greatly facilitate effective  interactions. A similar concern was echoed by France: generally, criminals hide in countries where  it’s difficult to co-operate, and this is an issue that the Directive doesn’t really address. In Europe,  cooperation via Europol is often easier than with non-EU countries, and the EC3 is a positive  development on that front. In other countries, experiences vary: there have been good examples in  France recently of co-operation with the Ivory Coast.  Finally, legal compliance in international information exchanges is a clear concern with CERTs, or at  least it is within Portugal. Within the Portuguese CERT, data protection guidelines and standard  policies have been drafted that determine when/which data can be shared. These policies are  reviewed and policed by the CERT’s own lawyers and are discussed with the data protection  authority.  Reflections on the findings 4.1.3  With a view of streamlining international information exchanges, several  recommendations could be identified from the interviewees’ replies:   A number of respondents (e.g. Belgium and Bulgaria) noted that, even within  the EU, replies to information requests were often delayed or partial, which  can halt investigations. The reasons included lack of trust, but also  misunderstandings with respect to the scope of requests, rather than  resources or language barriers. Streamlining/standardisation of  communications between the 24/7 network might be useful, which could be  done by establishing templates for the most common information requests.   As illustrated by the French best practice discussed above, it may be worth  coupling the reactive information sharing model espoused by the Directive  with a more proactive information sharing strategy in which collected  information could be proactively shared with international law enforcement  partners.   Specifically with respect to CERTs, it was noted that there are no standard  approaches/protocols to check whether there are any on-going investigations  in other countries. This is inefficient, because incidents, attacks or  vulnerabilities are often known to several national CERTs who are all working  on them, without knowing that colleagues in other countries are also  collecting relevant information. An EU level information site (like a storm  center) for CERTs/law enforcement to share such information would be  useful in order to avoid duplication of investigative efforts.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  28   International cooperation outside of the EU should also be supported through  face-to-face meetings between law enforcement representatives, as a key first  step to building trust and identifying effective contacts.   Finally, every country should have a single contact point for information  requests, irrespective of their national competences or organisational model.  The contact point can then delegate any requests as necessary according to  internal policy rules and principles, but this internal back office process should  be irrelevant and invisible to foreign law enforcement bodies.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  29  5 Data collection and reporting in the Directive  5.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  As a final new point, the Directive contains obligations on monitoring and statistics. Member States  would be required to implement a system for the recording, production and provision of statistical  data on the offences in the Directive, including at a minimum the number of offences and their  follow-up, and indicating on an annual basis the number of reported cases investigated, the number  of persons prosecuted, and the number of persons convicted. This data should be reported to the  Commission and published in a statistical report.  5.2 Data collection  Summary of interview outcomes  5.2.1  Responses from the interviewees indicated that data collection was subject to a number of  complexities, related primarily to the fragmentation of information sources. Depending on the  country, up to five distinct information sources could be identified: CERTs, supervisory bodies, law  enforcement bodies, public prosecutors and courts. The logical structure and semantics of their  databases (if present) generally could not be assumed to be built on the same assumptions: the  qualification given to an incident by a CERT (if any) would not necessarily be retained by  investigators, nor by prosecutors, or ultimately by courts.  It is of particular interest in this respect that several interviewees noted the importance of breach  notification obligations, e.g. in the context of the telecommunications sector, the financial services  industry or in the recently proposed Directive on Network and Information Security, as an additional  tool for creating a more substantive and comprehensive knowledge base on major ICT incidents and  their apparent impact. Of course, these notifications would not be inherently sufficient to provide  the data required by the Directive on Attacks against Information Systems (as they are not  specifically linked to the criminal qualifications presented in the Directive), but they could ultimately  contribute to forming a more comprehensive ecosystem of incident related data.  Responses also indicated a reluctance towards the comprehensiveness of this data collection  effort: while some countries indicated that they could indeed identify prosecutions and convictions  for the incidents enumerated in the Directive, they none the less cautioned that some cases could be  given a qualification that did not match the provisions of the Directive. E.g. a case of spear phishing  might ultimately be prosecuted simply as fraud and result in a conviction on this basis, despite the  fact that this might clearly qualify as identity theft as described above.  Additionally, interviewees cautioned against the known ‘dark number’ problem, i.e. the known fact  that cybercrime is very significantly underreported32, especially when incidents are committed  against reputation-sensitive victims such as banks, who have an incentive to see incidents solved  without formal investigation or prosecution, as these could result in greater visibility and thus  greater reputational damage. Thus, statistical data could be useful to show trends, but would be  entirely unsuitable to assess the actual scope of cybercrime problems.  32  Discussed e.g. in the Council of the European Union’s Note of 20 September 2013 on the Implementation EU  Policy cycle for organised and serious international crime: Multi-Annual Strategic Plan (MASP) related to the  EU crime priority \"cybercrime\"; see http://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/sep/eu-council-cosi-masp-2014- 2017-cybercrime-12759-rev3-13.pdf [Last accessed 22 October, 2013], p.2  http://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/sep/eu-council-cosi-masp-2014-2017-cybercrime-12759-rev3-13.pdf http://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/sep/eu-council-cosi-masp-2014-2017-cybercrime-12759-rev3-13.pdf  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  30  Finally, the respondents noted that statistics would measure identical facts differently in different  countries: the aforementioned case of spear phishing could be prosecuted as fraud in one Member  State and as identity theft in another, despite having the exact same factual background. Thus,  statistics would not be comparable between countries, in the absence of a common EU level  prosecutorial approach.  Despite this apparent scepticism, some good practices and suggestions have also been identified, as  will be briefly discussed below.  Identified good practices 5.2.2  Within some countries, data collection has been successful in specific context, and/or projects are  ongoing to improve and streamline data collection:   In Ireland, data collection within the financial sector works relatively effectively: there is an  information sharing platform for this sector where incident reports can be exchanged. This  operates as a trusted network and a relatively closed environment, where there is less fear  of publicity leaks. Similarly, gathering data from businesses is more complex than from  citizens, because they have a greater commercial risk linked to openness. Collecting data  from incidents that target citizens might be easier (spam, phishing, identity theft), given that  this fear is less present, and this could have the benefit of increasing awareness among  citizens.   Romania notes that it faces the same challenges as most other countries: data collection is  done systematically by the police, but the data is not always published. Prosecution data is  also available and held by prosecutors. However, there is currently a project on-going  between the police and prosecutors to bundle this information into joint statistics. There is  no public data available yet right now, but the project should be completed by the end of  the year, and statistics should be available at that time. Bundling data from all sources –  CERT, police, prosecutors and courts – would be a good practice.   Data collection is done systematically in France, at least for those specific crimes  enumerated in the current Directive. For cybercrime offenses outside of that (e.g. fraud  committed using a computer/via the Internet), statistics are not available because there is  no specifically defined infraction for fraud on the Internet in French law, so that no separate  convictions on this point are available (only for fraud in general). There are however  numbers for investigations and convictions in 2011 for the crimes in the Directive.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  31  Reflections on the findings 5.2.3  5.3 Reporting  Summary of interview outcomes  5.3.1  As noted in the sections above, some countries have an information source in place, and some of  these publish periodic statistical reports. However, it is relatively rare that a single coordinated  report is published containing information from all stakeholders (law enforcement, prosecutors,  courts, etc.). Furthermore, reports are sometimes only made available for internal use, and not  shared with the public.  In the sections below, we will identify some of the main reporting practices.  Identified good practices  5.3.2  Several countries have indicated that reports are already made publicly available on-line:   In Belgium, statistics are published to some extent, although separately for the police and  for courts. See e.g. http://www.polfed- fedpol.be/pub/rapport_activites/crimestats2011_nl.php (p.55) for the police’s cybercrime  statistics and http://www.om-mp.be/sa/jstat2011/n/home.html for the Ministry of Justice’s  statistics.   As also noted above, data collection is done systematically in France, at least for those  specific crimes enumerated in the Directive. There are numbers for investigations and  convictions in 2011 , and a new report will in principle be released in the course of 2013 by  In countries which have multiple information sources (and the interview outcomes  suggest that all Member States are in this situation) a coordinating body would need  to be designated to collect comparable information and to draft reports.  The existing and emerging legal frameworks for breach notification obligations offer a  unique opportunity for establishing a more comprehensive and coordinated  ecosystem of incident related data. While breach notifications do not contain direct  information on the legal qualification of incidents, nor on their prosecution or the  outcome thereof, it can be reasonably foreseen that at least a number of notifications  will be a trigger for cybercrime investigations, prosecutions and possibly convictions.  The processes for handling breach notifications should thus be aligned with the  terminology and approach envisaged by the Directive to facilitate the collection of  comparable European statistical data.  In the longer term, better alignment is needed with respect to semantics and  prosecutorial policies across the EU, at least if the goal is to obtain comparable  statistics across the EU. If the goal is merely to be able to assess cybercrime trends at  the national level without EU scale comparisons, then such alignment is not strictly  needed.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  32  the ONDRP (French criminal statistics agency - Observatoire national de la délinquance et  des réponses pénales): see http://www.inhesj.fr/fr/ondrp/les-publications/rapports-annuels.  Recommendations for the implementation 5.3.3  As with the data collection recommendation above, for reporting purposes too it would  be necessary to designate a coordinating body to collect comparable information and  to draft reports, and it would be necessary to improve alignment with respect to  semantics and prosecutorial policies across the EU, at least if the goal is to obtain  comparable reports across the EU. If the goal is merely to be able to assess cybercrime  trends at the national level without EU scale comparisons, then such alignment is not  strictly needed.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  33  6 Conclusions – good practices and open issues  6.1 Good practices for the implementation of the Directive  As shown in the analysis above, many of the new topics introduced by the Directive have already  been addressed in some countries through good practices. These are briefly summarised in the table  below, which can be used as a tool to support implementation activities in the Member States.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  34  Topic  Observed good practice  Country or organisation where the practice  was observed  All substantive criminal provisions (illegal access, illegal  interception, tools for committing offenses)  The publication of guidance on the interpretation and  application of the law, and particularly on the element of  intent (i.e. the unlawfulness – without right). This can be done  in the form of prosecution guidelines in countries that permit  this, and/or in the form of jurisprudence overviews to show  how courts apply the law in reality. Guidance should also  explicitly cover conduct that is considered lawful, such as the  activities of CERTs or security professionals.  UK, Sweden and Portugal  All substantive criminal provisions (illegal access, illegal  interception, tools for committing offenses)  Implementing legislation should be clear and explicit, and  include clear carve-outs of the applicability of the provision  for the normal activities of CERTs, academic institutions,  researchers, network operators and security service  professionals, and any actions undertaken at the lawful  request of businesses, governments and end users.  France (carve-outs not included in legislation, but  explicitly discussed in Parliamentary discussions)  Botnets & identity theft Implementing legislation should avoid using technology  specific terminology. It should focus on the exact harm that  technologically enabled crimes cause. E.g. rather than  introduce the concept of botnets or DDoS attacks, UK  legislation was amended to make it an offence to deliberately  or recklessly impair the operation of any computer or  program, or reliability of data, or to prevent or hinder access  to data. Similarly, French and Italian identity theft initiatives  focus on the intent to cause harm as a precondition for  criminalisation, and emphasise the importance of respecting  freedom of expression.  UK, France, Italy  Botnets & identity theft CERTs can benefit from the development of standardised  processes or playbooks for taking appropriate action to  respond to botnets or incidents of identity theft. These  should e.g. cover the questions that CERTs would need to ask,  what information and recommendations they should provide,  and what could proportionately and lawfully be done by  service providers. This would also be useful to strengthen the  Romania, France  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  35  image and perceived usefulness of CERTs (and law  enforcement) for criminals.  CERT mandates The definition of a clear mandate is crucial: private CERTs and  academic CERTs benefit from implementing clear  agreements with their constituency that define precisely what  their remit and competences are. Public CERTs benefit from a  clear legal framework that grants them clear authorities and  powers.  While a close integration of public CERTs and law  enforcement has efficiency benefits, it also means that  network operators and service providers may become less  willing to share information with a CERT, due to the concern  that the CERT will not only serve its traditional ‘fire brigade’  role, but also contribute to initiating legal proceedings. The  latter may be beneficial from a public policy perspective, but  can be (perceived as) highly negative for service providers,  since they lose the option of informally consulting the CERT.  Thus, if public CERTs are integrated with law enforcement  agencies, additional effort will be required to set up a trust  relationship with the constituency of the public CERT.  UK, Sweden  Cooperation between CERTs and private industry It is crucial for CERTs to work in partnership with  representatives of key sectors, including a large telcos and  banks. This can be done through ISACs (Information Sharing  and Analysis Center), that allow all stakeholders – law  enforcement, CERTs and private companies – to identify and  address issues that they face and establish streamlined  cooperation processes.  Netherlands  Data protection compliance within CERTs CERTs should maintain a close working relationship with their  data protection authorities, in order be able to obtain quick  advice when needed. This was noted to be important to  maintain trust of the CERT constituency (such as ISPs).  Slovenia  Data collection and statistical analysis While statistical data is often available at various levels  (CERTs, police/law enforcement, prosecutors, courts, etc),  coordination and bundling of this data is very rare. A  coordinating body can be designated to collect comparable  information and to draft reports.  Romania (test project to be initiated at the end of  2013)  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  36  6.2 Open issues and possible future actions  Despite the good practices as noted above, there are also a number of areas where further guidance  or follow up actions would be necessary. These are briefly summarised in the table below, which can  be used as a resource for further support actions for each of the stakeholders identified. Topics  already covered by the good practices above were not included further in the table below; however,  it is of course clear that such practices could be the basis for future actions in countries that have not  yet implemented them.  As can be seen, further follow-up activities at the EU level are also proposed, including potential  future actions in which ENISA could play a role, in a logical continuation of its support to the CERT  community in the fight against cybercrime through targeted support activities. In this manner, ENISA  could play a further enabling role in the successful implementation and application of the Directive  on Attacks against Information Systems.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  37  Topic  Recommended future action  Entity responsible for the action  All substantive criminal provisions (illegal access, illegal  interception, tools for committing offenses)  Collection and dissemination of guidance on the  interpretation and application of the law at the EU level  could help to ensure homogeneous application of the law  across the European territory. Guidance should also  explicitly cover conduct that is considered lawful, such as  the activities of CERTs or security professionals.  Could be done by ENISA as a part of its support activities  to CERTs, or by the European Commission as a part of  implementation support activities.  Implementation strategy Member States should assess carefully whether new  legislation is necessary to achieve the effects of the  Directive under existing law, and if so, to implement the  required changes through generic and technology neutral  language. This would achieve the desired outcome while  avoiding the risk of putting in place language that creates  new technical discussions or escape routes for criminal  behaviour.  Member State legislators  Enforcement strategies Joint coordinated actions between law enforcement,  CERTs and the private sector (such as network operators)  are recommended. CERTs and the private sector should  avoid taking actions without law enforcement support, as  this might solve a single attack but ultimately leaves the  criminals unharmed.  Law enforcement, CERTs and private industry  Enforcement strategies Simple cases (e.g. of identity theft) can often be solved by  requesting service providers to take voluntary action,  such as removal of the offending materials from any public  website. This approach is often more efficient than formal  legal proceedings. However, such requests must be  carefully considered in order to minimise the impact on  potential future proceedings. Deletion could result in the  destruction of evidence, making future legal actions  against criminals impossible or at least substantially  harder. For this reason, alignment is needed between  CERTS and law enforcement to agree upon appropriate  action for specific instances, including e.g. determining  when making data inaccessible is more appropriate than  requesting deletion.  Law enforcement and CERTs (depending on the level of  intervention)  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  38  Communication between CERTs and law enforcement It would be advisable to examine how feedback could be  provided from law enforcement to CERTs on any matters  reported by the CERT or in which the CERT intervened. To  protect the secrecy of ongoing investigations, such  information could only be provided at the aggregate (non- case specific) level.  Could be done by ENISA as a part of its support activities  to CERTs, or by the EC3; European alignment on this topic  would be beneficial.  Data protection compliance With respect to data sharing, pragmatic guidance at the  EU level, e.g. from the Article 29 Working Party, on the  interpretation and impact of data protection rules for  CERTs and network operators in their day-to-day security  related activities is still needed. While the theoretical  framework and the potential consequences are well  known, CERTs and service providers are still largely  experimenting on what type of monitoring, analysis and  reporting activities (to customers, CERTs or LEA) are lawful,  and which activities are excessive. This has a stifling effect  on the fight against cybercrime.  Article 29 Working Party  Identity theft National laws should clarify the importance of the criminal  intent of the alleged ID thief, and to stress that the  provisions should be interpreted and applied taking into  account the legitimate exercise of the fundamental right  to freedom of expression. It would not be feasible or  desirable to enumerate cases covered by this fundamental  right (such as parody, satire, societal criticism, polemic  discussion, etc.), but the primacy of this fundamental right  should be recognized in order to support the development  of rational and consistent case law. The interpretation of  the balance between criminal conduct and controversial  but legal free speech should be left to the courts; CERTs  should at any rate not play a role in assessing the balance.  Member State legislators  Assistance requests Even within the EU, replies to information requests were  often delayed or partial. Misunderstandings with respect  to the scope of requests were commonly a part of the  cause. Streamlining/standardisation of communications  between the 24/7 network might be useful, which could  be done by establishing templates for the most common  information requests. For assistance requests sent via  Europol/Interpol, the possibility exists to append codes to  EC3, given its role in EU level cooperation and  coordination  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  39  the information requests that indicate which information  may be disseminated to other contact points. This is a  minor but useful example of a standardisation mechanism  that can be very effective.  International cooperation International cooperation with partners outside of the EU  (e.g. with non-EU Southeast European countries, Asian and  African countries) is still at an immature level. This should  also be supported through face-to-face meetings between  law enforcement representatives, as a key first step to  building trust and identifying effective contacts. This is  important to address current policy gaps: bullet proof  hosting services are a challenge that is currently  unaffected by EU initiatives, as these services are almost  universally established outside the EU.  Law enforcement and CERTs, to be enabled via ENISA or  EC3  National organisation Every country should have a single contact point for  information requests, irrespective of their national  competences or organisational model. The contact point  can then delegate any requests as necessary according to  internal policy rules and principles, but this internal back  office process should be irrelevant and invisible to foreign  law enforcement bodies.  Member States  Data collection and statistical analysis In the longer term, better alignment is needed with  respect to semantics and prosecutorial policies across the  EU, if the goal is to obtain comparable statistics across the  EU. Crimes have different meanings in different countries,  and identical incidents can be qualified differently from  country to country, making statistics incomparable.

In 2010, the European Commission published a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament  and the Council on attacks against information systems1. This proposal was intended to further  streamline the legal framework in the Member States in relation to the definition and punishment of  certain cybercrime incidents, and tackled several challenges which were not adequately dealt with  under prior rules, such as notably the creation, use and dissemination of cybercrime tools, the  penalisation of illegal interception, the use of botnets, and identity theft.  The proposal was adopted by the European Parliament on 22 July 2013 and published in the Official  Journal on 14 August 2013 as Directive 2013/40/EU. The Directive, which Member States will need  to transpose by 4 September 2015, imposes new obligations, tasks and expectations on certain key  stakeholders, including CERTs/CSIRTs, LEAs, security specialists, telecommunications service  providers, etc.  This report serves two major goals, which both aim at supporting CERTs/CSIRTs:   Firstly to provide an analysis of the legal framework created by the Directive, coupled with a  stock taking on relevant existing national activities and good practices;   Secondly, the identification of key areas and, where appropriate, guidelines and  recommendations derived from these good practices  In this manner, the Collection endeavours to be a useful support tool for all stakeholders.  Disclaimer  This document provides background information mainly for the attention and digestion of members  of CERTs in the EU Member States. It aims at explaining the potential outcomes and implications  raised by the new Directive, in order to raise awareness. It by no means aims at giving guidance for  the implementation process directly, but it will hopefully enable key players to make sound decision  based on the information in this Collection.  1  European Commission. 2010.

Furthermore, a series of workshops have been organised10, including in cooperation with Europol,  and will continue to be organised in the future in order to strengthen the effectiveness of CERTs.  The present Study aims to build upon these outputs by examining a new challenge. In 2010 already,  the Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on  attacks against information systems11. This proposal was intended to further streamline the legal  framework in the Member States in relation to the definition and punishment of certain cybercrime  incidents, and tackled several challenges which were not adequately dealt with under prior rules,  2  ENISA overview of support for CERTs: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support [Last accessed  0ctober 14, 2013]  3  ENISA. 2006. ‘A step-by-step approach on how to set up a CSIRT’.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/guide [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  4  Basic set of good practice on how to successfully run a Computer Security and Incident Response team  (CSIRT): http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/guide2  5  ENISA. 2011. ‘A flair for sharing – encouraging information exchange between CERTs’  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing [Last  accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  6  ENISA. 2012. ‘The Fight against Cybercrime Cooperation between CERTs and Law Enforcement Agencies in  the fight against cybercrime’ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against- cybercrime/supporting-fight-against-cybercrime [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  7  ENISA. 2012. ‘Give and Take Good Practice Guide for Addressing Network and Information Security Aspects of  Cybercrime’ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice- guide-for-addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime [Last accessed 0ctober 14,  2013]  8  ENISA National/governmental CERTs - Baseline Capabilities:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  9  ENISA. 2010.

As such, the proposed Directive would also  repeal the existing legal framework at the EU level, specifically the Framework Decision on attacks  against information systems.  The proposal was adopted by the European Parliament on 22 July 2013, and the final text was signed  on 12 August 201312. It was published in the Official Journal on 14 August 2013 as Directive  2013/40/EU13, entering into force on 4 September 2013. The Directive, which Member States will  need to transpose by 4 September 2015, imposes new obligations, tasks and expectations on certain  key stakeholders, including CERTs/CSIRTs, LEAs, security specialists, telecommunications service  providers, etc. These relate mainly to the operation of the existing 24/7 contact points (introducing a  response deadline obligation), improving criminal justice/police cooperation, and the obligation to  strengthen statistical data collection in order to support accountability and rational policy making.  Some of these stakeholders will already have significant experiences on these points and will thus be  likely to satisfy these requirements with relative ease. Others however will not have appropriate  legislation, budget, experience, know-how, operational expertise or technological tools in place, and  could therefore benefit in particular from good practices, including from other Member States.  This Study therefore comprised two main activities to support the implementation process, with  particular view on supporting CERTs:   Firstly the analysis of the legal framework and collection of data on relevant national  activities  and good practices;   Secondly the identification of guidelines and recommendations derived from these good  practices in order to support the Member States and their CERTs.  In the following subsections our approach towards these two activities will be presented.  The Directive and potential challenges  1.1.1  As noted in the introductory section above, Directive 2013/40/EU was already proposed as early as  30 September 2010, and replaces Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA of 24 February 2005  on attacks against information systems14. The new Directive retains most of the key features of the  Framework Decision, but also introduces some new elements.  With respect to substantive criminal law, the Directive retained prior crimes from the Framework  Decision – namely the penalisation of illegal access, illegal system interference and illegal data  interference – but added criminalisation of certain tools for committing offenses, as well as the  notion of ‘illegal interception’. This will help keep EU level legislation in line with other international  cybercrime initiatives, such as the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Convention, also known as the  12  European Parliament. 2013.

The Directive raises the level of criminal penalties to a maximum term of imprisonment of at least  two years. Instigation, aiding, abetting and attempt of those offences will become penalised as well.  Finally, the Directive also introduces new and harmonised rules in relation to certain aggravating  circumstances which result in an increased maximum term of imprisonment of at least five years  (rather than two years, as foreseen by Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA). These aggravating  circumstances again target primarily trends which are increasingly observed in the cybercrime field  over recent years, and specifically include crimes:  (a) committed within the framework of a criminal organisation, as defined in Framework  Decision 2008/841/JHA;  (b) that cause serious damage; or  (c) committed against a critical infrastructure information system.  Similarly, a new aggravating circumstance is introduced for crimes committed by misusing the  personal data of another person, with the aim of gaining the trust of a third party, thereby causing  prejudice to the rightful identity owner, a new provision which aims to tackle identity theft incidents  by treating identity theft as an ancillary aggravating circumstance committed in conjunction with  other crimes, such as fraud, hacking, etc.  Finally, a new substantive criminalisation was introduced in relation to botnets, described as  committing the crimes of illegal system access or illegal system interference “where a significant  number of information systems have been affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7,  designed or adapted primarily for that purpose” (Article 9.3). This new provision aims to more  effectively target botnet operators and/or (Distributed) Denial of Service ((D)DoS) attacks16.  These substantive criminal law provisions, being included in a Directive, require transposition at the  national level. This raises challenges of harmonisation, as divergences in phrasing or interpretation  could lead to gaps in national cybercrime laws. For this reason, it is useful to consult stakeholders on  what they perceive to be the main challenges in the implementation and application of these laws.  This is highly relevant for the Directive, as some of the new provisions are somewhat contentious,  such as e.g. the criminalisation of certain tools, which can be hard to apply considering the  importance of such tools for penetration testing or white hat hacking17, or the provisions on identity  theft, which need to take into account nationally diverging stances on e.g. the permissibility of  parody user accounts and satire (i.e. user accounts created under existing celebrity names that are  used to clearly exaggerated positions that parody or satirize real opinions of the celebrity). Similarly,  15  Convention 185 on Cybercrime, Budapest, 23 November 2001:  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  16  Defined as “ an attack in which one or more machines target a victim and attempt to prevent the victim  from doing  useful work” in IETF RFC 4732; see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4732 [Last accessed 0ctober 22,  2013]  17  Also referred to as ethical hacking, the term generally refers to hacking undertaken without malicious intent  and the particular objective of testing and improving the security of an information system; see e.g.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) and  http://www.eccouncil.org/Certification/certified-ethical-hacker [Last accessed 0ctober 22, 2013]  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4732 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) http://www.eccouncil.org/Certification/certified-ethical-hacker  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  4  the Directive frequently relies on the notion of ‘without right’18, which is a concept that risks being  applied in diverging ways. While some national differences are acceptable and expected (given the  choice of a Directive as a regulatory instrument), alignment through the sharing of good practices is  clearly advisable.  The same observations can be applied to the Directive’s procedural criminal law provisions.  Specifically, the Directive aims to improve European criminal justice/police cooperation by:   strengthening the existing structure of 24/7 contact points, including an obligation to answer  within 8 hours to urgent requests (at least in terms of whether the request will be answered,  and the form and estimated time of the answer);   introducing an obligation to collect basic statistical data on cybercrimes.  While these provisions were already introduced in the 2010 draft, their application in practice will be  strongly affected through more recent policy developments, including the Commission’s recent  Communication on a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) on 28 March 201219. The Centre, which has  started operations in January 201320 following a feasibility study conducted by RAND Europe21, is to  act as the focal point in the fight against cybercrime in the Union, serving four core functions:   it should serve as the European cybercrime information focal point;   it should pool European cybercrime expertise to support Member States;   it should provide support to Member States' cybercrime investigations;   it should become the collective voice of European cybercrime investigators across law  enforcement and the judiciary.  These functions imply that the EC3 could play a supporting role for the Member States, especially in  facilitating their compliance with the procedural obligations imposed on the key stakeholders by the  Directive. It is therefore useful to determine in the context of this study which of the stakeholders  already have the necessary capabilities in places, and which good practices, recommendations or  tips they can provide to their colleagues in other Member States.  Key Stakeholders for the Directive  1.1.2  As noted in the tender specifications, the Directive can have a significant impact on a number of  stakeholders. Obviously, the direct addressees of the Directive are the legislators who will have to  transpose the Directive into national law.  At the more operational level, the transposition will affect the decision and policy making bodies in  EU Member States who are responsible for the establishment and operation of the  national/governmental CERTs, and the national/governmental CERTs themselves. These are most  18  Defined in the Directive as “conduct referred to in this Directive, including access, interference, or  interception, which is not authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or of part of it, or  not permitted under national law”, Article 2 (d).  19  European Commission. 2012.

Apart from the national/governmental CERTs, private CERTs who lack a formal governmental  mandate could also play a significant role in ensuring the correct functioning of key national  communication networks. In the course of their operations, they commonly need to work with  national/governmental CERTs, law enforcement agencies, or other enforcement bodies such as data  protection authorities (DPAs) and telecommunications supervisory bodies. Therefore, they  constitute a group of stakeholders that should be considered as well.  Given the pivotal role that law enforcement will play in the application of national transpositions, it  is important, in order to get the most complete possible picture, to chart in an appropriate manner  the opinions and best practices within national law enforcement bodies, and their current and future  collaboration mechanisms at the cross border level, including via the recently formed EC3, operating  within Europol.  The composition of the stakeholders consulted throughout the data collection reflected this  heterogeneity, covering not only national/governmental CERTs, but also other CERTs, law  enforcement bodies, policy makers and other sectoral supervisory/policing bodies such as DPAs and  telecommunications supervisors. In the methodological sections below, we will explain how this goal  was achieved, and a list of interlocutors will be provided.  1.2 Good Practice Collection  Objectives of the Collection  1.2.1  This Good Practice Collection identifies the potential implications of the Directive on stakeholders as  identified above. Proposals and recommendations to the stakeholders are included in this Collection  when appropriate, based on observed and identified best practices in the Member States, as well as  requests and observations on gaps made by interviewees. Opinions on the above therefore come  directly from the potentially affected stakeholders.  As a practical point to assist in the interpretation of the report, it should be noted that data was  collected and analysed prior to the adoption of the Directive. The questions and analysis below were  therefore conducted on the basis of the draft text of the Directive22, which underwent minor  phrasing/structuring changes during its finalisation. The analysis below has been updated to reflect  the final version of the Directive, and the findings have been validated through a workshop held on  the 4th October in The Hague, The Netherlands, to ensure that they remain relevant. However, some  of the questions below refer to proposed changes that were not ultimately retained in the finalised  Directive; in such cases, this is clearly identified in the analysis itself.  The Collection specifically focuses on potential implications of the Directive in the Member States  based on their existing legislation and practices23 and addresses how it is relevant for CERTs and  other stakeholders, and what potential future actions could be taken by all of them.  22  European Commission. 2010.

The representatives were taken  from a wide range of stakeholder groups to ensure that all relevant perspectives were taken into  consideration.  Ultimately, feedback was obtained from 18 Member States. While some participants indicated that  they would prefer not to be identified and the list below is therefore not exhaustive, the following  stakeholders among others contributed to the data used in this study:  Member State Affiliation  Belgium FCCU  Bulgaria  International Cyber Investigation Training  Academy  Cyprus Cyprus Research and Academic Network Security  CSIRT  Czech Republic National Police Academy of the Czech Republic  France Coordinator of the Investigations Plateau of  Cybercrime and Digital Analysis (Plateau  d'Investigation Cybercriminalité & Analyses  Numériques – PI CyAN), and Head of the  Department for the Fight against Cybercrime  Greece Hellenic Data Protection Authority  Ireland UCD Centre for Cybersecurity and Cybercrime  Investigation  Italy Ministry of the Interior  Luxembourg CIRCL  Netherlands National High Tech Crime Unit (Team High Tech  Crime)  National Crime Squad (Dienst Landelijke  Recherche)  Netherlands' Police (Nationale Politie, landelijke  eenheid)  Portugal FCCN.PT  Romania CERT-RO  Slovakia National Security Authority  Slovenia SI-CERT  Spain CNPIC  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  7  Sweden Swedish Defence Research Institute  United Kingdom Janet  Each interview was summarised in a brief (3-5 page) report, which was subsequently sent back to  each interviewee for validation.  The present report contains a comparative analysis of the responses, structured along the same  topics as the interviews themselves, i.e. the substantive criminal provisions of the Directive (section  2 below), the aggravating circumstances surrounding botnets and identity theft (ID theft) (section 3),  international cooperation and information exchange (section 4), and finally data collection and  reporting (section 5). In each of these sections, we have set out:   A summary of the interview outcomes, i.e. frequently recurring responses and general  trends in the feedback; this may contain both positive and negative feedback on the  Directive from the interviewees, as well as their lessons and experiences on each topic;   Identified good practices, i.e. positive lessons from specifically identified countries that may  be transposable to other countries; these are typically grouped per stakeholder;   Recommendations for the implementation, i.e. guidance towards Member States on  implementation choices, generally containing both the good practices identified earlier and  any additional recommendations that have been suggested by interviewees, even if there  was no existing good practice in any Member State yet. Thus, the recommendations not only  identify what exists in at least some Member States, but also indicate any gaps that need to  be filled in the future. As with the good practices, recommendations are typically grouped  per stakeholder.  Through this methodology, the Good Practice Collection presents an overview of the state of the art,  including the lessons learned by the various stakeholders, and aims to provide useful suggestions  and guidance for implementation activities.  This report was circulated among the ENISA Expert Group, constituted largely of persons interviewed  in the course of this Study, in order to ensure the validity and representative character of the  findings and recommendations. The report was thereafter discussed during an Expert Group  meeting in The Hague on 4 October 2013, and subsequently updated to reflect the suggestions. It  should be noted however that this report contains opinions, suggestions and recommendations  originating from various parties, and that these do not necessarily reflect any ENISA position.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  9  2 Substantive criminal provisions in the Directive  2.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  With respect to substantive criminal law, the Directive retains prior crimes from the Framework  Decision – namely the penalisation of illegal access, illegal system interference and illegal data  interference – but adds criminalisation of certain tools for committing offenses, as well as the notion  of ‘illegal interception’. This will help keep EU level legislation in line with other international  cybercrime initiatives, such as notably the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Convention, and more  importantly will allow to act more effectively against more recent developments of cybercrime  which were not yet adequately accounted for in the Framework Decision, such as the increased use  of botnets, which could be qualified as a criminal tool under the Directive’s provisions.  2.2 Illegal access  With respect to the crime of illegal access (hacking), the initially proposed Directive brought an  interesting change as compared to the prior Framework Decision. The Framework Decision allowed  Member States to decide that the conduct was incriminated only where a security measure was  breached (i.e. unlawfully accessing an unprotected information system was not required to be  criminalised in the Member States). The proposal for a Directive as studied below did not retain this  option, and illegal access would always be considered as a crime, irrespective of whether a security  measure was breached.  However, the ultimately adopted Directive (finalised after the interviews in this study were already  completed) reintroduced the terminology of the Framework Decision, noting that criminalisation of  illegal access was only needed “where committed by infringing a security measure”. The legal  framework was thus ultimately not changed, and the comments below are therefore mainly useful  as an exercise examining the potential impacts of changing this rule.  Summary of interview outcomes 2.2.1  The interviews showed that the legal framework in most countries was brought in line with the  requirements of the original proposal for a new Directive: either the legislation never required a  breach of security measures, or such a requirement had been removed in preceding years (e.g. in  the Netherlands). Of the 18 interviewed countries, only the Czech Republic indicated that a security  breach requirement was retained as a requirement in the law. Bulgaria noted that its legislation was  generally very strictly interpreted by judges, and that the ‘without permission’ criterion would  generally be interpreted as requiring that there is a lock or other security measure which needs to  be broken.  Interviewees in other countries (e.g. France and Italy) noted a similar perspective: even in the  absence of an explicit legal requirement, security breaches would always play a significant role in the  assessments made by judges: in the absence of security measures, the unlawfulness of access  attempts would be significantly harder to demonstrate.  As noted above, the Directive does not require any changes as compared to the Framework  Decision, and legislation in all Member States can thus remain ‘as is’.  Identified good practices 2.2.2  The primary challenge in relation to this provision in the Directive clearly relates to the  interpretation of unlawfulness of access attempts: especially in the absence of security measures  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  10  that were breached, it can be hard for prosecutors to decide when to initiate legal proceedings in  countries that permit prosecutors to exercise discretion on this point.  The presence of security measures can be indicative: in the absence of security measures, accidental  access is more likely. E.g. a recent decision from a French court found that access to documents on  an unsecured webserver did not constitute illegal access, since they were made freely accessible to  the public24.  Coherence on this issue is important to avoid arbitrary enforcement, and to avoid courts being  overburdened with seemingly trivial cases.  A number of countries have therefore reported the existence of prosecution guidelines that assist in  the interpretation and the application of the law. E.g. the United Kingdom reported the existence of  prosecution guidelines within the Crown Prosecution Service, which help in the interpretation of  laws and prioritisation of prosecutions25. Similar but non-public guidelines were reported in Sweden,  and Portugal reported the existence of guidance documents for judges (but not for prosecutors).  Reflections on the findings 2.2.3  2.3 Illegal interception  The offense of illegal interception was newly introduced in the Directive. It requires Member States  “to ensure that the intentional interception by technical means, of non-public transmissions of  computer data to, from or within an information system, including electromagnetic emissions from  an information system carrying such computer data, is punishable as a criminal offence when  committed without right.”  Summary of interview outcomes 2.3.1  The provision is very similar to Article 3 of the Cybercrime Convention on which it was based. As a  result, most countries could logically be expected to already have implemented suitable legislation.  24  Tribunal de Grande instance de Créteil 11ème chambre correctionnelle Jugement du 23 avril 2013:  http://www.legalis.net/spip.php?page=jurisprudence-decision&id_article=3739 [Last accessed 0ctober 14,  2013]  25  The Crown Prosecution Service. Computer Misuse Act 1990:  http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/computer_misuse_act_1990/ [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  To reduce legal uncertainty, it could be advisable for countries to publish guidance on the  interpretation and application of the unlawful access provisions, and particularly on the  element of intent (i.e. the unlawfulness – without right) in cases where no security measures  were breached, if this is permitted under national law. This can be done in the form of  prosecution guidelines in countries that permit this, and/or in the form of jurisprudence  overviews to show how courts apply the law in reality.  Collection and dissemination of such guidance at the EU level could also help to ensure  homogeneous application of the law across the European territory.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  11  The interview summaries showed that this was indeed the case: no interviewee indicated that  legislation covering illegal interception was unavailable in their jurisdiction. However, a small  number of countries (notably Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Slovakia) noted that their legislation on this  offense was currently being revised or tightened, as a part of the implementation of the Budapest  Convention, or in response to recent incidents where wiretaps were used inappropriately. This  illustrates a broader trend: many of the respondents spontaneously linked provisions on wiretaps  organised by law enforcement as an investigative measure to provisions on illegal interception as  envisaged by the Directive; likely because transgressions of rules on the former would result in a  violation of the latter.  The CERT from Luxembourg noted a particular concern, namely that excessively broad legislation  could impact e.g. the analysis of how malware works. What is non-public communication, e.g. in a  company network? Is monitoring how malware works in a system illegal interception? The law on  this point should be clear, to ensure that CERTs (or other investigators outside of law enforcement)  are not accused of interception simply because of an investigation of hacker activity. The provision in  the Directive states that only acts committed without right are considered unlawful, and regular  activities of CERTs should therefore not be interfered with. None the less, the CERT noted that there  should be more explicit guidance to ensure that the normal activities of CERTs aren’t considered to  be criminal, not so much because of a real risk of criminal investigation to CERTs, but mainly because  such discussions take up time and resources.  Identified good practices  2.3.2  No unique good practices were identified on this topic, but the concern outlined above by  Luxembourg could be similarly addressed by guidance documents. Thus, the same good practices as  discussed above under illegal interception could apply here as well.  Reflections on the findings 2.3.3  2.4 Tools for committing offenses  The Directive introduces a new offence related to tools used for committing offences, defined as  follows: Member States must “ensure that the intentional production, sale, procurement for use,  import, distribution or otherwise making available, of one of the following tools, without right and  with the intention that it be used to commit any of the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 6, is  punishable as a criminal offence, at least for cases which are not minor:”  (a) a computer programme, designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of committing  any of the offences above;  Similar to the above, uncertainty could be reduced through the publication of guidance  on the interpretation and application of the illegal interception provisions, and  particularly on the legitimacy of the activities of CERTs and network operators  themselves.  Collection and dissemination of such guidance at the EU level could also help to ensure  homogeneous application of the law across the European territory.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  12  (b) a computer password, access code, or similar data by which the whole or any part of an  information system is capable of being accessed.  Summary of interview outcomes 2.4.1  As with the offence of illegal interception above, this provision is very similar to Article 6 of the  Cybercrime Convention on which it was based26. Thus, it could again be expected that most  countries had already implemented it prior to the adoption of the Directive.  Indeed, the feedback obtained during the interviews confirmed that this was the case: of all the  interviewed respondents, none indicated that provisions on tools for committing offenses were  missing in their jurisdictions. However:   One respondent (Sweden) was not sufficiently aware of legislation on this point, and thus  could not provide conclusive information on Swedish law.   Three respondents (Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia) indicated that there was no unique  provision on ICT tools specifically, but rather that existing generic provision on tools for  committing crimes were applied. E.g. in Slovenian law the applicable provision is the articles  on the manufacture or production of weapons for a criminal act: the same rules are applied  to possession, manufacturing, selling, distributing, importing/exporting of tools for illegal  access to information systems.   Some respondents however also indicated that the existing rules were somewhat too  generic to be applied consistently. This was the case for the legislation in Bulgaria and  Slovakia. In Bulgaria for instance, a challenge is that the concept of a ‘tool’ is not defined in  Bulgarian law (or in EU law). As a result, judges are very careful in applying this concept. It is  thus likely that Bulgarian criminal law will need to be made more explicit to address this  issue before judges are systematically willing to apply/enforce it.   Other countries signalled either no need to update their legislation at all, or only on minor  points (e.g. procurement for use of tools is not yet included in Portuguese law whereas it is  included in the Directive; thus, the law would need to be amended on this point).  The interviewees were also polled on the well-known debate of whether the Directive’s rules were  sufficiently clear to ensure that CERTs, academic researchers, security professionals etc. could  operate lawfully. Whether this is the case or not depends on the interpretation of the Directive’s  language, and specifically on whether the tools are produced, sold,  etc.  ‘without right for the  purpose of committing any of the offences’. Here, there was a distinction between respondent  profiles:   Respondents representing law enforcement or policy makers almost unanimously noted that  this debate was largely academic, and that there were no known cases of actual  unwarranted prosecutions in practice. They were satisfied that the language of the Directive  would be appropriate and sufficient to safeguard lawful activities.   Respondents representing CERTs were less certain: while most were confident that the  provisions would never be applied to them, some still expressed doubts. This was notably  the case in Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. These respondents called for a clearer  confirmation that the normal activities of CERTs, academic institutions, researchers, network  operators and security service professionals would be exempted from the scope of  26  Convention 185 on Cybercrime, Budapest, 23 November 2001:  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm [Last accessed 0ctober 14, 2013]  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  13  application of this provision, as should any actions at the lawful request of businesses,  governments and end users.  A respondent from Ireland also noted a separate concern, namely the involuntary use of such tools,  such as the JS-LOIC tool (a javascript implementation of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon software used to  commit DDoS-attacks). Once integrated on a website, any visitor of that website automatically and  possibly unknowingly participates in a DDoS-attack on a preconfigured target. The provisions on  tools could target unwitting participants in such attacks, since law enforcement and criminal  investigators have no way of distinguishing such unwitting users (who have no criminal intent and  therefore would not be targeted by the criminal provisions of the Directive) from willing participants  (who visit the site with the intent to participate in a DDoS attack and therefore would fall within the  scope of the Directive). The provision could thus be hard to apply in such cases.  Thus, while the purpose-oriented language was seen as positive, more explicit legal carve-outs  (excluding criminal liability for clearly lawful activities) were seen as desirable for some respondents.  Identified good practices 2.4.2  Most countries had directly implemented the legislation already, and notable good practices were  therefore rare. However, the French experiences were instructive: the applicable provision in French  criminal law states that creation, owning, distribution without legal motive is a crime. The  interviewee noted that practical cases on this issue were rare, this is probably because the  Parliament in France explicitly discussed the fact that security and research purposes constituted a  lawful motive for keeping the tools, removing most of the doubt. The uncertainty thus seemed to be  largely theoretical. Cases do still occur, however: in a practical case, a company was prosecuted for  publishing exploits and actual code that allowed their exploitation; this was considered unlawful27.  None the less, the clear Parliamentary debate seemed to have deflected some of the concerns.  Reflections on the findings  2.4.3  27  Criminalités numériques weblog. 2009. ‘Est-il illégal de publier des failles de sécurité?’  http://blog.crimenumerique.fr/2009/12/24/est-il-illegal-de-publier-des-failles-de-securite [Last accessed  0ctober 14, 2013]  Based on the observed feedback, three sets of suggestions could be forwarded which are  based on good practices or suggestions from interviewees:   Firstly, implementing legislation should be clear and explicit, and include clear  carve-outs of the applicability of the provision for the normal activities of  CERTs, academic institutions, researchers, network operators and security  service professionals, and any actions undertaken at the lawful request of  businesses, governments and end users.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  14   The respondent from one of the countr suggested that a pure legislation  based solution would not be ideal, as legislation would never be able to  consider every abstract possibility that might occur in practice. Rather, he  suggested that it should be up to the security community itself to come up  with guidelines and recommendations on how to comply with the law, e.g.  on responsible disclosure. It is not the task of lawmakers or prosecutors to  define all the details through legislation or interpretative documents. This  recommendation should be applied at the international level: it would be  beneficial for the industry and academia itself to formalise its good practices  to remove or at least reduce any sense of unease. That would give judges a  baseline of criteria to appreciate cases.   The Irish respondent suggested that future initiative might further consider  the responsibility and liability of service providers, e.g. operators of  websites which run outdated software with known security vulnerabilities.  The interviewee noted that it could be useful to at least place some degree  of responsibility/liability for damages resulting from the hacking of such  systems with the operators. Irrespective of technical awareness of the  website operator, they should at least have some responsibility for  choosing/maintaining functioning and secure systems. A similar suggestion  of economic incentivisation was provided by the national CERT from  Luxembourg, noting that the original owner of a breached system should  perhaps bear some liability as well, in order to incentivise proper security  practices. Perhaps even financial/fiscal incentives could be considered to  encourage security investments. While technically out of scope of the  implementation of the Directive, the suggestion may still be useful for future  cybersecurity policy actions.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  15  3 Aggravating circumstances in the Directive  3.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  The Directive aims to increase the penalties for certain crimes, and introduced a new set of  aggravating circumstances in order to more effectively address identity theft and botnets.  Specifically:   Under the Framework Decision, the maximum penalty for committing crimes in the  framework of a criminal organization was at least 2-5 years. In the Directive, this is uniformly  set at 5 years, i.e. the upper bound of the previous range. This should increase penalties for  organized criminal activity, and would thus help the fight against criminal gangs engaged in  identity theft or the use of botnets.   The Framework Decision allowed (but did not require) the same penalty (2-5 years) when  the offense caused serious damages or has affected essential interests. The Directive  requires the same uniform (5 year) penalty for the same circumstance, as well as when the  crimes are committed against a critical infrastructure information system.   In addition, a 3 year penalty applies when botnets are used (“where a significant number of  information systems have been affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7,  designed or adapted primarily for that purpose”);   Finally, for identity theft (“by misusing the personal data of another person, with the aim of  gaining the trust of a third party, thereby causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner”),  Member States must ensure that this may be qualified as an aggravating circumstance under  national law.  Given that the increase in maximum penalties is not susceptible to good practices (all penalties are  merely required to be increased when needed, without much margin for creativity), the interviews  mainly focused on provisions and practices in relation to botnets and identity theft. The outcomes  will be briefly discussed below.  3.2 Botnets  Summary of interview outcomes 3.2.1  Under the Directive, Member States are required to ensure that the crimes of illegal system  interference and illegal system access “are punishable by criminal penalties of a maximum term of  imprisonment of at least three years where a significant number of information systems have been  affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7, designed or adapted primarily for that  purpose” (Article 9.3). Thus, botnets are addressed as the outcome of a tool (namely the software  used to take over the systems constituting the botnet) designed to launch attacks via the botnet (‘a  significant number of information systems’).  To identify good practices, interviewees were mainly asked whether their countries had already  implemented legislation addressing botnets (including as an aggravating circumstance), and what  the operational practices in their countries were that could be used as a good practice.  With respect to existing legislation, none of the interviewees indicated that specific legislation had  been adopted in their respective countries to address botnets, either as a separate crime or as an  aggravating circumstance. In practice, botnet attacks are universally dealt with at this time through  existing legislation, such as illegal access (hacking), fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit a crime etc.,  depending on the impact of botnet activity.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  16  In the UK however, existing legislation was amended to ensure that botnets could be  comprehensively addressed, without mentioning or defining botnets precisely: up until 2006,  builders of botnets were clearly committing an offense, but users of botnets (the botnet herders)  weren’t necessarily. Existing provisions focused on unlawful access, and builders (who infected third  party machines) were guilty of that crime. However, botnet herders who launched e.g. DDoS attacks  didn’t fall under this rule. Therefore, changes in the legislation were needed, and separate rules for  (D)DoS attacks were introduced.  Under the amended Section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act28, it is  an offence to deliberately or recklessly impair the operation of any computer or program, or  reliability of data, or to prevent or hinder access to data. That includes both the previous offence of  unlawful modification of data, and any additional DoS activities.  Several interviewees expressed concerns or reservations about amending legislation: both Bulgaria  and Luxembourg indicated that botnets would fall under the broader umbrella of unlawful tools, and  that this is a notion that is not very clearly defined under the Directive. For instance, the question  could be presented whether grids29 are also a form of botnet, or peer-to-peer (P2P) networks30, or  partially distributed communication networks such as Skype? There is a clear concern that newer  and more specific legislation could inadvertently create new legal discussions rather than solving  them: the Belgian interviewee noted that the definition in the Directive could actually make it harder  to pursue cases, because defendants might try to argue on technicalities: e.g. what is “a significant  number of information systems”? The inclusion of these criteria in the law could actually have an  adverse effect of giving defendants new elements to attack in their prosecution. Thus, any new  legislation should be implemented only if strictly necessary to achieve the objectives of the  Directive, and would need to be sufficiently precise to avoid creating new loopholes.  With respect to operational practices, the feedback provided by the interviewees was more  substantive and contained useful guidance from the perspective of CERTs, law enforcement bodies,  data protection supervisors and policy makers:   CERTs often face the practical challenge of what they are allowed to do in case of botnet  incidents. Some CERTs note that they did not report incidents to law enforcement  proactively, leaving this up to the victims, whereas others would inform law enforcement  themselves independent of any complaints. Taking forceful action by disconnecting infected  systems was only done by CERTs that had been explicitly authorised to supervise and police  well-defined networks, such as academic or military CERTs for their own academic or  military networks, and only on a limited scale. Outside of that specific context, CERTs can  only provide recommendations to network operators on how to address incidents, which  the operators could then choose to follow on a voluntary basis. However, such CERTs cannot  28  Police and Justice Act, 2006: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/48/section/36 [Last accessed 14  October, 2013]; and see Computer Misuse Act 1990:  http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/computer_misuse_act_1990/#an09 [Last accessed 14 October, 2013] for  guidance on its interpretation and application.  29  Grid computing can be defined as a system that coordinates resources that are not subject to centralized  control, using standard, open, general-purpose protocols and interfaces to deliver nontrivial qualities of  service.

Standard procedures for dealing with botnets are generally not  available.   Law enforcement bodies noted that they generally took a passive role, as active monitoring  of networks was either not legally possible or created privacy concerns. However, they  signalled that many operators (network operators or website operators) do monitor their  own networks, but are often uncertain as to what they can legally do when they see  anomalous behaviour. Passing on information to law enforcement causes them concern,  because it would require an acknowledgement that they monitor and analyse their users.  Even if this is only done to identify and address incidents, it could still give rise to privacy  concerns. For the identification of command & control nodes in a botnet, this means that  the information is often available, but operators are reluctant to hand it to law enforcement  bodies without a court order, due to privacy compliance concerns. De facto, that means that  botnet incidents can go unreported: operators are unwilling to risk the publicity of filing a  report and are content if an incident can be resolved quietly, and law enforcement is  typically unaware of incidents unless it is reported.   In some cases, botnets have been addressed through joint coordinated action between law  enforcement, CERTs and the private sector. Responses on such actions are positive,  although law enforcement bodies stress the need for their involvement. A concern has been  noted that solo-actions from the private sector (including private CERTs, security companies  etc.) without the backing of law enforcement may be effective in shutting down isolated  incidents, but ultimately leave criminals unharmed and free to resume their activities. Such  actions can furthermore harm ongoing investigations, as crucial data might be destroyed or  corrupted, making it unusable as evidence in potential criminal proceedings.   In international botnet cases, it is worth noting that the feedback universally indicated that  CERTs frequently interacted with other foreign CERTs and occasionally with foreign  operators, but virtually31 never directly with foreign law enforcement bodies. In such  international botnet cases, CERTs would work exclusively with their own national law  enforcement bodies, or would attempt to resolve the attack without involving law  enforcement at all.   As was already well established through prior studies, data sharing between operators,  CERTs and law enforcement is problematic due to data protection concerns. The  interpretation that an IP address is always personal data was mentioned as an anomaly that  raised constant issues of compliance even in the absence of significant privacy risks. E.g. if a  software company sent out a list of IP addresses that are seemingly infected with a virus  within the Zeus botnet, then the CERT felt that it would have to file notifications with its  data protection authority; the same would apply of this information was then sent on by the  CERT to ISPs. This example provided by an operational CERT, whether correct or not, shows  the need for guidance on this point. Some good practices have been observed however that  are used to address or mitigate this problem.   CERTs occasionally but not systematically work closely with data protection authorities  and/or telecommunications regulators in their countries. In e.g. the Czech Republic such  contacts were found to be useful to obtain guidance on data protection compliance. In other  countries, contacts with supervisors were limited due to the perceived lack of competences  or resources with these bodies.   A frequently related frustration from the side of CERTs was that information exchanges with  law enforcement tend to be unidirectional: from CERT to law enforcement, but rarely the  31  In a rare number of instances, CERTs reported working directly with foreign law enforcement, such as the  FBI.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  18  other way around. This is known and understood to be necessary to protect the secrecy of  ongoing investigations. However, it would still be useful to CERTs if investigators could  inform them of steps taken and expected future actions at a high level, without going into  specific details in a case, merely to know what (if anything) happened and to see how CERTs  could streamline their activities and improve their usefulness.  Identified good practices 3.2.2  With respect to legislation, only one country (the UK) had modified its legislation to ensure that  botnets could be addressed. As noted above, an update in 2006 was deemed to be necessary to  ensure that botnet herders who used a botnet without necessarily having infected any machines  themselves could also be prosecuted. This can be considered a good practice, as it covered a  legislative gap through generic language: it became an offence to deliberately or recklessly impair  the operation of any computer or program, or reliability of data, or to prevent or hinder access to  data. The provision also avoided the pitfall of introducing new technology specific concepts.  On the operational front, several good practices have been observed that could serve as examples  for other countries:   For CERTs, the definition of a clear mandate is crucial:  o Private CERTs and academic CERTs benefit from implementing clear agreements  with their constituency that define precisely what their remit and competences are.  This was e.g. observed in the UK through Janet, which can intervene within the  networks that it supervises (principally university networks), on the basis of the  policy agreements that it has concluded with the network operators. Principal  responsibility still lies with the universities, since they are the only ones who know  exactly what the impact of interventions will be.  o Public CERTs benefit from a clear legal framework that grants them clear authorities  and powers. For instance, the Swedish MilCERT has a clear legal mandate  established by law, and Swedish law requires public authorities to cooperate with  each other in the investigation of incidents. This can often facilitate interactions  between the CERT and law enforcement.   The Dutch national CERT noted the importance of working in partnership with  representatives of key sectors, including a number of large telcos and banks. This  partnership includes frequent meetings that allow all stakeholders – law enforcement,  CERTs and private companies – to identify and address issues that the private sector  faces through an ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center).   International cooperation with other CERTs is supported by the Trusted Introducer and  FIRST networks. Among others, the Romanian CERT-RO noted that these were  considered to be trust frameworks, since all member CERTs have to sign certain  paperwork and accept certain obligations.   To facilitate data sharing between operators, CERTs and law enforcement, it is worth  noting that no country reported having received clear guidance from data protection  authorities on how to comply with data protection law. It should however also be noted  that the Greek DPA that was interviewed indicated that it had not received any requests  on this point, and that it would be open to providing constructive advice, which it  believed would not be prohibitive. Positive experiences were reported notably in  Slovenia. After a recent DoS attack, the national CERT published an advisory for ISPs on  how to proceed, including a recommendation to conduct some network monitoring and  traffic analysis. This advisory resulted in a critical comment via Twitter, stating that this  advice was illegal as a violation of Slovenian data protection law. The CERT retweeted  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  19  this message to the Information Commissioner, who replied – also via Twitter – that it  considered such monitoring and analysis to be lawful and proportionate to the danger  that such an attack could cause, as the law could not be reasonably expected to define  every possible hypothesis in which data would need to be processed. This was useful,  because it resulted in a quick, public and highly visible communication towards CERTs,  ISPs and the Internet community.  More generally, the CERT noted that it was very  aware of the need to explain carefully what analysis they do and why, as this  proportionality and transparency is important to keep trust of their stakeholders. In case  of grey areas, the CERT maintains a good relationship with the Information  Commissioner to obtain quick advice when needed. This was noted to be important to  keep the trust of the community.   When addressing botnets, most CERTs lacked any standardised process or playbook for  taking appropriate action to respond to botnets, and decided on this on a case by case  basis. The Romanian CERT however noted that there was a standard procedure for  responding to botnets, which is followed in each case to ensure that all incidents are  handled in the same manner. Similarly, the French Gendarmerie reported that they are  currently devising a standard procedure for basic malware distribution (small botnets).  The idea is to help others through improved international cooperation: the collected  information could be proactively shared with international law enforcement partners.  The strategy will also include procedures for dealing with assistance requests from ISPs  or from CERTS (in France and abroad), and also push the collected information via  Europol to other countries (third countries, including Russia, Ukraine, etc.).  Reflections on the findings 3.2.3  Based on the analysis and good practice discussed above, a number of suggestions can  be derived.  With respect to legislation, given the concerns outlined above, it seems advisable to  assess whether new legislation is necessary to achieve the effects of the Directive  under existing law, and if so, to implement the required changes through generic and  technology neutral language. This would achieve the desired outcome of fighting  botnets, while avoiding the risk of putting in place language that creates new technical  discussions on what constitutes a botnet, and whether the thresholds for botnet  prosecution have been cleared. The example of the UK is instructive in that respect.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  20  Operationally, one of the main challenges is that most CERTs have no guidelines on  how botnets can be dealt with. Standardised guidance on this point, preferable on  at least the EU level, would be useful, e.g. covering the questions that CERTs would  need to ask, what information and recommendations they should provide, and what  could proportionately and lawfully be done. This would also be useful to strengthen  the image and perceived effectiveness of CERTs (and law enforcement) for criminals.  This guidance would also need to take into account the different mandates and  tasks that CERTs may have: private CERTs can benefit from contractual agreements  with their constituency as seen in the good practices noted above, whereas public  CERTs benefit from a clear relationship with law enforcement bodies (either by  liaising systematically, or by the integration of seconded law enforcement officials).  The mandate of CERTs needs to be clearly defined, taking into account the  consequences of any choices made in this respect. Private CERTs can benefit from  legal agreements with their main constituency, which can serve as a legal basis for  data sharing and which can limit the responsibilities and liabilities of the CERT. Public  CERTs can benefit from a mandate established by law that defines their  responsibilities and competences; however, their position is made more delicate  because of the need to keep the functions of CERTs and law enforcement separate.  While a close integration of CERTs and law enforcement has clear efficiency benefits,  it also means that network operators and service providers may become less willing  to share information with a CERT, due to the concern that the CERT will not only  serve its traditional ‘fire brigade’ role, but also contribute to initiating legal  proceedings. The latter may be beneficial from a public policy perspective, but can  be (perceived as) highly negative for service providers, since they lose the option of  informally consulting the CERT. Thus, if the latter approach is chosen, additional  effort will be required to set up a trust relationship with the constituency of the  public CERT.  To effectively address botnet crime, joint coordinated actions between law  enforcement, CERTs and the private sector (such as network operators) are  recommended. CERTs and the private sector should avoid taking actions without law  enforcement support, as this might solve a single attack but ultimately leaves the  criminals unharmed. The recent case of the b54 botnet operation was mentioned as  a good practice example, where Microsoft was able to work with the FBI to shut  down the Citadel botnet1. Linked to this, the organisation of frequent meetings that  allow all stakeholders – law enforcement, CERTs and private companies – to  identify and address issues that the private sector faces through an ISAC  (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) has been found to be effective, as seen in  the Dutch experiences.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  21  3.3 Identity Theft  Summary of interview outcomes  3.3.1  Under the Directive, Member States are required to “take the necessary measures to ensure that  when [the crimes of illegal system access or illegal system interference] are committed by misusing  the personal data of another person, with the aim of gaining the trust of a third party, thereby  causing prejudice to the rightful identity owner, this may, in accordance with national law, be  regarded as aggravating circumstances, unless those circumstances are already covered by another  offence, punishable under national law.” (Article 9.5). Thus, identity theft is defined in terms of two  constituent elements: misuse of personal data to gain the trust of a third party, prejudice to the  rightful identity owner.  To identify good practices, interviewees were mainly asked whether their countries had already  implemented legislation addressing identity theft (including as an aggravating circumstance), and  what the operational practices in their countries were that could be used as a good practice.  Additionally, they were also queried on how one might determine concealment of the real identity  of the perpetrator against the lawful use of pseudonyms, alter egos, avatars, usernames, or  anonymisation software, and on the determination of prejudice taking into account individual  sensitivity, satire, parody, freedom of speech rights, etc.  To facilitate cooperation between CERTs at the international level (including for  botnet incidents), the Trusted Introducer and FIRST networks act as strong enablers  which generally meet with highly positive feedback from CERTs. Membership of  these networks is thus strongly recommended.  It would be advisable to examine how feedback could be provided from law  enforcement to CERTs on any matters reported by the CERT or in which the CERT  intervened. To protect the secrecy of ongoing investigations, such information could  only be provided at the aggregate (non-case specific) level.  Finally, with respect to data sharing, pragmatic guidance at the EU level, e.g. from  the Article 29 Working Party, on the interpretation and impact of data protection  rules for CERTs and network operators in their day-to-day security related activities  is still needed. While the theoretical framework and the potential consequences are  well known, CERTs and service providers are still largely experimenting on what type  of monitoring, analysis and reporting activities are lawful, and which activities are  excessive. This has a stifling effect on the fight against cybercrime. In the absence of  such guidelines, Member States should at a minimum ensure that data protection  authorities at the national level are easily reachable to provide ad-hoc  recommendations. The best practice of Slovenia as reported above can serve as a  useful example of up-to-date, efficient and pragmatic advisory services.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  22  With respect to existing legislation, most countries indicate that they have not adopted any ID theft  specific legislation, and that incidents are addressed through existing generic criminal laws, such as  breaches of telecommunications confidentiality laws, fraud, illegal access/hacking, interfering with  computer systems, illegal interception, etc., depending on the circumstances. In rarer cases, the  applicability of data protection law is signalled, as are possible civil law qualifications (such as  violation of personality rights).  However, a smaller number of countries have reported specific legal initiatives. In Italy, legislation is  currently under discussion in Parliament, which introduces ID theft as an independent crime,  qualifying it as impersonation if there is an intent to gain a profit or to harm the identity owner. The  integration of this intent was seen generally as useful to avoid abuses. The Italian proposal remains  however subject to significant debate, and its chances of adoption are unclear.  In France, a specific provision was introduced in 2011 that covered cases of ID theft that were not  clearly covered by adequate criminal law before. Before 2011, ID theft was an offence only when it  would put a victim in a position of possibly being accused of committing an offence (also including  abuse of titles or functions, e.g. pretending to be a policeman to commit an offence was already  covered). The new legislation covers usurping the identity of a third person or to make use of one or  more data allowing the identification of that person, with a view to damage the tranquillity of  someone else, or to harm the honour or standing of that person. The law explicitly states that the  law also applies when committed on a public communication network (i.e. the Internet).  The main debate on the ID theft provision in France remains whether this opposes any right to  parody, or comic use of someone’s identity (freedom of speech). The Parliament has stated that  these rights should remain respected, so that judges need to consider this balance in actual cases.  The provision specifically aims to apply when people’s identity was being used on online forums, or  when their identity was abused by others to make people look bad.  With respect to operational practices, it is worth noting that both law enforcement and CERTs stress  the importance of good interactions with service providers such as social network sites or hosting  companies in addressing simple identity theft cases effectively. In more complex fraud cases  (including spear phishing in the financial services sector), both stakeholders noted the importance of  frequent contacts with sector specific organisations in order to rapidly disseminate information on  identified threats. Awareness raising is still seen as the primary tool in fighting identity theft, as the  main cause of successful identity theft cases is still the uninformed and insecure behaviour of end  users.  For less technically complex cases (e.g. creating Facebook under someone else’s name), a number of  countries noted the supporting role of data protection authorities, as such incidents could be  prosecuted as a violation of data protection law. The Greek DPA affirmed that a few such cases have  been brought before it, likely as a result of opinions published by the DPA on the topic. The DPA is  seen by many citizens as a lower threshold contact point that can then help them to contact the  service provider (e.g. Facebook) or by referring them to another competent DPA (e.g. the Irish DPA  in case of Facebook). Bigger cases would be addressed by law enforcement.  With respect to concealment of identities (an issue that would not be covered by the Directive’s  provisions, as they focus on the misuse of another person’s personal data), most respondents noted  that they do not consider the use of pseudonyms or anonymization networks as problematic in their  own rights, nor as indicative of any problem that makes a qualification as identity theft significantly  greater. However, it is interesting to note that at least three respondents (in France, in Slovenia and  in the Netherlands) saw a concern from the opposite angle: they noted that law enforcement  officials had no competences to use anonymisation technologies themselves, and that this was a real  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  23  need to enable them to take effective action. As this issue is outside the scope of the Directive, it will  not be examined further in this report.  Finally, with respect to determining prejudice, all interviewees were asked how grey area cases  (pseudonyms, joke accounts on Facebook, parody etc.) were addressed, and notably whether the  prejudice criterion was applied in practice. Interviewees almost unanimously noted that such cases  occurred with relative frequency, but that they were themselves rarely involved. This is likely  because the majority of interviewees were CERTs or law enforcement bodies: CERTs would not  generally be implicated in such technologically simple and relatively benign cases; and law  enforcement bodies would generally not be responsible for the assessment of prejudice, as this  would be done at a later stage by courts in case of prosecution.  Practically speaking, if any actions would be undertaken against these types of files, the interviewees  indicated that this would generally be done by the victims contacting service providers directly to  voluntarily take action, or by civil claims before civil courts. Criminal case law for such cases was  therefore noted to be extremely limited.  Identified good practices 3.3.2  Most of the good practices that were already described in the preceding sections on botnets also  apply to identity theft. However, several additional good practices can be found in the interview  outcomes.  On the legislative front, the primary good practices are the Italian example that emphasise the  intent to cause harm as a precondition for criminalisation, and the French example that was more  broadly phrased but benefited from discussions in Parliament that emphasized the importance of  respecting freedom of expression. Both of these elements (intent and freedom of expression) are  vital for the correct functioning of ID theft legislation.  Operationally, several respondents indicated that smaller ID theft cases in which no significant  interests were involved could often be addressed effectively by requesting appropriate interventions  (typically deletion of the offending materials) by the service providers themselves, as the use of false  identities in an attempt to cause harm to a third party is usually a violation of terms of service.  Reflections on the findings  3.3.3  With respect to implementing legislation, it will be important for national laws to stress  the importance of the criminal intent of the alleged ID thief, and to emphasse that the  provisions should be interpreted and applied taking into account the legitimate  exercise of the fundamental right to freedom of expression. It would not be feasible or  desirable to enumerate cases covered by this fundamental right (such as parody, satire,  societal criticism, polemic discussion, etc.), but the primacy of this fundamental right  should be recognized in order to support the development of rational and consistent  case law. Legal intervention on this point should thus be well considered. The  interpretation of this balance between criminal conduct and controversial but legal free  speech should be left to the courts; CERTs should at any rate not play a role in assessing  the balance.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  24  As noted above, ID theft cases could often be solved by requesting service providers  to take voluntary action, such as removal of the offending materials from any public  website. This approach is often more efficient than formal legal proceedings.  However, such requests must be carefully phrased in order to minimise the impact  on potential future proceedings. Deletion could result in the destruction of evidence,  making future legal actions against criminals impossible or at least substantially  harder. For this reason, information should be made inaccessible rather than deleting  it, unless it has been determined with a sufficient degree of certainty that no future  criminal or civil actions will be undertaken.  Linked to this, and similar to the recommendation with respect to botnets noted  above, the organisation of frequent meetings that allow all stakeholders – law  enforcement, CERTs and private companies – to identify and address issues that the  private sector faces through an ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) can be  effective. This is notably useful to proactively identify and address commonly recurring  ID theft attacks, such as spear phishing in the financial services industry.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  25  4 Cooperation and information exchange procedures in the Directive  4.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  With respect to procedural revisions, arguably the most significant improvements in the Directive  relate to information exchange and data collection. The Framework Decision merely specified that  Member States should “make use of the existing network of operational points of contact available  24 hours a day and seven days a week”, in accordance with data protection rules, and that Member  States should inform the General Secretariat of the Council and the Commission of its appointed  point of contact.  The tasks of the Member States on this point are significantly clarified in the new Directive. On the  exchange of information, the existing obligations are retained, and a response time obligation is  added: Member States should implement the necessary procedures to respond within a maximum  of eight hours to urgent requests. Such responses “shall at least indicate whether and in what form  the request for help will be answered and when”; thus, substantive responses are not necessarily  required in this initial response.  In the sections below, we will briefly examine the feedback from the interviewees with respect to  this update.  Summary of interview outcomes  4.1.1  Given that the obligation relates to information exchanges organised between investigative  authorities in the different Member States, the question was primarily relevant for representatives  of law enforcement bodies.  CERT interviewees on the other hand noted that they were generally able to exchange information  relatively quickly and flexibly between each other, as their interactions typically wouldn’t require  compliance with procedural law obligations, nor would their information exchanges necessarily  result in legal action. For more formal assistance requests, the CERTs generally indicated that they  only worked with law enforcement bodies in their own countries and would prefer to keep it this  way, since this simplifies trust and legal compliance.  Several CERTs (including e.g. from the UK) indicated a preference for keeping technical investigation  and legal investigations separate whenever possible, since the former (mainly between CERTs, but  also the flow of intelligence between CERTs and law enforcement) is significantly quicker and easier  than the latter (involving evidence, rather than intelligence). Intelligence and evidence should be  kept separate. A similar perspective was noted by the Slovenian CERT, indicating that CERTs could  occasionally act as rapid intelligence collectors at the request of law enforcement, who could then  use this intelligence to determine whether formal evidence would be needed. This difference in  focus is also why CERTs are not highly in favour of further regulation of CERT activities: this would  make the CERTs a separate flavour of police/law enforcement with the same disadvantages and the  same impact on their communicative efficiency. The non-legal route enabled by CERTs is sometimes  more effective, and regulation wouldn’t necessarily help them. Regulation could turn the non-legal  route into an illegal route.  As the obligation of the Directive would not formally apply to CERTs, the primary feedback was  obtained from law enforcement bodies, and CERT suggestions are not discussed in further detail  below.  Most of the law enforcement interviewees noted some reservations with respect to the Directive:  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  26   They acknowledged that the 8 hour time limit for responses to urgent requests was  generally feasible.   However, they stressed that – as permitted by the Directive – such quick responses were not  likely to be very substantive or useful to the party making the requests, as material help (e.g.  the identification of a subscriber behind an IP address) would take 24-36 hours at the most  optimistic end of the spectrum, with some respondents noting that a response time of a  week or more was more realistic. This was mainly due to the need to follow formal judicial  aid request procedures, and the requirement to obtain national court orders before any ISP  or other service provider could be required to hand over certain information.   Contacts are generally organised bilaterally (based on existing judicial assistance  agreements, and via legal aid requests through ministries of justice when necessary), or via  Europol and Interpol. The main difficulty in international collaboration (including within  Europe) is drafting the requests, which must be translated and put into a legally valid  format; this takes time and resources, even for relatively basic types of information.  Streamlining of these processes is seen as useful, although the French interviewee  questioned whether this was an appropriate topic for a cybercrime oriented initiative: policy  makers should be working on better processes and better mechanisms within Europol for  cooperation in general, i.e. in all criminal cases. Cybercrime specific rules and response  obligations therefore did not seem to be necessary, according to the interviewee.   Finally, as was noted by the interviewee from the Netherlands, the existence of a single  national high tech crime unit is highly beneficial to streamline communications: in  decentralised countries or countries with multiple contact points, information exchange  doesn’t always work well because a foreign body cannot determine reliably who should be  contacted. In principle, every country should have a single contact point; they can then  delegate any requests as necessary according to internal policy rules and principles.  Identified good practices 4.1.2  Good practices were relatively rare as most respondents indicated their basic requirement of  complying with formal rules without much margin for innovation or creativity. None the less, a few  interesting examples could be noted.  In the French Gendarmie, a current ongoing project is aiming to devise a standard procedure to  proactively address basic malware distributions (small botnets). This will fit into a more general  strategy being created right now, looking at any cases where infrastructure in France is used to  commit a crime, even if there are no known victims in France. The idea is to help others through  improved international cooperation: the collected information could be proactively shared with  international law enforcement partners. This strategy would need to be tested in a number of  cases; presently the idea is still in its early stages. The strategy will also include procedures for  dealing with assistance requests from ISPs or from CERTS (in France and abroad), and will include  proactively pushing the collected information via Europol to other countries (third countries,  including Russia, Ukraine, etc.). This approach which is currently being contemplated by the French  authorities would represent a paradigm shift from a responsive to a proactive model, which would  additionally include international non-European partners. Given that these countries are often  more likely to host criminals taking advantage of bullet proof hosting services, this will be crucial to  improve the effectiveness of anti-cybercrime measures.  The interviewee from Belgium noted that, for assistance requests sent via Europol/Interpol, the  possibility exists to append codes to the information requests that indicate which information may  be disseminated to other contact points. This is a minor but useful standardisation mechanism that  can be very effective to identify contacts and obtain their collaboration.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  27  Formal assistance networks are however not the only or even the most effective way to achieve  international cooperation. Several respondents – including e.g. in Bulgaria – noted that the  organisation of face-to-face meetings between law enforcement representatives outside of the EU  (e.g. non-EU Southeast European countries) was an important enabler, as cooperation with non-EU  countries can be more complicated and personal contacts can greatly facilitate effective  interactions. A similar concern was echoed by France: generally, criminals hide in countries where  it’s difficult to co-operate, and this is an issue that the Directive doesn’t really address. In Europe,  cooperation via Europol is often easier than with non-EU countries, and the EC3 is a positive  development on that front. In other countries, experiences vary: there have been good examples in  France recently of co-operation with the Ivory Coast.  Finally, legal compliance in international information exchanges is a clear concern with CERTs, or at  least it is within Portugal. Within the Portuguese CERT, data protection guidelines and standard  policies have been drafted that determine when/which data can be shared. These policies are  reviewed and policed by the CERT’s own lawyers and are discussed with the data protection  authority.  Reflections on the findings 4.1.3  With a view of streamlining international information exchanges, several  recommendations could be identified from the interviewees’ replies:   A number of respondents (e.g. Belgium and Bulgaria) noted that, even within  the EU, replies to information requests were often delayed or partial, which  can halt investigations. The reasons included lack of trust, but also  misunderstandings with respect to the scope of requests, rather than  resources or language barriers. Streamlining/standardisation of  communications between the 24/7 network might be useful, which could be  done by establishing templates for the most common information requests.   As illustrated by the French best practice discussed above, it may be worth  coupling the reactive information sharing model espoused by the Directive  with a more proactive information sharing strategy in which collected  information could be proactively shared with international law enforcement  partners.   Specifically with respect to CERTs, it was noted that there are no standard  approaches/protocols to check whether there are any on-going investigations  in other countries. This is inefficient, because incidents, attacks or  vulnerabilities are often known to several national CERTs who are all working  on them, without knowing that colleagues in other countries are also  collecting relevant information. An EU level information site (like a storm  center) for CERTs/law enforcement to share such information would be  useful in order to avoid duplication of investigative efforts.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  28   International cooperation outside of the EU should also be supported through  face-to-face meetings between law enforcement representatives, as a key first  step to building trust and identifying effective contacts.   Finally, every country should have a single contact point for information  requests, irrespective of their national competences or organisational model.  The contact point can then delegate any requests as necessary according to  internal policy rules and principles, but this internal back office process should  be irrelevant and invisible to foreign law enforcement bodies.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  29  5 Data collection and reporting in the Directive  5.1 Scope and contents of the Directive  As a final new point, the Directive contains obligations on monitoring and statistics. Member States  would be required to implement a system for the recording, production and provision of statistical  data on the offences in the Directive, including at a minimum the number of offences and their  follow-up, and indicating on an annual basis the number of reported cases investigated, the number  of persons prosecuted, and the number of persons convicted. This data should be reported to the  Commission and published in a statistical report.  5.2 Data collection  Summary of interview outcomes  5.2.1  Responses from the interviewees indicated that data collection was subject to a number of  complexities, related primarily to the fragmentation of information sources. Depending on the  country, up to five distinct information sources could be identified: CERTs, supervisory bodies, law  enforcement bodies, public prosecutors and courts. The logical structure and semantics of their  databases (if present) generally could not be assumed to be built on the same assumptions: the  qualification given to an incident by a CERT (if any) would not necessarily be retained by  investigators, nor by prosecutors, or ultimately by courts.  It is of particular interest in this respect that several interviewees noted the importance of breach  notification obligations, e.g. in the context of the telecommunications sector, the financial services  industry or in the recently proposed Directive on Network and Information Security, as an additional  tool for creating a more substantive and comprehensive knowledge base on major ICT incidents and  their apparent impact. Of course, these notifications would not be inherently sufficient to provide  the data required by the Directive on Attacks against Information Systems (as they are not  specifically linked to the criminal qualifications presented in the Directive), but they could ultimately  contribute to forming a more comprehensive ecosystem of incident related data.  Responses also indicated a reluctance towards the comprehensiveness of this data collection  effort: while some countries indicated that they could indeed identify prosecutions and convictions  for the incidents enumerated in the Directive, they none the less cautioned that some cases could be  given a qualification that did not match the provisions of the Directive. E.g. a case of spear phishing  might ultimately be prosecuted simply as fraud and result in a conviction on this basis, despite the  fact that this might clearly qualify as identity theft as described above.  Additionally, interviewees cautioned against the known ‘dark number’ problem, i.e. the known fact  that cybercrime is very significantly underreported32, especially when incidents are committed  against reputation-sensitive victims such as banks, who have an incentive to see incidents solved  without formal investigation or prosecution, as these could result in greater visibility and thus  greater reputational damage. Thus, statistical data could be useful to show trends, but would be  entirely unsuitable to assess the actual scope of cybercrime problems.  32  Discussed e.g. in the Council of the European Union’s Note of 20 September 2013 on the Implementation EU  Policy cycle for organised and serious international crime: Multi-Annual Strategic Plan (MASP) related to the  EU crime priority \"cybercrime\"; see http://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/sep/eu-council-cosi-masp-2014- 2017-cybercrime-12759-rev3-13.pdf [Last accessed 22 October, 2013], p.2  http://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/sep/eu-council-cosi-masp-2014-2017-cybercrime-12759-rev3-13.pdf http://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/sep/eu-council-cosi-masp-2014-2017-cybercrime-12759-rev3-13.pdf  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  30  Finally, the respondents noted that statistics would measure identical facts differently in different  countries: the aforementioned case of spear phishing could be prosecuted as fraud in one Member  State and as identity theft in another, despite having the exact same factual background. Thus,  statistics would not be comparable between countries, in the absence of a common EU level  prosecutorial approach.  Despite this apparent scepticism, some good practices and suggestions have also been identified, as  will be briefly discussed below.  Identified good practices 5.2.2  Within some countries, data collection has been successful in specific context, and/or projects are  ongoing to improve and streamline data collection:   In Ireland, data collection within the financial sector works relatively effectively: there is an  information sharing platform for this sector where incident reports can be exchanged. This  operates as a trusted network and a relatively closed environment, where there is less fear  of publicity leaks. Similarly, gathering data from businesses is more complex than from  citizens, because they have a greater commercial risk linked to openness. Collecting data  from incidents that target citizens might be easier (spam, phishing, identity theft), given that  this fear is less present, and this could have the benefit of increasing awareness among  citizens.   Romania notes that it faces the same challenges as most other countries: data collection is  done systematically by the police, but the data is not always published. Prosecution data is  also available and held by prosecutors. However, there is currently a project on-going  between the police and prosecutors to bundle this information into joint statistics. There is  no public data available yet right now, but the project should be completed by the end of  the year, and statistics should be available at that time. Bundling data from all sources –  CERT, police, prosecutors and courts – would be a good practice.   Data collection is done systematically in France, at least for those specific crimes  enumerated in the current Directive. For cybercrime offenses outside of that (e.g. fraud  committed using a computer/via the Internet), statistics are not available because there is  no specifically defined infraction for fraud on the Internet in French law, so that no separate  convictions on this point are available (only for fraud in general). There are however  numbers for investigations and convictions in 2011 for the crimes in the Directive.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  31  Reflections on the findings 5.2.3  5.3 Reporting  Summary of interview outcomes  5.3.1  As noted in the sections above, some countries have an information source in place, and some of  these publish periodic statistical reports. However, it is relatively rare that a single coordinated  report is published containing information from all stakeholders (law enforcement, prosecutors,  courts, etc.). Furthermore, reports are sometimes only made available for internal use, and not  shared with the public.  In the sections below, we will identify some of the main reporting practices.  Identified good practices  5.3.2  Several countries have indicated that reports are already made publicly available on-line:   In Belgium, statistics are published to some extent, although separately for the police and  for courts. See e.g. http://www.polfed- fedpol.be/pub/rapport_activites/crimestats2011_nl.php (p.55) for the police’s cybercrime  statistics and http://www.om-mp.be/sa/jstat2011/n/home.html for the Ministry of Justice’s  statistics.   As also noted above, data collection is done systematically in France, at least for those  specific crimes enumerated in the Directive. There are numbers for investigations and  convictions in 2011 , and a new report will in principle be released in the course of 2013 by  In countries which have multiple information sources (and the interview outcomes  suggest that all Member States are in this situation) a coordinating body would need  to be designated to collect comparable information and to draft reports.  The existing and emerging legal frameworks for breach notification obligations offer a  unique opportunity for establishing a more comprehensive and coordinated  ecosystem of incident related data. While breach notifications do not contain direct  information on the legal qualification of incidents, nor on their prosecution or the  outcome thereof, it can be reasonably foreseen that at least a number of notifications  will be a trigger for cybercrime investigations, prosecutions and possibly convictions.  The processes for handling breach notifications should thus be aligned with the  terminology and approach envisaged by the Directive to facilitate the collection of  comparable European statistical data.  In the longer term, better alignment is needed with respect to semantics and  prosecutorial policies across the EU, at least if the goal is to obtain comparable  statistics across the EU. If the goal is merely to be able to assess cybercrime trends at  the national level without EU scale comparisons, then such alignment is not strictly  needed.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  32  the ONDRP (French criminal statistics agency - Observatoire national de la délinquance et  des réponses pénales): see http://www.inhesj.fr/fr/ondrp/les-publications/rapports-annuels.  Recommendations for the implementation 5.3.3  As with the data collection recommendation above, for reporting purposes too it would  be necessary to designate a coordinating body to collect comparable information and  to draft reports, and it would be necessary to improve alignment with respect to  semantics and prosecutorial policies across the EU, at least if the goal is to obtain  comparable reports across the EU. If the goal is merely to be able to assess cybercrime  trends at the national level without EU scale comparisons, then such alignment is not  strictly needed.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  33  6 Conclusions – good practices and open issues  6.1 Good practices for the implementation of the Directive  As shown in the analysis above, many of the new topics introduced by the Directive have already  been addressed in some countries through good practices. These are briefly summarised in the table  below, which can be used as a tool to support implementation activities in the Member States.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  34  Topic  Observed good practice  Country or organisation where the practice  was observed  All substantive criminal provisions (illegal access, illegal  interception, tools for committing offenses)  The publication of guidance on the interpretation and  application of the law, and particularly on the element of  intent (i.e. the unlawfulness – without right). This can be done  in the form of prosecution guidelines in countries that permit  this, and/or in the form of jurisprudence overviews to show  how courts apply the law in reality. Guidance should also  explicitly cover conduct that is considered lawful, such as the  activities of CERTs or security professionals.  UK, Sweden and Portugal  All substantive criminal provisions (illegal access, illegal  interception, tools for committing offenses)  Implementing legislation should be clear and explicit, and  include clear carve-outs of the applicability of the provision  for the normal activities of CERTs, academic institutions,  researchers, network operators and security service  professionals, and any actions undertaken at the lawful  request of businesses, governments and end users.  France (carve-outs not included in legislation, but  explicitly discussed in Parliamentary discussions)  Botnets & identity theft Implementing legislation should avoid using technology  specific terminology. It should focus on the exact harm that  technologically enabled crimes cause. E.g. rather than  introduce the concept of botnets or DDoS attacks, UK  legislation was amended to make it an offence to deliberately  or recklessly impair the operation of any computer or  program, or reliability of data, or to prevent or hinder access  to data. Similarly, French and Italian identity theft initiatives  focus on the intent to cause harm as a precondition for  criminalisation, and emphasise the importance of respecting  freedom of expression.  UK, France, Italy  Botnets & identity theft CERTs can benefit from the development of standardised  processes or playbooks for taking appropriate action to  respond to botnets or incidents of identity theft. These  should e.g. cover the questions that CERTs would need to ask,  what information and recommendations they should provide,  and what could proportionately and lawfully be done by  service providers. This would also be useful to strengthen the  Romania, France  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  35  image and perceived usefulness of CERTs (and law  enforcement) for criminals.  CERT mandates The definition of a clear mandate is crucial: private CERTs and  academic CERTs benefit from implementing clear  agreements with their constituency that define precisely what  their remit and competences are. Public CERTs benefit from a  clear legal framework that grants them clear authorities and  powers.  While a close integration of public CERTs and law  enforcement has efficiency benefits, it also means that  network operators and service providers may become less  willing to share information with a CERT, due to the concern  that the CERT will not only serve its traditional ‘fire brigade’  role, but also contribute to initiating legal proceedings. The  latter may be beneficial from a public policy perspective, but  can be (perceived as) highly negative for service providers,  since they lose the option of informally consulting the CERT.  Thus, if public CERTs are integrated with law enforcement  agencies, additional effort will be required to set up a trust  relationship with the constituency of the public CERT.  UK, Sweden  Cooperation between CERTs and private industry It is crucial for CERTs to work in partnership with  representatives of key sectors, including a large telcos and  banks. This can be done through ISACs (Information Sharing  and Analysis Center), that allow all stakeholders – law  enforcement, CERTs and private companies – to identify and  address issues that they face and establish streamlined  cooperation processes.  Netherlands  Data protection compliance within CERTs CERTs should maintain a close working relationship with their  data protection authorities, in order be able to obtain quick  advice when needed. This was noted to be important to  maintain trust of the CERT constituency (such as ISPs).  Slovenia  Data collection and statistical analysis While statistical data is often available at various levels  (CERTs, police/law enforcement, prosecutors, courts, etc),  coordination and bundling of this data is very rare. A  coordinating body can be designated to collect comparable  information and to draft reports.  Romania (test project to be initiated at the end of  2013)  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  36  6.2 Open issues and possible future actions  Despite the good practices as noted above, there are also a number of areas where further guidance  or follow up actions would be necessary. These are briefly summarised in the table below, which can  be used as a resource for further support actions for each of the stakeholders identified. Topics  already covered by the good practices above were not included further in the table below; however,  it is of course clear that such practices could be the basis for future actions in countries that have not  yet implemented them.  As can be seen, further follow-up activities at the EU level are also proposed, including potential  future actions in which ENISA could play a role, in a logical continuation of its support to the CERT  community in the fight against cybercrime through targeted support activities. In this manner, ENISA  could play a further enabling role in the successful implementation and application of the Directive  on Attacks against Information Systems.  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  37  Topic  Recommended future action  Entity responsible for the action  All substantive criminal provisions (illegal access, illegal  interception, tools for committing offenses)  Collection and dissemination of guidance on the  interpretation and application of the law at the EU level  could help to ensure homogeneous application of the law  across the European territory. Guidance should also  explicitly cover conduct that is considered lawful, such as  the activities of CERTs or security professionals.  Could be done by ENISA as a part of its support activities  to CERTs, or by the European Commission as a part of  implementation support activities.  Implementation strategy Member States should assess carefully whether new  legislation is necessary to achieve the effects of the  Directive under existing law, and if so, to implement the  required changes through generic and technology neutral  language. This would achieve the desired outcome while  avoiding the risk of putting in place language that creates  new technical discussions or escape routes for criminal  behaviour.  Member State legislators  Enforcement strategies Joint coordinated actions between law enforcement,  CERTs and the private sector (such as network operators)  are recommended. CERTs and the private sector should  avoid taking actions without law enforcement support, as  this might solve a single attack but ultimately leaves the  criminals unharmed.  Law enforcement, CERTs and private industry  Enforcement strategies Simple cases (e.g. of identity theft) can often be solved by  requesting service providers to take voluntary action,  such as removal of the offending materials from any public  website. This approach is often more efficient than formal  legal proceedings. However, such requests must be  carefully considered in order to minimise the impact on  potential future proceedings. Deletion could result in the  destruction of evidence, making future legal actions  against criminals impossible or at least substantially  harder. For this reason, alignment is needed between  CERTS and law enforcement to agree upon appropriate  action for specific instances, including e.g. determining  when making data inaccessible is more appropriate than  requesting deletion.  Law enforcement and CERTs (depending on the level of  intervention)  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  38  Communication between CERTs and law enforcement It would be advisable to examine how feedback could be  provided from law enforcement to CERTs on any matters  reported by the CERT or in which the CERT intervened. To  protect the secrecy of ongoing investigations, such  information could only be provided at the aggregate (non- case specific) level.  Could be done by ENISA as a part of its support activities  to CERTs, or by the EC3; European alignment on this topic  would be beneficial.  Data protection compliance With respect to data sharing, pragmatic guidance at the  EU level, e.g. from the Article 29 Working Party, on the  interpretation and impact of data protection rules for  CERTs and network operators in their day-to-day security  related activities is still needed. While the theoretical  framework and the potential consequences are well  known, CERTs and service providers are still largely  experimenting on what type of monitoring, analysis and  reporting activities (to customers, CERTs or LEA) are lawful,  and which activities are excessive. This has a stifling effect  on the fight against cybercrime.  Article 29 Working Party  Identity theft National laws should clarify the importance of the criminal  intent of the alleged ID thief, and to stress that the  provisions should be interpreted and applied taking into  account the legitimate exercise of the fundamental right  to freedom of expression. It would not be feasible or  desirable to enumerate cases covered by this fundamental  right (such as parody, satire, societal criticism, polemic  discussion, etc.), but the primacy of this fundamental right  should be recognized in order to support the development  of rational and consistent case law. The interpretation of  the balance between criminal conduct and controversial  but legal free speech should be left to the courts; CERTs  should at any rate not play a role in assessing the balance.  Member State legislators  Assistance requests Even within the EU, replies to information requests were  often delayed or partial. Misunderstandings with respect  to the scope of requests were commonly a part of the  cause. Streamlining/standardisation of communications  between the 24/7 network might be useful, which could  be done by establishing templates for the most common  information requests. For assistance requests sent via  Europol/Interpol, the possibility exists to append codes to  EC3, given its role in EU level cooperation and  coordination  The Directive on attacks against information systems  A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems  Page  39  the information requests that indicate which information  may be disseminated to other contact points. This is a  minor but useful example of a standardisation mechanism  that can be very effective.  International cooperation International cooperation with partners outside of the EU  (e.g. with non-EU Southeast European countries, Asian and  African countries) is still at an immature level. This should  also be supported through face-to-face meetings between  law enforcement representatives, as a key first step to  building trust and identifying effective contacts. This is  important to address current policy gaps: bullet proof  hosting services are a challenge that is currently  unaffected by EU initiatives, as these services are almost  universally established outside the EU.  Law enforcement and CERTs, to be enabled via ENISA or  EC3  National organisation Every country should have a single contact point for  information requests, irrespective of their national  competences or organisational model. The contact point  can then delegate any requests as necessary according to  internal policy rules and principles, but this internal back  office process should be irrelevant and invisible to foreign  law enforcement bodies.  Member States  Data collection and statistical analysis In the longer term, better alignment is needed with  respect to semantics and prosecutorial policies across the  EU, if the goal is to obtain comparable statistics across the  EU. Crimes have different meanings in different countries,  and identical incidents can be qualified differently from  country to country, making statistics incomparable.

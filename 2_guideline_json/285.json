As stipulated by Article 49.3 of the Cybersecurity Act, “When preparing a candidate scheme,  ENISA shall consult all relevant stakeholders by means of a formal, open, transparent and  inclusive consultation process.” ENISA has therefore organised a public consultation from July,2  to July, 31 2020.  This report presents the outcome of this consultation. It contains 3 chapters. Under Chapter 1  the approach and process of the public consultation are explained. Under Chapter 2 the actual  analysis of the results is presented of which the main outcomes are outlined below:  The survey was designed in seven different sections with questions related to:   The contributors  o Important fact is that the contributors represent a broad spectrum of actors  involved in ICT products certification ensuring that input is received from all  different angles.  o Manufacturers/developers represented 37 % and the conformity assessment  bodies (certification bodies and ITSEFs/testing laboratories) 24 % of the total  number of respondents.  o 77% of the participants indicated EU/EEA as their country of establishment  and 20% as non-EU/EEA. Further to that, 32% indicated that their country of  establishment participates in the SOG-IS MRA and 33% that their country of  establishment is a member of the Common Criteria Recognition  Arrangement (CCRA).   The intend to use the draft candidate EUCC scheme: 33% of the respondents  indicated to envisage having ICT products certified under the EUCC scheme  (manufacturers/producers/developers and trade organisations) and 25% indicated to  have their products certified; generating a demand side that is more or less in balance  with the activity of contributors.   The transition from current scheme (SOG-IS or national schemes) to EUCC  scheme; 64% of the survey participants agreed that the choices made in the EUCC  scheme will have a positive impact on the transition from current activities. 32% were  neutral and only 4% were of the opinion that the impact will not be positive. The need  of guidance to support transition was noted.  2 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 April 2019 on ENISA  (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity  certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act).  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  4   The opinion on the new elements that were developed in the EUCC scheme, such  as:  o Conditions for issuing, maintenance, renewal and continuation of  certifications  o Monitoring & handling of non-compliances and non-conformities  o Vulnerability handling procedures  o Patch management procedures to support vulnerability handling  is the following: 70% of the survey participants agreed that these improvements will  have a positive impact on the certification of ICT products. 24% were neutral and only  6% were of the opinion that the impact will not be positive. Additional comments led to  some adjustments in the scheme.   The guidance that is needed for stakeholders related to the implementation of the  scheme: respondents preferred written guidance (33%), webinars (19%) and training  (19%). Some comments resulted in an extension of the topics that needed further  guidance, respondents also brought up new concepts to improve implementation that  may need further attention.   The opinion on the impact of the EUCC scheme on market conditions: the use of  a harmonised label and a QR code to easily upload certification information and the  possibility to establish generic specifications for products through certified Protection  Profiles, was welcomed by 75% of the participants who agreed that these provisions  will have a positive impact on EU market conditions while 16% were neutral and only  10% were of the opinion that the impact will not be positive.   The opinion on the maintenance of the EUCC scheme: comments were collected  and analysed.   Any additional comments of the stakeholders are listed under section 2.9 of this  report.  In addition, Chapter 3 provides an insight in the main transformations to the initial version 1.0 of  the candidate EUCC scheme, according to comments made. The revised version 1.1 will be  submitted to the ECCG for its opinion.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  5  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  Following the request from the European Commission in accordance with Article 48.2 of the  Cybersecurity Act3 (hereinafter referred to as CSA as indicated in the glossary), ENISA has set  up an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) to support the preparation of a candidate EU  cybersecurity certification scheme to serve as a successor to the existing schemes operating  under the SOG-IS MRA (Senior Officials Group Information Systems Security Mutual  Recognition Agreement).  Based on the outcomes from this AHWG, launched on November 27th, 2019 and composed of  twenty (20) selected members representing industry (e.g., developers, evaluators), as well as  around twelve (12) participants from accreditation bodies and EU Members States, regular  discussions within the ECCG and after an internal review, ENISA has consolidated in the very  beginning of July 2020 a candidate scheme, the EUCC scheme.  As required by Article 49.3 of the Cybersecurity Act, “When preparing a candidate scheme,  ENISA shall consult all relevant stakeholders by means of a formal, open, transparent and  inclusive consultation process.” ENISA has therefore launched a public consultation from  July,2nd  to July, 31st 2020.  1.1 WHY A PUBLIC CONSULTATION  The 20 experts composing the AHWG established to support ENISA for the development of the  EUCC candidate scheme do represent a very good selection of the relevant stakeholders that  may be involved into the use of such of scheme, if and when adopted through EU legislation.  With their support, ENISA could therefore successfully establish a first version 1.0 of this  scheme in accordance with the time constrains given to this project. However, the  improvements to the existing SOG-IS schemes proposed as to cover the requirements of the  CSA will have a significant impact on current activities.  In addition, as the EUCC is the first candidate scheme, and therefore its draft establishes a first  set of “interpretations” of the CSA. The understanding on what these are and how they should  be reflected in a clear and unambiguous way in this scheme is important. Therefore, the  feedback of the external readers is also crucial. Finally, ENISA is engaged into the development  of another candidate scheme, related to Cloud services, which targets a potentially different  audience than the Common Criteria community, but will benefit from the outcome of the EUCC.  As a result, ENISA decided to establish the necessary consultation required by Article 49.3 of  the CSA by means of a public consultation, open to any party, directly accessible on its website,  and without any limitation of participation.  As such, the public consultation was expected to give the chance to the Agency to collect the  opinions, feedback on technical, procedural, practical and explanatory fields of stakeholders in  order to align and improve the current draft of the scheme and bring it into the final stage.  3 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 April 2019 on ENISA  (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity  certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act).  A cybersecurity  certification  scheme is  developed in  collaboration with  all stakeholders  involved, taking  into consideration  all aspects and  angles of the  certification  process.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  7  1.2 CONSULTATION PROCESS  For the public consultation the EU Survey4 tool was used that enables parties to participate  online at any given moment and save and/or print their input in PDF version. To encourage the  public to provide feedback, the announcement of the public consultation was presented on the  ENISA website with a news item and was also pushed through social media enabling interested  parties to participate not only within, but also outside the European Union.  The public consultation was opened from July 2nd until July 31st 2020. Besides the public, the  European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG- consisting of representatives of national  cybersecurity certification authorities or representatives of other relevant national authorities  and invited stakeholders and relevant third parties that participate in the work)5 and the  Stakeholder Cybersecurity certification Group (SCCG- composed of members selected from  among recognised experts representing the relevant stakeholders)6 were invited to participate in  the consultation. The results of the ECCG are published in a separate report, as they reflect the  opinions of the Member States, as such. The public collection of feedback from different  stakeholders, together with the feedback from the ECCG, will help to consolidate the draft  scheme with the opinions of all relevant stakeholders.  The public consultation report includes recommendations proposed by the Agency in terms of  proposed changes and/or action points that are listed for uptake.  ENISA reconvened the AHWG that had been put in a “dormant” phase, as to analyse and  review the comments made, and to establish the necessary updates of the scheme. The  elements provided by ENISA to the AHWG were sanitized prior to the analysis and review  (removal of any indication on which individual or company/entity would have made the  comments).  The AHWG received separately the comments provided by the Member States that accepted to  share them with the group.  Upon presentation to the ECCG, SCCG and the Commission, the consultation results included  in this report with the identified necessary changes and defined action points, are now made  public.  1.3 PROCESSING THE RECEIVED DATA  The survey was designed in seven different sections with questions related to:   The contributors   The intend to use the draft EUCC candidate scheme   The transition from current schemes (SOG-IS or national scheme)   The opinion on the new elements that were developed in the EUCC scheme  o Conditions for issuing, maintenance, renewal and continuation of  certifications  o Monitoring & handling of non-compliances and non-conformities  o Vulnerability handling procedures  o Patch management procedures to support vulnerability handling   The guidance that is needed for stakeholders related to the implementation of the  scheme   The opinion on the impact of the EUCC scheme on market conditions  4 https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/  5 See Art. 62 CSA.  6 See Art. 22 CSA.  https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  8   The opinion on the maintenance of the EUCC scheme   Any additional comments of the stakeholders.  This report formulates the opinions received as well as the questions and concerns raised.  The outcome of the survey is processed in a way that it is providing insights for all respondents  as well as for the Agency, the Commission and the ECCG and SCCG. Upon each graphic,  diagram ENISA presents and provides explanatory text and remarks to assist the reader in the  clarification of the outcome. For some outcomes it is of relevance to analyse the feedback  provided and relate it to the background of the participants providing insights into the different  interests respondents may have depending on their activity.  None of the questions in this consultation were presented as mandatory to answer. In order to  provide a clear insight the percentages in each question were adjusted according to the replies  submitted, the non-answered questions are also indicated.  Lastly, for some questions participants could select more than one responses, as to better  depict their background, interest and/or expectation(s).  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  9  2. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  2.1 THE CONTRIBUTORS  In total 114 respondents participated in the survey. ENISA indeed welcomed the balanced  contributions from 37 producers, manufacturers and developers, 24 bodies that issue  certificates or perform conformity assessment, 19 interest groups from industry or sectorial  associations, 23 stakeholder interest groups such as trade organisations, distributors,  consultancy firms, research institutions and Academia. 17 Member States and governmental  institutions/bodies and National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities (NCCA’s) and  Accreditation bodies. Lastly, 8 participants indicated that they are affiliated with standards  developing organizations.  It should be noted that participants were able to select more than one option for this topic.  Important fact is that the contributors represent a brought spectrum of actors involved in  certification ensuring that input is received from all different angles.  The limited representation of consumer groups is to be noted, and gives indication to ENISA for  the development of a communication plan, for the implementation phase of this scheme, that  will make sure consumers are well informed of what cybersecurity certification of ICT products  entails, and can find cybersecurity support related to the certified product.  Figure 1: Survey Participants' Composition  Recommendation #1: During the implementation phase of the EUCC scheme, a  communication plan will be established. The plan will include  communication with consumers to ensure they are well informed in  what cybersecurity certification of ICT products entails.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  10  2.2 GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF PARTICIPANTS  Figure 2 reveals a broad spectrum of participating countries, but looking at the number of  participants per country, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium showed the largest  percentage of participants in the consultation.  77% of the participants indicated EU/EEA as their country of establishment and 20% as non-  EU/EEA. Further to that, 32% indicated that their country of establishment participates in the  SOG-IS MRA and 33% that their country of establishment is a member of the Common Criteria  Recognition Arrangement (CCRA). As this first scheme is built upon the current SOG-IS MRA  certification mechanism, it is understandable that the SOG-IS MRA participants and the CCRA  members in particular are participating in the feedback of the EUCC scheme. 28% indicated that  their country of establishment has experience in relevant national certification schemes and only  2% indicated that their country does not has relevant experience, indicating that most parties  that responded have experience with cybersecurity certification.  The relative high number of participants from the USA is also to be noted.  Figure 2: Geographic Composition of Participants  For the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework to become effective, it is important that  Member States and countries in the European Economic Area who are currently not involved or  engaged in the SOG-IS certification and have the intention to participate in the EUCC scheme,  are supported and enabled in the setting up of the certification mechanism. The Commission  and experienced SOG-IS Member States could consider to set up a programme to provide the  opportunity to set up and gain experience in cybersecurity certification issuance to enhance and  increase the certification capability and participation.  Recommendation #2: Ease the participation of interested EU Member States newcomers  to cybersecurity certification to participate to the EUCC scheme by  a dedicated training programme  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  11  2.3 INTENTION TO USE THE EUCC SCHEME  82% of the participants indicated their intention to use the EUCC scheme. 18% (13 participants)  indicated not to intend to use the EUCC scheme. From EU /EEA perspective 80% of the  participants from EU/EEA countries indicated that they intend to use the EUCC scheme, even if  it is voluntary, while 61% of the participants outside EU/EEA indicated that they also intend to  use the EUCC scheme.  Some EU/EEA countries that currently are not involved in the SOG-IS certification and  participated in the survey indicated that they intend to start using the EUCC scheme, this is why  we recommend to support these countries in their intent to participate.  Figure 3: Intention to use the EUCC scheme  2.4 ENVISIONED PURPOSES OF USING THE EUCC SCHEME  33% of the respondents indicated to envisage having their ICT products certified under the  EUCC scheme (manufacturers/producers/developers and trade organisations), 25% indicated  they intended to use certified products, and 29% they intended to develop certification related  activities (as a CB or ITSEF), showing a purpose to use the EUCC scheme very much in line  with the profile of the respondents.  Many of the manufacturers/producers/developers and trade organisations indicated that they  currently certify their products under the SOG-IS scheme and have every intention to extend  their certificate to the EU level:  “For our products in the verticals of telecommunication, identity, payment and transit Common  Criteria security certification on a high level is a key selling proposition. The high level of  assurance needs to be highly visible to our customers.”  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  12  Figure 4: Envisioned use of the EUCC scheme  Others indicated the market perspective as reason:  “As we wish to assess the security quality of our ICT products against a uniform and consensus-  based certification scheme which is recognized by all relevant parties, including telecom  operators, suppliers and regulators, to jointly enhance cybersecurity for ICT industry.”  “As a private business aiming to make organisations more secure and resilient to cyber threats,  we will certify our products to indicate even further their trustworthiness. Likewise, we intend to  make the forthcoming certification a major requirement for our supply chain”  “As an IT-consultancy enterprise, we intend to primarily develop certification activities as an  Evaluation Facility/Testing Laboratory (ITSEF), not as a Certification Body (CB). Secondly, we  intend to prescribe certifications at the partners we collaborate with, to take the responsibilities  we have on the area of security.”  Other participants indicate the certification intentions, depending on market considerations:  “We are committed to considering certification activities using the EUCC scheme, although any  decision would depend on market demand, product development cycle, evaluation lead time,  among other considerations.”  Parties that indicate not to intend using the EUCC scheme provided their reasons to do so:  “We operate our own global certification programme with a methodology developed on best  security evaluation principles to deliver cybersecurity products at a high assurance level. Our  scheme already provides similar benefits and there is not a need to duplicate these efforts.”  Others indicate the non-applicability:  “Our organization does not currently produce ICT products that would benefit from certification  against 'substantial' or 'high ratings'. However, we may use ICT products from other  manufacturers/providers in the assembly of our products.”  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  13  Some SMEs provided a different reason:  “The approach is not SME-friendly. The CC (and ISO/IEC 15408) has generally proved to be  difficult to apply and unaffordable to SMEs. We advise to tailor a scheme to the levels of risks  and size of organizations (and their roles in a value chain).”  2.5 TRANSITION FROM THE SOG-IS MRA TO THE EUCC SCHEME  The draft candidate EUCC scheme included a number of transitional measures and  recommendations to support a transition from the SOG-IS MRA to the EUCC scheme. These  transitional measures relate to:   The extensive reuse of the Joint Interpretation Library (JIL) mandatory supporting  documents:    The continuation of the Technical Domains of Smart Cards and similar devices and of  Hardware Devices with Security Boxes:    Governance of the scheme by the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  (ECCG) and relevant subgroups.  64% of the survey participants agreed that these choices will have a positive impact on the  transition. 32% were neutral and only 4% were of the opinion that the impact will not be  positive.  Figure 5: Positive impact of transitional measures from the SOG-IS MRA to the EUCC  In addition to these responses, 63% of the participants foresaw possible issues related to the  transition that they may run into. The relative large percentage of neutral scores deserves more  attention in order to learn what the related issues are.  The responses to the question as to what should be considered to be necessary in order to  successfully implement the transition from SOG-IS MRA schemes to the EUCC scheme  differed:   some participants pointed to the fact that this is the first scheme that is designed to be  applied horizontally to all industry domains and products;  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  14   others indicated that they like to have additional information as to how the transition in  practice will be organised, as they were in need of support in their certification  migration process;   or pointed towards the uncertainty in processing time as certification is considered  complex and time critical;   indicated that it might be useful to design a requirement mapping to get better insights  into what is needed to make the transfer successful for them;   emphasized the importance of mutual recognition on a worldwide basis;   brought up that self-declaration and the assurance level “basic” is not addressed by  the scheme;   expressed their concerns to the fact that the review of the NIS directive and the Radio  Equipment Directive might impact the security requirements in their sectors and  subsequently also have impact on the cybersecurity certification framework;   asked for clear communication to avoid confusion between existing & future schemes.  This information provides valuable insights and helps ENISA to design guidance that provides  clarification in the process and support in how to approach the migration effectively and  efficiently. It is clear that the EUCC scheme will be subject to maintenance and will adapt to  either legal, economical changes and/or technological innovations and improvements. The  EUCC scheme will be subject to continuous contributions to the evaluation of the certification  processes and the regular analysis of the main trends in the cybersecurity market both to the  demand and supply side as indicated under article 8 of the CSA.7  The estimated timeline indicated by participants for efficient transition varies between 1-3 years  with a slight majority for 2 years.  2.6 IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE SOG-IS MRA TO THE EUCC SCHEME  Based on the relevant CSA provisions, the draft candidate EUCC scheme included a number of  improvements to further advance the current SOG-IS MRA and to ensure assurance continuity  of the certificates. These improvements cover:   the maintenance of the certificates,   harmonised activities related to the monitoring and handling of non-compliances and  non-conformities,   harmonised conditions for vulnerability handling and disclosure   the introduction of a patch management mechanism to support vulnerability handling.  70% of the survey participants agreed that these improvements will have a positive impact on  the certification scheme. 24% were neutral and only 6% were of the opinion that the impact will  not be positive. Out of the participants that indicated their country of establishment, 69% (57  responses) from EU/EEA countries indicated that they agree and strongly agree that impact will  be positive, 28% (23 responses) were neutral and 3% (3 responses) disagreed or strongly  disagreed.  7 Article 8 (4) and 8 (7) CSA.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  15  Figure 6: Positive impact of improvements from the SOG-IS MRA to the EUCC  Looking at the 24 % of neutrality towards the indicated improvements, comments relate in  particular to:   a call for more flexibility on possible delays, suspensions periods, embargo and  communication to customers, associated with concerns about some indicated timelines  that seem ‘ambitious’ and not based yet upon best practice;   standards for vulnerability management already under development for some  industries;   questions about the maintenance of these new elements and the cooperation amongst  stakeholders in these new processes and compliance to these processes, with the call  for the use of a public forum instead of a closed working group under NDA;   the need for periodic feedback on the implementation of the scheme from relevant  types of actors e.g. by means of setting out a request for consultation (such as this  one);   for future maintenance and reviews of the EUCC scheme, the request to get  reasonable time in advance (e.g. 6 months in advance) to ensure providing high quality  responses and eventually contribute to continuous improvement of the certification  program as such.   the proposal to adjust these new processes upon a risk based approach, meaning that  for lower risk products the effort should be accordingly limited.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  16  2.7 FORM OF GUIDANCE TO BE DEVELOPED  Figure 7: Form of guidance  Looking at the indicated preferences for guidance, most participants indicated the importance of  written guidance as this provides reproducible material. These guidance supports may either be  combined with trainings, webinars or conferences and consultation rounds.  The different types  of guidance should be adjusted in line with the maintenance of the scheme.  A selection of ideas that were brought forward as ‘other ideas’ are listed below:   Set up a community slack channel or similar chat-like environment. Similar to OWASP  where one can issue questions and discuss with others working on the same topic;   Develop tooling for evaluation (preparation);   Developing a common virtual laboratory to prepare efficiently for evaluations/pentests   Mutual virtual visits or learning exercises and field trips for stakeholders to share  experiences, observe functioning certification system in place;   A platform where adopted methodologies and workflows can be shared and  demonstrated.  2.8 IMPACT OF THE EUCC SCHEME ON EU MARKET CONDITIONS  Based on the relevant CSA provisions, the candidate EUCC includes a number of aspects to  enhance the market conditions for the certified ICT products (both under the EUCC scheme and  future schemes). These aspects include:   An EU certificate will be valid throughout the entire European Union;   The certificates issued will also include a label that is associated to the EUCC scheme;   The label will be designed in a harmonised and clearly recognisable way across all EU  cybersecurity certification schemes;   The label will have a QR code associated to the certificate;   The QR code will provide access to the relevant publicly available certification  information and other related information regarding the Cybersecurity Certification  Framework under the Website on European cybersecurity certification schemes;   Stakeholder communities will have the possibility to establish generic specifications for  their products through certified Protection Profiles.  75% of the participants agreed that these provisions will have a positive impact on EU market  conditions while 16% were neutral and only 10% were of the opinion that the impact will not be  positive. Out of the participants that indicated their country of establishment, 76% (64  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  17  responses) from EU/EEA countries indicated that they agree and strongly agree that impact will  be positive, 14% (12 responses) were neutral and 10% (8 responses) disagreed or strongly  disagreed. From non EU/EEA countries, 70% (14 responses) indicated that they agree and  strongly agree that impact will be positive, 20% (4 responses) were neutral and 10% (2  responses) disagreed or strongly disagreed.  Figure 8: Positive impact of the EUCC scheme on EU market conditions  The participants that indicated a ‘neutral’ impact on market conditions, indicated remarks related  to the maintenance and transition, recognition and guidance with some of them already  presented in the previous sections of this report.  2.9 IMPORTANT ASPECTS RELATED TO THE EUCC SCHEME  Upon the question to the participants on what additional important aspects the Agency should  take into consideration, the following is a selection of the points that were addressed multiple  times:   Reusability of evidence, protection profiles, continuation of existing certificates, and a  lightweight way to migrate protection profiles and certificates from existing schemes  into the EUCC should be possible. The approach towards reuse of evidence of CBs in  different countries should be harmonised as harmonisation of acceptance of evidence  is crucial for composition;   Composition of certificates is very important to accommodate products based on  certified building blocks; such composition should not only be possible within the  EUCC scheme but also reusing existing evidence, PPs and certificates from legacy  schemes for a suitable transition period;   “The mapping of VAN.3 to \"high\" will weaken the significance of \"high resistance\" and  open the door to marketing campaign promoting \"high\" whereas the resistance is not;   Discussion on cryptographic analysis is missing in the EUCC proposal. However, this  is an important topic to be clarified in EUCC scheme as currently one SOG-IS  governmental agency performs a cryptographic analysis for the evaluation of a  product, while other EU SOG-IS agencies do not. It is important that harmonization on  this aspect is considered in the EUCC scheme;  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  18   The workflows and roles have to be described clearly and have to be published;   The decision structure for the maintenance of the scheme has to be described clearly  and has to be published;   The derogation of Art. 56. 6b of the CSA offers to provide for a chance for private  schemes to get involved in the EUCC, but should be described more clearly;   Monitoring and metrics of performance of the NCCAs and CABs should be introduced  so the required agile management of security issues are ensured;   The scheme is intended to be voluntary, however some are also considering a possible  future in which certification becomes required as result of regulatory mandate, market  pressure, or both. This can only be done at a moment the certification processes are  mature, cost efficient and have proven to be effective;   Next to a principle-based security and privacy framework, there is a need for dynamic  assurance and continuous certification. Autonomous cars already foresee the need for  continuous monitoring of the security and safety of the vehicle and trustworthiness of  the whole digital ecosystem of self-driving-cars. For the EUCC scheme to be effective,  it is imperative that it takes into account the whole ecosystem and not just one  component;   Certification schemes operated by industry or other private organisations are not  mentioned, and fall outside the CSA. The CSA public bodies operating such schemes  should be able to propose that the Commission consider such schemes as a basis for  approving them as a European Cybersecurity Certification scheme. As an example,  private schemes would be recognised if requested to mitigate any duplication impact to  vendors supporting the cards payments industry and digital single market;   The EUCC scheme would benefit from greater use of principles and process based  approaches which are much more scalable and hence effective than evaluation.  Approaches (such as those proposed for high) that mainly focus on vulnerability  searches are particularly costly and ineffective since vulnerabilities are almost always  found in real use;   For products in the verticals of telecommunication, identity, payment and transit  Common Criteria security certification on a high level is a key selling proposition. “The  high level of assurance needs to be highly visible to our customers.”; the security  quality of ICT products needs a uniform and consensus-based certification scheme  which is recognized by all relevant parties, including telecom operators, suppliers and  regulators, to jointly enhance cybersecurity for ICT industry.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  19  3. CONCLUSIONS & ACTIONS TAKEN  3.1 CONCLUSIONS  The EUCC candidate scheme received in majority a positive feedback.  Points that were brought up by stakeholders, experts, groups and participants, encourage  ENISA to further improve the EUCC scheme whether in current adjustments or amendments or  in a later maintenance phase. The feedback that ENISA received also helps to extend the  Cybersecurity Certification Framework upon the lessons learned  Some of the comments received are not addressed, as they were already discussed under the  AHWG. ENISA therefore considered sufficient background had been given into the current  version of the scheme.  In addition, the ECCG8 also proceeded to the review of version 1.0 of the candidate scheme.  Their comments, are not included in this report and processed in a separate report. Their  feedback also contributes to the revisions made within the candidate scheme.  Proposals for adjustments or amendments related to this public survey are described in the next  section. They will be processed into the updated versions of the EUCC candidate scheme, either  through direct changes, or in the form of recommendations for future activities or guidance.  3.2 ACTIONS TAKEN/ TO BE TAKEN  The main changes to the initial version 1.0 of the candidate EUCC scheme that are processed  into the updated version 1.1 are the following:   addition and clarification of definitions;   systematic cooperation with the ECCG for the development of guidance documents  supporting the scheme;   clarification of activities related to the maintenance of certificates;   clarification of deadlines associated to the handling of non-conformities, non-  compliances and vulnerabilities;   modification of the status of the new patch management process, now in annex and for  trial use;   modification of the logo associated to the certificates, allowing to establish an  additional specific logo for the scheme and to mention the evaluation level (AVA_VAN)  achieved in addition to the CSA level;   clarification of the peer assessment requirements and simplification of the associated  annex;   update of annexes 7 and 9 based on their recent evolution within the SOG-IS, and the  addition of one annex related to ST sanitization.  In addition, ENISA considers to launch several actions to improve the capacity to promote and  explain the importance of the use of the EUCC scheme to the EU community and to provide  potential newcomers to EUCC certification with additional information and assistance on  associated deadlines that need to be met and the required conditions, such as engaging into  guidance development or into a dedicated project to develop a communication plan. Moreover,  a transition project should be established in order to provide and ensure the best conditions for  a smooth transfer from the current SOG-IS activities to the EUCC.  8 Article 62 CSA.

As stipulated by Article 49.3 of the Cybersecurity Act, “When preparing a candidate scheme,  ENISA shall consult all relevant stakeholders by means of a formal, open, transparent and  inclusive consultation process.” ENISA has therefore organised a public consultation from July,2  to July, 31 2020.  This report presents the outcome of this consultation. It contains 3 chapters. Under Chapter 1  the approach and process of the public consultation are explained. Under Chapter 2 the actual  analysis of the results is presented of which the main outcomes are outlined below:  The survey was designed in seven different sections with questions related to:   The contributors  o Important fact is that the contributors represent a broad spectrum of actors  involved in ICT products certification ensuring that input is received from all  different angles.  o Manufacturers/developers represented 37 % and the conformity assessment  bodies (certification bodies and ITSEFs/testing laboratories) 24 % of the total  number of respondents.  o 77% of the participants indicated EU/EEA as their country of establishment  and 20% as non-EU/EEA. Further to that, 32% indicated that their country of  establishment participates in the SOG-IS MRA and 33% that their country of  establishment is a member of the Common Criteria Recognition  Arrangement (CCRA).   The intend to use the draft candidate EUCC scheme: 33% of the respondents  indicated to envisage having ICT products certified under the EUCC scheme  (manufacturers/producers/developers and trade organisations) and 25% indicated to  have their products certified; generating a demand side that is more or less in balance  with the activity of contributors.   The transition from current scheme (SOG-IS or national schemes) to EUCC  scheme; 64% of the survey participants agreed that the choices made in the EUCC  scheme will have a positive impact on the transition from current activities. 32% were  neutral and only 4% were of the opinion that the impact will not be positive. The need  of guidance to support transition was noted.  2 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 April 2019 on ENISA  (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity  certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act).  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  4   The opinion on the new elements that were developed in the EUCC scheme, such  as:  o Conditions for issuing, maintenance, renewal and continuation of  certifications  o Monitoring & handling of non-compliances and non-conformities  o Vulnerability handling procedures  o Patch management procedures to support vulnerability handling  is the following: 70% of the survey participants agreed that these improvements will  have a positive impact on the certification of ICT products. 24% were neutral and only  6% were of the opinion that the impact will not be positive. Additional comments led to  some adjustments in the scheme.   The guidance that is needed for stakeholders related to the implementation of the  scheme: respondents preferred written guidance (33%), webinars (19%) and training  (19%). Some comments resulted in an extension of the topics that needed further  guidance, respondents also brought up new concepts to improve implementation that  may need further attention.   The opinion on the impact of the EUCC scheme on market conditions: the use of  a harmonised label and a QR code to easily upload certification information and the  possibility to establish generic specifications for products through certified Protection  Profiles, was welcomed by 75% of the participants who agreed that these provisions  will have a positive impact on EU market conditions while 16% were neutral and only  10% were of the opinion that the impact will not be positive.   The opinion on the maintenance of the EUCC scheme: comments were collected  and analysed.   Any additional comments of the stakeholders are listed under section 2.9 of this  report.  In addition, Chapter 3 provides an insight in the main transformations to the initial version 1.0 of  the candidate EUCC scheme, according to comments made. The revised version 1.1 will be  submitted to the ECCG for its opinion.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  5  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  Following the request from the European Commission in accordance with Article 48.2 of the  Cybersecurity Act3 (hereinafter referred to as CSA as indicated in the glossary), ENISA has set  up an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) to support the preparation of a candidate EU  cybersecurity certification scheme to serve as a successor to the existing schemes operating  under the SOG-IS MRA (Senior Officials Group Information Systems Security Mutual  Recognition Agreement).  Based on the outcomes from this AHWG, launched on November 27th, 2019 and composed of  twenty (20) selected members representing industry (e.g., developers, evaluators), as well as  around twelve (12) participants from accreditation bodies and EU Members States, regular  discussions within the ECCG and after an internal review, ENISA has consolidated in the very  beginning of July 2020 a candidate scheme, the EUCC scheme.  As required by Article 49.3 of the Cybersecurity Act, “When preparing a candidate scheme,  ENISA shall consult all relevant stakeholders by means of a formal, open, transparent and  inclusive consultation process.” ENISA has therefore launched a public consultation from  July,2nd  to July, 31st 2020.  1.1 WHY A PUBLIC CONSULTATION  The 20 experts composing the AHWG established to support ENISA for the development of the  EUCC candidate scheme do represent a very good selection of the relevant stakeholders that  may be involved into the use of such of scheme, if and when adopted through EU legislation.  With their support, ENISA could therefore successfully establish a first version 1.0 of this  scheme in accordance with the time constrains given to this project. However, the  improvements to the existing SOG-IS schemes proposed as to cover the requirements of the  CSA will have a significant impact on current activities.  In addition, as the EUCC is the first candidate scheme, and therefore its draft establishes a first  set of “interpretations” of the CSA. The understanding on what these are and how they should  be reflected in a clear and unambiguous way in this scheme is important. Therefore, the  feedback of the external readers is also crucial. Finally, ENISA is engaged into the development  of another candidate scheme, related to Cloud services, which targets a potentially different  audience than the Common Criteria community, but will benefit from the outcome of the EUCC.  As a result, ENISA decided to establish the necessary consultation required by Article 49.3 of  the CSA by means of a public consultation, open to any party, directly accessible on its website,  and without any limitation of participation.  As such, the public consultation was expected to give the chance to the Agency to collect the  opinions, feedback on technical, procedural, practical and explanatory fields of stakeholders in  order to align and improve the current draft of the scheme and bring it into the final stage.  3 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 April 2019 on ENISA  (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity  certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act).  A cybersecurity  certification  scheme is  developed in  collaboration with  all stakeholders  involved, taking  into consideration  all aspects and  angles of the  certification  process.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  7  1.2 CONSULTATION PROCESS  For the public consultation the EU Survey4 tool was used that enables parties to participate  online at any given moment and save and/or print their input in PDF version. To encourage the  public to provide feedback, the announcement of the public consultation was presented on the  ENISA website with a news item and was also pushed through social media enabling interested  parties to participate not only within, but also outside the European Union.  The public consultation was opened from July 2nd until July 31st 2020. Besides the public, the  European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG- consisting of representatives of national  cybersecurity certification authorities or representatives of other relevant national authorities  and invited stakeholders and relevant third parties that participate in the work)5 and the  Stakeholder Cybersecurity certification Group (SCCG- composed of members selected from  among recognised experts representing the relevant stakeholders)6 were invited to participate in  the consultation. The results of the ECCG are published in a separate report, as they reflect the  opinions of the Member States, as such. The public collection of feedback from different  stakeholders, together with the feedback from the ECCG, will help to consolidate the draft  scheme with the opinions of all relevant stakeholders.  The public consultation report includes recommendations proposed by the Agency in terms of  proposed changes and/or action points that are listed for uptake.  ENISA reconvened the AHWG that had been put in a “dormant” phase, as to analyse and  review the comments made, and to establish the necessary updates of the scheme. The  elements provided by ENISA to the AHWG were sanitized prior to the analysis and review  (removal of any indication on which individual or company/entity would have made the  comments).  The AHWG received separately the comments provided by the Member States that accepted to  share them with the group.  Upon presentation to the ECCG, SCCG and the Commission, the consultation results included  in this report with the identified necessary changes and defined action points, are now made  public.  1.3 PROCESSING THE RECEIVED DATA  The survey was designed in seven different sections with questions related to:   The contributors   The intend to use the draft EUCC candidate scheme   The transition from current schemes (SOG-IS or national scheme)   The opinion on the new elements that were developed in the EUCC scheme  o Conditions for issuing, maintenance, renewal and continuation of  certifications  o Monitoring & handling of non-compliances and non-conformities  o Vulnerability handling procedures  o Patch management procedures to support vulnerability handling   The guidance that is needed for stakeholders related to the implementation of the  scheme   The opinion on the impact of the EUCC scheme on market conditions  4 https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/  5 See Art. 62 CSA.  6 See Art. 22 CSA.  https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  8   The opinion on the maintenance of the EUCC scheme   Any additional comments of the stakeholders.

The outcome of the survey is processed in a way that it is providing insights for all respondents  as well as for the Agency, the Commission and the ECCG and SCCG. Upon each graphic,  diagram ENISA presents and provides explanatory text and remarks to assist the reader in the  clarification of the outcome. For some outcomes it is of relevance to analyse the feedback  provided and relate it to the background of the participants providing insights into the different  interests respondents may have depending on their activity.  None of the questions in this consultation were presented as mandatory to answer. In order to  provide a clear insight the percentages in each question were adjusted according to the replies  submitted, the non-answered questions are also indicated.  Lastly, for some questions participants could select more than one responses, as to better  depict their background, interest and/or expectation(s).  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  9  2. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  2.1 THE CONTRIBUTORS  In total 114 respondents participated in the survey. ENISA indeed welcomed the balanced  contributions from 37 producers, manufacturers and developers, 24 bodies that issue  certificates or perform conformity assessment, 19 interest groups from industry or sectorial  associations, 23 stakeholder interest groups such as trade organisations, distributors,  consultancy firms, research institutions and Academia. 17 Member States and governmental  institutions/bodies and National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities (NCCA’s) and  Accreditation bodies. Lastly, 8 participants indicated that they are affiliated with standards  developing organizations.  It should be noted that participants were able to select more than one option for this topic.  Important fact is that the contributors represent a brought spectrum of actors involved in  certification ensuring that input is received from all different angles.  The limited representation of consumer groups is to be noted, and gives indication to ENISA for  the development of a communication plan, for the implementation phase of this scheme, that  will make sure consumers are well informed of what cybersecurity certification of ICT products  entails, and can find cybersecurity support related to the certified product.  Figure 1: Survey Participants' Composition  Recommendation #1: During the implementation phase of the EUCC scheme, a  communication plan will be established. The plan will include  communication with consumers to ensure they are well informed in  what cybersecurity certification of ICT products entails.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  10  2.2 GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF PARTICIPANTS  Figure 2 reveals a broad spectrum of participating countries, but looking at the number of  participants per country, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium showed the largest  percentage of participants in the consultation.  77% of the participants indicated EU/EEA as their country of establishment and 20% as non-  EU/EEA. Further to that, 32% indicated that their country of establishment participates in the  SOG-IS MRA and 33% that their country of establishment is a member of the Common Criteria  Recognition Arrangement (CCRA). As this first scheme is built upon the current SOG-IS MRA  certification mechanism, it is understandable that the SOG-IS MRA participants and the CCRA  members in particular are participating in the feedback of the EUCC scheme. 28% indicated that  their country of establishment has experience in relevant national certification schemes and only  2% indicated that their country does not has relevant experience, indicating that most parties  that responded have experience with cybersecurity certification.  The relative high number of participants from the USA is also to be noted.  Figure 2: Geographic Composition of Participants  For the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework to become effective, it is important that  Member States and countries in the European Economic Area who are currently not involved or  engaged in the SOG-IS certification and have the intention to participate in the EUCC scheme,  are supported and enabled in the setting up of the certification mechanism. The Commission  and experienced SOG-IS Member States could consider to set up a programme to provide the  opportunity to set up and gain experience in cybersecurity certification issuance to enhance and  increase the certification capability and participation.  Recommendation #2: Ease the participation of interested EU Member States newcomers  to cybersecurity certification to participate to the EUCC scheme by  a dedicated training programme  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  11  2.3 INTENTION TO USE THE EUCC SCHEME  82% of the participants indicated their intention to use the EUCC scheme. 18% (13 participants)  indicated not to intend to use the EUCC scheme. From EU /EEA perspective 80% of the  participants from EU/EEA countries indicated that they intend to use the EUCC scheme, even if  it is voluntary, while 61% of the participants outside EU/EEA indicated that they also intend to  use the EUCC scheme.  Some EU/EEA countries that currently are not involved in the SOG-IS certification and  participated in the survey indicated that they intend to start using the EUCC scheme, this is why  we recommend to support these countries in their intent to participate.  Figure 3: Intention to use the EUCC scheme  2.4 ENVISIONED PURPOSES OF USING THE EUCC SCHEME  33% of the respondents indicated to envisage having their ICT products certified under the  EUCC scheme (manufacturers/producers/developers and trade organisations), 25% indicated  they intended to use certified products, and 29% they intended to develop certification related  activities (as a CB or ITSEF), showing a purpose to use the EUCC scheme very much in line  with the profile of the respondents.  Many of the manufacturers/producers/developers and trade organisations indicated that they  currently certify their products under the SOG-IS scheme and have every intention to extend  their certificate to the EU level:  “For our products in the verticals of telecommunication, identity, payment and transit Common  Criteria security certification on a high level is a key selling proposition. The high level of  assurance needs to be highly visible to our customers.”  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  12  Figure 4: Envisioned use of the EUCC scheme  Others indicated the market perspective as reason:  “As we wish to assess the security quality of our ICT products against a uniform and consensus-  based certification scheme which is recognized by all relevant parties, including telecom  operators, suppliers and regulators, to jointly enhance cybersecurity for ICT industry.”  “As a private business aiming to make organisations more secure and resilient to cyber threats,  we will certify our products to indicate even further their trustworthiness. Likewise, we intend to  make the forthcoming certification a major requirement for our supply chain”  “As an IT-consultancy enterprise, we intend to primarily develop certification activities as an  Evaluation Facility/Testing Laboratory (ITSEF), not as a Certification Body (CB). Secondly, we  intend to prescribe certifications at the partners we collaborate with, to take the responsibilities  we have on the area of security.”  Other participants indicate the certification intentions, depending on market considerations:  “We are committed to considering certification activities using the EUCC scheme, although any  decision would depend on market demand, product development cycle, evaluation lead time,  among other considerations.”  Parties that indicate not to intend using the EUCC scheme provided their reasons to do so:  “We operate our own global certification programme with a methodology developed on best  security evaluation principles to deliver cybersecurity products at a high assurance level. Our  scheme already provides similar benefits and there is not a need to duplicate these efforts.”  Others indicate the non-applicability:  “Our organization does not currently produce ICT products that would benefit from certification  against 'substantial' or 'high ratings'. However, we may use ICT products from other  manufacturers/providers in the assembly of our products.”  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  13  Some SMEs provided a different reason:  “The approach is not SME-friendly. The CC (and ISO/IEC 15408) has generally proved to be  difficult to apply and unaffordable to SMEs. We advise to tailor a scheme to the levels of risks  and size of organizations (and their roles in a value chain).”  2.5 TRANSITION FROM THE SOG-IS MRA TO THE EUCC SCHEME  The draft candidate EUCC scheme included a number of transitional measures and  recommendations to support a transition from the SOG-IS MRA to the EUCC scheme. These  transitional measures relate to:   The extensive reuse of the Joint Interpretation Library (JIL) mandatory supporting  documents:    The continuation of the Technical Domains of Smart Cards and similar devices and of  Hardware Devices with Security Boxes:    Governance of the scheme by the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  (ECCG) and relevant subgroups.  64% of the survey participants agreed that these choices will have a positive impact on the  transition. 32% were neutral and only 4% were of the opinion that the impact will not be  positive.  Figure 5: Positive impact of transitional measures from the SOG-IS MRA to the EUCC  In addition to these responses, 63% of the participants foresaw possible issues related to the  transition that they may run into. The relative large percentage of neutral scores deserves more  attention in order to learn what the related issues are.  The responses to the question as to what should be considered to be necessary in order to  successfully implement the transition from SOG-IS MRA schemes to the EUCC scheme  differed:   some participants pointed to the fact that this is the first scheme that is designed to be  applied horizontally to all industry domains and products;  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  14   others indicated that they like to have additional information as to how the transition in  practice will be organised, as they were in need of support in their certification  migration process;   or pointed towards the uncertainty in processing time as certification is considered  complex and time critical;   indicated that it might be useful to design a requirement mapping to get better insights  into what is needed to make the transfer successful for them;   emphasized the importance of mutual recognition on a worldwide basis;   brought up that self-declaration and the assurance level “basic” is not addressed by  the scheme;   expressed their concerns to the fact that the review of the NIS directive and the Radio  Equipment Directive might impact the security requirements in their sectors and  subsequently also have impact on the cybersecurity certification framework;   asked for clear communication to avoid confusion between existing & future schemes.  This information provides valuable insights and helps ENISA to design guidance that provides  clarification in the process and support in how to approach the migration effectively and  efficiently. It is clear that the EUCC scheme will be subject to maintenance and will adapt to  either legal, economical changes and/or technological innovations and improvements. The  EUCC scheme will be subject to continuous contributions to the evaluation of the certification  processes and the regular analysis of the main trends in the cybersecurity market both to the  demand and supply side as indicated under article 8 of the CSA.7  The estimated timeline indicated by participants for efficient transition varies between 1-3 years  with a slight majority for 2 years.  2.6 IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE SOG-IS MRA TO THE EUCC SCHEME  Based on the relevant CSA provisions, the draft candidate EUCC scheme included a number of  improvements to further advance the current SOG-IS MRA and to ensure assurance continuity  of the certificates. These improvements cover:   the maintenance of the certificates,   harmonised activities related to the monitoring and handling of non-compliances and  non-conformities,   harmonised conditions for vulnerability handling and disclosure   the introduction of a patch management mechanism to support vulnerability handling.  70% of the survey participants agreed that these improvements will have a positive impact on  the certification scheme. 24% were neutral and only 6% were of the opinion that the impact will  not be positive. Out of the participants that indicated their country of establishment, 69% (57  responses) from EU/EEA countries indicated that they agree and strongly agree that impact will  be positive, 28% (23 responses) were neutral and 3% (3 responses) disagreed or strongly  disagreed.  7 Article 8 (4) and 8 (7) CSA.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  15  Figure 6: Positive impact of improvements from the SOG-IS MRA to the EUCC  Looking at the 24 % of neutrality towards the indicated improvements, comments relate in  particular to:   a call for more flexibility on possible delays, suspensions periods, embargo and  communication to customers, associated with concerns about some indicated timelines  that seem ‘ambitious’ and not based yet upon best practice;   standards for vulnerability management already under development for some  industries;   questions about the maintenance of these new elements and the cooperation amongst  stakeholders in these new processes and compliance to these processes, with the call  for the use of a public forum instead of a closed working group under NDA;   the need for periodic feedback on the implementation of the scheme from relevant  types of actors e.g. by means of setting out a request for consultation (such as this  one);   for future maintenance and reviews of the EUCC scheme, the request to get  reasonable time in advance (e.g. 6 months in advance) to ensure providing high quality  responses and eventually contribute to continuous improvement of the certification  program as such.   the proposal to adjust these new processes upon a risk based approach, meaning that  for lower risk products the effort should be accordingly limited.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  16  2.7 FORM OF GUIDANCE TO BE DEVELOPED  Figure 7: Form of guidance  Looking at the indicated preferences for guidance, most participants indicated the importance of  written guidance as this provides reproducible material. These guidance supports may either be  combined with trainings, webinars or conferences and consultation rounds.  The different types  of guidance should be adjusted in line with the maintenance of the scheme.  A selection of ideas that were brought forward as ‘other ideas’ are listed below:   Set up a community slack channel or similar chat-like environment. Similar to OWASP  where one can issue questions and discuss with others working on the same topic;   Develop tooling for evaluation (preparation);   Developing a common virtual laboratory to prepare efficiently for evaluations/pentests   Mutual virtual visits or learning exercises and field trips for stakeholders to share  experiences, observe functioning certification system in place;   A platform where adopted methodologies and workflows can be shared and  demonstrated.  2.8 IMPACT OF THE EUCC SCHEME ON EU MARKET CONDITIONS  Based on the relevant CSA provisions, the candidate EUCC includes a number of aspects to  enhance the market conditions for the certified ICT products (both under the EUCC scheme and  future schemes). These aspects include:   An EU certificate will be valid throughout the entire European Union;   The certificates issued will also include a label that is associated to the EUCC scheme;   The label will be designed in a harmonised and clearly recognisable way across all EU  cybersecurity certification schemes;   The label will have a QR code associated to the certificate;   The QR code will provide access to the relevant publicly available certification  information and other related information regarding the Cybersecurity Certification  Framework under the Website on European cybersecurity certification schemes;   Stakeholder communities will have the possibility to establish generic specifications for  their products through certified Protection Profiles.  75% of the participants agreed that these provisions will have a positive impact on EU market  conditions while 16% were neutral and only 10% were of the opinion that the impact will not be  positive. Out of the participants that indicated their country of establishment, 76% (64  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  17  responses) from EU/EEA countries indicated that they agree and strongly agree that impact will  be positive, 14% (12 responses) were neutral and 10% (8 responses) disagreed or strongly  disagreed. From non EU/EEA countries, 70% (14 responses) indicated that they agree and  strongly agree that impact will be positive, 20% (4 responses) were neutral and 10% (2  responses) disagreed or strongly disagreed.  Figure 8: Positive impact of the EUCC scheme on EU market conditions  The participants that indicated a ‘neutral’ impact on market conditions, indicated remarks related  to the maintenance and transition, recognition and guidance with some of them already  presented in the previous sections of this report.  2.9 IMPORTANT ASPECTS RELATED TO THE EUCC SCHEME  Upon the question to the participants on what additional important aspects the Agency should  take into consideration, the following is a selection of the points that were addressed multiple  times:   Reusability of evidence, protection profiles, continuation of existing certificates, and a  lightweight way to migrate protection profiles and certificates from existing schemes  into the EUCC should be possible. The approach towards reuse of evidence of CBs in  different countries should be harmonised as harmonisation of acceptance of evidence  is crucial for composition;   Composition of certificates is very important to accommodate products based on  certified building blocks; such composition should not only be possible within the  EUCC scheme but also reusing existing evidence, PPs and certificates from legacy  schemes for a suitable transition period;   “The mapping of VAN.3 to \"high\" will weaken the significance of \"high resistance\" and  open the door to marketing campaign promoting \"high\" whereas the resistance is not;   Discussion on cryptographic analysis is missing in the EUCC proposal. However, this  is an important topic to be clarified in EUCC scheme as currently one SOG-IS  governmental agency performs a cryptographic analysis for the evaluation of a  product, while other EU SOG-IS agencies do not. It is important that harmonization on  this aspect is considered in the EUCC scheme;  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  18   The workflows and roles have to be described clearly and have to be published;   The decision structure for the maintenance of the scheme has to be described clearly  and has to be published;   The derogation of Art. 56. 6b of the CSA offers to provide for a chance for private  schemes to get involved in the EUCC, but should be described more clearly;   Monitoring and metrics of performance of the NCCAs and CABs should be introduced  so the required agile management of security issues are ensured;   The scheme is intended to be voluntary, however some are also considering a possible  future in which certification becomes required as result of regulatory mandate, market  pressure, or both. This can only be done at a moment the certification processes are  mature, cost efficient and have proven to be effective;   Next to a principle-based security and privacy framework, there is a need for dynamic  assurance and continuous certification. Autonomous cars already foresee the need for  continuous monitoring of the security and safety of the vehicle and trustworthiness of  the whole digital ecosystem of self-driving-cars. For the EUCC scheme to be effective,  it is imperative that it takes into account the whole ecosystem and not just one  component;   Certification schemes operated by industry or other private organisations are not  mentioned, and fall outside the CSA. The CSA public bodies operating such schemes  should be able to propose that the Commission consider such schemes as a basis for  approving them as a European Cybersecurity Certification scheme. As an example,  private schemes would be recognised if requested to mitigate any duplication impact to  vendors supporting the cards payments industry and digital single market;   The EUCC scheme would benefit from greater use of principles and process based  approaches which are much more scalable and hence effective than evaluation.  Approaches (such as those proposed for high) that mainly focus on vulnerability  searches are particularly costly and ineffective since vulnerabilities are almost always  found in real use;   For products in the verticals of telecommunication, identity, payment and transit  Common Criteria security certification on a high level is a key selling proposition. “The  high level of assurance needs to be highly visible to our customers.”; the security  quality of ICT products needs a uniform and consensus-based certification scheme  which is recognized by all relevant parties, including telecom operators, suppliers and  regulators, to jointly enhance cybersecurity for ICT industry.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  19  3. CONCLUSIONS & ACTIONS TAKEN  3.1 CONCLUSIONS  The EUCC candidate scheme received in majority a positive feedback.  Points that were brought up by stakeholders, experts, groups and participants, encourage  ENISA to further improve the EUCC scheme whether in current adjustments or amendments or  in a later maintenance phase. The feedback that ENISA received also helps to extend the  Cybersecurity Certification Framework upon the lessons learned  Some of the comments received are not addressed, as they were already discussed under the  AHWG. ENISA therefore considered sufficient background had been given into the current  version of the scheme.  In addition, the ECCG8 also proceeded to the review of version 1.0 of the candidate scheme.  Their comments, are not included in this report and processed in a separate report. Their  feedback also contributes to the revisions made within the candidate scheme.  Proposals for adjustments or amendments related to this public survey are described in the next  section. They will be processed into the updated versions of the EUCC candidate scheme, either  through direct changes, or in the form of recommendations for future activities or guidance.  3.2 ACTIONS TAKEN/ TO BE TAKEN  The main changes to the initial version 1.0 of the candidate EUCC scheme that are processed  into the updated version 1.1 are the following:   addition and clarification of definitions;   systematic cooperation with the ECCG for the development of guidance documents  supporting the scheme;   clarification of activities related to the maintenance of certificates;   clarification of deadlines associated to the handling of non-conformities, non-  compliances and vulnerabilities;   modification of the status of the new patch management process, now in annex and for  trial use;   modification of the logo associated to the certificates, allowing to establish an  additional specific logo for the scheme and to mention the evaluation level (AVA_VAN)  achieved in addition to the CSA level;   clarification of the peer assessment requirements and simplification of the associated  annex;   update of annexes 7 and 9 based on their recent evolution within the SOG-IS, and the  addition of one annex related to ST sanitization.  In addition, ENISA considers to launch several actions to improve the capacity to promote and  explain the importance of the use of the EUCC scheme to the EU community and to provide  potential newcomers to EUCC certification with additional information and assistance on  associated deadlines that need to be met and the required conditions, such as engaging into  guidance development or into a dedicated project to develop a communication plan. Moreover,  a transition project should be established in order to provide and ensure the best conditions for  a smooth transfer from the current SOG-IS activities to the EUCC.  8 Article 62 CSA.  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE DRAFT CANDIDATE EUCC SCHEME  May 2021  20  ANNEX A: PUBLIC CONSULTATION  QUESTIONNAIRE  Consultation questionnaire of the draft EUCC candidate scheme, in  accordance with Article 49(3) of the Cybersecurity Act.  1. INTRODUCTION  Upon request of the European Commission, based on Article 48 (2) of the Cybersecurity Act9  (hereinafter referred to as CSA), ENISA has set up an Ad Hoc Working Group, hereinafter  referred to as EUCC AHWG, to support the preparation of a candidate cybersecurity certification  scheme that will serve as a successor to the SOG-IS Mutual Recognition Agreement,  hereinafter referred to as SOG-IS MRA10 .  The EUCC AHWG is chaired by ENISA and is composed of 20 appointed members  representing industry (developers, evaluators), as well as around 12 participants from  accreditation bodies and Members States.  This EUCC AHWG worked in close collaboration with the European Commission and with the  European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG: composed of representatives of national  cybersecurity certification authorities or representatives of other relevant national authorities of  the EU Member States).  The current consultation aims to collect your opinion(s), view(s) and suggestion(s) on the draft  version of the candidate EUCC scheme, the deployment and its future implementation, in line  with Article 49 (3) of the CSA.

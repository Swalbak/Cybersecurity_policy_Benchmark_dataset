The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.  The Essential Eight Maturity Model, first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, supports the implementation  of the Essential Eight. It is based on the ACSC’s experience in producing cyber threat intelligence, responding to cyber  security incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight.  As the Essential Eight outlines a minimum set of preventative measures, organisations need to implement additional  measures where it is warranted by their environment. Further, while the Essential Eight can help to mitigate the  majority of cyber threats, it will not mitigate all cyber threats. As such, additional mitigation strategies and controls  need to be considered, including those from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  and the Information  Security Manual (ISM).

privileges  Requests for privileged access to systems and applications are validated  when first requested.  1507  Privileged access to systems and applications is automatically disabled after  12 months unless revalidated.  1647  Privileged access to systems and applications is automatically disabled after  45 days of inactivity.  1648  Privileged access to systems and applications is limited to only what is  required for users and services to undertake their duties.  1508  Privileged accounts are prevented from accessing the internet, email and  web services.  1175, 1653  Privileged users use separate privileged and unprivileged operating  environments.  1380  9  Privileged operating environments are not virtualised within unprivileged  operating environments.  1687  Unprivileged accounts cannot logon to privileged operating environments. 1688  Privileged accounts (excluding local administrator accounts) cannot logon to  unprivileged operating environments.  1689  Just-in-time

used at least fortnightly to  support the detection of assets for subsequent vulnerability scanning  activities.  1807  A vulnerability scanner with an up-to-date vulnerability database is used for  vulnerability scanning activities.  1808  A vulnerability scanner is used at least daily to identify missing patches or  updates for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of internet-facing  services.  1701  A vulnerability scanner is used at least weekly to identify missing patches or  updates for security vulnerabilities in operating systems of workstations,  servers and network devices.  1702  10  Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in  operating systems of internet-facing services are applied within two weeks of  release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists.  1694  Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in  operating systems of workstations, servers and network devices are applied  within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists.  1695, 1696  The latest release, or the previous release, of operating systems are used. 1407  Operating systems that are no longer supported by vendors are replaced. 1501  Multi-factor  authentication  Multi-factor authentication is used by an organisation's users if they  authenticate to their organisation’s internet-facing services.  1504  Multi-factor authentication is used by an organisation’s users if they  authenticate to third-party internet-facing services that process, store or  communicate their organisation's sensitive data.  1679  Multi-factor authentication (where available) is used by an organisation’s  users if they authenticate to third-party internet-facing services that process,  store or communicate their organisation's non-sensitive data.  1680  Multi-factor authentication is enabled by default for non-organisational users  (but users can choose to opt out) if they authenticate to an organisation’s  internet-facing services.  1681  Multi-factor authentication is used to authenticate privileged users of  systems.  1173  Multi-factor authentication is used to authenticate users accessing important  data repositories.  1505  Multi-factor authentication is phishing-resistant and uses either: something  users have and something users know, or something users have that is  unlocked by something users know or are.  1401, 1682  Successful and unsuccessful multi-factor authentication events are centrally  logged.  1683, 1684,  1405  Event logs are protected from unauthorised modification and deletion. 1815  Event logs are monitored for signs of compromise and actioned when any  signs of compromise are detected.  0109, 0123,  0140, 1228,  1819  11  Regular backups Backups of important data, software and configuration settings are  performed and retained with a frequency and retention timeframe in  accordance with business continuity requirements.  1511  Backups of important data, software and configuration settings are  synchronised to enable restoration to a common point in time.  1810  Backups of important data, software and configuration settings are retained  in a secure and resilient manner.  1811  Restoration of important data, software and configuration settings from  backups to a common point in time is tested as part of disaster recovery  exercises.  1515  Unprivileged accounts cannot access backups belonging to other accounts,  nor their own accounts.  1812, 1813  Privileged accounts (excluding backup administrator accounts) cannot access  backups belonging to other accounts, nor their own accounts.  1705, 1706  Unprivileged accounts are prevented from modifying and deleting backups. 1814  Privileged accounts (including backup administrator accounts) are prevented  from modifying and deleting backups during their retention period.  1707, 1708  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats. The advice in the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, along with its Essential  Eight, complements this framework.

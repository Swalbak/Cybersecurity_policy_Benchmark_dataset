December 2015  05  Executive summary  This Report on Information Sharing and Common Taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Agencies (LEAs) was produced at the initiative of ENISA with the objective to enhance cooperation  both between the Member States (MS) of the EU and between related Network and Information  Security (NIS) communities.  With this study, which is a continuation of ENISA’s work done in the area of fight against cybercrime,  ENISA aims at identifying which information can be shared between CSIRTs and LEAs and how this  can be achieved from a technical and organisational perspective.  This report presents four proposals:  - A taxonomy for the exchange of information based on desk research, to define a common  vocabulary for the description of cyber incidents based on the approval of the majority of  the community.  - A sharing mechanism for the exchange of information, based on a taxonomy. This element is  still being debated, as explained further on in this document.  - An update model for the taxonomy, to answer new requirements that could arise from the  CSIRTs and the LEAs.  - A roadmap for the implementation of the taxonomy in the exchange of information across  CSIRTs and LEAs and the potential use of a sharing mechanism to enhance these exchanges.  There is a large consensus that a proposal for a taxonomy developed by CERT.PT2 is a good starting  point for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. This taxonomy fulfils the  requirements identified during this study, is easy to use and implement, while offering opportunities  for future updates. In addition it takes into account the Budapest Convention3 and the Cybercrime  Directive4, and provides a definition of the incidents and events it describes.  However, while a taxonomy allows to classify the information that is exchanged, it does not  necessarily provide a format for the exchanged data. Therefore, although there is no commonly  agreed format yet, using a common sharing mechanism could offer advantages such as automation  of the analysis of the data and the creation of statistics. Based on the research performed, STIX5 has  been identified as an appropriate candidate. It has a high level of recognition by the CSIRTS and LEAs  2 CERT.PT became part of the National Cybersecurity Centre in Portugal (CNCS).

Finally, to enhance the use of a taxonomy, it should also be kept up-to-date and evolve according to  the requirements of CSIRTs and LEAs. Therefore, an update model should be put in place to ensure  the further development of the taxonomy. Based on the information collected from CSIRTs and LEAs  and the possibilities of alignment with corresponding EC3 activities, a dynamic update of the  taxonomy through regular physical meetings with the stakeholders seems to be best suited.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  07  1 Introduction  1.1 Background  As of 2015, ENISA’s core operational activities are aligned with the four Strategic Objectives (SOs)  from the ENISA strategy document and the multi annual planning for 2015 to 2017, which are  summarised in ENISA’s Work Programme 20156.  The work packages in SO4 aim ‘to enhance cooperation both between the Member States (MS) of  the EU and between related Network and Information Security (NIS) communities’. The overall  goal is to ‘build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals’ through a ‘learn by doing  approach’.  Work Package (WPK) 4.1 aims at ‘supporting EU cooperation initiatives amongst NIS–related  communities in the context of the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union7 (EU CSS)’ through  two deliverables.  The goal of the first WPK 4.1 deliverable (which is the focus of this study) is to ‘develop and  provide guidance based on good practice for cooperation between key stakeholder communities’.  The goal of the second WPK 4.1 deliverable is to ‘identify practices of Member States in addressing  different sector regulation challenges of managing cyber security issues’. This is to be achieved  through a ‘stocktaking on Member States regulatory approaches for Cyber Security, with an  emphasis on cross-sector information sharing’.  1.2 Study Objectives and Scope  The study at hand aims to collect and present information on the previous and ongoing projects  facilitating information sharing between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement. It aims at investigating which  information can be shared between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement and how this can be achieved  technically and organisationally.  The scope of this study are CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Agencies in the European Union. It does not  cover other organisations than the selected communities (such as, for example, ISPs).  6 ENISA Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  7 Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure  Cyberspace: http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  08  1.3 Purpose of this document  The purpose of this study is to propose a solution for the exchange of information between CSIRTs  and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in the form of a roadmap and a common taxonomy, as well  as a mechanism to share information based on this common taxonomy and a model on how to  update the taxonomy to new phenomena.  This study outlines an initial proposal for:   A common taxonomy that could be used for sharing information between CSIRT and LEA  communities.   A mechanism to share information between both communities based on this taxonomy.   A model to update the taxonomy to new phenomena (such as new kind of attacks or a new  vulnerability type).   A roadmap for the introduction of the proposed taxonomy to both communities and the  implementation of a sharing solution between CSIRTs and LEA communities.  In addition, this study outlines:   How this study aligns with the Operational Action Plan (OAP) 4.1 working group8 EMPACT  (The European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats) Cyber Attacks 2015 to  avoid any overlap between both activities.  8 Europol EC3 leads the OAP 4.1 meetings. The OAP 4.1 initiated last year had three objectives: defining a  common taxonomy, defining exchange standards and achieving statistics. Up until now the first objective has  been progressed. The aim for this year (2015) is to achieve the second and third objective as well. In order to  achieve the second objective it is important to define use cases for sharing information between CSIRTs, LEA  and third parties.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  09  2 Proposition of a taxonomy for the exchange of information  between CSIRTs and LEAs  In order to defend against evolving threats, information sharing is key. The sharing of information  about cyber events and incidents allows others to defend against such attacks and help others to  detect and react to these attacks. The main obstacle in the exchange of information is the current  lack of standardization in the communication. There is no common understanding on how to  exchange information, limiting the amount of information that can be exchanged and the  possibilities of automation of this exchange.  Based on the previous work done by ENISA on the exchange of information between CSIRTs and  LEAs, it seems that a common language9 should be identified to enable a better exchange of  information between them. Since the CSIRT and LEA communities have different goals10, their way of  representing and classifying information about cyber events and incidents are not necessarily  similar, and the situation can be very different from one EU Member State to another. For example,  while many LEAs use the NATO classification system11, most CSIRTs use the Traffic Light Protocol  (TLP12).  Moreover, while LEAs store information based on investigations, the CSIRTs also collect information  on types of attacks that are not related to specific infection cases, in order to provide statistical  information on the current threat landscape. LEAs, for example, collect information that can be used  during an investigation to find evidence of a crime and incriminate its author. They also collect  information on potential criminal actions which take place on the Internet. CSIRTs, on the other side,  try to collect information on the current threat and attack vectors, and therefore tend to collect and  share more information not directly related to a specific attack, such as vulnerabilities, attackers and  behaviours.  Due to this difference in goals, the management of information by CSIRT and LEAs is very different.  The way the information is stored and used can vary, and there is no common vocabulary used to  define the types of threats and incidents.  To harmonise such exchanges of information, the first step is the choice of a common taxonomy that  could be adopted by Member States of the European Union to classify information. This would allow  the users of such a taxonomy to use the same vocabulary, by defining a common language,  therefore making it easier to share the information between the users of the taxonomy.  Towards this end, this chapter details how a selection of a common taxonomy to be proposed for  the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs has been done, based on requirements  highlighted by the interviews and possibilities of alignment of this study to the OAP 4.1 working  group (presented in section 2.2.1).  9 ‘Language’ describes here a common definition of the vocabulary used to describe events and incidents.  10 While CSIRTs focus mainly on blocking cyber-attacks and restoring a normal situation at the victim side, LEAs  focus on identifying criminals behind the attacks.  11 The NATO classification system: http://www.nato.int/structur/AC/135/ncs_guide/english/e_1-6-1.htm  12 Protocol to encourage classification systems: https://www.cert.be/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  http://www.nato.int/structur/AC/135/ncs_guide/english/e_1-6-1.htm https://www.cert.be/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  10  2.1 Definition of a taxonomy  To further refine the scope of this study, the first step is to provide the definition of a taxonomy.  According to the ENISA webpage on ontologies13, the definition of a taxonomy is the following: ‘a  taxonomy is most often defined as a classification of terms and has a close relationship with the use  of ontology. There are three characteristics that define a taxonomy:   A form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the  relationship these things have to each other.   A semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets.   A knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the  knowledge domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable  and easy to navigate.’  Figure 1 – Definition of a taxonomy13  Note that an ontology is a closely related concept.  The definition of an ontology consists of the  definition of domain concepts (e.g. objects, attributes and processes) and their  properties/relationships. This goes beyond the purpose of harmonising and standardising the  exchanges of information. In the view of the authors, LEAs and CSIRTs should first achieve the same  vocabulary enabling a common language before describing more complex relations between  concepts.  2.2 Alignment of this study with the EMPACT OAP 4.1 working group  towards the choice of a taxonomy  This section presents the EMPACT OAP 4.1 working group, the objectives of aligning both activities  for the choice of a taxonomy and how both of them are aligned at this stage of the project. One of  the main objectives of the OAP 4.1 working group is to improve sharing of information between  CSIRTs, LEAs and third parties and enable the generation of statistics on events and incidents. Due to  the similarities between the OAP 4.1 working group and this study, an alignment of both activities  benefits both communities.  13 Based on ENISA’s pages on ontology: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/metrics/ontology and https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  Taxonomy  Classification  scheme  Semantic  representation  Knowledge  map  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  11  2.2.1 Description of the OAP 4.1 working group  The European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats14 (EMPACT) Cyber Attacks 2015,  OAP 4.115 (OAP 4.1 working group) project is a multi-stakeholder initiative, taking into account the  interest of EC3 (representing Europol), ENISA, and various CSIRTs and LEAs representatives within  the European Union.  The OAP 4.1 working group had three main goals at the time of writing:  1. Defining a common taxonomy for the exchange of information related to incidents and  events in cyber security.  2. Defining an exchange standard to enable the sharing of information based on the  taxonomy.  3. Create statistics based on the information exchanged.  At the time of drafting this report, EC3 stated that the first goal, defining a common taxonomy, was  in progress and that they aim to achieve two additional goals by the end of 2015. The six use cases  presented in the first deliverable of this study are based on the use cases that were defined within  the OAP 4.1 working group to help determine activities that the use of a common taxonomy should  enable. It was agreed with ENISA that these use cases would serve as input to this study.  Additionally, the members of the OAP 4.1 working group are in the process of setting up a  governance structure to allow revisions of a common taxonomy that could be updated during bi- annual meetings.  The Common Taxonomy for the National Network of CSIRTs16 (hereafter the ‘CERT.PT taxonomy’) is,  at the time of writing, considered as an appropriate candidate by the OAP 4.1 working group for a  common taxonomy for the exchange of information. In this context, EC3 requested feedback about  the CERT.PT taxonomy from the EU Cybercrime Task Force (EU CTF) for which no objection at that  time was raised.  2.2.2 Use cases to be enabled by a common taxonomy  A set of possible use cases to be enabled by a common taxonomy have been identified in the  context of the OAP 4.1 working group. These use cases highlight the interaction between actors  (CSIRTs and LEAs but also other actors such as ISPs, which are out of the scope of this study). These  use cases also support the goals to be achieved in the context of the work performed by ENISA in the  fight against cybercrime17. Below is a summary of the use cases.  14 EU Policy Cycle - EMPACT: https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/eu-policy-cycle-empact  15 OAP: Operational Action Plan, part of the EMPACT as project to combat the priority threats.  16 The Common Taxonomy for National Network of CSIRTs (2014) is developed by the Fundação para a  Computação Científica Nacional (FCCN) and CERT.PT. It aims at describing a common taxonomy for the  classification of incidents within the National Network of CSIRTs in Portugal. In presents a technical perspective  and a ‘high level legal characterisation’ to facilitate the ontological harmonization of incidents within the  Portuguese Network, the international network of CERTs and foreign criminal investigation police forces (Law  Enforcement Agencies) or other similar bodies, such as the INTERPOL and the Europol.  17 ENISA fight against cybercrime: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/certs/support/fight-against- cybercrime  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/eu-policy-cycle-empact https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/certs/support/fight-against-cybercrime https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/certs/support/fight-against-cybercrime  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  12  1. Alerts from CSIRTs to LEAs: with the common taxonomy and a common formatted message,  LEAs can receive and automatically treat large amounts of data in less time, thus perceiving  the evolution of incidents both quantitatively and geographic ways.  2. Alerts among CSIRTs: CSIRTs and their networks can optimise incident case analysis,  promoting correlation of the security events and therefore act or react, jointly, within borders  or with other EU CSIRTs. This should result in faster incident mitigation and additional  information collection for incidents containing procedures and overall protectionism for the  EU.  3. Reporting of statistics: Sharing statistics among the identified actors will allow information  cross-checking with other sources, thus validating (or not) and spotting commercial  distortions on the security Information market.  4. LEAs alerts to CSIRTs: CSIRTs can benefit from better anticipation of significant security  events, access to correlated information that can highlight motivation of criminal actors.  5. Joint actions based on previous contributions: Because of the stronger collaboration  between LEAs and CSIRTs, consolidated by the statistics and the data exchanged, campaigns  of criminal prevention can be created and directed towards geographic areas populated by  security incidents, now perceived and visualised by tools that deal with the shared  information.  6. ISPs enrolment: ISPs can be enabled as active actors in this field, and both CSIRTs and LEAs  can take advantage of their participation in terms of public image, since they will be able to  ‘make available’ a ‘security image’ to its clients.  These use cases were further elaborated within the scope of this study. They represent the flow of  information between CERTs and LEAs and an alignment with the information collected during the  interviews.  2.2.2.1 Use case 1: Alerts from CSIRTs to LEAs  Through the interviews of CSIRTs and LEAs, it often appears that sharing information from CSIRTs to  LEAs would be very interesting for the LEAs, and sometimes information about incidents and botnets  is already shared. Although some LEAs are not able to treat such information due to the lack of  resources, many consider that being able to receive data from CSIRTs would be (or is) an advantage  for their work. Through the use of a taxonomy, the LEAs might be able to receive and automatically  treat data in less time, which might allow them to perform analysis and perceive the evolution of  cyber incidents.  Since the nature of activities of CSIRTs and LEAs differ from each other, the information they collect  and the way they collect it are fundamentally different too. According to most respondents, LEAs are  therefore interested in information that CSIRTs possess since it represents additional information  that they can use in investigations, or to prevent criminal activities.  One of the limitations often encountered during the interviews performed for this study is the need  for the approval of the victim. When CSIRTs help an organisation after an attack, they often need the  organisation to file an official complaint before being able to provide information about the attack to  LEAs. But apart from this limitation, exchange of information from CERTs to LEAs does not seem to  have any other constraints.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  13  2.2.2.2 Use case 2: Alerts among CSIRTs  Based on the interviews performed, it appeared that some communication between CSIRTs is  already in place, although it is not always automated. But, even without automation, the CSIRT  community often collaborates by sharing information. This information is sometimes exchanged  through sharing platforms but is also simply sent by e-mail in a structured (CSV) or unstructured  (PDF report) file. The community therefore seems to be interested in the implementation of a  common taxonomy for the exchange of information, to facilitate these exchanges by the use of a  common vocabulary.  Through the exchange of information structured on a common taxonomy, the CSIRTs might be able  to perform incident analysis and correlate security events. This would enable joint reactions  between CSIRTs across the European Union, and thus result in better incident mitigation.  2.2.2.3 Use case 3: Reporting of statistics  The exchange and correlation of information might allow the stakeholders to create statistics based  on the common taxonomy by gathering and analysing the data exchanged,. Indeed, since the  exchanged data is currently in different formats and uses different descriptions for events and  incidents, it is currently very hard to create statistics on their frequency and type.  By defining the types of events and incidents and providing a clear classification of the information  exchanged, a common taxonomy would facilitate the creation of statistics. While the CSIRTs and  LEAs might not have resources to create such analysis of the exchanged data to provide statistics,  Europol could be the central point to gather and analyse the exchanged information. This would  allow Europol to create statistics at the European Union level.  The creation of such statistics might enable the detection of trends and tendencies in cyber  incidents, enabling a better focus of the prevention and detection performed across the EU.  2.2.2.4 Use case 4: LEA alerts to CSIRTs:  Based on information collected during the interviews, although the alerts from CSIRTs to LEAs should  not be a problem in most countries (as detailed in section 2.2.2.1), the sharing of information from  LEAs to CSIRTs often encounter more constraints. LEAs are subject to restrictions regarding their  inquiries, and can rarely disclose information to any other organisation. Besides this constraint,  resources are also a problem: some LEAs do not have enough time or budget to gather and share  information that could be useful to CSIRTs. Also, there is in some cases a lack of certainty from the  LEAs about what kind of information could be useful for CSIRTs, due to a lack of formal or informal  exchanges between a CSIRT and a LEA.  Nevertheless, most CSIRTs and LEAs mentioned during the interview that an exchange of  information from the LEA to the CSIRT would be very interesting in terms of creation of statistics and  analysis of incidents across the country. Some CSIRTs and LEAs also mentioned the possibilities for  joint actions in case of specific attacks.  CSIRTs might therefore better anticipate, through sharing of information, security incidents and  prevent them, as well a better correlate data to highlight the motivation of threat actors.  2.2.2.5 Use case 5: Joint actions based on previous contributions  Based on the exchange of information and the collaboration that might follow, the sharing of  information between CSIRTs and LEAs could motivate prevention campaigns and joint actions in case  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  14  of detection of an incident. In some countries, cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs is already in  place for some specific cases where collaboration allows a quicker response and analysis.  This kind of collaboration might also be enhanced by the creation of statistics on incidents (use case  3) where geographic areas that are targeted by specific security incidents could be visualised and  therefore allow international actions across the EU.  2.2.2.6 Use case 6: ISP enrolment  Although the exchange of information with actors other than CSIRTs and LEAs is not part of the  scope of this study, it was still observed based on the interviews, that CSIRTs often have a specific  collaboration with other actors such as ISPs. In some countries, LEAs even ask CSIRTs to make  specific requests to ISPs regarding botnets, allowing CSIRTs and ISPs to collaborate and take them  down.  The exchange of information with ISPs, like the exchange between CSIRTs, is currently often  unstructured, or not based on any taxonomy. The use of a taxonomy for these exchanges is  expected to enable better communication by adding structure to the information exchanged, and  thus enable faster processing  According to some members of the OAP 4.1 working group, the participation of ISPs in such  exchanges might also improve their public image, by providing more security to their clients.  2.2.3 Synergies between this study and the OAP 4.1 working group  Many synergies can be observed between this study and the OAP 4.1 working group:   The goal of the study: one of the goals of this study, the definition of a common taxonomy  for the sharing of information between CSIRTs and LEAs, aligns directly with the first goal of  the OAP 4.1 working group: the definition of a taxonomy for the exchange of information  related to incidents and events in cyber security. However, while this study focuses specifically  on CSIRTs and LEAs, the OAP 4.1 working group also considers the use of the taxonomy for  the exchange of information with third parties as the next step to take, once the exchange of  information is in place between CSIRTs and LEAs. One of the interviewees explained that  although the OAP 4.1 working group would not directly focus on other parties than CSIRTs and  LEAs, they consider that enabling the exchange of information using a specific taxonomy could  motivate other parties to align to that taxonomy.   ENISA and EC3 are considered as an authority by both communities: through the interviews  it was observed that ENISA has the recognition in the CSIRT community to propose a taxonomy  for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. During these interviews, it was also  observed that Europol had a similar authority regarding the LEAs. Therefore, it can be  considered that both agencies have a level of authority to propose the use of a common  taxonomy. This synergy has been confirmed during the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop of the 8th and  9th October 201518 where the attendees, through anonymous voting, confirmed that ENISA  and EC3 were best positioned to determine the CSIRT and LEA communities to adopt a  common taxonomy and a sharing mechanism.  18 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  15   The next steps for the study: the OAP 4.1 working group intends to improve the  communication between CSIRTs and LEAs, if possible this year (2015), by attaining both  second and third goals of the working group (defining an exchange standard and creating  statistics). Along the same lines, this study proposes a roadmap for the introduction of a  common taxonomy and the use of a sharing mechanism. Besides, this study is in line with  the work performed by ENISA until now, which targets the enabling communication  between CSIRTs and LEAs, and ENISA plans to continue working to attain this goal in the  future.  2.2.4 Objectives of aligning this study with the OAP 4.1 working group for the taxonomy  The goal of this study is to propose a common taxonomy to improve information sharing between  CSIRTs and LEAs, and the creation of a roadmap for the introduction of such a solution. Similarly, the  OAP 4.1 working group intends to define a taxonomy for the exchange of information related to  incidents and events in cyber security, and use it in an exchange standard. This section presents the  several objectives of the alignment of the OAP 4.1 working group and this study.  2.2.4.1 Objective 1: Propose a common taxonomy to ensure alignment in the communities  An alignment of this study and the work done in the OAP 4.1 working group effectively results in a  proposal for a common taxonomy. Since the OAP 4.1 working group and ENISA both operate at the  EU level, proposing a common taxonomy to LEAs and CSIRTs shows that both communities are  working towards the same goal.  2.2.4.2 Objective 2: Improve efficiency in the promotion of the taxonomy and exchange  mechanism  As mentioned previously, ENISA and Europol are both considered authoritative when it comes to  making recommendations for CSIRTs and LEAs. Their alignment on a common taxonomy is expected  to encourage the use of the taxonomy by both communities. This should increase acceptance of the  taxonomy in the Member States. This could be particularly relevant for LEAs, for which the  implementation of a taxonomy might take a longer time than for the CSIRTs due to the way they are  structured. On the contrary, having only EC3, for example, proposing a taxonomy to the LEAs and  the CSIRTs could make it more challenging to promote the taxonomy to CSIRTs and could slow down  the process of improving the exchange of information.  2.2.5 How both this study ant the OAP 4.1 working group are being aligned  To attain the objectives mentioned in the previous section, this study was conducted in  collaboration with the OAP 4.1 working group. The first step of the collaboration with EC3 on this  study was a joint meeting. By participating to this meeting on the OAP 4.1 working group on Monday  4 May 2015, direct information on the status of the OAP 4.1 working group was obtained. One of the  examples of the alignment that was enabled by this meeting are the use cases: EC3 provided ENISA  with a set of six use cases defined by the OAP 4.1 working group and, through the interviews  performed for this study, the study team enriched the use cases with details on how and why the  information about cyber incidents could be shared. In addition, EC3 provided support to ENISA  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  16  during this study by using the EUCTF19 list to request an interview to the Member States LEAs.  Furthermore, EC3 informed ENISA of the progress of the study regarding the taxonomy and the  sharing mechanism that was being considered. For example, the current taxonomy being considered  for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs was the taxonomy created by CERT.PT,  and provided ENISA with a copy of this taxonomy.  Finally, this study aims at giving a better overview of the current situation in CSIRTs and LEAs across  Member States and the next steps to take regarding the implementation of a taxonomy and a  sharing mechanism between CSIRTs and LEAs, which should provide useful input to EC3 for the OAP  4.1 working group.  19 Established in 2010, the European Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF) is an expert group made up of  representatives from Europol, Eurojust and the European Commission, working together with the heads of  European Union cybercrime units to facilitate the cross-border fight against cybercrime.  http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Europol http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Eurojust http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/European_Commission http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/European_Union http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Cybercrime http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Cybercrime  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  17  2.3 Methodology for the selection of a taxonomy  One of the main purposes of this study is the proposal of a taxonomy for information exchange  between CSIRTs and LEAs. This section details the methodology applied and the choices made to  select a taxonomy that would fulfil the requirements expressed during the interviews of CSIRTs and  LEAs and be updated with a new phenomenon that might be encountered, while staying in line with  the OAP 4.1 working group. The chosen taxonomy will allow CSIRTs and LEAs to define a common  language when sharing information, based on the classification20 of events and incidents.  The first section ‘Results of the desk research’ presents previous work performed by ENISA in the  ‘Fight against cybercrime’ and ‘Actionable information’ area that have been considered in this study.  The second section ‘Results of the analysed taxonomies’ details possible requirements for a future  taxonomy that were expressed during the interviews. Associated with the use cases, this composes  the base of the selection of a taxonomy for the information exchange.  This section is based on information collected during interviews with CSIRTs and LEAs. These  interviews were mostly performed in a semi-structured manner, by asking the interviewees open  questions and allowing them to provide any complementary information considered useful for this  study. A total of 14 CSIRTs and 12 LEAs provided input, either by providing written answers, or  during phone calls.  The third section ‘Requirements for a taxonomy based on the needs for information CSIRTs and  LEAs as expressed during the interviews’ presents a global overview of the taxonomies that were  considered by this study, either obtained from the desk research or provided by Member States. It  also lists taxonomies that could not be obtained due to their level of classification.  The last section ‘Input from the OAP 4.1 working group about the taxonomy selected’ presents the  input provided by OAP 4.1 working group about the taxonomy they selected and how the choice of  the taxonomy has been made while keeping both activities aligned and answering the requirements  detailed in the second section.  2.3.1 Results of the desk research  In 2010, ENISA started supporting operational collaboration initiatives between CSIRTs and LEAs. In  this context, various activities have been launched since then. The following sections summarise the  key input to this report.  The desk research supporting this study focused mainly on ENISA’s work done in the fields of ‘the  fight against cybercrime’ and ‘Actionable Information’. It also keeps in mind the outcomes of the  Impact Analysis of ENISA’s support to Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).21 This impact  assessment has served as a basis for a proposed roadmap to 2020. The following studies were taken  into account.  20 The repartition of events and incidents into classes, not to be confused with the level of classification of a  document.  21 Impact Analysis and Roadmap: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/supporting-the- cert-community-impact-analysis-and-roadmap  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/supporting-the-cert-community-impact-analysis-and-roadmap https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/supporting-the-cert-community-impact-analysis-and-roadmap  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  18  2.3.1.1 ENISA work done in the field of ‘the fight against cybercrime’   A flair for sharing - encouraging information exchange between CERTs - This report22 focuses  on the legal and regulatory aspects of information sharing and cross-border collaboration of  national and governmental national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe.   The Fight against Cybercrime - Cooperation between CERTs and LEA in the fight against  cybercrime - The aim of this report is to improve the capability of national and governmental  CSIRTs, to address the NIS aspects of cybercrime. It focuses on supporting national and  governmental CSIRTs and their hosting organisations in the EU Member States in their  collaboration with the LEAs. It also intends to be a first collection of practices collected from  mature CSIRTs in Europe, including among other things workflows and collaboration with  other key players, in particular different law enforcement authorities, in the fight against  cybercrime.   Give and Take - Good practice Guide for Addressing NIS Aspects of Cybercrime - The  document constitutes a ‘work in progress’, a snapshot of the status of ENISAs support for  CSIRTs and LEAs at the time of the publication, and includes good practice and  recommendations for both communities.   The Directive on attacks against information systems - A Good Practice Collection for CERTs  on the Directive on attacks against information systems - This report provides an analysis of  the legal framework created by the Directive, coupled with a stock taking on relevant existing  national activities and good practices. Secondly, it identifies key areas and, where appropriate,  guidelines and recommendations derived from these good practices.   Electronic evidence - a basic guide for First Responders - The guide aims to be a practical tool  explaining the principles of sound evidence gathering and raising the right questions for  collecting and securing digital evidence.   ENISA’s traditional workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’ has been organised since 2005 for the  national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe and is one of the most efficient and  indispensable methods for ENISA in supporting teams in their daily work and improving their  capabilities. In 2011 ENISA started to collaborate with Europol. The first joint workshop was  held in Prague and had a focus on CSIRT cooperation with law enforcement. From 2012 the  annual ENISA workshop was split into two parts, one part aims only at national and  governmental CSIRTs and has a technical focus, and the other aims at both national and  governmental CSIRTs and law enforcement representatives, organised together with  Europol/EC3. While in 2014, the first part of the workshop focused on being an opportunity  to provide EU national and governmental CSIRTs teams' technical specialists with a  possibility to share and discuss about the latest developments and challenges with regard to  CSIRTs services, the second part of the workshop (later renamed to ENISA/EC3 workshop)  kept the focus on cooperation between national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe and  their national Law Enforcement counterparts. Representatives from both communities were  invited to these events.   The 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop23 – an annual gathering of both CSIRT and LEA communities,  focused on cooperation between national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe and their  national Law Enforcement counterparts, during which a presentation of this study was made  22 A flair for sharing - encouraging information exchange between CERTs:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing  23 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  19  and the draft of the report was sent to all attendees. The feedback received from the  participants served as input to this study.  2.3.1.2 ENISA’s work done in the field of ‘Actionable Information’  Extracting timely information that can be immediately acted on from vast amounts of all types of  data flowing in remains a challenge. This type of information is referred to as ‘actionable  information’24. In the field of data sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, being able to extract actionable  information from the data transferred as well as selecting the data to transfer to fit the need of the  receiver is a central point.   Actionable Information for Security Incident Response study25 - This study is a good practice  guide for the exchange and processing of actionable information.   Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information inventory26 -  This report is an inventory of 53 information sharing standards and 16 information  management tools relevant to the concept of actionable information.   ENISA Threat Landscape 201427 - This report consolidates the top cyber threats and emerging  threat trends in various technological and application areas.  24 Actionable Information: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information  25 Actionable Information for Security Incident Response study:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for- security  26 Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information inventory:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information  27 ENISA Threat Landscape 2014: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  20  2.3.2 Results of the analysed taxonomies  To enable sharing of information, a common taxonomy should answer the needs of CSIRT and LEA  communities. The classification offered by a common taxonomy should be acceptable for both  communities while being easy to use and implement in any tool that is used, and be easy to adapt.  This section reviews the pros and cons of each taxonomy presented in the first deliverable.  The table below provides an overview of the ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ of each taxonomy.  NR.

Table 1 - Pros and Cons of the studied taxonomies  2.3.2.1 Taxonomy 1, 2 and 3: The CERT NIC.LV taxonomy, ‘the common language’ and the eCISRT  taxonomy  These three taxonomies are presented in the documentation on existing taxonomies on the ENISA  website29. Although they may be an appropriate comparison point for the creation or the selection  of a taxonomy, the website mentions that they are now outdated and should not be used apart as  inspirational material to create a new taxonomy.  2.3.2.2 Taxonomy 4: The CERT.PT taxonomy  The CERT.PT taxonomy was presented by EC3 as the preferred choice of the common taxonomy (EC3  reached out to the LEA community through the EUCTF. At the time, no objections were raised by the  LEA community).  Although named ‘CERT.PT’ taxonomy, it is a product of a collaboration between several European  CSIRTs (from Austria, Belgium, Estonia and also CERT-EU) and the Portuguese police. CERT.PT  worked in collaboration with the police to add value to the taxonomy by introducing international  legal references into the taxonomy, reviewing the objectives of the taxonomy and proposing it to  EC3 as a candidate for a common taxonomy.  One of the main advantages of this taxonomy is that it could be easily adapted to fit the needs of  both communities or to take into account the new phenomena that could occur.  Secondly, the taxonomy intends to be precise while maintaining a high level of classification to be  easily used and understood across the communities of CSIRTs and LEAs. If in the future, more details  would become required for some parts of it, the taxonomy could be updated to add the required  information.  Finally, the taxonomy is already in use by some LEAs and CSIRTs and seems to have proven its  efficiency in the exchange of information.  However, one of the disadvantages is that the CERT.PT taxonomy is a very high-level classification.  The categories of incidents and events presented in this taxonomy are very broad. Therefore, an  incident described using the CERT.PT taxonomy would not provide many details regarding the  28 Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes: https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800- guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/988-ccn-stic-817-gestion-de-ciberincidentes/file.html  29 Existing taxonomies: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident- management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies  https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800-guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/988-ccn-stic-817-gestion-de-ciberincidentes/file.html https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800-guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/988-ccn-stic-817-gestion-de-ciberincidentes/file.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  22  incident itself. The taxonomy is therefore easy to use and statistics can created based on its  classification, but it limits the level of details of the classification of an incident.  2.3.2.3 Taxonomy 5: The AVOIDIT taxonomy  The AVOIDIT30 taxonomy is documented as a taxonomy to represent attacks in an innovative way to  allow a detailed classification, by characterising the attacks by five classifiers: attack vector, target,  operational impact, informational impact and defence. Although being innovative, this taxonomy  has not currently reached acceptance by any of the communities and no implementation or use of it  was found during the time of drafting this study.  2.3.2.4 Taxonomy 6: Data Harmonization Ontology  The ontology has been created by many CSIRTs as part of the AbuseHelper31 activity.  The taxonomy provided for the classification of abuse events is well-documented and quite simple  to use. It also defines key Indicators of Compromise (IOC) to be used as basis to communicate abuse  events. It also contains details of required fields that should appear in every report sent.  Although more detailed than the CERT.PT taxonomy, it seems that it has not reached a critical mass  of users and it seems to have a limited response from the business industry outside of the CSIRT  community.  2.3.2.5 Taxonomy 7: The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS)  This taxonomy32  is available on the internet and seems to be quite complete and useful for the  description of incidents. It has a good recognition by the business and can easily be implemented.  Although the VERIS taxonomy is an appropriate candidate and has additional features like the  specific database to store information, the main difficulty is the adaptation to fit the needs of the  CSIRT and LEA community. Adapting the taxonomy to the needs of this study is feasible, since the  data is available on GitHub33, but it would then deviate from the framework provided by Verizon and  make it more challenging to use for a future expansion of the sharing between the CSIRT and LEA  communities.  The level of complexity of the taxonomy seems to be rather high compared to others like the Data  Harmonization Ontology or the CERT.PT taxonomy. It therefore allows a more fine-grained detail of  events and incidents, but requires more input and a better technical knowledge from the user.  30 AVOIDIT: A Cyber Attack Taxonomy: http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/proceedings/2014/6- SimmonsEtAl.pdf  31 AbuseHelper: https://bitbucket.org/clarifiednetworks/abusehelper/wiki/Home  32 The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing: http://veriscommunity.net/  33 GitHub is a web-based repository hosting service offering distributed revision control and source code  management (SCM) functionality. https://github.com/  http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/proceedings/2014/6-SimmonsEtAl.pdf http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/proceedings/2014/6-SimmonsEtAl.pdf https://bitbucket.org/clarifiednetworks/abusehelper/wiki/Home http://veriscommunity.net/ https://github.com/  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  23  2.3.2.6 Taxonomy 8: Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX)  The CybOX34 taxonomy, provided by MITRE35 in parallel to STIX36 and TAXII37, provides a well- structured taxonomy for threats and events and has a good acceptance by the business. Similarly to  the VERIS taxonomy, it is available on the Internet but the main difficulty for this study is the fact  that it is owned by MITRE and therefore not easily adaptable to the needs of the community without  deviating from the original taxonomy.  The level of complexity of this taxonomy is rather high and requires more input and technical  knowledge from the user. Therefore, it may prove more challenging to be used by LEA.  2.3.2.7 Taxonomy 9: The taxonomy used in Hungary by CSIRTs and LEAs  It was mentioned that a taxonomy, developed by the Hungarian police, was already in use in  Hungary for the sharing of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. This taxonomy or concrete  examples of its use could not be shared with ENISA as it is classified.  2.3.2.8 Taxonomy 10: Phänomene Cybercrime taxonomy  The Swiss Federal Police mentioned during their interview that they were drafting a taxonomy for  the exchange of information in Switzerland and agreed to send it to ENISA to report on it in this  study. The Swiss Federal Police taxonomy, named ‘Phänomene Cybercrime’ is currently only  available in German. It is divided in three categories: ‘Cyber-WK’ (representing the general attacks),  sexual offenses and defamation.  The ‘Phänomene Cybercrime’ taxonomy describes every type of attack and action in a detailed  manner to avoid any confusion, but the information is classified according to the type of crime more  than the type of attack. For example, ‘Forbidden porn’ is also part of that taxonomy, while it is not  technically an attack but illegal use of a network. Although this type of taxonomy might be adapted  for the exchange of information between LEAs, it might be less relevant for the CSIRTs.  2.3.2.9 Taxonomy 11: CSIRT-MU taxonomy, Czech Republic  CSIRT-MU mentioned during their interview that they were drafting a taxonomy for the exchange of  information with the LEAs and agreed to send it to ENISA to use it in this study.  The CSIRT-MU taxonomy is high-level and contains around twenty types of attacks and their  description, with links to the Czech law and the Decree on cyber security. It also contains indications  for the CSIRT remediation and usable evidence.  34 Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX): https://cybox.mitre.org/  35 MITRE is a not-for-profit organization that operates research and development centres sponsored by the  federal government. http://www.mitre.org/  36 Structured Threat Information eXpression, a structured language for cyber threat intelligence:  https://stixproject.github.io/  37 Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information, a transport mechanism for the exchange of threat  information: https://taxiiproject.github.io/  https://cybox.mitre.org/ http://www.mitre.org/ https://stixproject.github.io/ https://taxiiproject.github.io/  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  24  2.3.2.10 Taxonomy 12: Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes  During feedback received after the workshop of the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, this taxonomy was  presented by CCN-CERT38. This taxonomy includes issues that were encountered in Spain and has  been published in May 2015 as part of the CCN-STIC-817 security guide issued by CCN-CERT.  The taxonomy includes three levels of classification: the type of cyber incidents, including type,  description and subtype, the danger of these incidents and the potential impact.  Although the taxonomy is very broad (high-level classification) and lacks complexity compared to  others like CybOX or VERIS, it is still easy to implement. Besides, the way it considers the different  subtypes of classification (type, danger and impact) could be of use for CSIRTs and LEAs to estimate  the importance of the problem.  2.3.3 Requirements for a taxonomy based on the needs for information CSIRTs and LEAs  as expressed during the interviews  Throughout the 26 interviews, this study was able to capture requirements expressed by the  different communities concerning the taxonomy for the exchange of information between CSIRTs  and LEAs. This section details these requirements and how each taxonomy presented in this  deliverable meets the requirements.  These requirements are considered as validated by the interviewees (14 CSIRTs and 12 LEA  representatives) according to the following formula:   At least 30% of the interviewees mentioned this information.   At least 51% of the interviewees mentioning this information have agreed to the statement.  If these conditions are met, the information is considered as ‘sufficiently justified’ and the  requirement based on this information should be taken into account for the selection of the  taxonomy. If it is not the case, the information is mentioned in this study as ‘information with  limited justification’ and the requirement won’t be considered as verified by the community and is  therefore not a priority requirement that the taxonomy should meet.  38 CCN-CERT: national Spanish CSIRT: https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/  https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  25  The following table summarises the requirements expressed through the interviews.

It must be noted that this only represents the opinion of the attendees of the  workshop and therefore does not represent the opinion of either community.  The following sections detail the different requirements and how the taxonomies meet these  requirements.  2.3.3.1 Requirement 1: The taxonomy should take the level of maturity of LEAs in term of  technical capabilities into account  The first requirement concerns the abilities of LEAs to implement advanced technical solutions.  Many interviewees mentioned that the technical abilities of the LEAs were often less advanced than  the CSIRTs technical capacity. This requirement is one of the justified pieces of information obtained  during the interviews and can therefore be considered as a main requirement.  To take that difference in technical level into account, the taxonomy should be simple to implement  and understand, with a clear definition of its vocabulary. This might help in overcoming the  difference in capabilities to implement a taxonomy that was observed between CSIRTs and LEAs.  This would allow all stakeholders to implement and use the taxonomy in an easy and efficient  manner.  The level of detail of a common taxonomy should also be accessible enough to describe events and  incidents in a precise way while still being understandable and easily usable. For example, having too  many levels of detail for the type of events and incidents (if one event has several subtypes which in  turn have several subtypes etc.) would make classification complex for the user, while being allowed  to divide the information between a limited amount of high-level classes would limit the level of  detail but allow the user to easily classify the information.  Regarding the available taxonomies, the CERT.PT taxonomy, the Esquema nacional de seguridad  Gestión de ciberincidentes, the Phänomene Cybercrime and the Data Harmonization Ontology could  be considered as easy to use while VERIS, CybOX and the AVOIDIT taxonomies are more complex to  use because of the level of detail available. The CSIRT-MU taxonomy, although easy to use, might be  unnecessarily simple for most countries in the EU.  This requirement was supported by the votes of the workshop where the ease of use of the  taxonomy was confirmed as an important element for the exchange of information.  2.3.3.2 Requirement 2: The taxonomy should fit for both high- and low-level data  Throughout the interviews, we observed that CSIRTs and LEAs share both high- and low-level data,  even if the exchange of information is not structured. For the taxonomy to be adopted by all parties,  it would be useful to be able to make use of the taxonomy to classify the information that is already  exchanged – this is one of the justified pieces of information obtained during the interviews and can  therefore be considered as the main requirement.  If a common taxonomy allows the user to classify the information that is already sent between  CSIRTs and LEAs, this would have a positive effect on the perception of the use of the taxonomy. In  addition, if a taxonomy would be kept up-to-date by regular adaptations to new phenomena, it  might allow both communities to integrate into the taxonomy those types of information that  cannot yet be classified.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  27  Regarding the sharing of low-level data (the three first levels of the pyramid of pain49: hash values, IP  addresses and domain names), all taxonomies allow the sharing of such information. The difference  in the taxonomies appears when the stakeholders want to share high-level information (such as  tactics, techniques and procedures). While the VERIS and the CybOX taxonomies allow the sharing of  (at least a part of) such information, the AVOIDIT taxonomy is not as complete, and the CERT.PT  taxonomy, the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes, the Data Harmonisation  Ontology, the CSIRT-MU taxonomy and the Phänomene Cybercrime are not as detailed and focus  more on incidents and events.  2.3.3.3 Requirement 3: The taxonomy should be as complete as possible regarding the types of  events and incidents  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  Three CSIRT representatives mentioned during the interviews that, in order to be useful for the  exchange of information, a common taxonomy should be exhaustive regarding the types of events  and incidents. Having an exhaustive taxonomy would allow CSIRTs and LEAs to fit any kind of event  and incident into the classification of the taxonomy thereby possibly raising the acceptance of the  taxonomy.  This requirement can be linked with the first one (‘the taxonomy should take the level of maturity of  the LEAs in term of technical capabilities into account’) since the level of complexity of a taxonomy is  proportional to its completeness in terms of events and incidents. While all taxonomies try to be as  complete as possible, the level of detail and subcategories about an incident or an event may vary  from one to another. In that regard, VERIS, the AVOIDIT taxonomy and CybOX are the most  complete (but also the most complex) while, the CERT.PT taxonomy, the CSIRT-MU taxonomy, the  Phänomene Cybercrime and the Data Harmonization Ontology define events and incidents with  high-level description. The Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes also falls in  that category but has an interesting point of view on classification, danger and impact.  2.3.3.4 Requirement 4: The format of the taxonomy should be stable in time  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  During the interviews, two CSIRTs mentioned that, to ensure that a taxonomy would not constantly  change, it should stay stable throughout time and avoid being adapted too regularly. This would  allow both communities to use the taxonomy without having to update its implementation into tools  too often, which would be time and resource intensive.  Based on the comparison with the other requirements, we can see that this requirement should stay  in balance with the possibility to update the taxonomy. While updating the taxonomy too often  might be a problem for CSIRTs and LEAs, it also needs to be kept up-to-date to take new phenomena  into account.  49 The pyramid of pain is a diagram that shows the relationship between the types of indicators you might use  to detect an adversary's activities and how much pain it will cause them when you are able to deny those  indicators to them: http://detect-respond.blogspot.fr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html.  http://detect-respond.blogspot.fr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  28  Regarding the stability of a taxonomy, the VERIS taxonomy has been updated last year (2014) and  Verizon is planning an annual or bi-annual update. CybOX is also updated with a mean of twice a  year since 2011. However, the Data Harmonisation Ontology, the CERT.PT taxonomy and the  AVOIDIT taxonomy have not been updated since they were firstly drawn up. It must be noted that if  the OAP 4.1 working group selects the CERT.PT taxonomy as the common taxonomy to use for the  exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs, they plan to update the taxonomy yearly  through meetings of its stakeholders. For the CSIRT-MU taxonomy and the Phänomene Cybercrime,  since they are still at draft version, they might evolve anytime.  The case of the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes is a bit specific since its  release date was in May 2015, the year of this report. It has therefore not been updated yet.  During the ENISA/EC3 workshop, the attendees mentioned the fact that the stability of the  taxonomy was indeed an important concern for the exchange of information.  2.3.3.5 Requirement 5: Some information should be mandatory in the taxonomy  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the CSIRT and respectively the LEA communities during the  interviews.  Three CSIRTs and one LEA representative mentioned during the interviews that some fields of the  taxonomy should always be mandatory when the taxonomy is used to classify information. That  way, if the information is exchanged based on the proposed taxonomy, the recipient of the  information can be sure that a minimal set of information will always be provided.  Most of the fields in the CybOX taxonomy are not mandatory, while VERIS and the Data  Harmonization Ontology have some mandatory fields. The CERT.PT, the Esquema nacional de  seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes, the CSIRT-MU taxonomy, the Phänomene Cybercrime and the  AVOIDIT taxonomy do not specify which fields are mandatory but are high-level description so all  information can be considered as mandatory by default (missing information would void the use of  these taxonomies).  2.3.3.6 Requirement 6: The taxonomy should have a description of the terms used to agree  upon terminology  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  One CSIRT representative and two LEA representatives mentioned during the interviews that, to  ensure that CSIRTs and LEAs use the same vocabulary regarding cyber incidents, the taxonomy  should describe the terms used to classify the information, such as types of events and incidents.  This would avoid confusion while classifying or sharing information based on the taxonomy.  All taxonomies presented in this study describe the terminology used to classify information.  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, the attendees also mentioned that this requirement was  important to be able to classify the information correctly, and that the description of each element  of the taxonomy was necessary.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  29  2.3.3.7 Requirement 7: The taxonomy should be updated regularly during meetings with its  stakeholders  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  During the interviews, one CSIRT representative and four LEA representatives mentioned that the  taxonomy should be updated on a regular basis. This should be done by having regular meetings  between the relevant stakeholders using the taxonomy. Updating the taxonomy would ensure that  it stays up-to-date and adapts to new phenomena encountered by the stakeholders.  VERIS and CybOX are maintained by institutions that manage their updates, although they take into  account users’ remarks. The data Harmonization Ontology and the AVOIDIT taxonomy are not  updated anymore and the CERT.PT will be adapted in the future if it is chosen by the OAP 4.1  working group as the promoted common taxonomy for this information exchange. The CSIRT-MU  taxonomy and the Phänomene Cybercrime are currently being drafted so their update process is not  yet known. Regarding the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes, it has just  been created so the update process is not known yet at the time of this study.  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, the update of the taxonomy was indeed mentioned as  important for the evolution and the use of the taxonomy in the exchange of information.  2.3.3.8 Requirement 8: The Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Directive should be taken  as legal basis for the taxonomy  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  Some LEA representatives mentioned during the interview that the Budapest Convention50 and the  Cybercrime Directive51 should be taken as legal basis for the taxonomy. This element was also  supported by an anonymous vote during the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop where 67% of the voters were  of the opinion that the taxonomy should include a mapping to both European and National  legislations.  VERIS and CybOX are US-based and do not take into account the Budapest Convention and the  Cybercrime Directive. In addition, the Data Harmonization Ontology and the AVOIDIT taxonomy do  not make any mention of it. The Phänomene Cybercrime and the Esquema nacional de seguridad  Gestión de ciberincidentes are not linked with the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime  Directive. Therefore, the CERT.PT taxonomy and the CSIRT-MU taxonomy are the only ones aligning  to this Convention and Directive since it has been constructed for the exchange of information with  the European LEA.  50 Convention on Cyber crime, Budapest, 23.XI.2001:  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/185.htm  51 Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against  information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:218:0008:0014:EN:PDF  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/185.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:218:0008:0014:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:218:0008:0014:EN:PDF  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  30  2.3.3.9 Requirement 9: The taxonomy should be mapped to the relevant EU and Council of  Europe legal framework and where possible to legislation in the Member States  Based on the specification of this study, the selected taxonomy should be mapped to the relevant  EU legislation such as the Cybercrime Directive, to the Budapest Convention and, where possible, to  the national legislation of the Member States.  Among the taxonomies examined by this study, the CERT.PT taxonomy and the CSIRT-MU taxonomy  are the only ones that reference the legislation – they specify EU legislation and the corresponding  national regulations. It must be underlined that the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de  ciberincidentes underlines the procedure of a declaration of an incident to the CCN-CERT.  2.3.3.10 Other possible requirements based on feedback received after the ENISA/EC3 workshop  In addition to the requirements mentioned in the previous sections, one CSIRT is of the opinion that  a taxonomy should support the categorisation of classified information, such as EU SECRET and  NATO SECRET. However, based on the information collected during the interviews, it seems that in  the current context of information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, it does not seem that such  information is exchanged actively. Therefore such a requirement may be further considered in a  future context, but not within the scope of this study  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  31  2.3.4 Input from the OAP 4.1 working group regarding the taxonomy selected  During the OAP 4.1 working group meeting in The Hague on the 4 May 2015 with EC3 and through  interviews with two LEA representatives, the following information was provided:   The OAP 4.1 working group can relate to the definition of a taxonomy52 used in this study: a  taxonomy is most often defined as a classification of terms and has a close relationship with  the use of ontology.   The OAP 4.1 working group is currently setting up a governance structure in order to revise  the common taxonomy during bi-annual meetings.   The OAP 4.1 working group considers that STIX could possibly be a good candidate as  sharing mechanism to use for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs using  the chosen common taxonomy. To be able to use STIX, the OAP 4.1 working group should  define STIX profiles53 for LEAs.  This input provided by the OAP 4.1 working group stakeholders has been taken into consideration  for the choice of the taxonomy and a sharing mechanism for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LEAs. The possibilities of alignment of this study to the OAP 4.1 working group were also  taken into account as they might provide the advantages previously mentioned in this document (in  ‘Objectives of aligning this study with the OAP 4.1 working group for the taxonomy’).  52 Ontology and taxonomies for critical infrastructures: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology  53 Profiles are a mechanism to describe a particular usage of STIX as practiced by a community, organization, or  tool.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  32  2.4 Verification that the preferred taxonomy (CERT.PT taxonomy) fits the  requirements highlighted during the interviews and identified from desk  research  This section presents the result of the analysis of the taxonomies considered by this study. For each  taxonomy, this section verifies whether it meets requirements identified at the previous section.  2.4.1 Why the CERT.PT taxonomy is best adapted for the exchange of information  between both communities  As detailed in the next section (the analysis of the requirements met by each taxonomy), the  CERT.PT taxonomy seems to be best fitted for the exchange of information, based on the minor  complexity of the taxonomy, its possibilities of evolution based on the needs of both communities  and its legal basis for the consideration of events and incidents.  Proposing the CERT.PT taxonomy may also have the advantage of aligning this study to the OAP 4.1  working group, as detailed in the section ‘Objectives of aligning this study with the OAP 4.1 working  group for the taxonomy‘.  2.4.2 Analysis of the requirements met by each taxonomy  In the summary table in the previous section ‘Requirements for a taxonomy based on the needs for  information CSIRTs and LEAs as expressed during the interviews’, we can observe two tendencies in  the taxonomies considered by this study:   Taxonomies tending to be as detailed as possible, that are therefore complex to use but  exhaustive, managed by organisations that have the ownership of the taxonomy, and   High-level taxonomies that are easy to use and do not contain a highly detailed structure to  describe the incidents and events.  This can be determined by observing the mapping of the first three requirements (‘The taxonomy  should take the level of maturity of LEAs in term of technical capabilities into account’, ‘The  taxonomy should be able to transmit high- and low-level data’ and ‘The taxonomy should be as  complete as possible regarding the types of events and incidents’).  Based on our observations, we can see that the use of a complex and exhaustive taxonomy may not  be a solution per se – the choice between complexity and completeness should be done according  to the capabilities of the stakeholders in information exchange.  For the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs, considering the high difference in terms  of technical capabilities between Member States, we consider that a better approach might be to  start with a taxonomy that is simple to use to make sure that it gets accepted by all CSIRTs and LEAs  as a common basis. At a later stage, if there would be a preference for an increase of the level of  detail, the taxonomy could be further elaborated by the stakeholders to meet the new  requirements. Towards this end, two taxonomies would fit the best to the first three requirements,  the Data Harmonization Ontology and the CERT.PT taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  33  The preference for the ease of use of a taxonomy was further supported by an anonymous vote  during the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop where a majority of respondents expressed that the ease of use  of a taxonomy should be the priority against the level of detail. Additionally, 30% of the voters  answered that both should be considered as priority. The need for an easy-to-use but also detailed  taxonomy might be answered by starting to exchange information based on a simple taxonomy and  upgrade it to a higher level of detail afterwards, when the use of the taxonomy would be well  implemented.  According to the requirements that were expressed during the interviewed CSIRTs and LEAs, we  can observe that the CERT.PT taxonomy is best fitted for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LEAs since it is based on the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Directive, and  that there is a possibility that it may be selected by the OAP 4.1 working group as the taxonomy to  be used for information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, and therefore be regularly updated based  on the requirements of the communities.  The CERT.PT taxonomy is also the only taxonomy presented in this study to reference EU legislation,  which has been identified as a requirement, which was supported by the votes during the 4th  ENISA/EC3 workshop.  The following table presents a summary of the possible advantages of using the CERT.PT taxonomy  for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs:  NR. ADVANTAGES OF THE CERT.PT TAXONOMY  1.  The CERT.PT taxonomy is easy to use and implement since it describes events and  incidents at a high level.  2.  The CERT.PT taxonomy, if it is chosen by the OAP 4.1 working group, will be updated  regularly through meetings of its stakeholders.  3.  The classification provided by the CERT.PT taxonomy makes all fields mandatory,  which provides consistency for the creation of statistics.  4. The CERT.PT is based on the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Directive.  5.  The events and incidents mentioned in the CERT.PT taxonomy are described, which  provides a common understanding of used terms.  Table 3 - Advantages of the CERT.PT taxonomy  In addition to the advantage that the CERT.PT taxonomy is being considered as a potential candidate  by the OAP 4.1 working group, it is already being implemented into some tools by some CSIRTs to  exchange information according to its classification and has proven efficient.  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, the participants confirmed, during the closing session of the  workshop, that according to them the CERT.PT taxonomy is sufficiently accepted by the CSIRT and  LEA communities.  For the future update of the CERT.PT taxonomy, the use of the other inputs and feedback provided  after the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, such as the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de  ciberincidentes and some other comments on the CERT.PT taxonomy should be used during the first  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  34  meeting of the CERT.PT governance structure to evaluate the input these studies could provide for  the current version of the CERT.PT taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  35  2.5 Proposal for a sharing mechanism for the selected taxonomy  A clear distinction should be made between a taxonomy, a sharing mechanism and a sharing  platform to avoid any possible confusion. While a taxonomy is a way of describing information  through classification, a sharing mechanism structures the way the information is encoded. For  example, a sharing mechanism might provide rules for names and positions of XML tags to allow a  file to be treated automatically. Finally, a sharing platform is a tool allowing to share information. It  is not mandatory to have such a platform – files containing information structured according to a  standard and classified according to a taxonomy could simply be sent by e-mail, for example.  Nevertheless, the use of a sharing platform allows users to easily share information in a structured  way.  While a taxonomy allows classification of the information, it does not provide a format for the  representation or the sharing of the information. This section presents the different requirements  for the sharing mechanism obtained through desk research and interviews, and observes how  sharing mechanisms taken into consideration for this study meet these requirements. The last part  justifies the choice of STIX as the proposed sharing mechanism and possibilities of future  alignment with the OAP 4.1 working group. However, the choice of STIX as the sharing mechanism  is not yet fully supported by both communities, as explained in section 2.5.3.  2.5.1 Requirements for the sharing mechanism highlighted by the desk research  Based on the desk research, information and recommendations for sharing mechanisms for the  exchange of information is detailed here. This information is not always focused on CSIRTs and LEAs  but more generally speaking about information exchange. These requirements and the  requirements highlighted through the interviews (in section 2.5.2) have been supported by the vote  of the attendees of the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop where the feedback about them was positive – 83%  of voters found these requirements ‘likely representative’ and 17% of them found the requirements  ‘very much representative’.  2.5.1.1 Requirement 1: The new sharing mechanism should not be a new standard 54  Considering the amount of already existing initiatives, creating a new standard for the exchange of  information between CSIRTs and LEAs could hinder the acceptance of the mechanism by CSIRTs and  LEAs, and later on by third parties (considering that the OAP 4.1 working group is also targeting the  use of the taxonomy and the sharing mechanism by the private sector).  Therefore, this study was directed towards the proposal for the use of an existing mechanism  instead of the creation of a new one.  54 Good practice guide for addressing NIS aspects of cybercrime:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice-guide-for- addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice-guide-for-addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice-guide-for-addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime/at_download/fullReport  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  36  2.5.1.2 Requirement 2: The source of the data of the sharing mechanism should be referenced,  including the originating organisation, the transport mechanism and the data format55  For information to be actionable, there must be a clear indication of its origin. Based on the source  of the data, the receiver of the information can decide to trust or not to trust the information  received. The sharing mechanism should therefore allow its users to indicate the details of the  source of the information transmitted.  2.5.1.3 Requirement 3: The sharing mechanism should have a level of acceptance among the  business56  Until recently, none of the mechanisms available to structure information exchange were considered  popular among the private sector. Nowadays, STIX is growing in popularity and is progressively  turning into a de facto standard. It is considered as a reliable and exhaustive tool to structure  information, and it is conveniently provided with the specification for a sharing mechanism, TAXII.  2.5.2 Requirements for the sharing mechanism highlighted through interviews  2.5.2.1 Requirement 1: The sharing mechanism should be considered as an appropriate tool for  the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs  Through the interviews, it appeared that CSIRTs and LEAs consider STIX as an appropriate tool for  the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. Although some of the CSIRTs and the LEAs  pointed out its complexity, most of them considered it as adaptable for information sharing.  The respondents also mentioned that, to be able to use STIX for information sharing, profiles would  have to be defined for LEAs. The profiles allow users to describe how they use STIX – what kind of  information they need, which parts of it should or should not be indicated in the information  transmitted. For example, if a user of STIX just wants to receive information about spam e-mails, he  could specify that the type of information he wants to receive is about spam, that he only needs the  observables and indicators in the information and does not need details about the target, the  attacker etc.  2.5.2.2 Requirement 2: The lack of human resources should not be an obstacle for the  implementation of a standard  While some CSIRTs and LEAs said that implementing a standard to share information would not be a  problem, some others mentioned that, considering their lack of human resources, implementing  such a tool would be rather resource intensive.  55 Actionable information for security: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable- information/actionable-information-for-security/at_download/fullReport  56 Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for- exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information/at_download/fullReport  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  37  2.5.3 Why STIX could be an appropriate sharing mechanism  Although multiple standards exist for the sharing of information, STIX appears to be the preferred  mechanism for the exchange mechanism, also recognised by the CSIRT and LEA communities as a  suitable candidate for a sharing mechanism, although its use for the exchange of information  between CSIRTs and LEAS is still under discussion. Indeed, using STIX would avoid rebuilding a  standard from scratch, which would represent a huge amount of work. It is also a mechanism that is  widely known and becoming a de facto standard according to the ENISA study ‘Standards and tools  for exchange and processing of actionable information’57.  STIX allows for a very close description of information – including the detailed description of the  source of the data exchanged, which is a requirement that has been pointed out during the desk  research. In addition, as STIX is a structured language to describe information, it can be  implemented together with any cyber incidents taxonomy. Besides, the STIX model is constituted of  different elements that relate to each other, which makes it feasible to use a step-by-step approach  in its implementation, by implementing the different parts of the model. In this process, the basic  parts of the STIX model could be implemented first, such as observables (the lowest element of the  Pyramid of Pain49), and then grown in complexity by adding other elements of the model when  feasible.  Regarding the lack of resources mentioned by some of the Member States, there might be ways to  overcome the complexity of the implementation of the tool, like cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEAs to implement it, specific help from ENISA or EC3, centralisation of a platform, etc. However,  these situations should be treated on a case-by-case basis.  Although a sharing mechanism would offer advantages, the use of sharing mechanisms and a  sharing platform is not supported by all stakeholders. It appeared through the 4th ENISA/EC3  workshop feedback session that some members of the community are not inclined to use STIX due  to its complexity, but also that some of them might prefer to use independent sharing mechanisms  on a case-by-case basis by taking into account the needs of the receiver of the information  exchanged – such as using a CSV file to send information to an ISP. Therefore, a separate study  should be set-up once the taxonomy has been implemented to see if there is sufficient demand for a  common sharing mechanism or if the local existing mechanisms in place should be kept.  Alternatively, if a unique sharing mechanism would be chosen, STIX is a ‘good enough’ solution  according to the feedback received during the workshop. If needed, it might also be implemented  step-by-step to reduce the complexity of the mechanism.  2.6 Proposed model to adapt the selected taxonomy to new phenomena  For the taxonomy to be used by the CSIRT and LEA communities, it should be regularly updated to  respond to the new needs of each community and the new phenomena appearing. This section  details the requirements for this update process that were highlighted by the interviews and the  proposed model for the regular update of the taxonomy.  57 Source: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools- for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  38  2.6.1 Requirements for maintaining a taxonomy highlighted by the interviews  This section presents requirements obtained through the interviews of CSIRTs and LEAs that should  be met by the model to adapt the chosen taxonomy.  2.6.1.1 Requirement 1: The update of the taxonomy and the exchange of information should be  supported by informal personal meetings  This is one of the pieces of justified information – all the CSIRTs and LEAs mentioning personal  meetings agreed that these meetings were necessary to maintain trust and keep the exchange of  information alive. While this is not a requirement directly addressed to the update of the taxonomy,  it adds to the following requirement (‘the update of the taxonomy should be performed regularly by  doing meetings with the stakeholders’). See below section.  Indeed, since personal meetings are considered vital to keep the exchange of information going,  these meetings could also be used to discuss the taxonomy and the need to update it to new  phenomena.  2.6.1.2 Requirement 2: The update of the taxonomy should be performed regularly by regular  meetings with the stakeholders  A number of CSIRTs and LEA mentioned that, to ensure that the taxonomy is updated and kept in  line with the requirements of the communities, meetings should take place regularly (at least once a  year) to ensure that the taxonomy stays ‘alive’. The more that input is received from the users of the  taxonomy, the more that the taxonomy will be adapted to the needs and, therefore, used.  2.6.2 Model to adapt the taxonomy based on the requirements  Based on our observations, we can divide the process of updating taxonomies into two models:  ‘dynamic’ and ‘unidirectional’.  The dynamic update of a taxonomy is done through meetings happening at regular intervals. During  these meetings, the stakeholders (owners, users, etc.) meet and share their experience and their  wishes regarding the evolution of the taxonomy. These meetings can be physical but online  meetings are also sufficient to update the taxonomy.  The unidirectional update of a taxonomy is usually in place when the taxonomy is owned by an  entity: users send a request for an update of the taxonomy and the owner of the taxonomy accepts  them and integrates them into the taxonomy or simply refuses them.  Regarding the update of the proposed common taxonomy for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LEAs, considering the low amount of stakeholders and the intention to be adapted to the  needs of the stakeholders, we recommend to implement a dynamic update of the taxonomy by  setting up regular meetings.  Also, a structure should be put in place to allow exceptional reviews of the taxonomy. In case of an  urgent need, this would allow the users of the taxonomy to request a change to the taxonomy  outside of the regular meetings, to meet new urgent needs.  The OAP 4.1 working group also considers regular meetings of the stakeholders to adapt the  taxonomy as a good way to proceed for its updates. They were setting up such meetings at the time  of writing of this report (2015).  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  39  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, this ‘update model’ based on regular meetings of the  stakeholders was supported by the majority of the voters. However, a concern about the costs for  such meetings was also expressed, but these could be avoided by co-locating meetings with another  meeting addressing the same communities, such as the ENISA/EC3 workshops.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  40  3 Proposal for a roadmap for the use of the taxonomy in a  sharing solution  Once a common taxonomy has been agreed, endorsed by ENISA and EC3 and accepted by the CSIRT  and LEA communities, the classification of the information proposed by the taxonomy can be  effectively used in the exchange of information between both communities. The taxonomy should  be used to further assist CSIRTs and LEAs in improving the information exchange and in accessing  information if the taxonomy has been effectively ‘implemented’ by them, or assigned to content, in  some way.  To achieve that goal, a mechanism to exchange the information based on the taxonomy  classification should be chosen, refined and further applied by the CSIRT and LEA communities.  Such a mechanism can be either supported by existing or further systems and technologies in place  at the CSIRTs and LEAs – with anticipated long-terms benefits in terms of decreasing necessary  effort/cost for exchanging information – or can be based only on agreements and protocols that  implement the taxonomy.  Based on our observations, without an agreed-upon mechanism, the exchange of data, even with a  common language, would remain unstructured and therefore could not be automatically processed.  For example, if a LEA and a CSIRT have an agreement on the taxonomy to use for the exchange of  information between them but have no agreement on a sharing mechanism, the LEA might send  information to the CSIRT in a simple text format. The CSIRT would be able to understand the  information the same way as the LEA thanks to the taxonomy, but they would not be able to  automatically enter this information into their systems without transforming it into the right format.  Having a common exchange mechanism would ensure that the format of the file that is exchanged is  the same, and therefore can easily be integrated in the tools of every receiver.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  41  3.1 Key tasks to perform for the implementation of the taxonomy  Based on the desk research, the interviews and the goals of the OAP 4.1 working group, this section  presents a roadmap, consisting of a set of short-term and long-term actions proposed for the  implementation of an information exchange between CSIRTs and LEAs communities. Conceptually,  these short-term and long-term actions can be grouped in the following categories, corresponding  to the typical phases of implementation for the taxonomies:  Key success factors for the implementation of the proposed roadmap consist of:   Integration into the day-to-day operations of CSIRTs and LEAs, eventually supported by a  sharing platform allowing for integration with the existing technical systems and  technologies in place is critical for the success of the taxonomy adoption. It is key that once  the taxonomy has been validated by end-users, it needs to be completely integrated into the  systems and technologies that are in place, or in the planned new ones (e.g. common  sharing platform). Changes and refinements to the taxonomy are usually further needed at  this stage – in order to allow for integration adjustments for multiple technical systems and  technologies in place.   Good governance of the taxonomy is critical to maintain its long-term stability and growth.  For this, creating clear policies to allow the community of CSIRT and LEA stakeholders to  effectively manage the taxonomy and its changes is a key success factor. This needs to be  supported by a simple and transparent governance plan.   Achieving a well-managed roll-out of a common taxonomy can emphasise a number of  benefits for CSIRTs and LEAs, in terms of lower efforts / costs for information exchange,  creation and retrieval.   Awareness and a proper training to involved CSIRTs and LEAs for the roll-out and effective  use of the taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  42   Further linking the taxonomy with an existing legislation of the Member States (e.g. based  on the demand of the Member States ) may contribute to a faster speed of adoption of the  taxonomy – by overcoming limitations of the CSIRT and LEA mandates and possible other  limits coming from the legislative framework.   A well-defined and well-organized system for adoption of the taxonomy allows to connect  the relevant CSIRT and LEA content and experts while improving information exchange,  ensuring a proper information security and data compliance.

Creation of a governance structure for the update of the taxonomy  To be able to adapt the taxonomy to a new phenomenon encountered by the communities and also to meet  new requirements that they might have in the future, a simple but effective governance structure should be  put in place by Europol and ENISA to organise regular meetings for the update of the taxonomy. Europol and  ENISA are the most appropriate organisers of this governance structure due to the fact that they are EU  agencies and that they represent both communities.  The first step for the creation of such a structure should be the identification of the stakeholder  representatives. If possible, each CSIRT and LEA from all EU Member States should be represented in the  governance structure that will update the taxonomy. Since Europol has access to the EUCTF mailing list and  ENISA has a mailing-list of national and governmental CSIRTs in EU Member States, Europol should contact  the LEAs of the Member States while ENISA should contact CSIRTs, to ask them to collaborate in such  meetings.  The second step is to plan regular meetings of this governance structure to ensure a regular review of the  taxonomy, with proper consideration of the balance between meeting of the requirements of the  communities and ensuring the stability of the taxonomy. Based on the information collected so far, it seems  that having meetings once or twice a year would be a good compromise. Once again, due to their roles and  contacts lists, Europol and ENISA should be responsible for the organisation of such meetings (choosing the  dates, making the agenda and sending invitations).  In parallel with the creation of the governance structure, the selected taxonomy should be promoted  amongst both LEA and CSIRT communities, to raise awareness about the taxonomy and to incline both  communities to use its classification for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. Having them  use the taxonomy before the choice of a sharing mechanism might provide feedback to be processed by the  governance structure, allowing it to begin updating the taxonomy to the needs of the users. As a result,  when a sharing mechanism and a sharing platform are chosen (which are the following actions), there may  be an accelerated adoption of the taxonomy, the sharing mechanism and the sharing platform. The  promotion of the taxonomy should be performed by ENISA and Europol, since they have the appropriate  contact list for this action (the EUCTF for Europol and a global CSIRT mailing list for ENISA).  3.1.2.2 Action 2. Adapting the chosen sharing mechanism to the taxonomy  As explained previously, the taxonomy itself needs to be accompanied by a sharing mechanism to make the  exchange of information efficient. The sharing mechanism that will be selected has to be adapted to the  taxonomy. A simple example is to define which fields contains the types of events and which other contains  the types of incidents.  Therefore, to integrate the taxonomy into a sharing mechanism, the fields that will contain the classification  provided by the taxonomy should be determined and the mandatory information specified (in the case of  high-level taxonomies like the CERT.PT taxonomy, the specification should define all fields as mandatory).  This task should be executed by Europol, in cooperation with ENISA and the members of the OAP 4.1  working group since they are the main actors in the selection of this taxonomy and are knowledgeable on  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  46  the matter. CERT-EU59 should provide technical support when needed since they already implemented the  CERT.PT taxonomy in information exchange tools.  The kind of information to be exchanged depending on the receiver should be determined as well. In STIX,  this is done by creating profiles, which allow users to define what kind of information they want to receive  (in other words, what part of the data they are interested in). This step could enable the use of the sharing  mechanism together with the taxonomy. Some profiles already exists for CSIRTs which could be reused as  default profiles. The focus of this step should therefore be on the LEAs. Europol, as the EU agency, should  define a LEA profile (in STIX, this is done by modifying the default profile60) with the cooperation of the  members of the OAP 4.1 working group and the LEAs. CSIRTs and LEAs that have specific needs regarding a  common profile and prefer using a specific profile created should also build a profile adapted to their needs.  3.1.2.3 Action 3. Choice of a sharing platform and an implementation model (distributed or global  platform) for the exchange of messages across Member States  As explained in the section ‘Proposition for a sharing mechanism for the selected taxonomy’, three elements  are used for the sharing of information between CSIRTs and LEAs: a taxonomy, a sharing mechanism and a  sharing platform. Once the first two are selected, the third one should be chosen or created. The platform to  exchange information might be simply e-mails, or specific tools could be used, such as MISP61 or  AbuseHelper62, which allows the use of a level of classification (such as TLP63, which was mentioned during  the interviews).  Therefore, selecting a sharing platform that would fit the needs of both communities might allow the  stakeholders to exchange information more easily. Europol and ENISA should execute this step in  collaboration with the OAP 4.1 working group since they have knowledge about the taxonomy and also  know the needs of the CSIRTs and the LEAs.  3.1.2.4 Action 4. Creation of a documentation set on integration, use and examples of the exchange of  information with the sharing mechanism and the taxonomy  Since not all CSIRTs and LEAs are familiar with the use of such tools (a taxonomy, sharing mechanisms and  platforms), the creation of documentation and examples on how to implement these to share information at  a local and EU level could help them through the process. ENISA should create this documentation since they  have an extensive experience in such documentation.  3.1.2.5 Action 5. Organisation of an online workshop to present the taxonomy and the sharing  mechanism to CSIRTs and LEAs  To present the tools (the taxonomy, the sharing mechanism and the sharing platform) to both communities,  demonstrate the use of the tools and gather comments and feedback from CSIRTs and LEAs, a workshop  should be organised to show how the exchange of information could be structured and the objectives and  advantages of such an approach.  59 CERT-EU: https://cert.europa.eu  60 STIX profile template: https://stix.mitre.org/language/profiles/stix_1.2_profile_template_r1.xlsx  61 Malware Information Sharing Platform, http://www.misp-project.org/  62 AbuseHelper, http://abusehelper.be/  63 The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a mechanism widely used in information sharing communities to indicate the  allowed distribution of information. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol  https://cert.europa.eu/ https://stix.mitre.org/language/profiles/stix_1.2_profile_template_r1.xlsx https://stix.mitre.org/language/profiles/stix_1.2_profile_template_r1.xlsx http://www.misp-project.org/ http://abusehelper.be/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  47  To be able to provide that information to all CSIRTs and LEAs and ensure a high participation to the  workshop, Europol and ENISA should organise such a workshop together and handle also invitations to  CSIRTs and LEAs.  3.1.2.6 Action 6. Linking the taxonomy with the legislation of the Member States based on the demand  of the Member States  Some Member States might need the taxonomy to be linked to their national legislation to help them adopt  the taxonomy to overcome limitations of their mandates and other possible limits from the legislative  framework (especially for the LEAs since their way of working is more procedural).  ENISA should provide help to Member States that would need assistance to create this mapping between  the taxonomy and their national legislation since it is an EU agency and it can provide such an advice through  their experience and knowledge about the taxonomy.  3.1.2.7 Action 7. Providing help to CSIRTs and LEAs for the integration of the taxonomy and the sharing  mechanism  Since the implementation of the taxonomy, the sharing mechanism and potentially a sharing platform might  be relatively complex for some CSIRTs or LEAs, ENISA and Europol should provide support (awareness raising  and, resources or documentation) to the entities that would require it based on their knowledge about the  taxonomy and the sharing mechanism.  Training requirements and the approach for training on the taxonomy will have to be further identified and  detailed. These will in-turn drive the development of training schedules and materials that are critical to the  actual delivery of support to the CSIRTs and LEAs for taxonomy implementation. This might help them put  such a mechanism in place.  It is recommended that CERT-EU should also be involved in this task in order to provide additional support  for the implementation, based on their experience with implementing the taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  48  4 Conclusion  During this study, key elements for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs have been  identified, more specifically regarding:   A taxonomy to use for the exchange of information   A sharing mechanism to structure the exchange   A model to adapt the taxonomy to new requirements  Based on this, a roadmap has been proposed for the implementation of a taxonomy in the exchange of  information. This section describes the conclusions for each part of this study.  4.1 Common taxonomy for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs  Based on the desk research and the information gathered from interviews of CSIRTs and LEAs of EU Member  States, requirements for a common taxonomy have been obtained. Based on these requirements and the  possibilities of alignment with the OAP 4.1 working group, this study proposes the CERT.PT taxonomy as a  common taxonomy for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. This taxonomy answers the  requirements provided and is easy to use and implement, while also offering opportunities for future  updates, to evolve to a higher level of detail. It is also based on the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime  Directive, and provides a definition of the incidents and events it describes.  4.2 Sharing mechanism for the selected taxonomy  While a taxonomy allows to classify the information exchanged, it does not provide a format for the  exchanged data. Using a common sharing mechanism could offer advantages such as automation of the  analysis of the data and the creation of statistics.  Based on the research performed, STIX would be a good candidate for the format of the data. It has a high  level of recognition by business and the stakeholders (CSIRTs and LEAs). STIX can be used together with any  taxonomy and offer a model of which the parts can be implemented separately, allowing a step-by-step  approach.  Although a sharing mechanism could offer advantages for the exchange of information, it also has  drawbacks: it complexity might hinder its use, and some CSIRTs and LEAs might prefer to keep ad-hoc  sharing mechanisms such as CSV files. Therefore, the use of a sharing mechanism should be studied further  based on the needs of the CSIRTs and LEAs.  4.3 Model to adapt the taxonomy to new requirements  To enhance the use of a taxonomy, it should also be kept up-to-date and evolve according to the  requirements of the CSIRTs and LEAs. Therefore, an update model should be in place to ensure the evolution  of the taxonomy. Based on the information collected from the interviews and the possibilities of alignment  with the OAP 4.1 working group, a dynamic update of the taxonomy through regular meeting of the  stakeholders seems to be best suited.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  49  4.4 Roadmap for the implementation of the taxonomy  This study proposes a roadmap that defines the main elements of the implementation of the common  taxonomy through the CSIRT and LEA communities.  The CERT.PT taxonomy is an important step towards improving the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. It  should allow both communities to share information more easily and improve the efficiency of the  communication. Furthermore, based on the evolution of the taxonomy, it should allow CSIRTs and LEAs to  adapt the classification to their convenience, making it grow based on their needs.  Towards this end, the most important short term activities include setting up a governance structure to  continuously update the taxonomy to new phenomena, disseminating the taxonomy to the CSIRT and LEA  communities, identifying the participants for the CSIRTs and LEAs in each Member State of the EU and  organising the governance meetings.

December 2015  05  Executive summary  This Report on Information Sharing and Common Taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Agencies (LEAs) was produced at the initiative of ENISA with the objective to enhance cooperation  both between the Member States (MS) of the EU and between related Network and Information  Security (NIS) communities.  With this study, which is a continuation of ENISA’s work done in the area of fight against cybercrime,  ENISA aims at identifying which information can be shared between CSIRTs and LEAs and how this  can be achieved from a technical and organisational perspective.  This report presents four proposals:  - A taxonomy for the exchange of information based on desk research, to define a common  vocabulary for the description of cyber incidents based on the approval of the majority of  the community.  - A sharing mechanism for the exchange of information, based on a taxonomy. This element is  still being debated, as explained further on in this document.  - An update model for the taxonomy, to answer new requirements that could arise from the  CSIRTs and the LEAs.  - A roadmap for the implementation of the taxonomy in the exchange of information across  CSIRTs and LEAs and the potential use of a sharing mechanism to enhance these exchanges.  There is a large consensus that a proposal for a taxonomy developed by CERT.PT2 is a good starting  point for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. This taxonomy fulfils the  requirements identified during this study, is easy to use and implement, while offering opportunities  for future updates. In addition it takes into account the Budapest Convention3 and the Cybercrime  Directive4, and provides a definition of the incidents and events it describes.  However, while a taxonomy allows to classify the information that is exchanged, it does not  necessarily provide a format for the exchanged data. Therefore, although there is no commonly  agreed format yet, using a common sharing mechanism could offer advantages such as automation  of the analysis of the data and the creation of statistics. Based on the research performed, STIX5 has  been identified as an appropriate candidate. It has a high level of recognition by the CSIRTS and LEAs  2 CERT.PT became part of the National Cybersecurity Centre in Portugal (CNCS).

Finally, to enhance the use of a taxonomy, it should also be kept up-to-date and evolve according to  the requirements of CSIRTs and LEAs. Therefore, an update model should be put in place to ensure  the further development of the taxonomy. Based on the information collected from CSIRTs and LEAs  and the possibilities of alignment with corresponding EC3 activities, a dynamic update of the  taxonomy through regular physical meetings with the stakeholders seems to be best suited.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  07  1 Introduction  1.1 Background  As of 2015, ENISA’s core operational activities are aligned with the four Strategic Objectives (SOs)  from the ENISA strategy document and the multi annual planning for 2015 to 2017, which are  summarised in ENISA’s Work Programme 20156.  The work packages in SO4 aim ‘to enhance cooperation both between the Member States (MS) of  the EU and between related Network and Information Security (NIS) communities’. The overall  goal is to ‘build up targeted NIS communities to meet policy goals’ through a ‘learn by doing  approach’.  Work Package (WPK) 4.1 aims at ‘supporting EU cooperation initiatives amongst NIS–related  communities in the context of the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union7 (EU CSS)’ through  two deliverables.  The goal of the first WPK 4.1 deliverable (which is the focus of this study) is to ‘develop and  provide guidance based on good practice for cooperation between key stakeholder communities’.  The goal of the second WPK 4.1 deliverable is to ‘identify practices of Member States in addressing  different sector regulation challenges of managing cyber security issues’. This is to be achieved  through a ‘stocktaking on Member States regulatory approaches for Cyber Security, with an  emphasis on cross-sector information sharing’.  1.2 Study Objectives and Scope  The study at hand aims to collect and present information on the previous and ongoing projects  facilitating information sharing between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement. It aims at investigating which  information can be shared between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement and how this can be achieved  technically and organisationally.  The scope of this study are CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Agencies in the European Union. It does not  cover other organisations than the selected communities (such as, for example, ISPs).  6 ENISA Work Programme 2015 Including Multi-Annual Planning:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015  7 Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure  Cyberspace: http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/enisa-work-programme-2015 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  08  1.3 Purpose of this document  The purpose of this study is to propose a solution for the exchange of information between CSIRTs  and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in the form of a roadmap and a common taxonomy, as well  as a mechanism to share information based on this common taxonomy and a model on how to  update the taxonomy to new phenomena.  This study outlines an initial proposal for:   A common taxonomy that could be used for sharing information between CSIRT and LEA  communities.   A mechanism to share information between both communities based on this taxonomy.   A model to update the taxonomy to new phenomena (such as new kind of attacks or a new  vulnerability type).   A roadmap for the introduction of the proposed taxonomy to both communities and the  implementation of a sharing solution between CSIRTs and LEA communities.  In addition, this study outlines:   How this study aligns with the Operational Action Plan (OAP) 4.1 working group8 EMPACT  (The European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats) Cyber Attacks 2015 to  avoid any overlap between both activities.  8 Europol EC3 leads the OAP 4.1 meetings. The OAP 4.1 initiated last year had three objectives: defining a  common taxonomy, defining exchange standards and achieving statistics. Up until now the first objective has  been progressed. The aim for this year (2015) is to achieve the second and third objective as well. In order to  achieve the second objective it is important to define use cases for sharing information between CSIRTs, LEA  and third parties.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  09  2 Proposition of a taxonomy for the exchange of information  between CSIRTs and LEAs  In order to defend against evolving threats, information sharing is key. The sharing of information  about cyber events and incidents allows others to defend against such attacks and help others to  detect and react to these attacks. The main obstacle in the exchange of information is the current  lack of standardization in the communication. There is no common understanding on how to  exchange information, limiting the amount of information that can be exchanged and the  possibilities of automation of this exchange.  Based on the previous work done by ENISA on the exchange of information between CSIRTs and  LEAs, it seems that a common language9 should be identified to enable a better exchange of  information between them. Since the CSIRT and LEA communities have different goals10, their way of  representing and classifying information about cyber events and incidents are not necessarily  similar, and the situation can be very different from one EU Member State to another. For example,  while many LEAs use the NATO classification system11, most CSIRTs use the Traffic Light Protocol  (TLP12).  Moreover, while LEAs store information based on investigations, the CSIRTs also collect information  on types of attacks that are not related to specific infection cases, in order to provide statistical  information on the current threat landscape. LEAs, for example, collect information that can be used  during an investigation to find evidence of a crime and incriminate its author. They also collect  information on potential criminal actions which take place on the Internet. CSIRTs, on the other side,  try to collect information on the current threat and attack vectors, and therefore tend to collect and  share more information not directly related to a specific attack, such as vulnerabilities, attackers and  behaviours.  Due to this difference in goals, the management of information by CSIRT and LEAs is very different.  The way the information is stored and used can vary, and there is no common vocabulary used to  define the types of threats and incidents.  To harmonise such exchanges of information, the first step is the choice of a common taxonomy that  could be adopted by Member States of the European Union to classify information. This would allow  the users of such a taxonomy to use the same vocabulary, by defining a common language,  therefore making it easier to share the information between the users of the taxonomy.  Towards this end, this chapter details how a selection of a common taxonomy to be proposed for  the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs has been done, based on requirements  highlighted by the interviews and possibilities of alignment of this study to the OAP 4.1 working  group (presented in section 2.2.1).  9 ‘Language’ describes here a common definition of the vocabulary used to describe events and incidents.  10 While CSIRTs focus mainly on blocking cyber-attacks and restoring a normal situation at the victim side, LEAs  focus on identifying criminals behind the attacks.  11 The NATO classification system: http://www.nato.int/structur/AC/135/ncs_guide/english/e_1-6-1.htm  12 Protocol to encourage classification systems: https://www.cert.be/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  http://www.nato.int/structur/AC/135/ncs_guide/english/e_1-6-1.htm https://www.cert.be/traffic-light-protocol-tlp  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  10  2.1 Definition of a taxonomy  To further refine the scope of this study, the first step is to provide the definition of a taxonomy.  According to the ENISA webpage on ontologies13, the definition of a taxonomy is the following: ‘a  taxonomy is most often defined as a classification of terms and has a close relationship with the use  of ontology. There are three characteristics that define a taxonomy:   A form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the  relationship these things have to each other.   A semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets.   A knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the  knowledge domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable  and easy to navigate.’  Figure 1 – Definition of a taxonomy13  Note that an ontology is a closely related concept.  The definition of an ontology consists of the  definition of domain concepts (e.g. objects, attributes and processes) and their  properties/relationships. This goes beyond the purpose of harmonising and standardising the  exchanges of information. In the view of the authors, LEAs and CSIRTs should first achieve the same  vocabulary enabling a common language before describing more complex relations between  concepts.  2.2 Alignment of this study with the EMPACT OAP 4.1 working group  towards the choice of a taxonomy  This section presents the EMPACT OAP 4.1 working group, the objectives of aligning both activities  for the choice of a taxonomy and how both of them are aligned at this stage of the project. One of  the main objectives of the OAP 4.1 working group is to improve sharing of information between  CSIRTs, LEAs and third parties and enable the generation of statistics on events and incidents. Due to  the similarities between the OAP 4.1 working group and this study, an alignment of both activities  benefits both communities.  13 Based on ENISA’s pages on ontology: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/metrics/ontology and https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  Taxonomy  Classification  scheme  Semantic  representation  Knowledge  map  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  11  2.2.1 Description of the OAP 4.1 working group  The European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats14 (EMPACT) Cyber Attacks 2015,  OAP 4.115 (OAP 4.1 working group) project is a multi-stakeholder initiative, taking into account the  interest of EC3 (representing Europol), ENISA, and various CSIRTs and LEAs representatives within  the European Union.  The OAP 4.1 working group had three main goals at the time of writing:  1. Defining a common taxonomy for the exchange of information related to incidents and  events in cyber security.  2. Defining an exchange standard to enable the sharing of information based on the  taxonomy.  3. Create statistics based on the information exchanged.  At the time of drafting this report, EC3 stated that the first goal, defining a common taxonomy, was  in progress and that they aim to achieve two additional goals by the end of 2015. The six use cases  presented in the first deliverable of this study are based on the use cases that were defined within  the OAP 4.1 working group to help determine activities that the use of a common taxonomy should  enable. It was agreed with ENISA that these use cases would serve as input to this study.  Additionally, the members of the OAP 4.1 working group are in the process of setting up a  governance structure to allow revisions of a common taxonomy that could be updated during bi- annual meetings.  The Common Taxonomy for the National Network of CSIRTs16 (hereafter the ‘CERT.PT taxonomy’) is,  at the time of writing, considered as an appropriate candidate by the OAP 4.1 working group for a  common taxonomy for the exchange of information. In this context, EC3 requested feedback about  the CERT.PT taxonomy from the EU Cybercrime Task Force (EU CTF) for which no objection at that  time was raised.  2.2.2 Use cases to be enabled by a common taxonomy  A set of possible use cases to be enabled by a common taxonomy have been identified in the  context of the OAP 4.1 working group. These use cases highlight the interaction between actors  (CSIRTs and LEAs but also other actors such as ISPs, which are out of the scope of this study). These  use cases also support the goals to be achieved in the context of the work performed by ENISA in the  fight against cybercrime17. Below is a summary of the use cases.  14 EU Policy Cycle - EMPACT: https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/eu-policy-cycle-empact  15 OAP: Operational Action Plan, part of the EMPACT as project to combat the priority threats.  16 The Common Taxonomy for National Network of CSIRTs (2014) is developed by the Fundação para a  Computação Científica Nacional (FCCN) and CERT.PT. It aims at describing a common taxonomy for the  classification of incidents within the National Network of CSIRTs in Portugal. In presents a technical perspective  and a ‘high level legal characterisation’ to facilitate the ontological harmonization of incidents within the  Portuguese Network, the international network of CERTs and foreign criminal investigation police forces (Law  Enforcement Agencies) or other similar bodies, such as the INTERPOL and the Europol.  17 ENISA fight against cybercrime: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/certs/support/fight-against- cybercrime  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/eu-policy-cycle-empact https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/certs/support/fight-against-cybercrime https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/certs/support/fight-against-cybercrime  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  12  1. Alerts from CSIRTs to LEAs: with the common taxonomy and a common formatted message,  LEAs can receive and automatically treat large amounts of data in less time, thus perceiving  the evolution of incidents both quantitatively and geographic ways.  2. Alerts among CSIRTs: CSIRTs and their networks can optimise incident case analysis,  promoting correlation of the security events and therefore act or react, jointly, within borders  or with other EU CSIRTs. This should result in faster incident mitigation and additional  information collection for incidents containing procedures and overall protectionism for the  EU.  3. Reporting of statistics: Sharing statistics among the identified actors will allow information  cross-checking with other sources, thus validating (or not) and spotting commercial  distortions on the security Information market.  4. LEAs alerts to CSIRTs: CSIRTs can benefit from better anticipation of significant security  events, access to correlated information that can highlight motivation of criminal actors.  5. Joint actions based on previous contributions: Because of the stronger collaboration  between LEAs and CSIRTs, consolidated by the statistics and the data exchanged, campaigns  of criminal prevention can be created and directed towards geographic areas populated by  security incidents, now perceived and visualised by tools that deal with the shared  information.  6. ISPs enrolment: ISPs can be enabled as active actors in this field, and both CSIRTs and LEAs  can take advantage of their participation in terms of public image, since they will be able to  ‘make available’ a ‘security image’ to its clients.  These use cases were further elaborated within the scope of this study. They represent the flow of  information between CERTs and LEAs and an alignment with the information collected during the  interviews.  2.2.2.1 Use case 1: Alerts from CSIRTs to LEAs  Through the interviews of CSIRTs and LEAs, it often appears that sharing information from CSIRTs to  LEAs would be very interesting for the LEAs, and sometimes information about incidents and botnets  is already shared. Although some LEAs are not able to treat such information due to the lack of  resources, many consider that being able to receive data from CSIRTs would be (or is) an advantage  for their work. Through the use of a taxonomy, the LEAs might be able to receive and automatically  treat data in less time, which might allow them to perform analysis and perceive the evolution of  cyber incidents.  Since the nature of activities of CSIRTs and LEAs differ from each other, the information they collect  and the way they collect it are fundamentally different too. According to most respondents, LEAs are  therefore interested in information that CSIRTs possess since it represents additional information  that they can use in investigations, or to prevent criminal activities.  One of the limitations often encountered during the interviews performed for this study is the need  for the approval of the victim. When CSIRTs help an organisation after an attack, they often need the  organisation to file an official complaint before being able to provide information about the attack to  LEAs. But apart from this limitation, exchange of information from CERTs to LEAs does not seem to  have any other constraints.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  13  2.2.2.2 Use case 2: Alerts among CSIRTs  Based on the interviews performed, it appeared that some communication between CSIRTs is  already in place, although it is not always automated. But, even without automation, the CSIRT  community often collaborates by sharing information. This information is sometimes exchanged  through sharing platforms but is also simply sent by e-mail in a structured (CSV) or unstructured  (PDF report) file. The community therefore seems to be interested in the implementation of a  common taxonomy for the exchange of information, to facilitate these exchanges by the use of a  common vocabulary.  Through the exchange of information structured on a common taxonomy, the CSIRTs might be able  to perform incident analysis and correlate security events. This would enable joint reactions  between CSIRTs across the European Union, and thus result in better incident mitigation.  2.2.2.3 Use case 3: Reporting of statistics  The exchange and correlation of information might allow the stakeholders to create statistics based  on the common taxonomy by gathering and analysing the data exchanged,. Indeed, since the  exchanged data is currently in different formats and uses different descriptions for events and  incidents, it is currently very hard to create statistics on their frequency and type.  By defining the types of events and incidents and providing a clear classification of the information  exchanged, a common taxonomy would facilitate the creation of statistics. While the CSIRTs and  LEAs might not have resources to create such analysis of the exchanged data to provide statistics,  Europol could be the central point to gather and analyse the exchanged information. This would  allow Europol to create statistics at the European Union level.  The creation of such statistics might enable the detection of trends and tendencies in cyber  incidents, enabling a better focus of the prevention and detection performed across the EU.  2.2.2.4 Use case 4: LEA alerts to CSIRTs:  Based on information collected during the interviews, although the alerts from CSIRTs to LEAs should  not be a problem in most countries (as detailed in section 2.2.2.1), the sharing of information from  LEAs to CSIRTs often encounter more constraints. LEAs are subject to restrictions regarding their  inquiries, and can rarely disclose information to any other organisation. Besides this constraint,  resources are also a problem: some LEAs do not have enough time or budget to gather and share  information that could be useful to CSIRTs. Also, there is in some cases a lack of certainty from the  LEAs about what kind of information could be useful for CSIRTs, due to a lack of formal or informal  exchanges between a CSIRT and a LEA.  Nevertheless, most CSIRTs and LEAs mentioned during the interview that an exchange of  information from the LEA to the CSIRT would be very interesting in terms of creation of statistics and  analysis of incidents across the country. Some CSIRTs and LEAs also mentioned the possibilities for  joint actions in case of specific attacks.  CSIRTs might therefore better anticipate, through sharing of information, security incidents and  prevent them, as well a better correlate data to highlight the motivation of threat actors.  2.2.2.5 Use case 5: Joint actions based on previous contributions  Based on the exchange of information and the collaboration that might follow, the sharing of  information between CSIRTs and LEAs could motivate prevention campaigns and joint actions in case  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  14  of detection of an incident. In some countries, cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs is already in  place for some specific cases where collaboration allows a quicker response and analysis.  This kind of collaboration might also be enhanced by the creation of statistics on incidents (use case  3) where geographic areas that are targeted by specific security incidents could be visualised and  therefore allow international actions across the EU.  2.2.2.6 Use case 6: ISP enrolment  Although the exchange of information with actors other than CSIRTs and LEAs is not part of the  scope of this study, it was still observed based on the interviews, that CSIRTs often have a specific  collaboration with other actors such as ISPs. In some countries, LEAs even ask CSIRTs to make  specific requests to ISPs regarding botnets, allowing CSIRTs and ISPs to collaborate and take them  down.  The exchange of information with ISPs, like the exchange between CSIRTs, is currently often  unstructured, or not based on any taxonomy. The use of a taxonomy for these exchanges is  expected to enable better communication by adding structure to the information exchanged, and  thus enable faster processing  According to some members of the OAP 4.1 working group, the participation of ISPs in such  exchanges might also improve their public image, by providing more security to their clients.  2.2.3 Synergies between this study and the OAP 4.1 working group  Many synergies can be observed between this study and the OAP 4.1 working group:   The goal of the study: one of the goals of this study, the definition of a common taxonomy  for the sharing of information between CSIRTs and LEAs, aligns directly with the first goal of  the OAP 4.1 working group: the definition of a taxonomy for the exchange of information  related to incidents and events in cyber security. However, while this study focuses specifically  on CSIRTs and LEAs, the OAP 4.1 working group also considers the use of the taxonomy for  the exchange of information with third parties as the next step to take, once the exchange of  information is in place between CSIRTs and LEAs. One of the interviewees explained that  although the OAP 4.1 working group would not directly focus on other parties than CSIRTs and  LEAs, they consider that enabling the exchange of information using a specific taxonomy could  motivate other parties to align to that taxonomy.   ENISA and EC3 are considered as an authority by both communities: through the interviews  it was observed that ENISA has the recognition in the CSIRT community to propose a taxonomy  for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. During these interviews, it was also  observed that Europol had a similar authority regarding the LEAs. Therefore, it can be  considered that both agencies have a level of authority to propose the use of a common  taxonomy. This synergy has been confirmed during the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop of the 8th and  9th October 201518 where the attendees, through anonymous voting, confirmed that ENISA  and EC3 were best positioned to determine the CSIRT and LEA communities to adopt a  common taxonomy and a sharing mechanism.  18 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  15   The next steps for the study: the OAP 4.1 working group intends to improve the  communication between CSIRTs and LEAs, if possible this year (2015), by attaining both  second and third goals of the working group (defining an exchange standard and creating  statistics). Along the same lines, this study proposes a roadmap for the introduction of a  common taxonomy and the use of a sharing mechanism. Besides, this study is in line with  the work performed by ENISA until now, which targets the enabling communication  between CSIRTs and LEAs, and ENISA plans to continue working to attain this goal in the  future.  2.2.4 Objectives of aligning this study with the OAP 4.1 working group for the taxonomy  The goal of this study is to propose a common taxonomy to improve information sharing between  CSIRTs and LEAs, and the creation of a roadmap for the introduction of such a solution. Similarly, the  OAP 4.1 working group intends to define a taxonomy for the exchange of information related to  incidents and events in cyber security, and use it in an exchange standard. This section presents the  several objectives of the alignment of the OAP 4.1 working group and this study.  2.2.4.1 Objective 1: Propose a common taxonomy to ensure alignment in the communities  An alignment of this study and the work done in the OAP 4.1 working group effectively results in a  proposal for a common taxonomy. Since the OAP 4.1 working group and ENISA both operate at the  EU level, proposing a common taxonomy to LEAs and CSIRTs shows that both communities are  working towards the same goal.  2.2.4.2 Objective 2: Improve efficiency in the promotion of the taxonomy and exchange  mechanism  As mentioned previously, ENISA and Europol are both considered authoritative when it comes to  making recommendations for CSIRTs and LEAs. Their alignment on a common taxonomy is expected  to encourage the use of the taxonomy by both communities. This should increase acceptance of the  taxonomy in the Member States. This could be particularly relevant for LEAs, for which the  implementation of a taxonomy might take a longer time than for the CSIRTs due to the way they are  structured. On the contrary, having only EC3, for example, proposing a taxonomy to the LEAs and  the CSIRTs could make it more challenging to promote the taxonomy to CSIRTs and could slow down  the process of improving the exchange of information.  2.2.5 How both this study ant the OAP 4.1 working group are being aligned  To attain the objectives mentioned in the previous section, this study was conducted in  collaboration with the OAP 4.1 working group. The first step of the collaboration with EC3 on this  study was a joint meeting. By participating to this meeting on the OAP 4.1 working group on Monday  4 May 2015, direct information on the status of the OAP 4.1 working group was obtained. One of the  examples of the alignment that was enabled by this meeting are the use cases: EC3 provided ENISA  with a set of six use cases defined by the OAP 4.1 working group and, through the interviews  performed for this study, the study team enriched the use cases with details on how and why the  information about cyber incidents could be shared. In addition, EC3 provided support to ENISA  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  16  during this study by using the EUCTF19 list to request an interview to the Member States LEAs.  Furthermore, EC3 informed ENISA of the progress of the study regarding the taxonomy and the  sharing mechanism that was being considered. For example, the current taxonomy being considered  for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs was the taxonomy created by CERT.PT,  and provided ENISA with a copy of this taxonomy.  Finally, this study aims at giving a better overview of the current situation in CSIRTs and LEAs across  Member States and the next steps to take regarding the implementation of a taxonomy and a  sharing mechanism between CSIRTs and LEAs, which should provide useful input to EC3 for the OAP  4.1 working group.  19 Established in 2010, the European Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF) is an expert group made up of  representatives from Europol, Eurojust and the European Commission, working together with the heads of  European Union cybercrime units to facilitate the cross-border fight against cybercrime.  http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Europol http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Eurojust http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/European_Commission http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/European_Union http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Cybercrime http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Cybercrime  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  17  2.3 Methodology for the selection of a taxonomy  One of the main purposes of this study is the proposal of a taxonomy for information exchange  between CSIRTs and LEAs. This section details the methodology applied and the choices made to  select a taxonomy that would fulfil the requirements expressed during the interviews of CSIRTs and  LEAs and be updated with a new phenomenon that might be encountered, while staying in line with  the OAP 4.1 working group. The chosen taxonomy will allow CSIRTs and LEAs to define a common  language when sharing information, based on the classification20 of events and incidents.  The first section ‘Results of the desk research’ presents previous work performed by ENISA in the  ‘Fight against cybercrime’ and ‘Actionable information’ area that have been considered in this study.  The second section ‘Results of the analysed taxonomies’ details possible requirements for a future  taxonomy that were expressed during the interviews. Associated with the use cases, this composes  the base of the selection of a taxonomy for the information exchange.  This section is based on information collected during interviews with CSIRTs and LEAs. These  interviews were mostly performed in a semi-structured manner, by asking the interviewees open  questions and allowing them to provide any complementary information considered useful for this  study. A total of 14 CSIRTs and 12 LEAs provided input, either by providing written answers, or  during phone calls.  The third section ‘Requirements for a taxonomy based on the needs for information CSIRTs and  LEAs as expressed during the interviews’ presents a global overview of the taxonomies that were  considered by this study, either obtained from the desk research or provided by Member States. It  also lists taxonomies that could not be obtained due to their level of classification.  The last section ‘Input from the OAP 4.1 working group about the taxonomy selected’ presents the  input provided by OAP 4.1 working group about the taxonomy they selected and how the choice of  the taxonomy has been made while keeping both activities aligned and answering the requirements  detailed in the second section.  2.3.1 Results of the desk research  In 2010, ENISA started supporting operational collaboration initiatives between CSIRTs and LEAs. In  this context, various activities have been launched since then. The following sections summarise the  key input to this report.  The desk research supporting this study focused mainly on ENISA’s work done in the fields of ‘the  fight against cybercrime’ and ‘Actionable Information’. It also keeps in mind the outcomes of the  Impact Analysis of ENISA’s support to Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).21 This impact  assessment has served as a basis for a proposed roadmap to 2020. The following studies were taken  into account.  20 The repartition of events and incidents into classes, not to be confused with the level of classification of a  document.  21 Impact Analysis and Roadmap: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/supporting-the- cert-community-impact-analysis-and-roadmap  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/supporting-the-cert-community-impact-analysis-and-roadmap https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/supporting-the-cert-community-impact-analysis-and-roadmap  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  18  2.3.1.1 ENISA work done in the field of ‘the fight against cybercrime’   A flair for sharing - encouraging information exchange between CERTs - This report22 focuses  on the legal and regulatory aspects of information sharing and cross-border collaboration of  national and governmental national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe.   The Fight against Cybercrime - Cooperation between CERTs and LEA in the fight against  cybercrime - The aim of this report is to improve the capability of national and governmental  CSIRTs, to address the NIS aspects of cybercrime. It focuses on supporting national and  governmental CSIRTs and their hosting organisations in the EU Member States in their  collaboration with the LEAs. It also intends to be a first collection of practices collected from  mature CSIRTs in Europe, including among other things workflows and collaboration with  other key players, in particular different law enforcement authorities, in the fight against  cybercrime.   Give and Take - Good practice Guide for Addressing NIS Aspects of Cybercrime - The  document constitutes a ‘work in progress’, a snapshot of the status of ENISAs support for  CSIRTs and LEAs at the time of the publication, and includes good practice and  recommendations for both communities.   The Directive on attacks against information systems - A Good Practice Collection for CERTs  on the Directive on attacks against information systems - This report provides an analysis of  the legal framework created by the Directive, coupled with a stock taking on relevant existing  national activities and good practices. Secondly, it identifies key areas and, where appropriate,  guidelines and recommendations derived from these good practices.   Electronic evidence - a basic guide for First Responders - The guide aims to be a practical tool  explaining the principles of sound evidence gathering and raising the right questions for  collecting and securing digital evidence.   ENISA’s traditional workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’ has been organised since 2005 for the  national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe and is one of the most efficient and  indispensable methods for ENISA in supporting teams in their daily work and improving their  capabilities. In 2011 ENISA started to collaborate with Europol. The first joint workshop was  held in Prague and had a focus on CSIRT cooperation with law enforcement. From 2012 the  annual ENISA workshop was split into two parts, one part aims only at national and  governmental CSIRTs and has a technical focus, and the other aims at both national and  governmental CSIRTs and law enforcement representatives, organised together with  Europol/EC3. While in 2014, the first part of the workshop focused on being an opportunity  to provide EU national and governmental CSIRTs teams' technical specialists with a  possibility to share and discuss about the latest developments and challenges with regard to  CSIRTs services, the second part of the workshop (later renamed to ENISA/EC3 workshop)  kept the focus on cooperation between national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe and  their national Law Enforcement counterparts. Representatives from both communities were  invited to these events.   The 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop23 – an annual gathering of both CSIRT and LEA communities,  focused on cooperation between national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe and their  national Law Enforcement counterparts, during which a presentation of this study was made  22 A flair for sharing - encouraging information exchange between CERTs:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing  23 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/legal-information-sharing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/4th-enisa-ec3-workshop  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  19  and the draft of the report was sent to all attendees. The feedback received from the  participants served as input to this study.  2.3.1.2 ENISA’s work done in the field of ‘Actionable Information’  Extracting timely information that can be immediately acted on from vast amounts of all types of  data flowing in remains a challenge. This type of information is referred to as ‘actionable  information’24. In the field of data sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, being able to extract actionable  information from the data transferred as well as selecting the data to transfer to fit the need of the  receiver is a central point.   Actionable Information for Security Incident Response study25 - This study is a good practice  guide for the exchange and processing of actionable information.   Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information inventory26 -  This report is an inventory of 53 information sharing standards and 16 information  management tools relevant to the concept of actionable information.   ENISA Threat Landscape 201427 - This report consolidates the top cyber threats and emerging  threat trends in various technological and application areas.  24 Actionable Information: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information  25 Actionable Information for Security Incident Response study:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for- security  26 Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information inventory:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information  27 ENISA Threat Landscape 2014: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  20  2.3.2 Results of the analysed taxonomies  To enable sharing of information, a common taxonomy should answer the needs of CSIRT and LEA  communities. The classification offered by a common taxonomy should be acceptable for both  communities while being easy to use and implement in any tool that is used, and be easy to adapt.  This section reviews the pros and cons of each taxonomy presented in the first deliverable.  The table below provides an overview of the ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ of each taxonomy.  NR.

Table 1 - Pros and Cons of the studied taxonomies  2.3.2.1 Taxonomy 1, 2 and 3: The CERT NIC.LV taxonomy, ‘the common language’ and the eCISRT  taxonomy  These three taxonomies are presented in the documentation on existing taxonomies on the ENISA  website29. Although they may be an appropriate comparison point for the creation or the selection  of a taxonomy, the website mentions that they are now outdated and should not be used apart as  inspirational material to create a new taxonomy.  2.3.2.2 Taxonomy 4: The CERT.PT taxonomy  The CERT.PT taxonomy was presented by EC3 as the preferred choice of the common taxonomy (EC3  reached out to the LEA community through the EUCTF. At the time, no objections were raised by the  LEA community).  Although named ‘CERT.PT’ taxonomy, it is a product of a collaboration between several European  CSIRTs (from Austria, Belgium, Estonia and also CERT-EU) and the Portuguese police. CERT.PT  worked in collaboration with the police to add value to the taxonomy by introducing international  legal references into the taxonomy, reviewing the objectives of the taxonomy and proposing it to  EC3 as a candidate for a common taxonomy.  One of the main advantages of this taxonomy is that it could be easily adapted to fit the needs of  both communities or to take into account the new phenomena that could occur.  Secondly, the taxonomy intends to be precise while maintaining a high level of classification to be  easily used and understood across the communities of CSIRTs and LEAs. If in the future, more details  would become required for some parts of it, the taxonomy could be updated to add the required  information.  Finally, the taxonomy is already in use by some LEAs and CSIRTs and seems to have proven its  efficiency in the exchange of information.  However, one of the disadvantages is that the CERT.PT taxonomy is a very high-level classification.  The categories of incidents and events presented in this taxonomy are very broad. Therefore, an  incident described using the CERT.PT taxonomy would not provide many details regarding the  28 Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes: https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800- guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/988-ccn-stic-817-gestion-de-ciberincidentes/file.html  29 Existing taxonomies: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident- management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies  https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800-guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/988-ccn-stic-817-gestion-de-ciberincidentes/file.html https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/series-ccn-stic/800-guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/988-ccn-stic-817-gestion-de-ciberincidentes/file.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  22  incident itself. The taxonomy is therefore easy to use and statistics can created based on its  classification, but it limits the level of details of the classification of an incident.  2.3.2.3 Taxonomy 5: The AVOIDIT taxonomy  The AVOIDIT30 taxonomy is documented as a taxonomy to represent attacks in an innovative way to  allow a detailed classification, by characterising the attacks by five classifiers: attack vector, target,  operational impact, informational impact and defence. Although being innovative, this taxonomy  has not currently reached acceptance by any of the communities and no implementation or use of it  was found during the time of drafting this study.  2.3.2.4 Taxonomy 6: Data Harmonization Ontology  The ontology has been created by many CSIRTs as part of the AbuseHelper31 activity.  The taxonomy provided for the classification of abuse events is well-documented and quite simple  to use. It also defines key Indicators of Compromise (IOC) to be used as basis to communicate abuse  events. It also contains details of required fields that should appear in every report sent.  Although more detailed than the CERT.PT taxonomy, it seems that it has not reached a critical mass  of users and it seems to have a limited response from the business industry outside of the CSIRT  community.  2.3.2.5 Taxonomy 7: The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS)  This taxonomy32  is available on the internet and seems to be quite complete and useful for the  description of incidents. It has a good recognition by the business and can easily be implemented.  Although the VERIS taxonomy is an appropriate candidate and has additional features like the  specific database to store information, the main difficulty is the adaptation to fit the needs of the  CSIRT and LEA community. Adapting the taxonomy to the needs of this study is feasible, since the  data is available on GitHub33, but it would then deviate from the framework provided by Verizon and  make it more challenging to use for a future expansion of the sharing between the CSIRT and LEA  communities.  The level of complexity of the taxonomy seems to be rather high compared to others like the Data  Harmonization Ontology or the CERT.PT taxonomy. It therefore allows a more fine-grained detail of  events and incidents, but requires more input and a better technical knowledge from the user.  30 AVOIDIT: A Cyber Attack Taxonomy: http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/proceedings/2014/6- SimmonsEtAl.pdf  31 AbuseHelper: https://bitbucket.org/clarifiednetworks/abusehelper/wiki/Home  32 The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing: http://veriscommunity.net/  33 GitHub is a web-based repository hosting service offering distributed revision control and source code  management (SCM) functionality. https://github.com/  http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/proceedings/2014/6-SimmonsEtAl.pdf http://www.albany.edu/iasymposium/proceedings/2014/6-SimmonsEtAl.pdf https://bitbucket.org/clarifiednetworks/abusehelper/wiki/Home http://veriscommunity.net/ https://github.com/  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  23  2.3.2.6 Taxonomy 8: Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX)  The CybOX34 taxonomy, provided by MITRE35 in parallel to STIX36 and TAXII37, provides a well- structured taxonomy for threats and events and has a good acceptance by the business. Similarly to  the VERIS taxonomy, it is available on the Internet but the main difficulty for this study is the fact  that it is owned by MITRE and therefore not easily adaptable to the needs of the community without  deviating from the original taxonomy.  The level of complexity of this taxonomy is rather high and requires more input and technical  knowledge from the user. Therefore, it may prove more challenging to be used by LEA.  2.3.2.7 Taxonomy 9: The taxonomy used in Hungary by CSIRTs and LEAs  It was mentioned that a taxonomy, developed by the Hungarian police, was already in use in  Hungary for the sharing of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. This taxonomy or concrete  examples of its use could not be shared with ENISA as it is classified.  2.3.2.8 Taxonomy 10: Phänomene Cybercrime taxonomy  The Swiss Federal Police mentioned during their interview that they were drafting a taxonomy for  the exchange of information in Switzerland and agreed to send it to ENISA to report on it in this  study. The Swiss Federal Police taxonomy, named ‘Phänomene Cybercrime’ is currently only  available in German. It is divided in three categories: ‘Cyber-WK’ (representing the general attacks),  sexual offenses and defamation.  The ‘Phänomene Cybercrime’ taxonomy describes every type of attack and action in a detailed  manner to avoid any confusion, but the information is classified according to the type of crime more  than the type of attack. For example, ‘Forbidden porn’ is also part of that taxonomy, while it is not  technically an attack but illegal use of a network. Although this type of taxonomy might be adapted  for the exchange of information between LEAs, it might be less relevant for the CSIRTs.  2.3.2.9 Taxonomy 11: CSIRT-MU taxonomy, Czech Republic  CSIRT-MU mentioned during their interview that they were drafting a taxonomy for the exchange of  information with the LEAs and agreed to send it to ENISA to use it in this study.  The CSIRT-MU taxonomy is high-level and contains around twenty types of attacks and their  description, with links to the Czech law and the Decree on cyber security. It also contains indications  for the CSIRT remediation and usable evidence.  34 Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX): https://cybox.mitre.org/  35 MITRE is a not-for-profit organization that operates research and development centres sponsored by the  federal government. http://www.mitre.org/  36 Structured Threat Information eXpression, a structured language for cyber threat intelligence:  https://stixproject.github.io/  37 Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information, a transport mechanism for the exchange of threat  information: https://taxiiproject.github.io/  https://cybox.mitre.org/ http://www.mitre.org/ https://stixproject.github.io/ https://taxiiproject.github.io/  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  24  2.3.2.10 Taxonomy 12: Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes  During feedback received after the workshop of the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, this taxonomy was  presented by CCN-CERT38. This taxonomy includes issues that were encountered in Spain and has  been published in May 2015 as part of the CCN-STIC-817 security guide issued by CCN-CERT.  The taxonomy includes three levels of classification: the type of cyber incidents, including type,  description and subtype, the danger of these incidents and the potential impact.  Although the taxonomy is very broad (high-level classification) and lacks complexity compared to  others like CybOX or VERIS, it is still easy to implement. Besides, the way it considers the different  subtypes of classification (type, danger and impact) could be of use for CSIRTs and LEAs to estimate  the importance of the problem.  2.3.3 Requirements for a taxonomy based on the needs for information CSIRTs and LEAs  as expressed during the interviews  Throughout the 26 interviews, this study was able to capture requirements expressed by the  different communities concerning the taxonomy for the exchange of information between CSIRTs  and LEAs. This section details these requirements and how each taxonomy presented in this  deliverable meets the requirements.  These requirements are considered as validated by the interviewees (14 CSIRTs and 12 LEA  representatives) according to the following formula:   At least 30% of the interviewees mentioned this information.   At least 51% of the interviewees mentioning this information have agreed to the statement.  If these conditions are met, the information is considered as ‘sufficiently justified’ and the  requirement based on this information should be taken into account for the selection of the  taxonomy. If it is not the case, the information is mentioned in this study as ‘information with  limited justification’ and the requirement won’t be considered as verified by the community and is  therefore not a priority requirement that the taxonomy should meet.  38 CCN-CERT: national Spanish CSIRT: https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/  https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  25  The following table summarises the requirements expressed through the interviews.

It must be noted that this only represents the opinion of the attendees of the  workshop and therefore does not represent the opinion of either community.  The following sections detail the different requirements and how the taxonomies meet these  requirements.  2.3.3.1 Requirement 1: The taxonomy should take the level of maturity of LEAs in term of  technical capabilities into account  The first requirement concerns the abilities of LEAs to implement advanced technical solutions.  Many interviewees mentioned that the technical abilities of the LEAs were often less advanced than  the CSIRTs technical capacity. This requirement is one of the justified pieces of information obtained  during the interviews and can therefore be considered as a main requirement.  To take that difference in technical level into account, the taxonomy should be simple to implement  and understand, with a clear definition of its vocabulary. This might help in overcoming the  difference in capabilities to implement a taxonomy that was observed between CSIRTs and LEAs.  This would allow all stakeholders to implement and use the taxonomy in an easy and efficient  manner.  The level of detail of a common taxonomy should also be accessible enough to describe events and  incidents in a precise way while still being understandable and easily usable. For example, having too  many levels of detail for the type of events and incidents (if one event has several subtypes which in  turn have several subtypes etc.) would make classification complex for the user, while being allowed  to divide the information between a limited amount of high-level classes would limit the level of  detail but allow the user to easily classify the information.  Regarding the available taxonomies, the CERT.PT taxonomy, the Esquema nacional de seguridad  Gestión de ciberincidentes, the Phänomene Cybercrime and the Data Harmonization Ontology could  be considered as easy to use while VERIS, CybOX and the AVOIDIT taxonomies are more complex to  use because of the level of detail available. The CSIRT-MU taxonomy, although easy to use, might be  unnecessarily simple for most countries in the EU.  This requirement was supported by the votes of the workshop where the ease of use of the  taxonomy was confirmed as an important element for the exchange of information.  2.3.3.2 Requirement 2: The taxonomy should fit for both high- and low-level data  Throughout the interviews, we observed that CSIRTs and LEAs share both high- and low-level data,  even if the exchange of information is not structured. For the taxonomy to be adopted by all parties,  it would be useful to be able to make use of the taxonomy to classify the information that is already  exchanged – this is one of the justified pieces of information obtained during the interviews and can  therefore be considered as the main requirement.  If a common taxonomy allows the user to classify the information that is already sent between  CSIRTs and LEAs, this would have a positive effect on the perception of the use of the taxonomy. In  addition, if a taxonomy would be kept up-to-date by regular adaptations to new phenomena, it  might allow both communities to integrate into the taxonomy those types of information that  cannot yet be classified.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  27  Regarding the sharing of low-level data (the three first levels of the pyramid of pain49: hash values, IP  addresses and domain names), all taxonomies allow the sharing of such information. The difference  in the taxonomies appears when the stakeholders want to share high-level information (such as  tactics, techniques and procedures). While the VERIS and the CybOX taxonomies allow the sharing of  (at least a part of) such information, the AVOIDIT taxonomy is not as complete, and the CERT.PT  taxonomy, the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes, the Data Harmonisation  Ontology, the CSIRT-MU taxonomy and the Phänomene Cybercrime are not as detailed and focus  more on incidents and events.  2.3.3.3 Requirement 3: The taxonomy should be as complete as possible regarding the types of  events and incidents  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  Three CSIRT representatives mentioned during the interviews that, in order to be useful for the  exchange of information, a common taxonomy should be exhaustive regarding the types of events  and incidents. Having an exhaustive taxonomy would allow CSIRTs and LEAs to fit any kind of event  and incident into the classification of the taxonomy thereby possibly raising the acceptance of the  taxonomy.  This requirement can be linked with the first one (‘the taxonomy should take the level of maturity of  the LEAs in term of technical capabilities into account’) since the level of complexity of a taxonomy is  proportional to its completeness in terms of events and incidents. While all taxonomies try to be as  complete as possible, the level of detail and subcategories about an incident or an event may vary  from one to another. In that regard, VERIS, the AVOIDIT taxonomy and CybOX are the most  complete (but also the most complex) while, the CERT.PT taxonomy, the CSIRT-MU taxonomy, the  Phänomene Cybercrime and the Data Harmonization Ontology define events and incidents with  high-level description. The Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes also falls in  that category but has an interesting point of view on classification, danger and impact.  2.3.3.4 Requirement 4: The format of the taxonomy should be stable in time  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  During the interviews, two CSIRTs mentioned that, to ensure that a taxonomy would not constantly  change, it should stay stable throughout time and avoid being adapted too regularly. This would  allow both communities to use the taxonomy without having to update its implementation into tools  too often, which would be time and resource intensive.  Based on the comparison with the other requirements, we can see that this requirement should stay  in balance with the possibility to update the taxonomy. While updating the taxonomy too often  might be a problem for CSIRTs and LEAs, it also needs to be kept up-to-date to take new phenomena  into account.  49 The pyramid of pain is a diagram that shows the relationship between the types of indicators you might use  to detect an adversary's activities and how much pain it will cause them when you are able to deny those  indicators to them: http://detect-respond.blogspot.fr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html.  http://detect-respond.blogspot.fr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  28  Regarding the stability of a taxonomy, the VERIS taxonomy has been updated last year (2014) and  Verizon is planning an annual or bi-annual update. CybOX is also updated with a mean of twice a  year since 2011. However, the Data Harmonisation Ontology, the CERT.PT taxonomy and the  AVOIDIT taxonomy have not been updated since they were firstly drawn up. It must be noted that if  the OAP 4.1 working group selects the CERT.PT taxonomy as the common taxonomy to use for the  exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs, they plan to update the taxonomy yearly  through meetings of its stakeholders. For the CSIRT-MU taxonomy and the Phänomene Cybercrime,  since they are still at draft version, they might evolve anytime.  The case of the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes is a bit specific since its  release date was in May 2015, the year of this report. It has therefore not been updated yet.  During the ENISA/EC3 workshop, the attendees mentioned the fact that the stability of the  taxonomy was indeed an important concern for the exchange of information.  2.3.3.5 Requirement 5: Some information should be mandatory in the taxonomy  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the CSIRT and respectively the LEA communities during the  interviews.  Three CSIRTs and one LEA representative mentioned during the interviews that some fields of the  taxonomy should always be mandatory when the taxonomy is used to classify information. That  way, if the information is exchanged based on the proposed taxonomy, the recipient of the  information can be sure that a minimal set of information will always be provided.  Most of the fields in the CybOX taxonomy are not mandatory, while VERIS and the Data  Harmonization Ontology have some mandatory fields. The CERT.PT, the Esquema nacional de  seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes, the CSIRT-MU taxonomy, the Phänomene Cybercrime and the  AVOIDIT taxonomy do not specify which fields are mandatory but are high-level description so all  information can be considered as mandatory by default (missing information would void the use of  these taxonomies).  2.3.3.6 Requirement 6: The taxonomy should have a description of the terms used to agree  upon terminology  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  One CSIRT representative and two LEA representatives mentioned during the interviews that, to  ensure that CSIRTs and LEAs use the same vocabulary regarding cyber incidents, the taxonomy  should describe the terms used to classify the information, such as types of events and incidents.  This would avoid confusion while classifying or sharing information based on the taxonomy.  All taxonomies presented in this study describe the terminology used to classify information.  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, the attendees also mentioned that this requirement was  important to be able to classify the information correctly, and that the description of each element  of the taxonomy was necessary.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  29  2.3.3.7 Requirement 7: The taxonomy should be updated regularly during meetings with its  stakeholders  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  During the interviews, one CSIRT representative and four LEA representatives mentioned that the  taxonomy should be updated on a regular basis. This should be done by having regular meetings  between the relevant stakeholders using the taxonomy. Updating the taxonomy would ensure that  it stays up-to-date and adapts to new phenomena encountered by the stakeholders.  VERIS and CybOX are maintained by institutions that manage their updates, although they take into  account users’ remarks. The data Harmonization Ontology and the AVOIDIT taxonomy are not  updated anymore and the CERT.PT will be adapted in the future if it is chosen by the OAP 4.1  working group as the promoted common taxonomy for this information exchange. The CSIRT-MU  taxonomy and the Phänomene Cybercrime are currently being drafted so their update process is not  yet known. Regarding the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de ciberincidentes, it has just  been created so the update process is not known yet at the time of this study.  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, the update of the taxonomy was indeed mentioned as  important for the evolution and the use of the taxonomy in the exchange of information.  2.3.3.8 Requirement 8: The Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Directive should be taken  as legal basis for the taxonomy  This information is not part of the information considered as being sufficiently justified since it was  less expressed by the members of the communities during the interviews.  Some LEA representatives mentioned during the interview that the Budapest Convention50 and the  Cybercrime Directive51 should be taken as legal basis for the taxonomy. This element was also  supported by an anonymous vote during the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop where 67% of the voters were  of the opinion that the taxonomy should include a mapping to both European and National  legislations.  VERIS and CybOX are US-based and do not take into account the Budapest Convention and the  Cybercrime Directive. In addition, the Data Harmonization Ontology and the AVOIDIT taxonomy do  not make any mention of it. The Phänomene Cybercrime and the Esquema nacional de seguridad  Gestión de ciberincidentes are not linked with the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime  Directive. Therefore, the CERT.PT taxonomy and the CSIRT-MU taxonomy are the only ones aligning  to this Convention and Directive since it has been constructed for the exchange of information with  the European LEA.  50 Convention on Cyber crime, Budapest, 23.XI.2001:  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/185.htm  51 Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against  information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:218:0008:0014:EN:PDF  http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/185.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:218:0008:0014:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:218:0008:0014:EN:PDF  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  30  2.3.3.9 Requirement 9: The taxonomy should be mapped to the relevant EU and Council of  Europe legal framework and where possible to legislation in the Member States  Based on the specification of this study, the selected taxonomy should be mapped to the relevant  EU legislation such as the Cybercrime Directive, to the Budapest Convention and, where possible, to  the national legislation of the Member States.  Among the taxonomies examined by this study, the CERT.PT taxonomy and the CSIRT-MU taxonomy  are the only ones that reference the legislation – they specify EU legislation and the corresponding  national regulations. It must be underlined that the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de  ciberincidentes underlines the procedure of a declaration of an incident to the CCN-CERT.  2.3.3.10 Other possible requirements based on feedback received after the ENISA/EC3 workshop  In addition to the requirements mentioned in the previous sections, one CSIRT is of the opinion that  a taxonomy should support the categorisation of classified information, such as EU SECRET and  NATO SECRET. However, based on the information collected during the interviews, it seems that in  the current context of information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, it does not seem that such  information is exchanged actively. Therefore such a requirement may be further considered in a  future context, but not within the scope of this study  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  31  2.3.4 Input from the OAP 4.1 working group regarding the taxonomy selected  During the OAP 4.1 working group meeting in The Hague on the 4 May 2015 with EC3 and through  interviews with two LEA representatives, the following information was provided:   The OAP 4.1 working group can relate to the definition of a taxonomy52 used in this study: a  taxonomy is most often defined as a classification of terms and has a close relationship with  the use of ontology.   The OAP 4.1 working group is currently setting up a governance structure in order to revise  the common taxonomy during bi-annual meetings.   The OAP 4.1 working group considers that STIX could possibly be a good candidate as  sharing mechanism to use for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs using  the chosen common taxonomy. To be able to use STIX, the OAP 4.1 working group should  define STIX profiles53 for LEAs.  This input provided by the OAP 4.1 working group stakeholders has been taken into consideration  for the choice of the taxonomy and a sharing mechanism for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LEAs. The possibilities of alignment of this study to the OAP 4.1 working group were also  taken into account as they might provide the advantages previously mentioned in this document (in  ‘Objectives of aligning this study with the OAP 4.1 working group for the taxonomy’).  52 Ontology and taxonomies for critical infrastructures: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology  53 Profiles are a mechanism to describe a particular usage of STIX as practiced by a community, organization, or  tool.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  32  2.4 Verification that the preferred taxonomy (CERT.PT taxonomy) fits the  requirements highlighted during the interviews and identified from desk  research  This section presents the result of the analysis of the taxonomies considered by this study. For each  taxonomy, this section verifies whether it meets requirements identified at the previous section.  2.4.1 Why the CERT.PT taxonomy is best adapted for the exchange of information  between both communities  As detailed in the next section (the analysis of the requirements met by each taxonomy), the  CERT.PT taxonomy seems to be best fitted for the exchange of information, based on the minor  complexity of the taxonomy, its possibilities of evolution based on the needs of both communities  and its legal basis for the consideration of events and incidents.  Proposing the CERT.PT taxonomy may also have the advantage of aligning this study to the OAP 4.1  working group, as detailed in the section ‘Objectives of aligning this study with the OAP 4.1 working  group for the taxonomy‘.  2.4.2 Analysis of the requirements met by each taxonomy  In the summary table in the previous section ‘Requirements for a taxonomy based on the needs for  information CSIRTs and LEAs as expressed during the interviews’, we can observe two tendencies in  the taxonomies considered by this study:   Taxonomies tending to be as detailed as possible, that are therefore complex to use but  exhaustive, managed by organisations that have the ownership of the taxonomy, and   High-level taxonomies that are easy to use and do not contain a highly detailed structure to  describe the incidents and events.  This can be determined by observing the mapping of the first three requirements (‘The taxonomy  should take the level of maturity of LEAs in term of technical capabilities into account’, ‘The  taxonomy should be able to transmit high- and low-level data’ and ‘The taxonomy should be as  complete as possible regarding the types of events and incidents’).  Based on our observations, we can see that the use of a complex and exhaustive taxonomy may not  be a solution per se – the choice between complexity and completeness should be done according  to the capabilities of the stakeholders in information exchange.  For the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs, considering the high difference in terms  of technical capabilities between Member States, we consider that a better approach might be to  start with a taxonomy that is simple to use to make sure that it gets accepted by all CSIRTs and LEAs  as a common basis. At a later stage, if there would be a preference for an increase of the level of  detail, the taxonomy could be further elaborated by the stakeholders to meet the new  requirements. Towards this end, two taxonomies would fit the best to the first three requirements,  the Data Harmonization Ontology and the CERT.PT taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  33  The preference for the ease of use of a taxonomy was further supported by an anonymous vote  during the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop where a majority of respondents expressed that the ease of use  of a taxonomy should be the priority against the level of detail. Additionally, 30% of the voters  answered that both should be considered as priority. The need for an easy-to-use but also detailed  taxonomy might be answered by starting to exchange information based on a simple taxonomy and  upgrade it to a higher level of detail afterwards, when the use of the taxonomy would be well  implemented.  According to the requirements that were expressed during the interviewed CSIRTs and LEAs, we  can observe that the CERT.PT taxonomy is best fitted for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LEAs since it is based on the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Directive, and  that there is a possibility that it may be selected by the OAP 4.1 working group as the taxonomy to  be used for information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, and therefore be regularly updated based  on the requirements of the communities.  The CERT.PT taxonomy is also the only taxonomy presented in this study to reference EU legislation,  which has been identified as a requirement, which was supported by the votes during the 4th  ENISA/EC3 workshop.  The following table presents a summary of the possible advantages of using the CERT.PT taxonomy  for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs:  NR. ADVANTAGES OF THE CERT.PT TAXONOMY  1.  The CERT.PT taxonomy is easy to use and implement since it describes events and  incidents at a high level.  2.  The CERT.PT taxonomy, if it is chosen by the OAP 4.1 working group, will be updated  regularly through meetings of its stakeholders.  3.  The classification provided by the CERT.PT taxonomy makes all fields mandatory,  which provides consistency for the creation of statistics.  4. The CERT.PT is based on the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Directive.  5.  The events and incidents mentioned in the CERT.PT taxonomy are described, which  provides a common understanding of used terms.  Table 3 - Advantages of the CERT.PT taxonomy  In addition to the advantage that the CERT.PT taxonomy is being considered as a potential candidate  by the OAP 4.1 working group, it is already being implemented into some tools by some CSIRTs to  exchange information according to its classification and has proven efficient.  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, the participants confirmed, during the closing session of the  workshop, that according to them the CERT.PT taxonomy is sufficiently accepted by the CSIRT and  LEA communities.  For the future update of the CERT.PT taxonomy, the use of the other inputs and feedback provided  after the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, such as the Esquema nacional de seguridad Gestión de  ciberincidentes and some other comments on the CERT.PT taxonomy should be used during the first  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  34  meeting of the CERT.PT governance structure to evaluate the input these studies could provide for  the current version of the CERT.PT taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  35  2.5 Proposal for a sharing mechanism for the selected taxonomy  A clear distinction should be made between a taxonomy, a sharing mechanism and a sharing  platform to avoid any possible confusion. While a taxonomy is a way of describing information  through classification, a sharing mechanism structures the way the information is encoded. For  example, a sharing mechanism might provide rules for names and positions of XML tags to allow a  file to be treated automatically. Finally, a sharing platform is a tool allowing to share information. It  is not mandatory to have such a platform – files containing information structured according to a  standard and classified according to a taxonomy could simply be sent by e-mail, for example.  Nevertheless, the use of a sharing platform allows users to easily share information in a structured  way.  While a taxonomy allows classification of the information, it does not provide a format for the  representation or the sharing of the information. This section presents the different requirements  for the sharing mechanism obtained through desk research and interviews, and observes how  sharing mechanisms taken into consideration for this study meet these requirements. The last part  justifies the choice of STIX as the proposed sharing mechanism and possibilities of future  alignment with the OAP 4.1 working group. However, the choice of STIX as the sharing mechanism  is not yet fully supported by both communities, as explained in section 2.5.3.  2.5.1 Requirements for the sharing mechanism highlighted by the desk research  Based on the desk research, information and recommendations for sharing mechanisms for the  exchange of information is detailed here. This information is not always focused on CSIRTs and LEAs  but more generally speaking about information exchange. These requirements and the  requirements highlighted through the interviews (in section 2.5.2) have been supported by the vote  of the attendees of the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop where the feedback about them was positive – 83%  of voters found these requirements ‘likely representative’ and 17% of them found the requirements  ‘very much representative’.  2.5.1.1 Requirement 1: The new sharing mechanism should not be a new standard 54  Considering the amount of already existing initiatives, creating a new standard for the exchange of  information between CSIRTs and LEAs could hinder the acceptance of the mechanism by CSIRTs and  LEAs, and later on by third parties (considering that the OAP 4.1 working group is also targeting the  use of the taxonomy and the sharing mechanism by the private sector).  Therefore, this study was directed towards the proposal for the use of an existing mechanism  instead of the creation of a new one.  54 Good practice guide for addressing NIS aspects of cybercrime:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice-guide-for- addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice-guide-for-addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/good-practice-guide-for-addressing-network-and-information-security-aspects-of-cybercrime/at_download/fullReport  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  36  2.5.1.2 Requirement 2: The source of the data of the sharing mechanism should be referenced,  including the originating organisation, the transport mechanism and the data format55  For information to be actionable, there must be a clear indication of its origin. Based on the source  of the data, the receiver of the information can decide to trust or not to trust the information  received. The sharing mechanism should therefore allow its users to indicate the details of the  source of the information transmitted.  2.5.1.3 Requirement 3: The sharing mechanism should have a level of acceptance among the  business56  Until recently, none of the mechanisms available to structure information exchange were considered  popular among the private sector. Nowadays, STIX is growing in popularity and is progressively  turning into a de facto standard. It is considered as a reliable and exhaustive tool to structure  information, and it is conveniently provided with the specification for a sharing mechanism, TAXII.  2.5.2 Requirements for the sharing mechanism highlighted through interviews  2.5.2.1 Requirement 1: The sharing mechanism should be considered as an appropriate tool for  the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs  Through the interviews, it appeared that CSIRTs and LEAs consider STIX as an appropriate tool for  the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. Although some of the CSIRTs and the LEAs  pointed out its complexity, most of them considered it as adaptable for information sharing.  The respondents also mentioned that, to be able to use STIX for information sharing, profiles would  have to be defined for LEAs. The profiles allow users to describe how they use STIX – what kind of  information they need, which parts of it should or should not be indicated in the information  transmitted. For example, if a user of STIX just wants to receive information about spam e-mails, he  could specify that the type of information he wants to receive is about spam, that he only needs the  observables and indicators in the information and does not need details about the target, the  attacker etc.  2.5.2.2 Requirement 2: The lack of human resources should not be an obstacle for the  implementation of a standard  While some CSIRTs and LEAs said that implementing a standard to share information would not be a  problem, some others mentioned that, considering their lack of human resources, implementing  such a tool would be rather resource intensive.  55 Actionable information for security: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable- information/actionable-information-for-security/at_download/fullReport  56 Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for- exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information/at_download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/actionable-information-for-security/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information/at_download/fullReport  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  37  2.5.3 Why STIX could be an appropriate sharing mechanism  Although multiple standards exist for the sharing of information, STIX appears to be the preferred  mechanism for the exchange mechanism, also recognised by the CSIRT and LEA communities as a  suitable candidate for a sharing mechanism, although its use for the exchange of information  between CSIRTs and LEAS is still under discussion. Indeed, using STIX would avoid rebuilding a  standard from scratch, which would represent a huge amount of work. It is also a mechanism that is  widely known and becoming a de facto standard according to the ENISA study ‘Standards and tools  for exchange and processing of actionable information’57.  STIX allows for a very close description of information – including the detailed description of the  source of the data exchanged, which is a requirement that has been pointed out during the desk  research. In addition, as STIX is a structured language to describe information, it can be  implemented together with any cyber incidents taxonomy. Besides, the STIX model is constituted of  different elements that relate to each other, which makes it feasible to use a step-by-step approach  in its implementation, by implementing the different parts of the model. In this process, the basic  parts of the STIX model could be implemented first, such as observables (the lowest element of the  Pyramid of Pain49), and then grown in complexity by adding other elements of the model when  feasible.  Regarding the lack of resources mentioned by some of the Member States, there might be ways to  overcome the complexity of the implementation of the tool, like cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEAs to implement it, specific help from ENISA or EC3, centralisation of a platform, etc. However,  these situations should be treated on a case-by-case basis.  Although a sharing mechanism would offer advantages, the use of sharing mechanisms and a  sharing platform is not supported by all stakeholders. It appeared through the 4th ENISA/EC3  workshop feedback session that some members of the community are not inclined to use STIX due  to its complexity, but also that some of them might prefer to use independent sharing mechanisms  on a case-by-case basis by taking into account the needs of the receiver of the information  exchanged – such as using a CSV file to send information to an ISP. Therefore, a separate study  should be set-up once the taxonomy has been implemented to see if there is sufficient demand for a  common sharing mechanism or if the local existing mechanisms in place should be kept.  Alternatively, if a unique sharing mechanism would be chosen, STIX is a ‘good enough’ solution  according to the feedback received during the workshop. If needed, it might also be implemented  step-by-step to reduce the complexity of the mechanism.  2.6 Proposed model to adapt the selected taxonomy to new phenomena  For the taxonomy to be used by the CSIRT and LEA communities, it should be regularly updated to  respond to the new needs of each community and the new phenomena appearing. This section  details the requirements for this update process that were highlighted by the interviews and the  proposed model for the regular update of the taxonomy.  57 Source: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools- for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  38  2.6.1 Requirements for maintaining a taxonomy highlighted by the interviews  This section presents requirements obtained through the interviews of CSIRTs and LEAs that should  be met by the model to adapt the chosen taxonomy.  2.6.1.1 Requirement 1: The update of the taxonomy and the exchange of information should be  supported by informal personal meetings  This is one of the pieces of justified information – all the CSIRTs and LEAs mentioning personal  meetings agreed that these meetings were necessary to maintain trust and keep the exchange of  information alive. While this is not a requirement directly addressed to the update of the taxonomy,  it adds to the following requirement (‘the update of the taxonomy should be performed regularly by  doing meetings with the stakeholders’). See below section.  Indeed, since personal meetings are considered vital to keep the exchange of information going,  these meetings could also be used to discuss the taxonomy and the need to update it to new  phenomena.  2.6.1.2 Requirement 2: The update of the taxonomy should be performed regularly by regular  meetings with the stakeholders  A number of CSIRTs and LEA mentioned that, to ensure that the taxonomy is updated and kept in  line with the requirements of the communities, meetings should take place regularly (at least once a  year) to ensure that the taxonomy stays ‘alive’. The more that input is received from the users of the  taxonomy, the more that the taxonomy will be adapted to the needs and, therefore, used.  2.6.2 Model to adapt the taxonomy based on the requirements  Based on our observations, we can divide the process of updating taxonomies into two models:  ‘dynamic’ and ‘unidirectional’.  The dynamic update of a taxonomy is done through meetings happening at regular intervals. During  these meetings, the stakeholders (owners, users, etc.) meet and share their experience and their  wishes regarding the evolution of the taxonomy. These meetings can be physical but online  meetings are also sufficient to update the taxonomy.  The unidirectional update of a taxonomy is usually in place when the taxonomy is owned by an  entity: users send a request for an update of the taxonomy and the owner of the taxonomy accepts  them and integrates them into the taxonomy or simply refuses them.  Regarding the update of the proposed common taxonomy for the exchange of information between  CSIRTs and LEAs, considering the low amount of stakeholders and the intention to be adapted to the  needs of the stakeholders, we recommend to implement a dynamic update of the taxonomy by  setting up regular meetings.  Also, a structure should be put in place to allow exceptional reviews of the taxonomy. In case of an  urgent need, this would allow the users of the taxonomy to request a change to the taxonomy  outside of the regular meetings, to meet new urgent needs.  The OAP 4.1 working group also considers regular meetings of the stakeholders to adapt the  taxonomy as a good way to proceed for its updates. They were setting up such meetings at the time  of writing of this report (2015).  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  39  During the 4th ENISA/EC3 workshop, this ‘update model’ based on regular meetings of the  stakeholders was supported by the majority of the voters. However, a concern about the costs for  such meetings was also expressed, but these could be avoided by co-locating meetings with another  meeting addressing the same communities, such as the ENISA/EC3 workshops.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  40  3 Proposal for a roadmap for the use of the taxonomy in a  sharing solution  Once a common taxonomy has been agreed, endorsed by ENISA and EC3 and accepted by the CSIRT  and LEA communities, the classification of the information proposed by the taxonomy can be  effectively used in the exchange of information between both communities. The taxonomy should  be used to further assist CSIRTs and LEAs in improving the information exchange and in accessing  information if the taxonomy has been effectively ‘implemented’ by them, or assigned to content, in  some way.  To achieve that goal, a mechanism to exchange the information based on the taxonomy  classification should be chosen, refined and further applied by the CSIRT and LEA communities.  Such a mechanism can be either supported by existing or further systems and technologies in place  at the CSIRTs and LEAs – with anticipated long-terms benefits in terms of decreasing necessary  effort/cost for exchanging information – or can be based only on agreements and protocols that  implement the taxonomy.  Based on our observations, without an agreed-upon mechanism, the exchange of data, even with a  common language, would remain unstructured and therefore could not be automatically processed.  For example, if a LEA and a CSIRT have an agreement on the taxonomy to use for the exchange of  information between them but have no agreement on a sharing mechanism, the LEA might send  information to the CSIRT in a simple text format. The CSIRT would be able to understand the  information the same way as the LEA thanks to the taxonomy, but they would not be able to  automatically enter this information into their systems without transforming it into the right format.  Having a common exchange mechanism would ensure that the format of the file that is exchanged is  the same, and therefore can easily be integrated in the tools of every receiver.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  41  3.1 Key tasks to perform for the implementation of the taxonomy  Based on the desk research, the interviews and the goals of the OAP 4.1 working group, this section  presents a roadmap, consisting of a set of short-term and long-term actions proposed for the  implementation of an information exchange between CSIRTs and LEAs communities. Conceptually,  these short-term and long-term actions can be grouped in the following categories, corresponding  to the typical phases of implementation for the taxonomies:  Key success factors for the implementation of the proposed roadmap consist of:   Integration into the day-to-day operations of CSIRTs and LEAs, eventually supported by a  sharing platform allowing for integration with the existing technical systems and  technologies in place is critical for the success of the taxonomy adoption. It is key that once  the taxonomy has been validated by end-users, it needs to be completely integrated into the  systems and technologies that are in place, or in the planned new ones (e.g. common  sharing platform). Changes and refinements to the taxonomy are usually further needed at  this stage – in order to allow for integration adjustments for multiple technical systems and  technologies in place.   Good governance of the taxonomy is critical to maintain its long-term stability and growth.  For this, creating clear policies to allow the community of CSIRT and LEA stakeholders to  effectively manage the taxonomy and its changes is a key success factor. This needs to be  supported by a simple and transparent governance plan.   Achieving a well-managed roll-out of a common taxonomy can emphasise a number of  benefits for CSIRTs and LEAs, in terms of lower efforts / costs for information exchange,  creation and retrieval.   Awareness and a proper training to involved CSIRTs and LEAs for the roll-out and effective  use of the taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  42   Further linking the taxonomy with an existing legislation of the Member States (e.g. based  on the demand of the Member States ) may contribute to a faster speed of adoption of the  taxonomy – by overcoming limitations of the CSIRT and LEA mandates and possible other  limits coming from the legislative framework.   A well-defined and well-organized system for adoption of the taxonomy allows to connect  the relevant CSIRT and LEA content and experts while improving information exchange,  ensuring a proper information security and data compliance.

Creation of a governance structure for the update of the taxonomy  To be able to adapt the taxonomy to a new phenomenon encountered by the communities and also to meet  new requirements that they might have in the future, a simple but effective governance structure should be  put in place by Europol and ENISA to organise regular meetings for the update of the taxonomy. Europol and  ENISA are the most appropriate organisers of this governance structure due to the fact that they are EU  agencies and that they represent both communities.  The first step for the creation of such a structure should be the identification of the stakeholder  representatives. If possible, each CSIRT and LEA from all EU Member States should be represented in the  governance structure that will update the taxonomy. Since Europol has access to the EUCTF mailing list and  ENISA has a mailing-list of national and governmental CSIRTs in EU Member States, Europol should contact  the LEAs of the Member States while ENISA should contact CSIRTs, to ask them to collaborate in such  meetings.  The second step is to plan regular meetings of this governance structure to ensure a regular review of the  taxonomy, with proper consideration of the balance between meeting of the requirements of the  communities and ensuring the stability of the taxonomy. Based on the information collected so far, it seems  that having meetings once or twice a year would be a good compromise. Once again, due to their roles and  contacts lists, Europol and ENISA should be responsible for the organisation of such meetings (choosing the  dates, making the agenda and sending invitations).  In parallel with the creation of the governance structure, the selected taxonomy should be promoted  amongst both LEA and CSIRT communities, to raise awareness about the taxonomy and to incline both  communities to use its classification for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. Having them  use the taxonomy before the choice of a sharing mechanism might provide feedback to be processed by the  governance structure, allowing it to begin updating the taxonomy to the needs of the users. As a result,  when a sharing mechanism and a sharing platform are chosen (which are the following actions), there may  be an accelerated adoption of the taxonomy, the sharing mechanism and the sharing platform. The  promotion of the taxonomy should be performed by ENISA and Europol, since they have the appropriate  contact list for this action (the EUCTF for Europol and a global CSIRT mailing list for ENISA).  3.1.2.2 Action 2. Adapting the chosen sharing mechanism to the taxonomy  As explained previously, the taxonomy itself needs to be accompanied by a sharing mechanism to make the  exchange of information efficient. The sharing mechanism that will be selected has to be adapted to the  taxonomy. A simple example is to define which fields contains the types of events and which other contains  the types of incidents.  Therefore, to integrate the taxonomy into a sharing mechanism, the fields that will contain the classification  provided by the taxonomy should be determined and the mandatory information specified (in the case of  high-level taxonomies like the CERT.PT taxonomy, the specification should define all fields as mandatory).  This task should be executed by Europol, in cooperation with ENISA and the members of the OAP 4.1  working group since they are the main actors in the selection of this taxonomy and are knowledgeable on  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  46  the matter. CERT-EU59 should provide technical support when needed since they already implemented the  CERT.PT taxonomy in information exchange tools.  The kind of information to be exchanged depending on the receiver should be determined as well. In STIX,  this is done by creating profiles, which allow users to define what kind of information they want to receive  (in other words, what part of the data they are interested in). This step could enable the use of the sharing  mechanism together with the taxonomy. Some profiles already exists for CSIRTs which could be reused as  default profiles. The focus of this step should therefore be on the LEAs. Europol, as the EU agency, should  define a LEA profile (in STIX, this is done by modifying the default profile60) with the cooperation of the  members of the OAP 4.1 working group and the LEAs. CSIRTs and LEAs that have specific needs regarding a  common profile and prefer using a specific profile created should also build a profile adapted to their needs.  3.1.2.3 Action 3. Choice of a sharing platform and an implementation model (distributed or global  platform) for the exchange of messages across Member States  As explained in the section ‘Proposition for a sharing mechanism for the selected taxonomy’, three elements  are used for the sharing of information between CSIRTs and LEAs: a taxonomy, a sharing mechanism and a  sharing platform. Once the first two are selected, the third one should be chosen or created. The platform to  exchange information might be simply e-mails, or specific tools could be used, such as MISP61 or  AbuseHelper62, which allows the use of a level of classification (such as TLP63, which was mentioned during  the interviews).  Therefore, selecting a sharing platform that would fit the needs of both communities might allow the  stakeholders to exchange information more easily. Europol and ENISA should execute this step in  collaboration with the OAP 4.1 working group since they have knowledge about the taxonomy and also  know the needs of the CSIRTs and the LEAs.  3.1.2.4 Action 4. Creation of a documentation set on integration, use and examples of the exchange of  information with the sharing mechanism and the taxonomy  Since not all CSIRTs and LEAs are familiar with the use of such tools (a taxonomy, sharing mechanisms and  platforms), the creation of documentation and examples on how to implement these to share information at  a local and EU level could help them through the process. ENISA should create this documentation since they  have an extensive experience in such documentation.  3.1.2.5 Action 5. Organisation of an online workshop to present the taxonomy and the sharing  mechanism to CSIRTs and LEAs  To present the tools (the taxonomy, the sharing mechanism and the sharing platform) to both communities,  demonstrate the use of the tools and gather comments and feedback from CSIRTs and LEAs, a workshop  should be organised to show how the exchange of information could be structured and the objectives and  advantages of such an approach.  59 CERT-EU: https://cert.europa.eu  60 STIX profile template: https://stix.mitre.org/language/profiles/stix_1.2_profile_template_r1.xlsx  61 Malware Information Sharing Platform, http://www.misp-project.org/  62 AbuseHelper, http://abusehelper.be/  63 The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a mechanism widely used in information sharing communities to indicate the  allowed distribution of information. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol  https://cert.europa.eu/ https://stix.mitre.org/language/profiles/stix_1.2_profile_template_r1.xlsx https://stix.mitre.org/language/profiles/stix_1.2_profile_template_r1.xlsx http://www.misp-project.org/ http://abusehelper.be/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  47  To be able to provide that information to all CSIRTs and LEAs and ensure a high participation to the  workshop, Europol and ENISA should organise such a workshop together and handle also invitations to  CSIRTs and LEAs.  3.1.2.6 Action 6. Linking the taxonomy with the legislation of the Member States based on the demand  of the Member States  Some Member States might need the taxonomy to be linked to their national legislation to help them adopt  the taxonomy to overcome limitations of their mandates and other possible limits from the legislative  framework (especially for the LEAs since their way of working is more procedural).  ENISA should provide help to Member States that would need assistance to create this mapping between  the taxonomy and their national legislation since it is an EU agency and it can provide such an advice through  their experience and knowledge about the taxonomy.  3.1.2.7 Action 7. Providing help to CSIRTs and LEAs for the integration of the taxonomy and the sharing  mechanism  Since the implementation of the taxonomy, the sharing mechanism and potentially a sharing platform might  be relatively complex for some CSIRTs or LEAs, ENISA and Europol should provide support (awareness raising  and, resources or documentation) to the entities that would require it based on their knowledge about the  taxonomy and the sharing mechanism.  Training requirements and the approach for training on the taxonomy will have to be further identified and  detailed. These will in-turn drive the development of training schedules and materials that are critical to the  actual delivery of support to the CSIRTs and LEAs for taxonomy implementation. This might help them put  such a mechanism in place.  It is recommended that CERT-EU should also be involved in this task in order to provide additional support  for the implementation, based on their experience with implementing the taxonomy.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  48  4 Conclusion  During this study, key elements for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs have been  identified, more specifically regarding:   A taxonomy to use for the exchange of information   A sharing mechanism to structure the exchange   A model to adapt the taxonomy to new requirements  Based on this, a roadmap has been proposed for the implementation of a taxonomy in the exchange of  information. This section describes the conclusions for each part of this study.  4.1 Common taxonomy for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs  Based on the desk research and the information gathered from interviews of CSIRTs and LEAs of EU Member  States, requirements for a common taxonomy have been obtained. Based on these requirements and the  possibilities of alignment with the OAP 4.1 working group, this study proposes the CERT.PT taxonomy as a  common taxonomy for the exchange of information between CSIRTs and LEAs. This taxonomy answers the  requirements provided and is easy to use and implement, while also offering opportunities for future  updates, to evolve to a higher level of detail. It is also based on the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime  Directive, and provides a definition of the incidents and events it describes.  4.2 Sharing mechanism for the selected taxonomy  While a taxonomy allows to classify the information exchanged, it does not provide a format for the  exchanged data. Using a common sharing mechanism could offer advantages such as automation of the  analysis of the data and the creation of statistics.  Based on the research performed, STIX would be a good candidate for the format of the data. It has a high  level of recognition by business and the stakeholders (CSIRTs and LEAs). STIX can be used together with any  taxonomy and offer a model of which the parts can be implemented separately, allowing a step-by-step  approach.  Although a sharing mechanism could offer advantages for the exchange of information, it also has  drawbacks: it complexity might hinder its use, and some CSIRTs and LEAs might prefer to keep ad-hoc  sharing mechanisms such as CSV files. Therefore, the use of a sharing mechanism should be studied further  based on the needs of the CSIRTs and LEAs.  4.3 Model to adapt the taxonomy to new requirements  To enhance the use of a taxonomy, it should also be kept up-to-date and evolve according to the  requirements of the CSIRTs and LEAs. Therefore, an update model should be in place to ensure the evolution  of the taxonomy. Based on the information collected from the interviews and the possibilities of alignment  with the OAP 4.1 working group, a dynamic update of the taxonomy through regular meeting of the  stakeholders seems to be best suited.  Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  Final  |  Version 1.0  |  PuBlic  |  December 2015  49  4.4 Roadmap for the implementation of the taxonomy  This study proposes a roadmap that defines the main elements of the implementation of the common  taxonomy through the CSIRT and LEA communities.  The CERT.PT taxonomy is an important step towards improving the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. It  should allow both communities to share information more easily and improve the efficiency of the  communication. Furthermore, based on the evolution of the taxonomy, it should allow CSIRTs and LEAs to  adapt the classification to their convenience, making it grow based on their needs.  Towards this end, the most important short term activities include setting up a governance structure to  continuously update the taxonomy to new phenomena, disseminating the taxonomy to the CSIRT and LEA  communities, identifying the participants for the CSIRTs and LEAs in each Member State of the EU and  organising the governance meetings.

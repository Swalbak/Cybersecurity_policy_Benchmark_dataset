BIBLIOGRAPHY 33  A ANNEX: SURVEY – QUESTIONNAIRE 37  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In recent years, digitalisation has turned everything into something connected and smarter.  How ever, w hile creating numerous opportunities for the European economy and society,  technologies bring forw ard several new  challenges. According to a recent study 1, cyber threats  increase year over year, as the popularity of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things  (IoT), Artif icial Intelligence (AI), big data, the large use of cloud computing, as w ell as connected  devices, provide copious w ays to invade an organisation.  An attack directed at a critical infrastructure, such as a hospital, can lead to physical damages  and put the lives of patients at risk2. Therefore, there is a need for solid Incident Response  Capabilities (IRC) in the health sector, in particular health care settings (including hospitals and  private clinics). This sector indeed faces threats along its entire supply chain w ith potentially  disastrous societal consequences for a multiplicity of stakeholders (citizens, public authorities,  regulators, professional associations, large industries, SMEs), w hich become even more  vulnerable in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This report focuses on sectoral CSIRT capabilities status and development w ithin the health  sector since the implementation of the NIS Directive. The aim of the report is to offer insights on  current incident response (IR) trends in order to draw  practical recommendations about the  development of IR capabilities in the health sector.  KEY FINDING  Based on a methodological approach, a series of f indings is identif ied, as follow s:  Key Finding #1 The main entity in charge of Incident Response in the health sector are  National CSIRTs. Health Sectoral CSIRTs are still an exception across  Member States. How ever, there is a strong trend in developing sector-  w ide CSIRTs collaborations, w hich include, but are not limited, to  information sharing.  Key Finding #2 The creation of sector-specif ic IRC in the health sector appears to be  the result of the lack of sector-specif ic know ledge of the National  CSIRT, as w ell as lesson learned from past incidents, and the  implementation of the NIS Directive.  Key Finding #3 National Health Sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide services more  adapted to the sector’s specif icities and needs in addition to the generic  services provided by National CSIRTs.  Key Finding #4 According to the respondents to the survey, the main resources and  tools in place to support the development of constituents’ IRC in the  health sector are shared framew orks for incident classif ication and  threat modelling, training and education activities and a netw ork of IR  actors.  1 https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/the-2020-cyber-security-report/  2 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/18/prosecutors-open-homicide-case-after-cyber-attack-on-german- hospital  https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/the-2020-cyber-security-report/ https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/18/prosecutors-open-homicide-case-after-cyber-attack-on-german-hospital https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/18/prosecutors-open-homicide-case-after-cyber-attack-on-german-hospital  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  4  Key Finding #5 This study found out that the key forces driving CSIRTs’ IR  development are sector-specif ic clarif ications on the security  requirements and responsibilities of the organisations, and the  exchange of IR related information.  Key Finding #6 When it comes dow n to IR, this study found out that the main  challenges faced by the health CSIRTs are the lack of security culture  among operators of essential services (OESs), the fact that  management (and the security) of OESs IT infrastructure is often  outsourced, and the lack of established cooperation tools and channels  w ith OES incident response teams.  The study makes the following recommendations:  • Enhance and facilitate the creation of healthcare sectoral  CSIRTs.  • Capitalise on the expertise of the healthcare CSIRTs for helping  Operators of Essential Services (OESs) develop their IR  capabilities.  • Empow er healthcare CSIRTs role on information sharing  activities.

OVERVIEW AND SCOPE OF  THE STUDY  1.1 CONTEXT OF THE STUDY  The volume and intensity of cyberattacks  on the health sector increased in 202034 (e.g.,  Ryuk ransomw are5; shut dow n of the UVM Health Netw ork6). Health care organisations in  general and hospitals in particular have been a major target for cybercrime, primarily because of  the value of data that can be obtained from an attack, as w ell as its disruptive impact7.  The cyber threats are now  increasingly visible  to executive committees, boards, politicians  and citizens. It is now  mandatory for companies, governments, and citizens to think about and  act upon cybersecurity8. To face such threats, Member States and public and private entities  must strengthen their Incident Response (IR) capabilities and the coordination betw een  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).  As critical infrastructure and services, health care organisations, including hospitals and private  clinics must be prepared to face such cyber-attacks. Disruption of their services would lead  to fundamental impact on both governments and populations .  Nevertheless, the number of highly technical-skilled cybersecurity experts is insuff icient. To f ill  the gap betw een the demand and the human resources available, the public and the private  sector have started to w ork together to create new  training programmes and certif ications for  cybersecurity experts / IR experts. ENISA has also been w orking on the European  Cybersecurity Skills Framew ork9. These new  experts led to the multiplication of response teams  (CSIRT) for both the public and the private sector.  Regarding this evolution of CSIRTs in the health sector, some new  topics may emerge in w hich  ENISA w ill be a key player. On one hand, ENISA supports the NIS Directive enforcement as  the Secretariat of the CSIRT Network , tasked to actively support the CSIRTs cooperation,  provide the secretariat and active support for incident coordination upon request. ENISA also  supports sectorial CSIRTs in the standardisation of exchanges and monitoring specif ic sectorial  threats at national/European scale.  On the other hand, ENISA works to strengthen public and private relationships within the  health sector  by building a trust circle at European scale. For example, by setting up a  collaboration platform dedicated to EU Member States and fostering relevant information  sharing and analysis initiatives Several R&D initiatives at team levels need to be steered at  European level to foster cross-CSIRTs developments, at least w ith guidelines about IR/Threat  Intelligence priorities for EU.  3 ENISA Threat Landscape 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-in-the-health care-sector-during-covid-19-pandemic  5 https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/politics/hospitals-targeted-ransomware-attacks/index.html  6 https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/inside-uvm-medical-center-s-ransomware-attack-11-details.html  7 https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-health care-institutions-with- ransomware  8 https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/fr/pdf/2019/04/fr-complying-with-the-eu-nis-directive.pdf  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-in-the-health%20care-sector-during-covid-19-pandemic https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/politics/hospitals-targeted-ransomware-attacks/index.html https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/inside-uvm-medical-center-s-ransomware-attack-11-details.html https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-health%20care-institutions-with-ransomware https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-health%20care-institutions-with-ransomware https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/fr/pdf/2019/04/fr-complying-with-the-eu-nis-directive.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  7  In this context of rapid grow th of CSIRTs in Europe, this study supports ENISA and Member  States tow ards a better understanding of sectorial CSIRTs and their current IR capabilities, on  w hich they rely in case of major and systemic cyber-attack. The objectives of the study are  explained in more detail in the follow ing section.  1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  This study aims to support the understanding of the status and development of sectoral  healthcare CSIRTs across EU10. The conclusions of the study should help ENISA and Member  States to identify and draw conclusions about the development of incident handling and  response (IR) w ithin the health sector  follow ing the implementation of the NIS Directive.  The study looks into potential gaps, overlaps and challenges  in the services offered as w ell  as in the procedures, processes and tools  in place. More specif ically the study provides an  overview  of the key factors facilitating or hindering the development of sectoral CSIRTs in this  particular sector, as w ell as the specif ic resources and tools in place to support the development  of IRC in the health sector.  The main objectives of this study are the follow ing:  • To collect data on the current IRC in the health care sector;  • To analyse gathered information to assess current sectorial capabilities,  services, processes, tools and cooperation mechanisms; and  • To draw  conclusions and recommendations  based on the key aspects facilitating  and or hindering IR procedures.  The study aimed to collect relevant information in order to provide the follow ing:  • Statistics of distribution of services offered to constituency by CSIRTs and other IR  entities;  • Analysis of the tools used (e.g., open source / commercial / homemade) and their  distribution w ithin CSIRTs and other IR entities;  • Analysis of the IR setup (e.g., central, distributed, hybrid, etc.) and the resources  needed to provide services (e.g., number of resources, skillset, etc.);  • Analysis of gaps and overlaps in services, processes, tools, resources, especially  betw een CSIRTs and other IR entities w ithin the health sector;  • Description of existing policies and guidelines applicable to IR;  • Good practices and lesson learned; and  • Conclusions and recommendations for the development of CSIRTs and other IR  entities.  The study f indings may also support ENISA w ith the delivery of the Output 8.2 of “ENISA  single programming document 2021-2023” Activity 8: ‘Provide targeted as well as general  reports, recommendations, analysis and other actions on future cybersecurity scenarios and  threat landscapes (incident response landscape mapping for NIS Directive sectors)’ .  To achieve the project objectives, a solid methodological approach w as proposed based on  desktop research and an online questionnaire  distributed to EU National CSIRTs and  Sectoral CSIRTs as w ell as OES Incident Response Teams. The methodological approach is  further explained under section 2.  10 Health care prov iders as defined in point (g) of Article 3 of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the  Council.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0024  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  8  2. METHODOLOGY AND DATA  COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  This Chapter describes the methodological approach taken for identifying, collecting and  analysing data on IR development and capabilities in the health care sector.  2.1.1.1 Definition of the research focus for the data collection  The scope of the research and the focus for data collection w as mainly on the operational  domain as outlined by ENISA based on current needs and previous w ork already conducted on  IR. At this stage it w as also decided that the data collection methods w ould be mainly desktop  research and an online survey.  2.1.1.2 Desktop research on the health sector IRC  A literature review  w as conducted to investigate all aspects of IR responsibilities w ithin the  health sector for CSIRTs and other entities in each EU Member State. The desktop research  w as guided by the need to:  • identify the relevant bodies and/or organisations  that play a role in the f ield of IR  capabilities w ithin the health sector in the European Union; and  • analyse the IR responsibilities of the different stakeholders, focusing on the  operational aspects of IR.  While conducting desktop research w e review ed previous ENISA publications, policy  documents, national strategies and other documents and reports made available by CSIRTs,  National Cybersecurity Centres, and the European Commission. Additionally, studies carried out  by technology research, strategic research companies, and academic researchers w ere  consulted. The activities at this stage also included informal consultation w ith IR experts.  2.1.1.3 Designing and testing the online survey  Based on the categorisation of public available information, w e w ere able to identify gaps and  additional information needed to be collected to complement desk research. As such, a  questionnaire w as designed and made available online in order to collect relevant data on IR  setup, and related services, procedures, processes and tools. The survey also covered the  main enabling and hindering factors for establishing sectoral CSIRTs as w ell as the specif ic  resources and tools in place to support the development of incident response capabilities (IRC)  in the health sector.  Before being distributed to stakeholders the online questionnaire w as extensively tested to  ensure that the questions addressed the study objectives and that they are clear, coherent, and  covered all relevant aspects of IR capabilities in the health sector. The f inal version of the  questionnaire is available in Annex A: Survey – questionnaire .  2.1.1.4 Conducting the survey  Upon validation, the questionnaire w as uploaded on EU Survey and the link w as distributed by  ENISA to the members of the CSIRTs Netw ork (CNW), the CyCLONe Netw ork, and the NIS  Cooperation Group. The survey included an introduction to the objectives of the study,  instructions on how  to respond to the questionnaire, and a privacy statement.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  9  The survey w as available online for four w eeks. ENISA follow ed-up w eekly w ith the targeted  audience and sent reminders to the respondents to complete their contributions. A total of 15  responses w ere provided representing 12 Member States.  2.1.1.5 Analysis and identification of recommendations  We performed an analysis of the raw  data collected from the desktop research and the survey  w hich w ere aggregated in a structured matrix. This preliminary analysis allow ed the mapping of  the key f indings of the study.  2.1.1.6 Final report  Final remarks and/or feedback from the pool of experts that w ere used to validate the study (the  study w as distributed for validation to the same group of stakeholders to w hich the survey w as  distributed) w ere incorporated in the f inal report.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  10  3. KEY FINDINGS  3.1 IRC SET-UP AND LANDSCAPE  The main entity in charge of incident response in the health sector are National CSIRTs.  Health Sectoral CSIRTs are still an exception across Member States11. However, there is a  trend in developing sector-wide CSIRTs collaborations, which include, but are not limited,  to information sharing.12  The results of desk research and the survey targeting relevant bodies and organisations that play  a role in the f ield of incident response capabilities w ithin the EU health sector13 show s that:  • 22 out of 27 Member States have no Health Sectoral CSIRTs, but 214 have plans to  create one in the near future;  • 2 Member States15 are currently setting up a Health CSIRT at national level; and  • 3 Member States16 have a Health Sectoral CSIRT at national level. Among these Health  Sectoral CSIRT, 2 (CERT Santé and HealthNet) w ere created respectively by the French  and Luxembourgish government; meanw hile, Z-CERT, the Dutch Health Sectoral  CSIRT, w as developed specif ically for institutions in the healthcare sector.  In addition to Z-CERT, the data collected highlight that an increasing number of sectoral CSIRTs  is being created by operators of essential services 17. Evidence of this trend is HelseCERT,  Norw ay health and care sector's national centre for cyber security18. Although Norw ay is not a  member of the European Union, HelseCERT is an interesting Health Sectoral CSIRT to mention  among the CSIRTs operating in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.  Table 1 provides a summary of the sectoral IR layout and set-up at European level in the health  sector19.  11  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  12 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1  13 Surv ey  for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021.

This applies in particular to countries  w ith a centralised incident response model, w hich do not plan to develop specif ic  sectoral CSIRT capabilities since IR tend to be managed by the OES and supervised  by the National CSIRT or governmental CSIRT53.  • For three54 Member States, dedicated sectoral CSIRTs coordinate incident response at  national level, supervised by the National CSIRT.  To conclude, it is w orth mentioning the existence of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis  Centre (H-ISAC). H-ISAC is a global, non-profit, member-driven organisation offering health  care stakeholders a trusted community and forum for coordinating, collaborating and sharing  vital physical and cyber threat intelligence and best practices w ith each other55. Launched in  2010 in the US, H-ISAC dropped its national focus in favour of an international one in 201856.  Now adays H-ISAC facilitates know ledge transfer across the w orld through educational summits,  w ebinars, w orkshops and w hite papers, supporting in this w ay the exchange of information and  the building of relationships that may contribute to make the health sector more resilient and  proactive in the face of future cyberattacks.  H-ISAC is not an isolated initiative. There is a multiplication of ISACs and netw orks to foster  information exchange and increase aw areness among stakeholders w ithin a sector, even for  sectors than are not defined in the NIS Directive 57.  3.2 CREATION OF SECTORAL CSIRTS  The creation of sector-specific IR capacities in the health sector appears to be the result  of the lack of sector-specific knowledge of the National CSIRT, as well as lessons learned  from past incidents, and the implementation of the NIS Directive.  Figure 1 presents the f indings of the survey (all respondents provided an answ er) in relation to  the key reasons that motivated Member States to create sector-specif ic incident response  capacities in the health sector.  53 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  54 Luxembourg, France, and the Netherlands.  55 https://h-isac.org/  56 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html  57 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://h-isac.org/ https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  16  Figure 1: Reasons to create sector-specif ic IR capacities58  Source: Survey for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021. Q6.  What are the key reasons to create such sector-specific incident response capacities? (N=15).  The need to overcome the lack of sector-specif ic know ledge or capacity of the National CSIRT  appears to be the most relevant reason behind the creation of sector specif ic IR capacities  (27% of responses). Similarly, ‘The diff iculties in managing the cybersecurity incidents in the  NIS Directive sectors’ (14% of responses), together w ith the ‘Lessons learned from past  incidents’ (14% of responses), highlighted the need for sector-specif ic IR capacities in the  health sector, according to the survey respondents.  How ever, the second most important reason w ith 18% of responses is the implementation of the  NIS Directive. This confirms the ENISA finding related to the sector-specif ic capabilities of the  Energy and Air transport sectors59: European legislation has an important and positive impact in  pushing actors to develop sectoral capacities.  In particular, the survey respondents indicated that the NIS Directive had the follow ing impacts  on their activity related to the creation of sectoral IR capacities60:  • Provided additional f inancial support for security measures;  • Changed the structures and architectures of the existing cybersecurity measures; and  • Expanded the scope of  CSIRTs’ responsibilities.  The expansion of the scope of the CSIRTs’ responsibilities, combined w ith the provision of  additional f inancial support for new  security measures, appear to have encouraged the creation  of sector-specif ic IR capabilities.  Factors facilitating the development of sectoral CSIRTs  As Figure 2 show s, apart from the main reasons that lead to the creation of sectoral CSIRTs  and/or incident response capacities, there are also key factors facilitating their development.  58 7% of  responses were ‘Other’. This option was chosen when the question was not applicable to the survey respondent or  to prov ide additional information related to the options mentioned in the graph.  59 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport  60 Surv ey  for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021.

Q11.Based on your experience, what are the key factors facil itating the development of sectoral CSIRTs  and/or incident response capacities?  (N=15).  According to the survey respondents, the main enabling factors are the follow ing61:  • The dissemination of threat intelligence, exchange of good practice and lessons  learned (19% of responses): There is an emerging trend in w hich actors, and CSIRTs  in the same sector go beyond information sharing to organise IRC62. Sectoral actors  make use of existing reporting schemes such as the NIS Directive reporting and build  trusted sectoral communities of users, w hich can securely exchange both ex -ante and  ex-post incident information leveraging existing tools and automated solutions63.  • The establishment of sector-specific regulations clarifying the security  requirements and responsibilities (17% of responses): Sector specif ic regulations,  including guidelines and requirements for reporting and management of incidents, tend  to act as a key driver to enhance capabilities at the sectoral level64. An example of  sectoral regulation is Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)65, w hich  bound manufacturers of medical devices to consider cybersecurity risks w hen placing  product in the market.  61 The lessons learned from past incidents was already considered among the main reasons that lead to the creation of  sectoral CSIRTs, therefore, it has not been taken into consideration as a key facilitating factor.  62 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  63 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport/at_download/fullReport  64 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  65 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02017R0745-20200424  1 Please use f ootnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Sectoral actors can  benefit from the experience and know ledge of National and other Sectoral CSIRTs, for  instance, through the appointment of a liaison off icer, sharing of know -how , expert  advice or tailored training.67 A notew orthy initiative, pre-dating the NIS Directive, is that  of the Dutch NCSC, w hich provided incentives and guidelines to support the creation of  CERTs 68.  • The establishment of public-private partnership (11% of responses): Public-private  partnerships are also a tendency in some Member States, as they play a key role in  certain IR related activities. For instance, they can encourage the sharing of lessons  learned on the use of open-access or commercial tools, especially those automated  w ithin a specif ic sector to better benefit from each other’s experience and accelerate  the maturation of new ly created IR entities. How ever, desk research indicated that  among all the tasks under the scope of the CSIRTs, establishing cooperation  relationships w ith the private sector w as one of the tasks w ith the least allocated  time69.  Overall, from Figure 2, it appears that a blend of bottom up and top dow n incentives could lead  the w ay to the creation of sectoral CSIRTS and IR capabilities. Funding and the guidance of  National CSIRTs are as important as the cooperation and information sharing across sectoral  actors for the development of Sectoral CSIRTs70.  Table 2 presents the reasons and enabling factors that lead to the creation of a Health Sectoral  CSIRT in the Netherlands.  66 This f inding was confirmed by the answer provided by the survey respondents to the following question: Q13. Does your  organisation need / have you asked for any specific support or guidance from external stakeholders to design and  implement sectoral incident response capacities.The majority of the respondents (53%, 8 out of 15) reported that their  organisation asked for specific support or guidance from external stakeholders to design and implement sectoral incident  response capacities, in particular the support of National Authorities and CSIRT communities and peers.  67 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  68 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  69 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  70 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport/at_download/fullReport  1 Please use f ootnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

In 2017, all Dutch hospitals had show n to have  vulnerabilities in their systems. The most prominent risks w ere configuration errors and w ebsites  running on outdated softw are71. Z-CERT w as founded to overcome these IR w eaknesses and  provide specialised IR services to health care institutions. Z-CERT and National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) w ork together by sharing relevant information and data.  Today all hospitals (ranging from academic “UMCs”, top clinical “STZ” to “General” hospitals) as  w ell as mental health care institutions (\"GGZ\") can register w ith Z-CERT as a participant to the  Health Sectoral CSIRT constituency, and can, therefore, benefit from Z-CERT cyber security  protection and IR support and know ledge.72  It appears that the responsibilities and services of Z-CERT w ill be expanded in the near future.  COVID-19-related developments have accelerated Z-CERTs plans to implement Cyber Threat  Intelligence Capability as w ell as other projects to enhance the digital resilience of the Dutch Health  Care73.

NCSC w as only allow ed by law  to provide  services to operators of essential and vital services, as w ell to the central government.  Therefore, w ithout Z-CERT, the Dutch health care w ould not have access to relevant threat  intelligence, w hich w ere particularly in face of the increasing number of cyber attacked against  the health sector.  3.3 CSIRTS SERVICES  Health Sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide services more adapted to the sector’s  specificities and needs in addition to the generic services provided by National CSIRTs.  Depending on their mandate, Health Sectoral CSIRTs appear to offer the same kind of services  as the National CSIRTs. How ever, Health Sectoral CSIRTs seem to provide services that are  more f itted to the specif icities of the health sector.  According to the information gathered through the survey75, in comparison to National CSIRTs,  the Health Sectoral CSIRT provide the follow ing services, roles or functions:  71 https://www.cybersprint.com/news/cybersprints-study-leads-to-national-investigation-into-Health cares-cyber-security/  72 https://www.thehaguesecuritydelta.com/partners/partner/663-z-cert  73 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/z-cert-and-eclecticiq-cooperate-to-bring-benefits-of-cti-to-dutch-Health care- sector-301073185.html  74 https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0041520/2021-06-01  75 Surv ey for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021.

Overall, survey respondents believe that sectoral CSIRTs may offer deeper and more  specialised know ledge on sector-specif ic threats and operational technology, as w ell as broader  netw orking w ith sectoral bodies and organisations. Evidently, this observation also depends on  the scale and capabilities of the national CSIRT.  Considerations on proactive  approach to incident response in the health sector  Incident response in the health sector tends to be often reactive, i.e. aimed at responding to  threats or attacks against the CSIRT’s systems, rather than proactive, i.e. aimed at preventing  incidents and reduce their negative impact w hen they do occur. This reactive nature appears to  be due to an insuff icient communication and collaboration across different stakeholders of the  vulnerability ecosystem (national/sectoral CSIRTs, end clients, Operators of Essential  Services)76. To improve the current coordinated IRC to counteract threats, despite their reactive  nature and responsibilities, sectoral CSIRTs may be an important player. Sectoral CSIRTs are  indeed w ell placed to facilitate and encourage a more proactive approach to incident response,  as they seem to have in-depth know ledge and close relationships w ith the main sectoral  stakeholders at national level. They could also support the streamlining of information sharing,  especially w ith OESs, w hich w ould highly benefit from guidance, for instance, in the form of  guidelines and trainings, and exchange of know ledge and expertise77.  Table 3 show s the services provided by the Health Sectoral CSIRTs in the Netherlands in  comparison w ith the National CSIRTs. The services are presented per service categories  according to the FIRST CSIRT Services Framew ork78. The service categories considered are  the follow ing:  1. Information security event management: This category includes monitoring,  detection and event analysis services.  2. Information security incident management: This category refers to services, such  as information security incident report acceptance, information security incident  analysis, artifact and forensic evidence analysis, mitigation and recovery procedures,  information security incident coordination, and crisis management support.  3. Vulnerability management: These services encompass vulnerability discovery /  research, vulnerability report intake, vulnerability analysis, vulnerability coordination,  vulnerability disclosure, and lastly, vulnerability response.  4. Situational awareness: This category consists of the follow ing subtypes: analysis and  synthesis and communication.  5. Knowledge transfer: It involves aw areness building, training and education,  exercises, technical and policy advisory.  76 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  77 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-expertise-and-capabilities-development  78 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747%23figure2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-expertise-and-capabilities-development https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  21  Table 3: Case Study – Z-CERT - Specif ic mandate and services compared w ith those the  National CSIRT  Case study – The Netherlands  National CSIRT’s mandate  Health Sectoral CSIRT’s mandate (Z-CERT)  The NCSC is the competent national authority for  the implementation of the Netw ork and Information  Systems Security Act (Wbni), w hich has been in  force since 9 November 2018. The Wbni regulates  the statutory tasks of the NCSC in the f ield of  cybersecurity. Organisations in vital sectors are  obliged to report serious digital security incidents to  the NCSC.  Under the Wbni, the NCSC is the designated CSIRT  for vital providers and providers of essential  services (AEDs).  Z-CERT offers specialised services to health care  institutions w ith regards to optimal cyber security  protection and offers support in case an incident  has occurred. Z-CERT has in-depth know ledge of  medical applications, medical netw orks and  medical devices.  National CSIRT’s services Health Sectoral CSIRT’s services  Under the Wbni, the services offered by the NCSC  include:  Information Security Event Management  - Monitoring incidents at national level, w arning  providers early and disseminating information about  risks and incidents.  Information Security Incident Management  - Carrying out analyses and technical investigations  into threats and incidents.

As per the article 9 of the NIS Directive, CSIRTs are responsible for risk and incident handling in  accordance w ith w ell-defined process, supported by the adequate resources.81  3.4.1 Tools  There are 5 different types of possible tools according to the service they offer w ithin the scope  of CSIRTs’ responsibilities:  1. Information security event management tools. This type includes monitoring,  detection and event analysis tools.  2. Information security incident management tools. This area involves tools and  procedures such as information security incident report acceptance, information  security incident analysis, artifact and forensic evidence analysis, mitigation and  recovery procedures, information security incident coordination, and crisis  management support.  3. Vulnerability management tools . These services encompass vulnerability discovery /  research, vulnerability report intake, vulnerability analysis, vulnerability coordination,  vulnerability disclosure, and lastly, vulnerability response.  4. Situational awareness tools. This category consists of the follow ing subtypes:  analysis and synthesis and communication.  5. Knowledge transfer tools. It involves aw areness building, training and education,  exercises, technical and policy advisory tools.  The analysis of the CSIRTs through the survey offered the follow ing perspectives:  • On average, half of the respondents indicated that there is a tool operating for each of  the service (see Table 4 below ).  • In the cases w here there is not a tool in place, there is a plan to implement one quarter  of the cases.  • Notably, only the crisis management support services underscore compares to this  trend (only 33% of organisations have a tool in place).  79 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  80 https://www.z-cert.nl/english/  81 NIS Directive, Article 9.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://www.z-cert.nl/english/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  23  Table 4: Uptake of tools per service/function  Service area and Services  Tool in service  Planning to  implement one  Service Area 1 – Information security event Management  Monitoring and detection 60% 27%  Event analysis 47% 33%  Service Area 2 - Information security incident management  Information security incident report  acceptance  67% 7%  Information security incident analysis 60% 27%  Artifact and forensic evidence analysis 53% 20%  Mitigation and recovery 47% 13%  Information security incident coordination 60% 27%  Crisis management support 33% 33%  Service Area 3 - Vulnerability management  Vulnerability discovery / research 53% 27%  Vulnerability report intake 47% 27%  Vulnerability analysis 40% 27%  Vulnerability coordination 47% 33%  Vulnerability disclosure 40% 27%  Vulnerability response 40% 13%  Service area 4 – Situational awareness  Data acquisition 53% 27%  Analysis and synthesis 47% 33%  Communication 73% 13%  Service area 5 – Knowledge transfer  Aw areness building 53% 20%  Training & Education 53% 20%  Exercises 53% 20%  Technical and policy advisory 47% 27%  Source: Survey for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June  2021. Q24:  Which specif ic tools does your organisation rely on to conduct the follow ing  services? (N=15).  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  24  Furthermore, CSIRTs tools may be developed in-house, or a service/tool procured from  vendors.82 As it w ill be mentioned in section 3.6 on CSIRTs Challenges and Gaps, the use of  vendors’ solutions comes w ith its ow n specif ic challenges, such as the import of unforeseen  vulnerabilities in the tool. They w ill require additional efforts (on top of those for in-house  systems) for updates and patches to guarantee their safety/eff iciency.83 Moreover, it is  important to note that organisations that have few er resources are more likely to look at external  tools. This may lead to some type of incidental standardisation of security practices impacting  on the overall performance of externalised tools users.  When asked about the specif ic information exchange tools to enable the notif ication of  incidents, the stakeholders pointed that the most common ones w ere secure emails, Malw are  Information Sharing Platform and Threat Sharing (MISP) standard formats and technologies  and special government secured netw orks. This also implies their reliance on internet access,  obliging Health CSIRTs to have a minimum of tw o internet service providers or at least  redundant physical connections.84 Moreover, the stakeholders pointed out that, in the majority of  the cases, uptake by the National CSIRTs ensured the broader uptake of these tools and  procedures by their constituents.  Finally, according to the survey responses, the main resources and tools in place to support the  development of constituents’ IRC in the health sector are shared framew orks for incident  classif ication and threat modelling (24% of responses), training and education activities (24%),  and a netw ork of incident response actors at a national or sectoral level to exchange good  practices about information exchange, capabilities, cooperation (20%).

Q24:  Which specif ic tools does your organisation rely on to conduct the follow ing  services? (N=15).  3.4.2 Procedures  Beyond the existing types of tools in place, there are other variants that should be considered in  the analysis to guarantee a successful handling of incidents. The clarity and availability of the  procedures in place are key in the course of incident response; procedures for usage of the  tools should be alw ays w ritten dow n.  For instance, after the collection of the incident reported, CSIRTs ought to define and apply  some type of information classif ication86. Follow ing the incident classif ication, there should be a  formal document indicating the statistics on how  the handled incidents are created and  disclosed. 87 Within this context, an over complicated or imprecise plan w ill deter a sw ift reaction  to a cyberattack on an organisational level or prevent rising aw areness on potential  vulnerabilities across the sector or cross border.88  In this line, more than half of Health Sectoral CSIRTs offer clear procedures. In the consultation  process carried out w ithin the scope of this study, the stakeholders stressed that their  organisation had standard operating procedures (SOPs) that OESs’ teams should follow  in case  of incident in 67% of the cases. Moreover, 60% of respondents pointed that their organisation  made use of an incident notif ication template, available to all constituents, w hile only 40% did  not. In this context, according to the stakeholders consulted for this s tudy, the most recurrent  types of information reported through the different tools are root causes (20% of the cases), the  services affected (18% of the cases), and the description of the incident, w ith the indicators of  compromise (IOCs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) (in 16% of the cases).  This information compilation is important, as the use of a template indicates how  eff iciently and  easily the CSIRTs can categorise the information collected.  In relation to the incident response in cross-border crisis situations, w hile half of respondents  (47%) declared that there are specif ic procedures to address cross-border incidents, there is not  a clear trend on how  those are dealt w ith: in some cases, there is a sectoral or national  procedure, in other cases it is done through a third-party Point of Contact. Some of the specif ic  86 According to the NIS Directive, “To facilitate cooperation, CSIRTs shall promote the adoption and use of common or  standardised practices for: (i) incident and risk-handling procedures; (ii) incident, risk and information classification  schemes.”, which are defined by them.  87 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  88 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation pg 13.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  26  procedures mentioned by the respondents w ere the organisation of cross -border exercises or  the participation of a representative of the other country in the crisis response processes.  Furthermore, these stakeholders stressed that in 60% of the cases, their CSIRTs had specif ic  measures in place to inform the relevant actors (national authorities and OES) in neighbouring  countries about an incident that may impact them; 47% percent w ould inform other stakeholders  through a Point of Contact (a trusted third-party) w hile only 13% w ould rely on a direct contact  (communicating w ith relevant actors using their direct contact information, w ithout going through  an intermediary).  Notably, w hile these recommendations are universally applicable, each health CSIRT has  specif ic needs, w hich should be reflected in the tailoring of their tools and procedures. For that  reason, each team should have an in-house developer that takes into account the requirements  and suggestions that emerge from the team through their experience.89 Moreover, procedures  are dependent on w orkflow s. Thus, they should be designed consequently, for instance w ith  one procedure that f its all incidents reported, or various procedures for different types of  incidents.90  Lastly, another key element to consider is the usage and maintenance of the CSIRTs solutions:  tools and processes should be managed, tested, and updated in order to achieve full protection  against attacks, as w ell as complementary training should be provided for the personnel w ho  use them.91  3.5 IR MATURITY DEVELOPMENT  This study found out that the key forces driving CSIRT’s IR development are sector-  specific clarifications on the security requirements and responsibilities of the  organisations, and the exchange of IR related information.  The maturity of a CSIRT is defined as the measurement of its capability in terms of structure,  people, processes, and technologies. Its capabilities must guarantee that the organisation can  perform its activities and functions consistently, as w ell as being able to continuously develop  these capabilities.92  More in detail, ENISA has developed a maturity assessment model that can be used to evaluate  the capabilities of CSIRTs.93 Based on this maturity model, there are three pillars that greatly  influence the development of CSIRTs capabilities: the uninterrupted performance of tasks and  procedures, a w orkplace culture of continuous improvement of the CSIRT’s capabilities  (monitoring of tasks performance, for instance), and education and training continuously  provided to the team (to educate and also update the teams expertise). In addition, it is key to  put in place policies, procedures and w orkflows that support the team’s goals and tasks,  polished through real life application. Lastly, these pillars may only be attainable if  the CSIRT  fills in the follow ing prerequisites: it must have been operating for a w hile, have suff icient budget  and have a low  turn-over rate of staff members.  CSIRTs maturity can be measured and classif ied in three levels:  • Basic Maturity Level: the CSIRT coordinates handling of incidents, has a minimum  foundation in terms of their existence (mandate etc.), is easily reachable and has a  basic incident handling process in place.  89 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities  90 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities  91 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation pg 14  92 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities  93 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  27  • Intermediate Maturity Level: the CSIRT coordinates the handling of incidents, and  also allow s additional joint activities (like vulnerability handling), it has a mature  foundation, w ith detail descriptions of all relevant tools, processes, and human  aspects.  • Advanced Maturity Level: the CSIRT coordinates the handling of incidents, w hile also  reliably supports additional joint activities, such as sharing of threats and early -w arning  data, vulnerability handling. This implies that the CSIRT has w ell described, approved,  and actively assessed processes, tools, and human aspects.  The assessment model offers a clear image of a CSIRTs maturity. According to this model, the  average health CSIRT has achieved the Basic Maturity level and is close to achieve the  Intermediate level of maturity, only needing to formalise already existing procedures.94  Interestingly, more than 90 percent of all National CSIRTs or government teams w ith national  scope reached the Basic Maturity level as w ell, according to the model, on average being close  to reaching the Intermediate Maturity level.95  In the frame of the ENISA model, reaching the basic maturity level implies that the CSIRT  analysed is operational, w ith a basic functioning incident handling process in place, its contact  information available to other teams, fully functional in its other responsibilities, its services are  defined according to the RFC2350, and the team has reached an appropriate level of maturity.  These features are essential requirements for capacity building, collaboration w ith other CSIRTs  and to support the national landscape of CSIRT.96  How ever, the consultation carried out for this study revealed that only 40% of Health CSIRTs  use a specif ic CSIRT maturity assessment methodology to support the development of IRC  w ithin their sector. Within the 40% of stakeholders that use a specif ic CSIRT maturity  assessment methodology, the majority of them relied on the SIM3 model (Security Incident  Management Maturity Model), and to a lesser degree, the National CSIRT maturity tool  available in their country. All methodologies are seen as relevant to enhance the maturity of  CSIRTs. Moreover, they pointed that the key factors facilitating the maturity development of  Health CSIRTs and/or their IR capacities depend mainly on the follow ing:  • The establishment of sector-specif ic regulations clarifying the security requirements  and responsibilities (18% of responses);  • The dissemination of threat intelligence, exchange of good practice and lessons  learned (16% of responses); and  • To a lesser extent, the establishment of cooperation agreement betw een national and  sectoral actors (13% of responses).  Unsurprisingly, the survey respondents explained that they seek specif ic support or guidance  from external stakeholders to design and implement sectoral IR capacities in the majority of the  cases, mainly through CSIRT communities/peers, national authorities, and industry players.  Ultimately, both top-dow n and peer-to-peer support, in the form of training, tooling, and trusted  communication channels, is needed for CSIRTs to reach an intermediate level of maturity,  w hich requires further w ork on the organisational, human, tooling and process parameters. 97  94 In 80% of  organisations the scope of responsibility has been defined; In 87% of the cases the classification of the  incidents handled by the entities have been defined; Security policies have been stablished in 80% of the cases; The lev el  of  offer has been defined in 60% of the cases; The organisation approach to ensure the resilience of its personnel is  def ined on a 60 % of  the cases; 70% of organisations have trainings and only 8% guidelines for the personnel.  95 TI Accreditation was used as baseline for the Basic Maturity Level. https://www.trusted- introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  96 NIS Directive, Annex I (1a, 1c, 1e, 1f, 2a).  97 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  28  3.6 CSIRTS CHALLENGES AND GAPS  When it comes down to incident response, this study found out that the main challenges  faced by the health CSIRTs are the lack of security culture among OESs, the fact that  management (and the security) of OESs IT infrastructure is often outsourced, and the  lack of established cooperation tools and channels w ith OESs incident response teams.  3.6.1 OESs cybersecurity challenges  In general, health care operators face some specif ic complications in the realm of cybersecurity  and IR, due to the nature of their services. Consequently, these barriers also impac t the w ork  and eff iciency of health CSIRTs in fulf illing their responsibilities. Below , the main challenges  faced by health care providers are presented in more detail.  Equipment: legacy systems and lack of cybersecurity by design  Traditional sectors, including health care, are more vulnerable to cyberattacks health care  operations and equipment have a long-lasting lifetime (15 years on average), they w ere not  conventionally designed to deal w ith malicious acts from the beginning of the product life  cycle98, w hile at the same time the Information Technology cycles have continuously shorten in  the past decades.99  These have resulted in a constant grow ing number of vulnerabilities founded in digital device  providers and hardw are manufacturers, forcing hospitals  to update and adapt their systems in a  very short span of time, accumulating vulnerabilities as a result of the IT layer obsolescence  through their lifecycle. Hence, the pace of updates is quickly outrun by the pace of IT  technology evolution. Moreover, this vendor dependence is accentuated by the IoT device  adoption taking place in health care providers, leading to an endpoint complexity that expands  greatly the areas that can be attacked.100 The fact that this array of devices is closely  interconnected only exacerbates the risk and potential impact of the threats. At the same time,  practitioners usually circumvent security in order to deliver better care to patients.101  In this line, some recurrent problems are inappropriate encryption configurations, and the  incapacity for safe health information sharing and exchange w ith third-party and cross-border  partners (there are no sophisticated data security tools in the health industry).102  Organisational complexity meets incident reporting  Closely linked to the previous section, organisational complexity challenges the cybersecurity of  health providers. The large supply chain of the health care ecosystem involves many  stakeholders, w hich leads to potential cascade effects in the middle of a crisis. Concretely,  existing organisational silos as w ell as excessive disparities among members of the hospital are  recurrent risks.103  Moreover, the coordination of an incident response is highly affected by this complexity. In the  course of an incident, overcomplicated response plans that involve many stakeholders delay the  effectiveness of the procedure, as each team member is not alw ays aw are of their role in the  process. As a result, the health sector tends to have a time lag betw een an attack and its  detection.104  98 https://www.jmir.org/2018/5/e10059?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0  99 https://www.forrester.com/report/Best+Practices+Medical+Device+Security/-/E-RES132003#  100 https://www.forrester.com/report/Best+Practices+Medical+Device+Security/-/E-RES132003#  101 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  102 https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01161-7  103 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-r  104 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation  1 Please use f ootnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

It is notew orthy to mention again the H-ISAC, as it facilitates  know ledge transfer across the w orld through educational summits, w ebinars, w orkshops and  w hite papers, supporting in this w ay the exchange of information and the building of  relationships that may contribute to make the health sector more resilient and proactive in the  face of future cyberattacks. 105 How ever, w hile H-ISAC has shifted its focus tow ards an  international approach in 2018106, effort is still needed to increase and maintain the exchange of  information across health care stakeholders.  Lack of expertise  There is a lack of suff iciently skilled experts in the health care industry.107 In general IT security  experts are hard to f ind,108 w hile dealing w ith an incident can be challenging if the team is not  mature or does not know  how  to best use a tool.109 For instance, buying the most protective  equipment w ill not shield an operator from cyberattacks if it is used inadequately due to the fact  that the personnel has not been trained.  Lack of security awareness  There is low  aw areness on cyber risks in the health sector, and its potential impact on the  organisation.110 Concretely, health practitioners are not aw are of the consequences of cyber  risky behaviour, due to the lack of policies and reinforcement of secure behaviour. Through the  pandemic, w hile digitalisation increased in all sectors, there w ere no increase on cybersecurity  procedures, or guidance on revised procedures and technologies. This lack of aw areness is  partly due to an inadequate board-level risk communication in the hospitals.111  Uninterrupted functioning systems  It is challenging to implement certain cybersecurity procedures in real time in the health sector,  w ithout shutting dow n the equipment. And continuous monitoring coverage or shutdow ns of the  systems are not easily implemented. For instance, few  health care IT infrastructures could be  shut dow n w ithout serious impact on the patients’ life (and hence the functioning of the hospitals  or health care facilities).112  3.6.2 Health CSIRT Challenges  Within this landscape, the Health CSIRTs consulted for this study stressed that the main  challenges faced w hen collaborating w ith OESs in the health sector are usually the follow ing, in  order of importance:  • Lack of security culture among operators of essential services;  • The management and the security of operators of essential services IT infrastructure  is often outsourced;  • Lack of established cooperation tools and channels w ith operators of essential  services incident response teams;  • No 24/7 coverage / capabilities; and  • Resources or expertise issues.  Unsurprisingly, all the challenges listed by the consulted Health CSIRTs are closely linked to or  referred directly to the challenges faced by the OESs themselves.113 To a lesser extent, supply  105 https://h-isac.org/  106 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html  107 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  108 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  109 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  110 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  111 https://www.jmir.org/2018/5/e10059?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0  112 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  113 https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01161-7  https://h-isac.org/ https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747%23figure2 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1/language-en https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2 https://www.jmir.org/2018/5/e10059?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2 https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01161-7  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  30  chain management and confidentiality issues w ere also listed by the consulted stakeholders as  particular challenges.  Notably, 60% of  consulted stakeholders pointed to the absence of a specif ic Health Sectoral  CSIRTs, hence in these cases there are no overlaps betw een the responsibilities and services  offered by the National CSIRTs, and the ones offered by Health Sectoral CSIRTs. Only 13% of  interview ees pointed to an existing overlap betw een National and Health Sectoral CSIRTs.  In parallel to the overlaps, they also referred to the gap betw een the responsibilities and  services offered by the National CSIRTs and the responsibilities and services offered by Health  Sectoral CSIRTs: the stakeholders stressed that “the main gap is that National CSIRT have  more coordination functions and they have a different constituency”. Particularly, the Health  CSIRTs address all potential victims of cyberattacks from the health care industry, including  non-essential services such as social health care. Other stakeholders pointed to the gap of  information, as Health CSIRTs can only share information in its industry across the National  one, creating delays or even under informing the other Health CSIRTs stakeholders.  Regarding the internal w ork of the CSIRTs, respondents to the consultation also explained that  recurrent personnel-related challenges in the context of incident response teams include lack of  know ledge and skills and high personnel rotation, w hile organisational-related challenges in the  context of incident response activities usually involve also lack of personnel, and of formal  definition of responsibilities and duties.  3.7 CSIRTS LESSONS LEARNED  73% of stakeholders w ho participated on the survey stressed the support received from  groups/forums to exchange w ith peers IR information, good practices, and experience in the  health sector. These types of information are key for the enhancement of sectoral IR capacity-  building. Some stakeholders suggested that they often communicate w ith the EU institutions,  bodies, and agencies to share information. Some other forums mentioned are international  groups such as the CSIRTs Netw ork Members.  In the same line, the respondents suggested that existing capacity-building initiatives  implemented at European level related to information sharing tools, and aw areness raising  actions in relation to security incidents, are very useful for improving the effectiveness of the  Health CSIRTs, particularly their IR capacities. Moreover, the stakeholders also pointed to more  guidance on the use of vendor health care systems.  Regarding specif ic tools/ processes in place in their organisation that w ould help improve the  effectiveness of sector IR capacities in other Health CSIRTs, respondents to the survey pointed  to the follow ing:  • Policy and procedure trainings and exercises;  • Vulnerability response tools; and  • Information sharing actions.  Finally, stakeholders pointed tow ards the creation of public-private-partnership programs, that  w ould help create a common vision among OESs and CSIRTs, minimising the lack of trust  among players.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  31  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  4.1 INTRODUCTION  Overall, this study has found that Health sectoral CSIRTs are still scarce in a landscape w here  health OESs need specialised support in their incident response activities. Moreover, the  insights shared by the consulted parties stressed the great potential of Health CSIRTs in  offering this support, in particular, in information sharing initiatives.  Based on this key area of opportunity, and the needs expressed by the OESs, the follow ing  recommendations have clearly emerged across the study:  4.2 RECOMMENDATION 1: ENHANCE AND FACILITATE THE CREATION  OF HEALTH SECTORAL CSIRTS  While there is a trend in developing sectoral CSIRTs and sector-w ide CSIRTs collaborations by  the health OESs, still few  governments have Health CSIRTs or intend to create one. In general,  incident response capabilities are handled by the main OESs and supervised by the  national/governmental CSIRT, leaving the IR coordination and information sharing activities to  parties w ith less expertise on this niche: the intersection betw een cybersecurity and health care.  Active efforts should be placed in facilitating funding, guidance - in relation to capacity  building, information sharing, awareness raising - and cooperation to guarantee the  creation of Health Sectoral CSIRTs .  Recommendation aimed at: National Cybersecurity Authorities.  4.3 RECOMMENDATION 2: CAPITALISE ON THE EXPERTISE OF THE  HEALTH CSIRTS FOR HELPING OESS DEVELOP THEIR IR  CAPABILITIES  OESs stressed the need for guidance, direction and capability building w hen it comes dow n to  incident response; one concrete challenge is that incident response in the health sector tends to  often rely more on reactive services rather than proactive ones, due to a lack of a coordinated  incident response capacity to counteract threats. Concretely, OESs need help identifying  lessons learned from past incidents w ithin the sector. At the same time, the lack of sector-  specif ic know ledge of the National CSIRT prevents them from executing this coordination role to  the best of the health OESs interest, leaving an unfulf illed role that Health CSIRTs can take on.  For these reasons, Health CSIRTs should be empowered to gain the role of supporting  OESs w.r.t. incident response, encouraging the organisation and pool of incident  response capabilities, and facilitating a more proactive approach to incident response in  general.  Recommendation aimed at: National Cybersecurity Authorities, Sectoral and/or National  CSIRTs.  Ideally, this role w ould include the follow ing responsibilities: promotion of specialised services to  handle sector-specif ic threats, vulnerabilities and incidents; dissemination of specif ic know ledge  and expertise on medical devices, medical IT systems, as w ell as threats and incidents related  to the health sector in real time; provide sectoral expertise to the National CSIRT; assist  nonregulated operators in the health sector on incident response; coordination for multi-site  compromised systems in the health sector; and vulnerability coordination w ith vendors of sector -  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  32  specif ic systems / devices. These activities address the core challenges of both health OESs  and CSIRTs. Furthermore, the fulf ilment of these activities w ill require strong efforts from the  Health CSIRTs, as w ell as development of expertise and cooperation w ith national/international  CSIRTs.  In order to achieve this, the follow ing measures may enhance health CSIRTs capabilities:  establishing sector-specif ic regulations clarifying the security requirements and responsibilities  (such as guidelines and requirements for reporting and management of incidents); the  establishment of cooperation agreement betw een national and sectoral actors (through the  appointment of a liaison off icer, sharing of know -how , expert advice or tailored training);  establishing a direct and f luent communication channel w ith the OESs; and the use of public -  private partnerships, w hich can accelerate the maturity of Health CSIRTs and OESs IR  capabilities. Linked to this, this study found that Health CSIRTs have an opportunity to reach an  Intermediate Maturity Level on its IR capabilities by formalising their existing procedures.  4.4 RECOMMENDATION 3: EMPOWER HEALTH CSIRTS ROLE ON  INFORMATION SHARING ACTIVITIES  In the same line, the last recommendation stresses the importance of empow ering Health  CSIRTs on the information sharing across OESs.  The organic emergence of Health CSIRTs, such as the Health Information Sharing and Analysis  Centre (H-ISAC), points tow ards OESs’ strong need for information exchange, bypassing  national centralised systems that do not have sector-specif ic know ledge and that may create  unnecessary extra steps in the information sharing process.  Health CSIRTs could have a role in breaking dow n the barriers associated to incident  information sharing, w hich are specially complicated in the health care industry. Concretely,  Health CSIRTs should be supported on the development of this information exchange  activities, which among others should include: dissemination of threat intelligence (both  ex-ante and ex-post incident information), exchange of good practice and lessons  learned, and information regarding trainings and exercises for the capacity building of  OESs .  Recommendation aimed at: National Cybersecurity Authorities, CSIRTs Network,  Sectoral and/or National CSIRTs.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  33  5. BIBLIOGRAPHY  Argaw , S.

BIBLIOGRAPHY 33  A ANNEX: SURVEY – QUESTIONNAIRE 37  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In recent years, digitalisation has turned everything into something connected and smarter.  How ever, w hile creating numerous opportunities for the European economy and society,  technologies bring forw ard several new  challenges. According to a recent study 1, cyber threats  increase year over year, as the popularity of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things  (IoT), Artif icial Intelligence (AI), big data, the large use of cloud computing, as w ell as connected  devices, provide copious w ays to invade an organisation.  An attack directed at a critical infrastructure, such as a hospital, can lead to physical damages  and put the lives of patients at risk2. Therefore, there is a need for solid Incident Response  Capabilities (IRC) in the health sector, in particular health care settings (including hospitals and  private clinics). This sector indeed faces threats along its entire supply chain w ith potentially  disastrous societal consequences for a multiplicity of stakeholders (citizens, public authorities,  regulators, professional associations, large industries, SMEs), w hich become even more  vulnerable in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This report focuses on sectoral CSIRT capabilities status and development w ithin the health  sector since the implementation of the NIS Directive. The aim of the report is to offer insights on  current incident response (IR) trends in order to draw  practical recommendations about the  development of IR capabilities in the health sector.  KEY FINDING  Based on a methodological approach, a series of f indings is identif ied, as follow s:  Key Finding #1 The main entity in charge of Incident Response in the health sector are  National CSIRTs. Health Sectoral CSIRTs are still an exception across  Member States. How ever, there is a strong trend in developing sector-  w ide CSIRTs collaborations, w hich include, but are not limited, to  information sharing.  Key Finding #2 The creation of sector-specif ic IRC in the health sector appears to be  the result of the lack of sector-specif ic know ledge of the National  CSIRT, as w ell as lesson learned from past incidents, and the  implementation of the NIS Directive.  Key Finding #3 National Health Sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide services more  adapted to the sector’s specif icities and needs in addition to the generic  services provided by National CSIRTs.  Key Finding #4 According to the respondents to the survey, the main resources and  tools in place to support the development of constituents’ IRC in the  health sector are shared framew orks for incident classif ication and  threat modelling, training and education activities and a netw ork of IR  actors.  1 https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/the-2020-cyber-security-report/  2 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/18/prosecutors-open-homicide-case-after-cyber-attack-on-german- hospital  https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/the-2020-cyber-security-report/ https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/18/prosecutors-open-homicide-case-after-cyber-attack-on-german-hospital https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/18/prosecutors-open-homicide-case-after-cyber-attack-on-german-hospital  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  4  Key Finding #5 This study found out that the key forces driving CSIRTs’ IR  development are sector-specif ic clarif ications on the security  requirements and responsibilities of the organisations, and the  exchange of IR related information.  Key Finding #6 When it comes dow n to IR, this study found out that the main  challenges faced by the health CSIRTs are the lack of security culture  among operators of essential services (OESs), the fact that  management (and the security) of OESs IT infrastructure is often  outsourced, and the lack of established cooperation tools and channels  w ith OES incident response teams.  The study makes the following recommendations:  • Enhance and facilitate the creation of healthcare sectoral  CSIRTs.  • Capitalise on the expertise of the healthcare CSIRTs for helping  Operators of Essential Services (OESs) develop their IR  capabilities.  • Empow er healthcare CSIRTs role on information sharing  activities.

OVERVIEW AND SCOPE OF  THE STUDY  1.1 CONTEXT OF THE STUDY  The volume and intensity of cyberattacks  on the health sector increased in 202034 (e.g.,  Ryuk ransomw are5; shut dow n of the UVM Health Netw ork6). Health care organisations in  general and hospitals in particular have been a major target for cybercrime, primarily because of  the value of data that can be obtained from an attack, as w ell as its disruptive impact7.  The cyber threats are now  increasingly visible  to executive committees, boards, politicians  and citizens. It is now  mandatory for companies, governments, and citizens to think about and  act upon cybersecurity8. To face such threats, Member States and public and private entities  must strengthen their Incident Response (IR) capabilities and the coordination betw een  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT).  As critical infrastructure and services, health care organisations, including hospitals and private  clinics must be prepared to face such cyber-attacks. Disruption of their services would lead  to fundamental impact on both governments and populations .  Nevertheless, the number of highly technical-skilled cybersecurity experts is insuff icient. To f ill  the gap betw een the demand and the human resources available, the public and the private  sector have started to w ork together to create new  training programmes and certif ications for  cybersecurity experts / IR experts. ENISA has also been w orking on the European  Cybersecurity Skills Framew ork9. These new  experts led to the multiplication of response teams  (CSIRT) for both the public and the private sector.  Regarding this evolution of CSIRTs in the health sector, some new  topics may emerge in w hich  ENISA w ill be a key player. On one hand, ENISA supports the NIS Directive enforcement as  the Secretariat of the CSIRT Network , tasked to actively support the CSIRTs cooperation,  provide the secretariat and active support for incident coordination upon request. ENISA also  supports sectorial CSIRTs in the standardisation of exchanges and monitoring specif ic sectorial  threats at national/European scale.  On the other hand, ENISA works to strengthen public and private relationships within the  health sector  by building a trust circle at European scale. For example, by setting up a  collaboration platform dedicated to EU Member States and fostering relevant information  sharing and analysis initiatives Several R&D initiatives at team levels need to be steered at  European level to foster cross-CSIRTs developments, at least w ith guidelines about IR/Threat  Intelligence priorities for EU.  3 ENISA Threat Landscape 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-in-the-health care-sector-during-covid-19-pandemic  5 https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/politics/hospitals-targeted-ransomware-attacks/index.html  6 https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/inside-uvm-medical-center-s-ransomware-attack-11-details.html  7 https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-health care-institutions-with- ransomware  8 https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/fr/pdf/2019/04/fr-complying-with-the-eu-nis-directive.pdf  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-in-the-health%20care-sector-during-covid-19-pandemic https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/politics/hospitals-targeted-ransomware-attacks/index.html https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/inside-uvm-medical-center-s-ransomware-attack-11-details.html https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-health%20care-institutions-with-ransomware https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-health%20care-institutions-with-ransomware https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/fr/pdf/2019/04/fr-complying-with-the-eu-nis-directive.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  7  In this context of rapid grow th of CSIRTs in Europe, this study supports ENISA and Member  States tow ards a better understanding of sectorial CSIRTs and their current IR capabilities, on  w hich they rely in case of major and systemic cyber-attack. The objectives of the study are  explained in more detail in the follow ing section.  1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  This study aims to support the understanding of the status and development of sectoral  healthcare CSIRTs across EU10. The conclusions of the study should help ENISA and Member  States to identify and draw conclusions about the development of incident handling and  response (IR) w ithin the health sector  follow ing the implementation of the NIS Directive.  The study looks into potential gaps, overlaps and challenges  in the services offered as w ell  as in the procedures, processes and tools  in place. More specif ically the study provides an  overview  of the key factors facilitating or hindering the development of sectoral CSIRTs in this  particular sector, as w ell as the specif ic resources and tools in place to support the development  of IRC in the health sector.  The main objectives of this study are the follow ing:  • To collect data on the current IRC in the health care sector;  • To analyse gathered information to assess current sectorial capabilities,  services, processes, tools and cooperation mechanisms; and  • To draw  conclusions and recommendations  based on the key aspects facilitating  and or hindering IR procedures.  The study aimed to collect relevant information in order to provide the follow ing:  • Statistics of distribution of services offered to constituency by CSIRTs and other IR  entities;  • Analysis of the tools used (e.g., open source / commercial / homemade) and their  distribution w ithin CSIRTs and other IR entities;  • Analysis of the IR setup (e.g., central, distributed, hybrid, etc.) and the resources  needed to provide services (e.g., number of resources, skillset, etc.);  • Analysis of gaps and overlaps in services, processes, tools, resources, especially  betw een CSIRTs and other IR entities w ithin the health sector;  • Description of existing policies and guidelines applicable to IR;  • Good practices and lesson learned; and  • Conclusions and recommendations for the development of CSIRTs and other IR  entities.  The study f indings may also support ENISA w ith the delivery of the Output 8.2 of “ENISA  single programming document 2021-2023” Activity 8: ‘Provide targeted as well as general  reports, recommendations, analysis and other actions on future cybersecurity scenarios and  threat landscapes (incident response landscape mapping for NIS Directive sectors)’ .  To achieve the project objectives, a solid methodological approach w as proposed based on  desktop research and an online questionnaire  distributed to EU National CSIRTs and  Sectoral CSIRTs as w ell as OES Incident Response Teams. The methodological approach is  further explained under section 2.  10 Health care prov iders as defined in point (g) of Article 3 of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the  Council.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0024  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  8  2. METHODOLOGY AND DATA  COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  This Chapter describes the methodological approach taken for identifying, collecting and  analysing data on IR development and capabilities in the health care sector.  2.1.1.1 Definition of the research focus for the data collection  The scope of the research and the focus for data collection w as mainly on the operational  domain as outlined by ENISA based on current needs and previous w ork already conducted on  IR. At this stage it w as also decided that the data collection methods w ould be mainly desktop  research and an online survey.  2.1.1.2 Desktop research on the health sector IRC  A literature review  w as conducted to investigate all aspects of IR responsibilities w ithin the  health sector for CSIRTs and other entities in each EU Member State. The desktop research  w as guided by the need to:  • identify the relevant bodies and/or organisations  that play a role in the f ield of IR  capabilities w ithin the health sector in the European Union; and  • analyse the IR responsibilities of the different stakeholders, focusing on the  operational aspects of IR.  While conducting desktop research w e review ed previous ENISA publications, policy  documents, national strategies and other documents and reports made available by CSIRTs,  National Cybersecurity Centres, and the European Commission. Additionally, studies carried out  by technology research, strategic research companies, and academic researchers w ere  consulted. The activities at this stage also included informal consultation w ith IR experts.  2.1.1.3 Designing and testing the online survey  Based on the categorisation of public available information, w e w ere able to identify gaps and  additional information needed to be collected to complement desk research. As such, a  questionnaire w as designed and made available online in order to collect relevant data on IR  setup, and related services, procedures, processes and tools. The survey also covered the  main enabling and hindering factors for establishing sectoral CSIRTs as w ell as the specif ic  resources and tools in place to support the development of incident response capabilities (IRC)  in the health sector.  Before being distributed to stakeholders the online questionnaire w as extensively tested to  ensure that the questions addressed the study objectives and that they are clear, coherent, and  covered all relevant aspects of IR capabilities in the health sector. The f inal version of the  questionnaire is available in Annex A: Survey – questionnaire .  2.1.1.4 Conducting the survey  Upon validation, the questionnaire w as uploaded on EU Survey and the link w as distributed by  ENISA to the members of the CSIRTs Netw ork (CNW), the CyCLONe Netw ork, and the NIS  Cooperation Group. The survey included an introduction to the objectives of the study,  instructions on how  to respond to the questionnaire, and a privacy statement.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  9  The survey w as available online for four w eeks.

A total of 15  responses w ere provided representing 12 Member States.  2.1.1.5 Analysis and identification of recommendations  We performed an analysis of the raw  data collected from the desktop research and the survey  w hich w ere aggregated in a structured matrix. This preliminary analysis allow ed the mapping of  the key f indings of the study.  2.1.1.6 Final report  Final remarks and/or feedback from the pool of experts that w ere used to validate the study (the  study w as distributed for validation to the same group of stakeholders to w hich the survey w as  distributed) w ere incorporated in the f inal report.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  10  3. KEY FINDINGS  3.1 IRC SET-UP AND LANDSCAPE  The main entity in charge of incident response in the health sector are National CSIRTs.  Health Sectoral CSIRTs are still an exception across Member States11. However, there is a  trend in developing sector-wide CSIRTs collaborations, which include, but are not limited,  to information sharing.12  The results of desk research and the survey targeting relevant bodies and organisations that play  a role in the f ield of incident response capabilities w ithin the EU health sector13 show s that:  • 22 out of 27 Member States have no Health Sectoral CSIRTs, but 214 have plans to  create one in the near future;  • 2 Member States15 are currently setting up a Health CSIRT at national level; and  • 3 Member States16 have a Health Sectoral CSIRT at national level. Among these Health  Sectoral CSIRT, 2 (CERT Santé and HealthNet) w ere created respectively by the French  and Luxembourgish government; meanw hile, Z-CERT, the Dutch Health Sectoral  CSIRT, w as developed specif ically for institutions in the healthcare sector.  In addition to Z-CERT, the data collected highlight that an increasing number of sectoral CSIRTs  is being created by operators of essential services 17. Evidence of this trend is HelseCERT,  Norw ay health and care sector's national centre for cyber security18. Although Norw ay is not a  member of the European Union, HelseCERT is an interesting Health Sectoral CSIRT to mention  among the CSIRTs operating in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.

This applies in particular to countries  w ith a centralised incident response model, w hich do not plan to develop specif ic  sectoral CSIRT capabilities since IR tend to be managed by the OES and supervised  by the National CSIRT or governmental CSIRT53.  • For three54 Member States, dedicated sectoral CSIRTs coordinate incident response at  national level, supervised by the National CSIRT.  To conclude, it is w orth mentioning the existence of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis  Centre (H-ISAC). H-ISAC is a global, non-profit, member-driven organisation offering health  care stakeholders a trusted community and forum for coordinating, collaborating and sharing  vital physical and cyber threat intelligence and best practices w ith each other55. Launched in  2010 in the US, H-ISAC dropped its national focus in favour of an international one in 201856.  Now adays H-ISAC facilitates know ledge transfer across the w orld through educational summits,  w ebinars, w orkshops and w hite papers, supporting in this w ay the exchange of information and  the building of relationships that may contribute to make the health sector more resilient and  proactive in the face of future cyberattacks.  H-ISAC is not an isolated initiative. There is a multiplication of ISACs and netw orks to foster  information exchange and increase aw areness among stakeholders w ithin a sector, even for  sectors than are not defined in the NIS Directive 57.  3.2 CREATION OF SECTORAL CSIRTS  The creation of sector-specific IR capacities in the health sector appears to be the result  of the lack of sector-specific knowledge of the National CSIRT, as well as lessons learned  from past incidents, and the implementation of the NIS Directive.  Figure 1 presents the f indings of the survey (all respondents provided an answ er) in relation to  the key reasons that motivated Member States to create sector-specif ic incident response  capacities in the health sector.  53 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  54 Luxembourg, France, and the Netherlands.  55 https://h-isac.org/  56 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html  57 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://h-isac.org/ https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  16  Figure 1: Reasons to create sector-specif ic IR capacities58  Source: Survey for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021. Q6.  What are the key reasons to create such sector-specific incident response capacities? (N=15).  The need to overcome the lack of sector-specif ic know ledge or capacity of the National CSIRT  appears to be the most relevant reason behind the creation of sector specif ic IR capacities  (27% of responses). Similarly, ‘The diff iculties in managing the cybersecurity incidents in the  NIS Directive sectors’ (14% of responses), together w ith the ‘Lessons learned from past  incidents’ (14% of responses), highlighted the need for sector-specif ic IR capacities in the  health sector, according to the survey respondents.  How ever, the second most important reason w ith 18% of responses is the implementation of the  NIS Directive. This confirms the ENISA finding related to the sector-specif ic capabilities of the  Energy and Air transport sectors59: European legislation has an important and positive impact in  pushing actors to develop sectoral capacities.  In particular, the survey respondents indicated that the NIS Directive had the follow ing impacts  on their activity related to the creation of sectoral IR capacities60:  • Provided additional f inancial support for security measures;  • Changed the structures and architectures of the existing cybersecurity measures; and  • Expanded the scope of  CSIRTs’ responsibilities.  The expansion of the scope of the CSIRTs’ responsibilities, combined w ith the provision of  additional f inancial support for new  security measures, appear to have encouraged the creation  of sector-specif ic IR capabilities.  Factors facilitating the development of sectoral CSIRTs  As Figure 2 show s, apart from the main reasons that lead to the creation of sectoral CSIRTs  and/or incident response capacities, there are also key factors facilitating their development.  58 7% of  responses were ‘Other’. This option was chosen when the question was not applicable to the survey respondent or  to prov ide additional information related to the options mentioned in the graph.  59 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport  60 Surv ey  for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021.

Q11.Based on your experience, what are the key factors facil itating the development of sectoral CSIRTs  and/or incident response capacities?  (N=15).  According to the survey respondents, the main enabling factors are the follow ing61:  • The dissemination of threat intelligence, exchange of good practice and lessons  learned (19% of responses): There is an emerging trend in w hich actors, and CSIRTs  in the same sector go beyond information sharing to organise IRC62. Sectoral actors  make use of existing reporting schemes such as the NIS Directive reporting and build  trusted sectoral communities of users, w hich can securely exchange both ex -ante and  ex-post incident information leveraging existing tools and automated solutions63.  • The establishment of sector-specific regulations clarifying the security  requirements and responsibilities (17% of responses): Sector specif ic regulations,  including guidelines and requirements for reporting and management of incidents, tend  to act as a key driver to enhance capabilities at the sectoral level64. An example of  sectoral regulation is Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)65, w hich  bound manufacturers of medical devices to consider cybersecurity risks w hen placing  product in the market.  61 The lessons learned from past incidents was already considered among the main reasons that lead to the creation of  sectoral CSIRTs, therefore, it has not been taken into consideration as a key facilitating factor.  62 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  63 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport/at_download/fullReport  64 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  65 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02017R0745-20200424  1 Please use f ootnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Sectoral actors can  benefit from the experience and know ledge of National and other Sectoral CSIRTs, for  instance, through the appointment of a liaison off icer, sharing of know -how , expert  advice or tailored training.67 A notew orthy initiative, pre-dating the NIS Directive, is that  of the Dutch NCSC, w hich provided incentives and guidelines to support the creation of  CERTs 68.  • The establishment of public-private partnership (11% of responses): Public-private  partnerships are also a tendency in some Member States, as they play a key role in  certain IR related activities. For instance, they can encourage the sharing of lessons  learned on the use of open-access or commercial tools, especially those automated  w ithin a specif ic sector to better benefit from each other’s experience and accelerate  the maturation of new ly created IR entities. How ever, desk research indicated that  among all the tasks under the scope of the CSIRTs, establishing cooperation  relationships w ith the private sector w as one of the tasks w ith the least allocated  time69.  Overall, from Figure 2, it appears that a blend of bottom up and top dow n incentives could lead  the w ay to the creation of sectoral CSIRTS and IR capabilities. Funding and the guidance of  National CSIRTs are as important as the cooperation and information sharing across sectoral  actors for the development of Sectoral CSIRTs70.  Table 2 presents the reasons and enabling factors that lead to the creation of a Health Sectoral  CSIRT in the Netherlands.  66 This f inding was confirmed by the answer provided by the survey respondents to the following question: Q13. Does your  organisation need / have you asked for any specific support or guidance from external stakeholders to design and  implement sectoral incident response capacities.The majority of the respondents (53%, 8 out of 15) reported that their  organisation asked for specific support or guidance from external stakeholders to design and implement sectoral incident  response capacities, in particular the support of National Authorities and CSIRT communities and peers.  67 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  68 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  69 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  70 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport/at_download/fullReport  1 Please use f ootnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

In 2017, all Dutch hospitals had show n to have  vulnerabilities in their systems. The most prominent risks w ere configuration errors and w ebsites  running on outdated softw are71. Z-CERT w as founded to overcome these IR w eaknesses and  provide specialised IR services to health care institutions. Z-CERT and National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) w ork together by sharing relevant information and data.  Today all hospitals (ranging from academic “UMCs”, top clinical “STZ” to “General” hospitals) as  w ell as mental health care institutions (\"GGZ\") can register w ith Z-CERT as a participant to the  Health Sectoral CSIRT constituency, and can, therefore, benefit from Z-CERT cyber security  protection and IR support and know ledge.72  It appears that the responsibilities and services of Z-CERT w ill be expanded in the near future.  COVID-19-related developments have accelerated Z-CERTs plans to implement Cyber Threat  Intelligence Capability as w ell as other projects to enhance the digital resilience of the Dutch Health  Care73.

NCSC w as only allow ed by law  to provide  services to operators of essential and vital services, as w ell to the central government.  Therefore, w ithout Z-CERT, the Dutch health care w ould not have access to relevant threat  intelligence, w hich w ere particularly in face of the increasing number of cyber attacked against  the health sector.  3.3 CSIRTS SERVICES  Health Sectoral CSIRTs tend to provide services more adapted to the sector’s  specificities and needs in addition to the generic services provided by National CSIRTs.  Depending on their mandate, Health Sectoral CSIRTs appear to offer the same kind of services  as the National CSIRTs. How ever, Health Sectoral CSIRTs seem to provide services that are  more f itted to the specif icities of the health sector.  According to the information gathered through the survey75, in comparison to National CSIRTs,  the Health Sectoral CSIRT provide the follow ing services, roles or functions:  71 https://www.cybersprint.com/news/cybersprints-study-leads-to-national-investigation-into-Health cares-cyber-security/  72 https://www.thehaguesecuritydelta.com/partners/partner/663-z-cert  73 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/z-cert-and-eclecticiq-cooperate-to-bring-benefits-of-cti-to-dutch-Health care- sector-301073185.html  74 https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0041520/2021-06-01  75 Surv ey for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June 2021. Q8. In your opinion, what are  the specific services, roles or functions of the Sectoral CSIRTs in contrast to national, governmental or military CSIRTs?  N=15.  https://www.z-cert.nl/english/ https://www.cybersprint.com/news/cybersprints-study-leads-to-national-investigation-into-healthcares-cyber-security/ https://www.cybersprint.com/news/cybersprints-study-leads-to-national-investigation-into-healthcares-cyber-security/ https://www.thehaguesecuritydelta.com/partners/partner/663-z-cert https://www.cybersprint.com/news/cybersprints-study-leads-to-national-investigation-into-Health%20cares-cyber-security/ https://www.thehaguesecuritydelta.com/partners/partner/663-z-cert https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/z-cert-and-eclecticiq-cooperate-to-bring-benefits-of-cti-to-dutch-Health%20care-sector-301073185.html https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/z-cert-and-eclecticiq-cooperate-to-bring-benefits-of-cti-to-dutch-Health%20care-sector-301073185.html https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0041520/2021-06-01  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  20  • Specialised services to handle sector-specif ic threats, vulnerabilities and incidents;  • Specif ic know ledge and expertise on medical devices, medical IT systems, as w ell as  threats and incidents related to the health sector;  • Providing sectoral expertise to the National CSIRT;  • Assisting nonregulated operators in the health sector on incident response;  • Coordination for multi-site compromised systems in the health sector; and  • Vulnerability coordination w ith vendors of sector-specif ic systems / devices.  Overall, survey respondents believe that sectoral CSIRTs may offer deeper and more  specialised know ledge on sector-specif ic threats and operational technology, as w ell as broader  netw orking w ith sectoral bodies and organisations. Evidently, this observation also depends on  the scale and capabilities of the national CSIRT.  Considerations on proactive  approach to incident response in the health sector  Incident response in the health sector tends to be often reactive, i.e. aimed at responding to  threats or attacks against the CSIRT’s systems, rather than proactive, i.e. aimed at preventing  incidents and reduce their negative impact w hen they do occur. This reactive nature appears to  be due to an insuff icient communication and collaboration across different stakeholders of the  vulnerability ecosystem (national/sectoral CSIRTs, end clients, Operators of Essential  Services)76. To improve the current coordinated IRC to counteract threats, despite their reactive  nature and responsibilities, sectoral CSIRTs may be an important player. Sectoral CSIRTs are  indeed w ell placed to facilitate and encourage a more proactive approach to incident response,  as they seem to have in-depth know ledge and close relationships w ith the main sectoral  stakeholders at national level. They could also support the streamlining of information sharing,  especially w ith OESs, w hich w ould highly benefit from guidance, for instance, in the form of  guidelines and trainings, and exchange of know ledge and expertise77.  Table 3 show s the services provided by the Health Sectoral CSIRTs in the Netherlands in  comparison w ith the National CSIRTs. The services are presented per service categories  according to the FIRST CSIRT Services Framew ork78. The service categories considered are  the follow ing:  1. Information security event management: This category includes monitoring,  detection and event analysis services.  2. Information security incident management: This category refers to services, such  as information security incident report acceptance, information security incident  analysis, artifact and forensic evidence analysis, mitigation and recovery procedures,  information security incident coordination, and crisis management support.  3. Vulnerability management: These services encompass vulnerability discovery /  research, vulnerability report intake, vulnerability analysis, vulnerability coordination,  vulnerability disclosure, and lastly, vulnerability response.  4. Situational awareness: This category consists of the follow ing subtypes: analysis and  synthesis and communication.  5. Knowledge transfer: It involves aw areness building, training and education,  exercises, technical and policy advisory.  76 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  77 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-expertise-and-capabilities-development  78 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747%23figure2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-expertise-and-capabilities-development https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework_v2.1  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  21  Table 3: Case Study – Z-CERT - Specif ic mandate and services compared w ith those the  National CSIRT  Case study – The Netherlands  National CSIRT’s mandate  Health Sectoral CSIRT’s mandate (Z-CERT)  The NCSC is the competent national authority for  the implementation of the Netw ork and Information  Systems Security Act (Wbni), w hich has been in  force since 9 November 2018. The Wbni regulates  the statutory tasks of the NCSC in the f ield of  cybersecurity. Organisations in vital sectors are  obliged to report serious digital security incidents to  the NCSC.  Under the Wbni, the NCSC is the designated CSIRT  for vital providers and providers of essential  services (AEDs).  Z-CERT offers specialised services to health care  institutions w ith regards to optimal cyber security  protection and offers support in case an incident  has occurred. Z-CERT has in-depth know ledge of  medical applications, medical netw orks and  medical devices.  National CSIRT’s services Health Sectoral CSIRT’s services  Under the Wbni, the services offered by the NCSC  include:  Information Security Event Management  - Monitoring incidents at national level, w arning  providers early and disseminating information about  risks and incidents.  Information Security Incident Management  - Carrying out analyses and technical investigations  into threats and incidents.  Vulnerability Management  - Responding to incidents that are reported  voluntarily or mandatorily and assist AEDs and parts  of central government in taking measures to  guarantee the continuity of their services.  Situational awareness  - Maintaining cooperative contacts w ith the private  sector.  Knowledge Transfer  - Sharing information w ith organisations tasked w ith  informing other organisations or the public about  threats and incidents, and computer crisis teams.  Information Security Event Management  - Sending out alerts regarding possible threats and  current attacks.  - Checking periodically participants’ IP addresses  and domain names for multiple blacklists (viruses,  w orms, botnets, etc.).  Information Security Incident Management  - Conducting forensic research into the Modus  Operandi, in order to minimize technical and  f inancial damage as w ell as any reputation risk.  Vulnerability Management  - Immediately informing the participant(s) and offer  advice in case viruses, w orms, and botnets.  - Offering advice on the approach and best  resolution method of the incident.  Situational Awareness  - Informing its participants of any vulnerabilities  detected in medical devices, medical netw orks  and medical applications.  Knowledge Transfer  - Sharing know ledge w ith its participants.  - Facilitating meetings for its participants, as w ell  as hosts netw ork events and theme sessions.

As per the article 9 of the NIS Directive, CSIRTs are responsible for risk and incident handling in  accordance w ith w ell-defined process, supported by the adequate resources.81  3.4.1 Tools  There are 5 different types of possible tools according to the service they offer w ithin the scope  of CSIRTs’ responsibilities:  1. Information security event management tools. This type includes monitoring,  detection and event analysis tools.  2. Information security incident management tools. This area involves tools and  procedures such as information security incident report acceptance, information  security incident analysis, artifact and forensic evidence analysis, mitigation and  recovery procedures, information security incident coordination, and crisis  management support.  3. Vulnerability management tools . These services encompass vulnerability discovery /  research, vulnerability report intake, vulnerability analysis, vulnerability coordination,  vulnerability disclosure, and lastly, vulnerability response.  4. Situational awareness tools. This category consists of the follow ing subtypes:  analysis and synthesis and communication.  5. Knowledge transfer tools. It involves aw areness building, training and education,  exercises, technical and policy advisory tools.  The analysis of the CSIRTs through the survey offered the follow ing perspectives:  • On average, half of the respondents indicated that there is a tool operating for each of  the service (see Table 4 below ).  • In the cases w here there is not a tool in place, there is a plan to implement one quarter  of the cases.  • Notably, only the crisis management support services underscore compares to this  trend (only 33% of organisations have a tool in place).  79 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  80 https://www.z-cert.nl/english/  81 NIS Directive, Article 9.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://www.z-cert.nl/english/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  23  Table 4: Uptake of tools per service/function  Service area and Services  Tool in service  Planning to  implement one  Service Area 1 – Information security event Management  Monitoring and detection 60% 27%  Event analysis 47% 33%  Service Area 2 - Information security incident management  Information security incident report  acceptance  67% 7%  Information security incident analysis 60% 27%  Artifact and forensic evidence analysis 53% 20%  Mitigation and recovery 47% 13%  Information security incident coordination 60% 27%  Crisis management support 33% 33%  Service Area 3 - Vulnerability management  Vulnerability discovery / research 53% 27%  Vulnerability report intake 47% 27%  Vulnerability analysis 40% 27%  Vulnerability coordination 47% 33%  Vulnerability disclosure 40% 27%  Vulnerability response 40% 13%  Service area 4 – Situational awareness  Data acquisition 53% 27%  Analysis and synthesis 47% 33%  Communication 73% 13%  Service area 5 – Knowledge transfer  Aw areness building 53% 20%  Training & Education 53% 20%  Exercises 53% 20%  Technical and policy advisory 47% 27%  Source: Survey for assessing incident response capabilities in the health sector, ENISA, June  2021. Q24:  Which specif ic tools does your organisation rely on to conduct the follow ing  services? (N=15).  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  24  Furthermore, CSIRTs tools may be developed in-house, or a service/tool procured from  vendors.82 As it w ill be mentioned in section 3.6 on CSIRTs Challenges and Gaps, the use of  vendors’ solutions comes w ith its ow n specif ic challenges, such as the import of unforeseen  vulnerabilities in the tool. They w ill require additional efforts (on top of those for in-house  systems) for updates and patches to guarantee their safety/eff iciency.83 Moreover, it is  important to note that organisations that have few er resources are more likely to look at external  tools. This may lead to some type of incidental standardisation of security practices impacting  on the overall performance of externalised tools users.  When asked about the specif ic information exchange tools to enable the notif ication of  incidents, the stakeholders pointed that the most common ones w ere secure emails, Malw are  Information Sharing Platform and Threat Sharing (MISP) standard formats and technologies  and special government secured netw orks. This also implies their reliance on internet access,  obliging Health CSIRTs to have a minimum of tw o internet service providers or at least  redundant physical connections.84 Moreover, the stakeholders pointed out that, in the majority of  the cases, uptake by the National CSIRTs ensured the broader uptake of these tools and  procedures by their constituents.  Finally, according to the survey responses, the main resources and tools in place to support the  development of constituents’ IRC in the health sector are shared framew orks for incident  classif ication and threat modelling (24% of responses), training and education activities (24%),  and a netw ork of incident response actors at a national or sectoral level to exchange good  practices about information exchange, capabilities, cooperation (20%).

Q24:  Which specif ic tools does your organisation rely on to conduct the follow ing  services? (N=15).  3.4.2 Procedures  Beyond the existing types of tools in place, there are other variants that should be considered in  the analysis to guarantee a successful handling of incidents. The clarity and availability of the  procedures in place are key in the course of incident response; procedures for usage of the  tools should be alw ays w ritten dow n.  For instance, after the collection of the incident reported, CSIRTs ought to define and apply  some type of information classif ication86. Follow ing the incident classif ication, there should be a  formal document indicating the statistics on how  the handled incidents are created and  disclosed. 87 Within this context, an over complicated or imprecise plan w ill deter a sw ift reaction  to a cyberattack on an organisational level or prevent rising aw areness on potential  vulnerabilities across the sector or cross border.88  In this line, more than half of Health Sectoral CSIRTs offer clear procedures. In the consultation  process carried out w ithin the scope of this study, the stakeholders stressed that their  organisation had standard operating procedures (SOPs) that OESs’ teams should follow  in case  of incident in 67% of the cases. Moreover, 60% of respondents pointed that their organisation  made use of an incident notif ication template, available to all constituents, w hile only 40% did  not. In this context, according to the stakeholders consulted for this s tudy, the most recurrent  types of information reported through the different tools are root causes (20% of the cases), the  services affected (18% of the cases), and the description of the incident, w ith the indicators of  compromise (IOCs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) (in 16% of the cases).  This information compilation is important, as the use of a template indicates how  eff iciently and  easily the CSIRTs can categorise the information collected.  In relation to the incident response in cross-border crisis situations, w hile half of respondents  (47%) declared that there are specif ic procedures to address cross-border incidents, there is not  a clear trend on how  those are dealt w ith: in some cases, there is a sectoral or national  procedure, in other cases it is done through a third-party Point of Contact. Some of the specif ic  86 According to the NIS Directive, “To facilitate cooperation, CSIRTs shall promote the adoption and use of common or  standardised practices for: (i) incident and risk-handling procedures; (ii) incident, risk and information classification  schemes.”, which are defined by them.  87 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  88 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation pg 13.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  26  procedures mentioned by the respondents w ere the organisation of cross -border exercises or  the participation of a representative of the other country in the crisis response processes.  Furthermore, these stakeholders stressed that in 60% of the cases, their CSIRTs had specif ic  measures in place to inform the relevant actors (national authorities and OES) in neighbouring  countries about an incident that may impact them; 47% percent w ould inform other stakeholders  through a Point of Contact (a trusted third-party) w hile only 13% w ould rely on a direct contact  (communicating w ith relevant actors using their direct contact information, w ithout going through  an intermediary).  Notably, w hile these recommendations are universally applicable, each health CSIRT has  specif ic needs, w hich should be reflected in the tailoring of their tools and procedures. For that  reason, each team should have an in-house developer that takes into account the requirements  and suggestions that emerge from the team through their experience.89 Moreover, procedures  are dependent on w orkflow s. Thus, they should be designed consequently, for instance w ith  one procedure that f its all incidents reported, or various procedures for different types of  incidents.90  Lastly, another key element to consider is the usage and maintenance of the CSIRTs solutions:  tools and processes should be managed, tested, and updated in order to achieve full protection  against attacks, as w ell as complementary training should be provided for the personnel w ho  use them.91  3.5 IR MATURITY DEVELOPMENT  This study found out that the key forces driving CSIRT’s IR development are sector-  specific clarifications on the security requirements and responsibilities of the  organisations, and the exchange of IR related information.  The maturity of a CSIRT is defined as the measurement of its capability in terms of structure,  people, processes, and technologies. Its capabilities must guarantee that the organisation can  perform its activities and functions consistently, as w ell as being able to continuously develop  these capabilities.92  More in detail, ENISA has developed a maturity assessment model that can be used to evaluate  the capabilities of CSIRTs.93 Based on this maturity model, there are three pillars that greatly  influence the development of CSIRTs capabilities: the uninterrupted performance of tasks and  procedures, a w orkplace culture of continuous improvement of the CSIRT’s capabilities  (monitoring of tasks performance, for instance), and education and training continuously  provided to the team (to educate and also update the teams expertise). In addition, it is key to  put in place policies, procedures and w orkflows that support the team’s goals and tasks,  polished through real life application. Lastly, these pillars may only be attainable if  the CSIRT  fills in the follow ing prerequisites: it must have been operating for a w hile, have suff icient budget  and have a low  turn-over rate of staff members.  CSIRTs maturity can be measured and classif ied in three levels:  • Basic Maturity Level: the CSIRT coordinates handling of incidents, has a minimum  foundation in terms of their existence (mandate etc.), is easily reachable and has a  basic incident handling process in place.  89 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities  90 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities  91 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation pg 14  92 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities  93 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-capabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  27  • Intermediate Maturity Level: the CSIRT coordinates the handling of incidents, and  also allow s additional joint activities (like vulnerability handling), it has a mature  foundation, w ith detail descriptions of all relevant tools, processes, and human  aspects.  • Advanced Maturity Level: the CSIRT coordinates the handling of incidents, w hile also  reliably supports additional joint activities, such as sharing of threats and early -w arning  data, vulnerability handling. This implies that the CSIRT has w ell described, approved,  and actively assessed processes, tools, and human aspects.  The assessment model offers a clear image of a CSIRTs maturity. According to this model, the  average health CSIRT has achieved the Basic Maturity level and is close to achieve the  Intermediate level of maturity, only needing to formalise already existing procedures.94  Interestingly, more than 90 percent of all National CSIRTs or government teams w ith national  scope reached the Basic Maturity level as w ell, according to the model, on average being close  to reaching the Intermediate Maturity level.95  In the frame of the ENISA model, reaching the basic maturity level implies that the CSIRT  analysed is operational, w ith a basic functioning incident handling process in place, its contact  information available to other teams, fully functional in its other responsibilities, its services are  defined according to the RFC2350, and the team has reached an appropriate level of maturity.  These features are essential requirements for capacity building, collaboration w ith other CSIRTs  and to support the national landscape of CSIRT.96  How ever, the consultation carried out for this study revealed that only 40% of Health CSIRTs  use a specif ic CSIRT maturity assessment methodology to support the development of IRC  w ithin their sector. Within the 40% of stakeholders that use a specif ic CSIRT maturity  assessment methodology, the majority of them relied on the SIM3 model (Security Incident  Management Maturity Model), and to a lesser degree, the National CSIRT maturity tool  available in their country. All methodologies are seen as relevant to enhance the maturity of  CSIRTs. Moreover, they pointed that the key factors facilitating the maturity development of  Health CSIRTs and/or their IR capacities depend mainly on the follow ing:  • The establishment of sector-specif ic regulations clarifying the security requirements  and responsibilities (18% of responses);  • The dissemination of threat intelligence, exchange of good practice and lessons  learned (16% of responses); and  • To a lesser extent, the establishment of cooperation agreement betw een national and  sectoral actors (13% of responses).  Unsurprisingly, the survey respondents explained that they seek specif ic support or guidance  from external stakeholders to design and implement sectoral IR capacities in the majority of the  cases, mainly through CSIRT communities/peers, national authorities, and industry players.  Ultimately, both top-dow n and peer-to-peer support, in the form of training, tooling, and trusted  communication channels, is needed for CSIRTs to reach an intermediate level of maturity,  w hich requires further w ork on the organisational, human, tooling and process parameters. 97  94 In 80% of  organisations the scope of responsibility has been defined; In 87% of the cases the classification of the  incidents handled by the entities have been defined; Security policies have been stablished in 80% of the cases; The lev el  of  offer has been defined in 60% of the cases; The organisation approach to ensure the resilience of its personnel is  def ined on a 60 % of  the cases; 70% of organisations have trainings and only 8% guidelines for the personnel.  95 TI Accreditation was used as baseline for the Basic Maturity Level. https://www.trusted- introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  96 NIS Directive, Annex I (1a, 1c, 1e, 1f, 2a).  97 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  28  3.6 CSIRTS CHALLENGES AND GAPS  When it comes down to incident response, this study found out that the main challenges  faced by the health CSIRTs are the lack of security culture among OESs, the fact that  management (and the security) of OESs IT infrastructure is often outsourced, and the  lack of established cooperation tools and channels w ith OESs incident response teams.  3.6.1 OESs cybersecurity challenges  In general, health care operators face some specif ic complications in the realm of cybersecurity  and IR, due to the nature of their services. Consequently, these barriers also impac t the w ork  and eff iciency of health CSIRTs in fulf illing their responsibilities. Below , the main challenges  faced by health care providers are presented in more detail.  Equipment: legacy systems and lack of cybersecurity by design  Traditional sectors, including health care, are more vulnerable to cyberattacks health care  operations and equipment have a long-lasting lifetime (15 years on average), they w ere not  conventionally designed to deal w ith malicious acts from the beginning of the product life  cycle98, w hile at the same time the Information Technology cycles have continuously shorten in  the past decades.99  These have resulted in a constant grow ing number of vulnerabilities founded in digital device  providers and hardw are manufacturers, forcing hospitals  to update and adapt their systems in a  very short span of time, accumulating vulnerabilities as a result of the IT layer obsolescence  through their lifecycle. Hence, the pace of updates is quickly outrun by the pace of IT  technology evolution. Moreover, this vendor dependence is accentuated by the IoT device  adoption taking place in health care providers, leading to an endpoint complexity that expands  greatly the areas that can be attacked.100 The fact that this array of devices is closely  interconnected only exacerbates the risk and potential impact of the threats. At the same time,  practitioners usually circumvent security in order to deliver better care to patients.101  In this line, some recurrent problems are inappropriate encryption configurations, and the  incapacity for safe health information sharing and exchange w ith third-party and cross-border  partners (there are no sophisticated data security tools in the health industry).102  Organisational complexity meets incident reporting  Closely linked to the previous section, organisational complexity challenges the cybersecurity of  health providers. The large supply chain of the health care ecosystem involves many  stakeholders, w hich leads to potential cascade effects in the middle of a crisis. Concretely,  existing organisational silos as w ell as excessive disparities among members of the hospital are  recurrent risks.103  Moreover, the coordination of an incident response is highly affected by this complexity. In the  course of an incident, overcomplicated response plans that involve many stakeholders delay the  effectiveness of the procedure, as each team member is not alw ays aw are of their role in the  process. As a result, the health sector tends to have a time lag betw een an attack and its  detection.104  98 https://www.jmir.org/2018/5/e10059?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0  99 https://www.forrester.com/report/Best+Practices+Medical+Device+Security/-/E-RES132003#  100 https://www.forrester.com/report/Best+Practices+Medical+Device+Security/-/E-RES132003#  101 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  102 https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01161-7  103 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-r  104 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/strategies-for-incident-response-and-cyber-crisis-cooperation  1 Please use f ootnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

It is notew orthy to mention again the H-ISAC, as it facilitates  know ledge transfer across the w orld through educational summits, w ebinars, w orkshops and  w hite papers, supporting in this w ay the exchange of information and the building of  relationships that may contribute to make the health sector more resilient and proactive in the  face of future cyberattacks. 105 How ever, w hile H-ISAC has shifted its focus tow ards an  international approach in 2018106, effort is still needed to increase and maintain the exchange of  information across health care stakeholders.  Lack of expertise  There is a lack of suff iciently skilled experts in the health care industry.107 In general IT security  experts are hard to f ind,108 w hile dealing w ith an incident can be challenging if the team is not  mature or does not know  how  to best use a tool.109 For instance, buying the most protective  equipment w ill not shield an operator from cyberattacks if it is used inadequately due to the fact  that the personnel has not been trained.  Lack of security awareness  There is low  aw areness on cyber risks in the health sector, and its potential impact on the  organisation.110 Concretely, health practitioners are not aw are of the consequences of cyber  risky behaviour, due to the lack of policies and reinforcement of secure behaviour. Through the  pandemic, w hile digitalisation increased in all sectors, there w ere no increase on cybersecurity  procedures, or guidance on revised procedures and technologies. This lack of aw areness is  partly due to an inadequate board-level risk communication in the hospitals.111  Uninterrupted functioning systems  It is challenging to implement certain cybersecurity procedures in real time in the health sector,  w ithout shutting dow n the equipment. And continuous monitoring coverage or shutdow ns of the  systems are not easily implemented. For instance, few  health care IT infrastructures could be  shut dow n w ithout serious impact on the patients’ life (and hence the functioning of the hospitals  or health care facilities).112  3.6.2 Health CSIRT Challenges  Within this landscape, the Health CSIRTs consulted for this study stressed that the main  challenges faced w hen collaborating w ith OESs in the health sector are usually the follow ing, in  order of importance:  • Lack of security culture among operators of essential services;  • The management and the security of operators of essential services IT infrastructure  is often outsourced;  • Lack of established cooperation tools and channels w ith operators of essential  services incident response teams;  • No 24/7 coverage / capabilities; and  • Resources or expertise issues.  Unsurprisingly, all the challenges listed by the consulted Health CSIRTs are closely linked to or  referred directly to the challenges faced by the OESs themselves.113 To a lesser extent, supply  105 https://h-isac.org/  106 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html  107 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  108 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  109 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  110 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  111 https://www.jmir.org/2018/5/e10059?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0  112 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2  113 https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01161-7  https://h-isac.org/ https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nh-isac-changes-name-to-health-isac-h-isac-300706786.html https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747%23figure2 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3b6ad641-d23c-11eb-ac72-01aa75ed71a1/language-en https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2 https://www.jmir.org/2018/5/e10059?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0 https://www.jmir.org/2021/4/e21747#figure2 https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01161-7  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  30  chain management and confidentiality issues w ere also listed by the consulted stakeholders as  particular challenges.  Notably, 60% of  consulted stakeholders pointed to the absence of a specif ic Health Sectoral  CSIRTs, hence in these cases there are no overlaps betw een the responsibilities and services  offered by the National CSIRTs, and the ones offered by Health Sectoral CSIRTs. Only 13% of  interview ees pointed to an existing overlap betw een National and Health Sectoral CSIRTs.  In parallel to the overlaps, they also referred to the gap betw een the responsibilities and  services offered by the National CSIRTs and the responsibilities and services offered by Health  Sectoral CSIRTs: the stakeholders stressed that “the main gap is that National CSIRT have  more coordination functions and they have a different constituency”. Particularly, the Health  CSIRTs address all potential victims of cyberattacks from the health care industry, including  non-essential services such as social health care. Other stakeholders pointed to the gap of  information, as Health CSIRTs can only share information in its industry across the National  one, creating delays or even under informing the other Health CSIRTs stakeholders.  Regarding the internal w ork of the CSIRTs, respondents to the consultation also explained that  recurrent personnel-related challenges in the context of incident response teams include lack of  know ledge and skills and high personnel rotation, w hile organisational-related challenges in the  context of incident response activities usually involve also lack of personnel, and of formal  definition of responsibilities and duties.  3.7 CSIRTS LESSONS LEARNED  73% of stakeholders w ho participated on the survey stressed the support received from  groups/forums to exchange w ith peers IR information, good practices, and experience in the  health sector. These types of information are key for the enhancement of sectoral IR capacity-  building. Some stakeholders suggested that they often communicate w ith the EU institutions,  bodies, and agencies to share information. Some other forums mentioned are international  groups such as the CSIRTs Netw ork Members.  In the same line, the respondents suggested that existing capacity-building initiatives  implemented at European level related to information sharing tools, and aw areness raising  actions in relation to security incidents, are very useful for improving the effectiveness of the  Health CSIRTs, particularly their IR capacities. Moreover, the stakeholders also pointed to more  guidance on the use of vendor health care systems.  Regarding specif ic tools/ processes in place in their organisation that w ould help improve the  effectiveness of sector IR capacities in other Health CSIRTs, respondents to the survey pointed  to the follow ing:  • Policy and procedure trainings and exercises;  • Vulnerability response tools; and  • Information sharing actions.  Finally, stakeholders pointed tow ards the creation of public-private-partnership programs, that  w ould help create a common vision among OESs and CSIRTs, minimising the lack of trust  among players.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  31  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  4.1 INTRODUCTION  Overall, this study has found that Health sectoral CSIRTs are still scarce in a landscape w here  health OESs need specialised support in their incident response activities. Moreover, the  insights shared by the consulted parties stressed the great potential of Health CSIRTs in  offering this support, in particular, in information sharing initiatives.  Based on this key area of opportunity, and the needs expressed by the OESs, the follow ing  recommendations have clearly emerged across the study:  4.2 RECOMMENDATION 1: ENHANCE AND FACILITATE THE CREATION  OF HEALTH SECTORAL CSIRTS  While there is a trend in developing sectoral CSIRTs and sector-w ide CSIRTs collaborations by  the health OESs, still few  governments have Health CSIRTs or intend to create one. In general,  incident response capabilities are handled by the main OESs and supervised by the  national/governmental CSIRT, leaving the IR coordination and information sharing activities to  parties w ith less expertise on this niche: the intersection betw een cybersecurity and health care.  Active efforts should be placed in facilitating funding, guidance - in relation to capacity  building, information sharing, awareness raising - and cooperation to guarantee the  creation of Health Sectoral CSIRTs .  Recommendation aimed at: National Cybersecurity Authorities.  4.3 RECOMMENDATION 2: CAPITALISE ON THE EXPERTISE OF THE  HEALTH CSIRTS FOR HELPING OESS DEVELOP THEIR IR  CAPABILITIES  OESs stressed the need for guidance, direction and capability building w hen it comes dow n to  incident response; one concrete challenge is that incident response in the health sector tends to  often rely more on reactive services rather than proactive ones, due to a lack of a coordinated  incident response capacity to counteract threats. Concretely, OESs need help identifying  lessons learned from past incidents w ithin the sector. At the same time, the lack of sector-  specif ic know ledge of the National CSIRT prevents them from executing this coordination role to  the best of the health OESs interest, leaving an unfulf illed role that Health CSIRTs can take on.  For these reasons, Health CSIRTs should be empowered to gain the role of supporting  OESs w.r.t. incident response, encouraging the organisation and pool of incident  response capabilities, and facilitating a more proactive approach to incident response in  general.  Recommendation aimed at: National Cybersecurity Authorities, Sectoral and/or National  CSIRTs.  Ideally, this role w ould include the follow ing responsibilities: promotion of specialised services to  handle sector-specif ic threats, vulnerabilities and incidents; dissemination of specif ic know ledge  and expertise on medical devices, medical IT systems, as w ell as threats and incidents related  to the health sector in real time; provide sectoral expertise to the National CSIRT; assist  nonregulated operators in the health sector on incident response; coordination for multi-site  compromised systems in the health sector; and vulnerability coordination w ith vendors of sector -  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  32  specif ic systems / devices. These activities address the core challenges of both health OESs  and CSIRTs. Furthermore, the fulf ilment of these activities w ill require strong efforts from the  Health CSIRTs, as w ell as development of expertise and cooperation w ith national/international  CSIRTs.  In order to achieve this, the follow ing measures may enhance health CSIRTs capabilities:  establishing sector-specif ic regulations clarifying the security requirements and responsibilities  (such as guidelines and requirements for reporting and management of incidents); the  establishment of cooperation agreement betw een national and sectoral actors (through the  appointment of a liaison off icer, sharing of know -how , expert advice or tailored training);  establishing a direct and f luent communication channel w ith the OESs; and the use of public -  private partnerships, w hich can accelerate the maturity of Health CSIRTs and OESs IR  capabilities. Linked to this, this study found that Health CSIRTs have an opportunity to reach an  Intermediate Maturity Level on its IR capabilities by formalising their existing procedures.  4.4 RECOMMENDATION 3: EMPOWER HEALTH CSIRTS ROLE ON  INFORMATION SHARING ACTIVITIES  In the same line, the last recommendation stresses the importance of empow ering Health  CSIRTs on the information sharing across OESs.  The organic emergence of Health CSIRTs, such as the Health Information Sharing and Analysis  Centre (H-ISAC), points tow ards OESs’ strong need for information exchange, bypassing  national centralised systems that do not have sector-specif ic know ledge and that may create  unnecessary extra steps in the information sharing process.  Health CSIRTs could have a role in breaking dow n the barriers associated to incident  information sharing, w hich are specially complicated in the health care industry. Concretely,  Health CSIRTs should be supported on the development of this information exchange  activities, which among others should include: dissemination of threat intelligence (both  ex-ante and ex-post incident information), exchange of good practice and lessons  learned, and information regarding trainings and exercises for the capacity building of  OESs .  Recommendation aimed at: National Cybersecurity Authorities, CSIRTs Network,  Sectoral and/or National CSIRTs.  CSIRT CAPABILITIES IN HEALTHCARE SECTOR  NOVEMBER 2021  33  5. BIBLIOGRAPHY  Argaw , S.

    "abstract": "An attack directed at a critical infrastructure, such as a hospital, can lead to physical damages and put the lives of patients at risk. Therefore, there is a need for solid Incident Response Capabilities (IRC) in the health sector, in particular health care settings (including hospitals and private clinics). This report focuses on sectoral CSIRT capabilities status and development within the health sector since the implementation of the NIS Directive. The aim of the report is to offer insights on current incident response (IR) trends in order to draw practical recommendations about the development of IR capabilities in the health sector."

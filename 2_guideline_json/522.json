However, the adoption  approach is not yet mature. The vast majority of Financial Institutions (FIs) still rely on in-house  infrastructure.  Finance sector Institutions and supervisory authorities seem to have a clear view of the financial and  technical benefits connected to the adoption of both Public and Private Cloud1 deployment models, but they  remain cautious about the risk of losing control over information assets.  The most common approach used by FIs is a Hybrid of Private and Public Cloud. Even then, the services most  often migrated to the cloud are test environments and email management2. Financial Institutions consider  that Private Cloud is a better overall fit for the financial market due to privacy and compliance concerns.  Private Cloud is certainly favoured by the National Financial Supervisory Authorities (NFSAs), as it provides  more control over data and operations.  In creating this report we analysed input from a number of different sources to better understand the usage  of cloud services in the finance sector. Based on the analysis we provide recommendations to financial  institutions, regulators and cloud service providers about what we believe should be done to support secure  adoption of cloud services in the finance sector.  As with business sectors even less critical than the finance sector, loss of control and compliance top the FIs’  and regulators’ list of risks. Whether the risk is perceived or real, this certainly poses challenges for the cloud  market players to address. Those challenges include the ability to:   Manage the governance and compliance risk   Provide better tools for contract/SLAs negotiation (especially for smaller financial institutions)   Increase the level of transparency of the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)   Increase the information understanding of cloud security in NFSAs and FIs   Clarify the differences between outsourcing and cloud computing   Push the NFSAs to provide more guidance on cloud adoption   Improve currently available security and privacy certification schemes  From the information collected through the surveys and interviews, it appears that the most pressing short- term issues for promoting the adoption of cloud services are:   Reducing the information gap. Neither FIs nor NFSAs consider security as a main benefit of cloud  services, despite the fact that security is considered a very important factor by CSPs, and by expert  bodies including ENISA, which has published reports (e.g., the ENISA Cloud Risk Assessment)  describing the security benefits of cloud computing. Furthermore, in many instances regulators do  not differentiate between outsourcing and cloud computing.  1 Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds, ENISA (2013)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good- practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  2 \"Cloud computing - statistics on the use by enterprises\", Eurostat (2014) http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  6   Providing clearer and fit for purpose regulatory guidance. That CSPs, FIs and NFSAs have such  different views and understandings of the relevance of national regulations for the cloud computing  seems to confirm that the financial market needs better guidance and communication between the  players.   Simplifying and streamlining compliance. Further guidance from NFSAs would facilitate the  adoption of cloud services in the finance sector while meeting the regulatory requirements. Various  FIs find ENISA’s Cloud Computing Security Risk Assessment3 as a helpful tool for developing a  corporate risk assessment for cloud computing.  In the longer term, some NFSAs fear a systemic failure stemming from the use of cloud computing by pan- European banking groups in connection to global cloud providers that offer services to multiple financial  institutions. Such a risk of failure calls for stronger coordination and collaboration between NFSAs, and a  more open dialogue with FIs and CSPs.  In terms of mitigating actions, while FIs are relying on SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001, PCI DSS, some are also  leveraging ENISA’s cloud computing security risk assessment, which helps them identify key risks associated  with Cloud and what actions to take.  CSPs report that for FIs, sometimes the biggest obstacle to cloud adoption is misconceptions about the  technology. In fact, many EU NFSAs tend to block cloud usage, since they judge that CSPs are not sufficiently  transparent. Therefore, it encourages CSPs to strive for transparency and help customers understanding the  security implications of various cloud offerings.  In this study we provide the following recommendations:   NFSAs, FIs and CSPs to cooperate on extending the national good practices and standards in the  areas of Cloud governance and risk management   NFSAs to define practices and standards for incident information sharing   NFSAs to define minimum security requirements for adoption of Cloud computing in FIs   FIs to develop a Cloud strategy in order to define their approach to Cloud computing   CSPs to continue their efforts to provide transparency and assurance to NFSAs and FIs   EU institutions in cooperation with CSPs to create information campaigns to better inform both  regulators and FIs about the security risks and opportunities connected to the use of cloud  computing   EU institutions in cooperation with NFSAs to continue their work on harmonizing the legal and  regulatory environment within the European Union  This study presents not just challenges and issues, but also some significant success stories that will be of  good guidance and an example for those FIs, supervisory authorities and CSPs that are still at the beginning  of their journey towards cloud. One conclusion we can derive from our surveys and analysis is that whenever  the rules of the game are clear, more players are encouraged to participate.  Lastly, most of the issues highlighted in this report represent from our standpoint an opportunity for CSPs  and technology providers to strengthen their offerings in order to enable financial institutions to better  leverage the benefits of cloud computing.  3 \"Cloud Computing Risk Assessment\", ENISA (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  7  1. Introduction  Financial Institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and other financial service providers had an  initially cautious approach towards cloud computing. This is mainly due to the many compliance and  reputational risks, that such a new approach to IT service provisioning could entail. Nevertheless, in the  recent years driven by the compelling business and economic benefits, FIs have been rapidly rolling out their  cloud strategies. Currently, it appears that very few FIs still have a strict “no cloud” policy.  1.1 Policy Context  Cloud computing drives the vast spectrum of current and emerging applications, digital products and  services.  It is also a key technology enabler for the future Internet. Its direct economic value to the European  Union is unambiguously significant. Cloud computing is an accepted enabler for innovation and also widely  advocated as such by the European Commission (EC) in the Digital Single Market4 which considers cloud  computing an economic game changer. It also considers that the main obstacles impeding cloud adoption  are standards, certification, data protection, interoperability, lock-in, and legal certainty5.  The European Cloud Computing Strategy, contains the key actions that the European Commission identified  to support the uptake of Cloud computing in Europe.  The European Cloud Computing Strategy has two main objectives:   To make Europe cloud-friendly and cloud-active   To connect digital agenda initiatives  Achieving these two objectives requires the execution of three key actions:   Standards and certification   Fair Service Level Agreements (SLAs)   A European Cloud Partnership  As identified in the ENISA study Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector6, information  security measures are dispersed across many European and National regulations. Such fragmentation  increases the need for common and shared guidelines as companies operate more and more at the pan- European level.  Trust and security in the digital world are the very foundations of a Digital Single Market (DSM)7. The DSM  strategy aims to open up digital opportunities for people and business and enhance Europe's position as a  world leader in the digital economy. The European Commission has identified the completion of the DSM as  4 \"A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe\" COM(2015)192, European Commission, (2015)  http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf  5 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/docs/pg_en.pdf.  6 Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector.

The 2013 European Commission proposal for a Network and Information Security  (NIS) Directive 9 aims to ensure a high, common level of cybersecurity in the EU, by:   Improving Member States' national cybersecurity capabilities   Improving cooperation between Member States, and between public and private sectors   Requiring companies in critical sectors – such as energy, transport, finance and health – as well as  key Internet services to adopt risk management practices and report major incidents to the national  authorities  Another important initiative from the European Commission is the Capital Markets Union 10(CMU). With the  CMU, the Commission will explore ways of reducing fragmentation in financial markets, diversifying  financing sources, strengthening cross border capital flows and improving access to finance for businesses,  particularly SMEs. The CMU is a new frontier of Europe’s single market and is included in the political  guidelines announced11 by the Juncker Commission.  Finally, there is a large body of related work on the security and governance aspects of cloud computing,  including ENISA work related to this analysis:   Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Recommendations for Information Security12, which covers the  evaluation of security risks of migrating to the cloud, legal considerations and the ENISA Cloud  Computing Information Assurance Framework13   Security and Resilience in Governmental Clouds14, which provides a guide for public bodies in the  definition of their security and resilience requirements, and how to evaluate and choose from the  different cloud computing service delivery models   ENISA’s survey of current practice in public procurement15, which covers over 140 public  organisations across Europe   Procure Secure16, a guide to monitoring of security service levels in cloud contracts   Critical Cloud Computing17, a Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) perspective on  cloud computing services  8 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/network-and-information-security-nis-directive.  9 \"Concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union\"  COM(2013)48, European Commission (2013) http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1666  10 http://ec.europa.eu/finance/capital-markets-union/index_en.htm  11 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/docs/pg_en.pdf.  12 Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Recommendations for Information Security.

The collection of data was based on:   Desktop Research. This included sources such as: 1) studies and reports from relevant analysts, 2)  blogs, web articles, white papers available on the Internet, 3) scientific publications, and 4) vendor- specific white papers (a complete list of references can be found in Annexes 1 and 4)   Surveys and interviews. Two questionnaires were developed, one addressed to FIs and CSPs and  another to NFSAs (see Annexes 2 and 3 respectively). In order to ensure the quality and plausibility  of the surveys, the questions were reviewed by a selected group of individual representing the three  categories to be surveyed. The questionnaires were used to survey a list of contacts including 83  representatives of FIs, 40 CSPs and 24 NFSAs. During the survey’s phases, information was initially  collected in written form and then, based on the participants’ availability, discussed in a phone  interview.  A total of 42 organisations participated in the survey (24 FIs, 6 CSPs and 12 NFSAs), and a total of 24  interviews were conducted (13 with FIs, 1 CSP and 10 with NFSAs). We have tried to contact many  more organizations from all parties (FIs, NFSA and CSPs) and from different member states. Due to  time limitations only the ones that have responded to us, have been included in the survey and the  interviews.  The information collected from research, surveys and interviews was consolidated and analysed to support  developing the conclusions and recommendations. The content and structure of the designed surveys drove  the analysis of the data collected.  1.5 Document structure  This document is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the current state and approach of the financial  industry to cloud computing, incentives and benefits, regulatory environment, risks and challenges and  mitigation measures. It also contains the analysis of risks and opportunities from the perspective of different  stakeholders. Section 3 details the relevant outcomes from the state of the art survey and desktop research,  and also introduces the underlying roles and definitions to be used in this report. Section 4 summarizes the  main conclusions and recommendations drawn from this report. Annexes 2 and 3 present the questionnaire  used during the interviews with the selected representatives from FIs, NFSAs and CSPs.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  11  2. Cloud adoption in the European Finance Sector  2.1 Current state and approach to cloud computing  The European financial industry is still in its early stages of cloud adoption. Many FIs use a limited range of  cloud based services. Their approach using cloud based services is not strategically placed and in some cases  they may be unaware that their services are cloud based.  As shown in Figure 1, almost 88% of FIs are already using cloud based services before June 2015, and 81%  were aware these were cloud-based and their implications. In approximately 1 out of 4 organisations  consulted, there were business units using cloud based services without the involvement of the respective  IT department (“shadow IT”).  Figure 1 - Has the organisation you work for ever used cloud services?  Confirming the relatively low level of maturity of the adoption of cloud-based services by the finance sector,  only 50% of finance sector involved in this study already have an explicit cloud strategy. The most common  approaches use a hybrid of Private Cloud and Public Cloud (50%). Rather common (42%) is also the practice  of relying on in-house IT and moving non-critical services (e.g., email management, collaboration and  content management tools) to a cloud based service. Some organisations are using cloud based service as a  testing environment and to develop use cases to better assess a hybrid of Public Cloud and in-house, on- premises hosting of cloud-based services. Public Cloud is also used by those FIs as test beds for new  applications.  It must be stated that according to the results of our survey, a small percentage (8%) of FIs have chosen a  strict Private Cloud only policy. The main reasons are privacy and compliance concerns, as well as the  confidence that a Private Cloud can satisfy the business requirements of the organization. The vast majority  (92%) of the organisations with an already developed strategy rely on a hybrid of Public and Private Cloud  hosted both externally and also as in-house IT services. This is a sign of growing confidence towards the  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  12  adoption of cloud based services. However, we have noted a certain level of prudency when it comes to  moving critical services to the cloud. Some are avoiding moving core banking activities to the cloud, instead  opting to use it for the digital transformation of their business.  42% of FIs participating in this study either do not have an explicit cloud strategy or are just now in the early  stages of developing one.  The main reasons21 for FIs not having a well-defined cloud strategy are:  • Regulation restrictions that prevent financial institutions from using the cloud  (50%)  • Lack of strategic approach to cloud computing within the organisation (30%)  • Concerns over public breach notification (20%)  • Doubts about the real value of Cloud Computing (20%)  • Lack of interest - resources to assess the cloud opportunities (10%)  • Concerns over government surveillance (10%)  Finally, around 8% of the FIs have a no-cloud strategy, i.e., either they will not adopt cloud based services or  they have not yet had the time or resources to address this topic.  The main reasons22 for FIs having a no-cloud approach are:  •  Security concerns (100%)  •  Privacy concerns (100%)  •  Legal/Regulatory/Supervision compliance (100%)  •  Cloud providers do not comply with our internal policies (100%)  •  We are waiting for a wider adoption from the industry (50%)  The majority (60%) of the NFSAs declared to have a conservative or very conservative adoption of new  technologies such as cloud. However, 40% considered themselves to be progressive or very progressive  when referring to the adoption of cloud based services.  Almost half of NFSAs declared to have a level of knowledge of cloud computing that can be described as  medium (27%) or poor (18%). It must also be pointed out that NFSAs declared similar levels of expertise with  regard to information security (64% claim proficient/expert, but 36% have a medium or poor level of  knowledge on the matter).  21 These are not cumulative to 100%, as participants could choose more than one reason in response to this survey  question.  22 These are not cumulative to 100%, as participants could choose more than one reason in response to this survey  question.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  13  Finally, the low level of maturity within the  Finance sector- with regards to the adoption of  cloud based services- is evidenced by the  answers provided by the NFSAs. The general  perception of the NFSAs is that the level of  adoption of cloud based services in the finance  sector is low (64%) or very low (18%), and only  18% believe that the level of adoption is medium  or high. This suggests that the NFSAs seem to be  aware that cloud based services are still in the  early stages of adoption within a Financial  Institution. However, this underestimates the  real level of cloud adoption.  For example the experience of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) is much closer to that of the FIs. In their  opinion, only 1 out of 5 FIs are already using cloud based services. CSPs report that the FIs they interacted  with have either developed a clear cloud strategy, or have developed one during the design phase of a cloud  adoption project.  The top public cloud services/applications that are being adopted provide a snapshot of what organisations  are leveraging from current cloud providers. As seen from Figure 2a, the services most often bought by FIs  from public CSPs are (1) email management23, (2) business management24 and (3) application development/  test environment. From the NFSAs standpoint, the most appropriate services that FIs should buy from  providers of Public cloud based services are instead (1) application development/ test environment, (2)  business management and (3) email management. From CSP experience with the FIs, the most often used  public cloud services are (1) application development/ test environment, (2) mobile security elements, and  many others.  23 E-mail and spam management  24 Collaboration and content management platforms, CRM, HR, ERP, Marketing and Customer support/ticketing  Since security and privacy are considered as  two of the main reasons preventing a wider  adoption of cloud, it is clear that a better  understanding within NFSAs about cloud  based services, information security and the  cyber security risks related to cloud adoption,  would greatly help the market to mature and  improve.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  14  Figure 2a - Adoption of Public cloud based services  It is significant to note the inconsistencies between the opinions of FIs, CSPs and NFSAs with respect to which  services should be bought from Public Clouds. While it is true that the three different groups have different  priorities in mind, it is also true that email management and application development/test environment  services rank very high in their assessments.  It should be noted that 23% of the participating NFSAs believe that Public cloud services should never be  used in the finance sector.  Figure 2b –Adoption of externally hosted, Private cloud based services  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  15  When it comes to the use of Private cloud based services (Figure 2b), it appears that FIs are mostly adopting  (1) Application development/ test environment and (2) Processing & Analytics25. NFSAs believe that most  Private cloud based services are appropriate, with (1) Financial services and (2) Mobile Security Elements  being on top of the list. As seen from Figures 2a and 2b, NFSAs feel much more comfortable with the use of  Private cloud over Public cloud. Again, CSP experience with FIs is that the Private cloud services that are used  most often are (1) Processing & Analytics and (2) Business management.  By comparing the information depicted in Figure 2a and 2b, it is clear that while CSPs believe that Public  cloud is fit for the FI’s purpose, NFSAs for FIs are more in favour of using Private cloud. More neutral, and  perhaps more informed and less biased, is the opinion of the FIs.  The messages that we can derive from the FIs’ answers is that they prefer doing email management in a  Public cloud rather than in a Private cloud, and that both Private and public clouds are suitable environments  for application development and testing.  The strongest divergence between FIs, NFSAs and CSPs is related to the use of mobile security elements:  from the viewpoint of the CSPs mobile security could be moved into the Public cloud, possibly to be offered  a Security as a Service, while from the point of view of NFSAs those services should be provided from a  Private cloud (possibly to guarantee scalability and keep full control as seen in Figure 2b). Finally from the  point of view of FIs, mobile security elements are suitable for neither the Public nor the Private cloud.  2.2 Examples of cloud adoption in the Finance sector  In this section we provide several examples of how European supervisory authorities have been addressing  some of the challenges from cloud based services, and how FIs are adopting cloud based services.  National Supervisory Authorities  DNB - The Dutch banking regulator  In 2012, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Netherlands’ national banking regulator, was one of the  initiators in Europe that enacted legislation allowing FIs to use cloud based services.  Now, DNB has included Amazon Web Services (AWS) for use by the country’s finance sector, clarifying key  supervision criteria (see “Guideline” below) for Dutch organisations looking to move infrastructure or  services to the AWS cloud. The DNB’s announcement means that Dutch banks and other FIs are if they  comply to those guidelines now permitted to use AWS, Salesforce, IBM, KPN and Microsoft Azure26 for a  range of services including websites, mobile applications, retail banking platforms, high performance  computing and credit risk analysis solutions.  The guidelines require that the DNB be allowed to oversee and confirm that the IT infrastructure (including  cloud infrastructure) used by financial firms is compliant with its regulations. DNB confirmed that use of AWS  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) meets this requirement. However, it has said that the FIs must still meet  other requirements, such as carrying out a standard risk analysis for their use of IaaS cloud based services.  25 Processing capacity, data analysis and Intelligence, big data, storage/disaster recovery/data archiving, virtual  desktops  26 http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/dutch-regulator-de-nederlandsche-bank-makes-cloud-migration-a- seamless-reality/ .Last accessed 30th November 2015  http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/dutch-regulator-de-nederlandsche-bank-makes-cloud-migration-a-seamless-reality/ http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/dutch-regulator-de-nederlandsche-bank-makes-cloud-migration-a-seamless-reality/  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  16  The DNB guidelines require27 institutions to:   report their intention to use cloud computing to DNB beforehand   draw up a risk analysis   also meet the requirements laid down in the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht  – Wft)   allow DNB the right to examine the bank   make sure exit clauses are included in the contract  FINMA - Swiss Banking Regulator  FINMA exercises prudential and risk-oriented supervision over banks and securities dealers. As a financial  regulator it aims at protecting creditors and maintaining the stability of the financial system. Therefore, it  centres on ensuring that licensing, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements, are met at all times.  FINMA's level of supervision is most intensive in areas where risk is greatest. It assigns banks, insurance  companies, collective investment schemes, self-regulatory organisations (SROs) and directly subordinated  financial intermediaries (DSFIs) to six different supervisory categories depending on their size, complexity  and risk structure.  When shortcomings arise and licensed institutions break the rules, FINMA orders appropriate measures to  enforce supervisory law28.  FINMA has allowed the use of cloud based services in Switzerland and the most prevalent are those offered  by Safe Swiss Cloud. Safe Swiss Cloud claims to be a safe and secure cloud computing service based in  Switzerland that offers innovative compute, storage and managed cloud services. They emphasize the  privacy of customers29 by committing to not share data with third parties, to fully comply with to Swiss30 and  EU laws31 on data protection and data transfer.  Moreover FINMA adopts a risk-based approach32 to asset management. There are six different supervisory  categories to which licence holders are assigned, depending on their potential risk impact on creditors,  investors, the system as a whole and the reputation of the Swiss financial centre. Licence holders of major  and global systemic importance that are exposed to significant risks are assigned to Category 1. The risk  potential of the institutions in the other categories decreases gradually down to Category 5. Market  participants in Category 6 are not placed under prudential supervision since they are considered very low  risk. Such an approach is also relevant to cloud computing.  27 DNB. (2015).

It has provided online banking services since  1996, when they pioneered the offering of real-time stock market operations. More than 60% of Bankinter  transactions are performed through remote channels, and 46% of those transactions are conducted over  the Internet.  Bankinter uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an integral part of their credit-risk simulation application,  developing complex algorithms to simulate diverse scenarios in order to evaluate the financial health of  Bankinter clients. According to the Bankinter Director of Technological Innovation, they perform at least  5,000,000 simulations to get realistic results. Bankinter uses the flexibility and power of Amazon Elastic  Compute Cloud (EC2) to perform these simulations, subdividing processes through a grid of AWS EC2  instances, and implementing simulations in parallel on several AWS EC2 instances to obtain the result in a  very short time period.  Through the use of AWS, Bankinter decreased the average time-to-solution from 23 hours to 20 minutes and  dramatically reduced processing (and cost), with the capability to reduce even further when needed.  Bankinter reports that the AWS platform, with its unlimited and flexible computational power, is a good fit  for their risk-simulation process requirements. They are empowered to decide how quickly to obtain  simulation results. More importantly, they say that they have the ability to run simulations that were not  before possible due to the large amount of infrastructure required34.  ING  ING is using cloud-based software from ServiceNow to deliver HR services to its 25,000 staff in the  Netherlands. ServiceNow and ING built a branded portal to give staff access to information and to automate  previously manual tasks. ING previously used call centres and face-to-face interactions for most HR  enquiries. Now a self-service portal gives employees faster and easier access to a knowledge base with over  1,200 articles on topics such as health and compensation. This improved user satisfaction and reduced the  cost and time of providing services. ING sees ServiceNow as a key partner in their transformation efforts35.  33 https://www.bankinter.com/www2/particulares/es/inicio/bienvenida  34 Amazon Web Services. AWS Case Study: Bankinter.

Figure 3a – Which Public cloud based services are you interested in adopting?  It appears that FIs do not see particular benefits in the use of Public cloud based services. The only use cases  in which they see some value are application development/test environment (25%) and email management  (19%). NFSAs appear to have similar opinions, as they believe that Public cloud is fit for application  development/test environment (64%) as well as email management (45%) and business management (45%).  It might come as a surprise that NFSAs seem to see more benefits in the use of Public cloud (e.g. for business  management and e-mail management services) than the FIs themselves. FIs are somewhat open in using  public cloud for collaboration and content management platforms (29%), and e-mail (29%), but beyond  these services the interest in Public cloud based services is generally lower.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  19  Figure 3b - Which Private cloud based services are you interested in adopting?  Similar to what we see in the Public cloud based services, FIs do not have high interest in adopting Private  cloud based services, as the highest interest has been again noted in application development/test  environment (29%) and while the interest in business management services is generally low, 38% of  respondents were interested in collaboration and content management platforms. Based on the analysis of  the data reported in Figure 3a and 3b, adjusted on the basis of the input collected during the interviews, we  can state that both FIs and NFSAs see more benefits in the use of Private cloud rather than Public cloud.  Moreover, most NFSAs strongly support and believe that Private cloud based services are mostly  appropriate for use in finance sector, which represents an opportunity for growth in the cloud market.  In summary, by analysing the answers provided by FIs on their interest about Public and Private cloud, it is  evident that FIs generally consider application development and testing as the best possible use cases for  both Private and Public cloud. However, it is also noticeable that FIs perceive more benefits in the use of  Public clouds for email management and financial services applications.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  20  2.4 Incentives and Benefits  Our analysis shows that both financial institutions and supervisory authorities have a similar understanding  of the benefits that the cloud based services are offering.  Figure 4 - Primary reasons for adopting cloud computing  Some of the top reasons to move to the Cloud (Figure 4) are reduced total cost of ownership (TCO), reduced  time for provisioning, reduced time to market, and infrastructure and pricing flexibility. NFSAs also see  business continuity as one of the important incentives for adopting cloud based services. On the other hand,  NFSAs and almost 70% of the surveyed FIs do not consider mobility as an important reason for adopting the  cloud, whereas CSPs believe it is, together with business continuity and security, the biggest reasons for the  adoption of cloud computing services. However, CSPs do not believe that cloud computing can be leveraged  by FIs for optimisation of in-house technical and human resources, which is a primary reason for 45% of the  FIs.  It is worth highlighting that neither FIs nor NFSAs  consider information security as one of main benefits  and incentives for adopting cloud based services,  although security is considered as very important  factor from the CSPs perspective. This might be due to  the fact that the security measures provided by the  CSPs are not very well communicated to the NFSAs  and the FIs. The opinion of the FIs and NFSAs seems  to be in contradiction not only with that of the CSPs,  In general it appears that while both FIs and  NFSAs are aware of benefits that cloud brings  (specialization, economy of scale, flexibility),  they are not willing to take the chance of losing  over what is arguably the most valuable asset  for a financial institution: the information.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  21  but also with the perspective of other relevant experts (including ENISA) as stated in published reports (e.g.  ENISA Cloud Risk Assessment36) regarding the security benefits of cloud based services. Some NFSAs say that  better security is a benefit brought by cloud based services only for small FIs.  2.5 Regulatory Environment  Supervisory authorities around Europe are aware that an increasing number of FIs are adopting or  considering the use of cloud based services. From the NFSA’s perspective, it is important to understand the  prudential statutory and subsidiary legislation relevant to cloud based services. In general, from the NFSAs’  point of view, cloud based services are considered as a form of outsourcing and therefore the same rules  apply to cloud based services as for outsourced services. Moreover, it appears that most of NFSAs are very  cautious towards cloud base services, recommending the use of Private cloud over Public cloud, which they  view as a suitable option only for non critical services.  Despite the fact that some NFSAs around Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Finland) have  published opinions related to outsourcing/cloud based services, it appears that the financial industry is  dealing with a lack of clear, formal guidance that is consistent across all NFSAs on the specificities of cloud  based services.  For instance, half of the participating NFSAs request that FIs notify them when adopting cloud services only  if moving critical services or sensitive data (50%). However, this cannot be considered a general rule. Some  NFSAs require to be notified always (33%), and just some of them when migrating to a Public cloud (8%).  Our respondents have described various cases  in which the need to notify NFSAs about the  adoption of cloud based services has caused  severe delays, or even blocked the prospective  use of cloud services in their FIs. This on one  hand is because information was not provided  by the CSPs, but on the other hand also due to  lack of guidance from the NFSAs on what  specific information to be provided.  It appears reasonable to assume that those issues could have been mitigated by increasing the level of  understanding of NFSAs about cloud based services and CSPs providing more specific information, which  calls for better understanding, increased CSP transparency and a more structured and strategic approach  from FIs and NFSAs. There is still a smaller group of NFSAs (8%) that have no specific requirements on the  matter.  However, however they do appreciate voluntary notification by the FIs.  About 70% of participating FIs indicate that they have engaged with regulatory bodies in discussions about  requirements for the adoption of cloud based services in the finance sector. Several FIs are following specific  regulations and standards to govern the migration to the cloud. These specific regulatory requirements are  presented in Figure 5. The vast majority of the FIs need to comply with data protection legislations and other  specific national regulations issued by individual NFSAs (e.g., IT service providers based in Luxembourg and  offering IT operation services to a FI must obtain a license of finance sector professionals, also known as  Support PSF to provide a secure and confidential processing of the data in Luxembourg). The Payment Card  36 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  A lack of formal guidelines for cloud based  services, and the lack of mature evaluation  processes, has forced the relevant NFSAs to  perform evaluation that cause severe delays or  even block the prospective use of cloud based  services by FIs.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  22  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is certainly another very important sector-specific standard with  which the majority of the FIs must comply.  Figure 5 - Notable regulations - FI perspective  It appears that CSPs do not overly emphasise the importance of national regulations and PCI-DSS. Based on  the experience they have in dealing with the FIs, the two most important regulatory requirements are data  protection and corporate governance.  The fact that CSPs, FIs and NFSAs have such a different view and understanding of the relevance of national  regulations for cloud based services seems to confirm that the finance sector is in the need of better  guidance and better communication between the relevant players.  It should be noted however that even if there is still work to be done from the NFSAs’ side, some virtuous  examples already exists, for instance the DNB in the Netherlands. The Dutch Authority has provided formal  guidance that states37:  “When using third-party cloud computing services, the supervised institution is subject to the legal  requirements that apply to outsourcing:  37 http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/binaries/51-224828.pdf  http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/binaries/51-224828.pdf  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  23   Risks must be demonstrably known and mitigated, and   Outsourcing to third parties may not obstruct supervision.  Before a supervised institution proceeds to engage in cloud computing, DNB expects to be informed of this  prospective outsourcing arrangement. DNB will ask the supervised institution to submit its risk analysis  concerning cloud computing for assessment in the context of risk-based supervision.”  Furthermore, DNB requests that explicit attention is given to risks associated with, among other things, data  integrity, confidentiality and availability. DNB also requires assurance with regards to the location where the  business data are to be processed and stored. In the event that the supervised institution interrupts the use  of third party services, it must secure all data and verify that they have been removed from the third party’s  systems. The DNB has also defined the requirements for cloud computing risk assessment. Banks are  required to prepare a risk assessment using a risk analysis framework38 and contractually agree to a ‘right to  examine.’ The ENISA Cloud Computing Security Risk Assessment is one that is known to have been used  among others as well. The requirements set out in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) also have to be  met.  An area where there is consistency in the approaches of the various NFSAs is risk assessment and  management. All the NFSAs require FIs to provide evidence that the information security risks connected to  the use of cloud based services are properly identified, assessed, treated and communicated.  For instance, BaFin 40requires that, in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG) and  the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk), FIs ensure the integrity,  availability, authenticity and confidentiality of data within their IT systems and IT  processes. In recent years, BaFin has increased its efforts in the area of IT security. Special  audits have helped to raise awareness about IT security amongst the FIs.  38 http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/binaries/50-228202.pdf  39 http://www.prarulebook.co.uk/rulebook/Content/Part/214147/11-09-2015  40 http://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffen- tlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2013/fa_bj_2013_11_it_sicherheit_en.html  DNB has agreed to a ‘right to examine’ with various parties, including KPN, Microsoft, IBM,  Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce.com. This ‘right to examine’ (right to audit) is a  standard clause in the contracts that Dutch financial institutions use for cloud services  provided by these CSPs. This allows financial institutions to meet one of the statutory  requirements for cloud services.  In Germany, BaFin requires FIs to maintain full audit rights for its external and internal  auditors. The same requirement applies for BaFin too when outsourcing to a provider. Any  CSPs that are not willing to grant these rights cannot serve the German banks.  Bank of England requires FIs to make available on request to the Prudential Regulation  Authority (PRA), as well as to any other relevant competent authority, all information  necessary to enable competent authority to supervise the compliance of the performance of  the outsourced activities with the requirements of the regulatory system.39  http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/binaries/50-228202.pdf http://www.prarulebook.co.uk/rulebook/Content/Part/214147/11-09-2015 http://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2013/fa_bj_2013_11_it_sicherheit_en.html http://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2013/fa_bj_2013_11_it_sicherheit_en.html  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  24  Banking supervision in Germany covers all risks related to the IT management/control,  availability, confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the data, internal control system  of the IT organisation, IT strategy, and the use of information technology. BaFin has noted  the challenge to maintain IT security at a high level when the framework conditions  change. As many FIs have outsourced their IT, BaFin believes that it is crucial for them to  integrate the service provider in their information security management  functions/systems, since the same requirements apply irrespective of whether the IT  systems and processes are managed by the FIs themselves or by service providers.  Financial institutions in Luxembourg are required to have a minimum internal IT capacity, which is  proportionate to their business and system complexity. 41  CSSF in Luxembourg requires FIs to follow at least three prudential principles:  • The financial institutions shall always have their activities under control from a  technical and operational perspective;  • The risks shall be correctly assessed, reduced, transferred or accepted;  • The residual risks shall be known and accepted.  41 http://www.cssf.lu/filead-min/files/Publications/Rapports_annuels/Rapport_2011/RA2011_chapter_10_eng.pdf  42 http://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/vigilanza/normativa/archivio-norme/circolari/c263/263CIRC_15AGG.pdf  Bank of Italy42 (BOI) requires FIs to choose CSPs on the basis of an analysis of the risk, which should  include an estimate of:  • The risks connected to the resources and services to be outsourced  • The risks attaching to possible suppliers  • The quality of sub-contractors  • The redundancy of the lines of communication used  • The reliability, security and scalability of the technologies adopted  BOI also requires FIs to know the location of data centres and the number of staff that have access  to confidential data or critical components, with the outsourcer obliged to update the data  periodically.  Finally, BOI warn FIs to be especially cautious in evaluating CSP offerings. The regulator believes  that in the case of acquisition of community or public cloud services, the potential risks are greater  and may require a more complex system of controls, especially when critical components are  outsourced. It is important that the locations of the data centres be notified in advance, and  adequate mechanisms must be provided for isolating each client’s data to protect their  confidentiality and integrity. CSPs must contractually guarantee to comply with the agreed levels of  service, including in emergencies or when other clients call for resources. CSPs should also ensure  that data access and modifications can be fully reconstructed, including for inspections. According  to BOI, FIs must agree on adequate audit procedures with the CSP.  http://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/vigilanza/normativa/archivio-norme/circolari/c263/263CIRC_15AGG.pdf  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  25  NFSAs have noted that CSPs are proactively working to improve the level of transparency, but they still note  differences between the approach that different CSPs have, and their ability to provide the sufficient level  of transparency. As NFSAs require access to sufficient information to be able to understand risk exposure of  FIs, there is an increased tendency to use a certification scheme for CSPs as a starting point for achieving  compliance.  Finally, as banking groups with a global or pan-European presence have started using cloud computing,  NFSAs started to consider cloud services as systemic services, and to be concerned with concentration of  risk. Therefore, while some NFSAs have no interest to regulate the CSPs directly, some of them have  expressed the potential need to oversee providers who are offering critical services to banks with a global  presence, as they represent a source of systemic risk.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  26  3. Risks and Challenges  3.1 Security concerns  The study shows a continued concern over security issues related to cloud. NFSAs unanimously agree that  risks related to in-house IT can be much easier controlled and operationally managed than in the Cloud. With  security concerns being a key consideration when adopting cloud services, we asked respondents to rank a  list of common security risks on scale of one to five (with five being the greatest concern).  Figure 6 - Cloud computing security concerns ranked  The FIs have many security concerns related to cloud based services, but they are especially worried about  data confidentiality, data breach, and compliance and legal issues. The NFSAs however perceive loss of  governance, lack of transparency and lack of auditing features as additional top risks, in addition to those  mentioned by FIs.  CSPs report that when they discuss security concerns with FIs, usually data breach, integrity and availability  are top the list. It is worth noticing that lack of forensic capabilities is not considered as a particularly relevant  issue, and generally all other risks are substantially less relevant than those expressed by FIs and NFSAs.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  27  Similarly to other economic sectors43, security concerns are considered the main limiting factor for cloud  adoption in the finance sector (see Section 3.1). Analysing the answers provided to risk-related questions, it  appears that NFSAs are generally more concerned than FIs. The biggest differences in perception noted are  loss of control of the data (governance), integrity, lack of transparency and lack of auditing features.  Figure 7 - Have you or your team developed a detailed corporate risk assessment of  Cloud Computing?  3.2 Corporate Risk Assessment  Despite the fact that FIs seem to be aware of specific risks connected to the use of cloud computing and that  NFSAs are requiring that supervised institutions to identify, assess and mitigate the risks, 46% of the  respondents have not developed a detailed corporate risk assessment for cloud computing.  Such high percentage of FIs without a developed corporate risk management strategy for cloud computing  is not surprising considering that, as noted in Section 3.1, 42% of the FIs do not have a fully structured cloud  strategy.  The lack of clear and formal regulatory guidance could be another explanation  of the fact that despite 88% of FIs having already used cloud services, 46% have  not developed a detailed corporate risk assessment.  43 http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_- _statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  28  From our standpoint, some further guidance from NFSAs could improve the situation and facilitate the  adoption of cloud services in the finance sector while meeting the regulatory requirements. Various FIs find  ENISA Cloud Computing Security Risk Assessment as a helpful tool on the market for developing a corporate  risk assessment for cloud based services. Additionally, some of the respondents have identified Technology  Risk Management Guidelines44 issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as very useful to better guide  for addressing existing and emerging technology risks.  Figure 8 - Main challenges to cloud based services  Finally we asked CSPs and FIs which are the main challenges to their adoption of cloud based services.  Their opinions from these interested parties are divergent. In fact from the FIs standpoint, regulatory  obligations represent by far the biggest challenge during the migration to cloud-based services. For the  CSPs however, the most complex challenge relates to the migration of high frequency trading  solutions. In contrast, high frequency trading solutions are not seen as a challenge to FIs, perhaps  because they are not planning to move these applications in the cloud. We believe it is important to  note that while a third of the FIs recognise that log collection and analysis in cloud is an issue,  44 http://www.mas.gov.sg/regulations-and-financial-stability/regulatory-and-supervisory-framework/risk- management/technology-risk.aspx  http://www.mas.gov.sg/regulations-and-financial-stability/regulatory-and-supervisory-framework/risk-management/technology-risk.aspx http://www.mas.gov.sg/regulations-and-financial-stability/regulatory-and-supervisory-framework/risk-management/technology-risk.aspx  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  29  particularly in Public Clouds, the CSPs do not share the same opinion and they appear to judge the  challenge of log collection as completely irrelevant. These divergent opinions seem to reflect the need  of FIs to be in direct control of what happens in the cloud (and logs are a good tool for that).  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  30  4. Security requirements and mitigation measures  In this section we provide an analysis of the security requirements both from the point of view of FIs and  CSPs. We report and analyse the security measures that NFSAs, FIs and CSPs would like to adopt within the  finance sector.  4.1 Security requirements  When adopting (or planning) cloud services, financial institutions are strictly requiring:   Thoroughly implemented security measures (75%)   Deep auditing permission in case of incident (63%)   Penalty clauses in case of incident (54%)   Not moving client data to the cloud (50%)  Figure 9 - Security requirements  CSPs mostly confirm that FIs ask for thoroughly implemented security measures, deep auditing permission  in case of incident, and not moving client data to the cloud. However, it appears that penalty clauses in case  of incidents are not required from FIs.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  31  Isolating answers from smaller CSPs from those of leading European providers, it appears that FIs demand  more from small CSPs, from whom they usually require deep auditing permission in case of an incident.  Moreover, FIs do not move client data into clouds of smaller providers. FIs also seem more able to enforce  penalty clauses in case of incidents to small CSPs, which is not the case with big providers. However it should  be noted that we cannot consider this statistically significant since the sample of CSPs used was too small.  In previous sections we have already noted that many NFSAs still have concerns about the adoption of cloud  based services by FIs. Those concerns are reflected by the fact that NFSAs require FIs to follow strict security  requirements, starting with a risk assessment of security measures that need to be implemented.  Due to those stringent requirements and supervision by NFSAs, compliance is a crucial operating  requirement for FIs, and cloud adoption must be considered within the context of maintaining regulatory  compliance. This study found that organisations typically approach compliance assurance with cloud  providers through these means:   Specific contract clauses (92%)   SLAs (83%)   Certification (71%)   Audits (29%)  Figure 10 - Ensuring compliance by service providers  During the interviews we identified two challenges for FIs in their compliance efforts:   Lack of negotiation power. FIs do not have enough power when negotiating specific  contract clauses with large CSPs.   Perceived limitation in the area of certification. While FIs see high value in attestation,  e.g. SOC 2, or audits performed by NFSAs, there are mixed feelings about certification  of cloud services. On one hand, there is consensus that certifications provide high  value and are a good means for CSPs to assure their compliance with standards. On  the other hand, it appears that financial market players are sceptical towards existing  cloud certification schemes, especially due to lack of information about the relevance  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  32  of existing cloud security standards to the financial market. The latter suggest a clear  awareness gap since governance and assurance standards specifically developed for  and aimed at the cloud already exist, and some of them are considered mature enough  to be adopted. ISO 2700145 and PCI-DSS46 are the most commonly used standards, but  various FIs express that cloud-specific certification frameworks would be a more  helpful approach to compliance.  Additionally, ENISA has developed two specific tools for supporting security awareness  in the cloud:   Cloud Certification Schemes List (CCSL)47 is a list of existing certification schemes  relevant to cloud computing customers. CCSL provides potential customers with an  overview of objective characteristics per scheme, to help them understand how the  scheme works and if it is appropriate for their setting. CCSL is being improved  continuously and updated by ENISA and stakeholders from industry and public sector.   Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework (CCSM)48, is a framework that collects  public sector security requirements and groups them into 27 security objectives. These  security objectives are then mapped against the cloud certification schemes included  in the CCSL. The goal of CCSM is to provide more transparency and help customers in  the public sector with their procurement of cloud computing services.  Furthermore, experience of CSPs shows that for FIs sometimes the biggest obstacle in overcoming the risk  of cloud computing comes from the misconceptions about the technology. It behoves CSPs to be more  transparent about their cloud offerings.  45 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm  46 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php  47 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  48 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  33  4.2 Mitigation Measures  To mitigate the risks introduced by adoption of cloud computing, FI’s willingness to engage has much to do  with whether the cloud services offer specific functions and features. Some of these functions and features  are needed for improving trust, and others are needed for security and compliance purposes.  Figure 11 - Top features desired from cloud providers  The top desired features are depicted in Figure 11. NFSAs would generally desire more security features than  the FIs, however the only area where NFSAs are less interested was forensics and e-discovery. FIs consider  those features as important. CSPs noted that the majority of desired features shown in Figure 9 are being  driven by privacy requirements.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  34  We conclude from this data that some FIs are making a priori decisions about  not using the cloud for sensitive data rather, than basing their decision on a  mature analysis and assessment of the risks.  Figure 12 - Mitigation measures adopted  When asked about the mitigation measures implemented during migration to cloud services, the  majority of respondents requested from their CSPs specific contract clauses such as right to audit,  develop exit strategies, require information assurance and security certifications, thoroughly  implemented security measures and clearly defined SLAs. It is clearly visible that NFSAs want a much  stricter approach than the FIs are taking, although this should be noted as normal as this is due to their  nature being not for profit, but prudence based. However, they are much less reluctant about moving  client (vs. the FI’s) data to the cloud, assuming that a risk assessment has been performed and the risks  adequately mitigated. The percentage of FIs who have not moved client data to the cloud is consistent  with the number of FIs who have not developed a detailed corporate risk assessment for cloud based  services (Figure 7).  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  35  5. Recommendations  In this section we provide a list of recommendations addressed mainly to FIs and regulators. The recommendations  are grouped into four key areas: collaboration, risks based approach, transparency and assurance and information  campaigns.  5.1 Cooperation between FIs, NFSA and CSPs  This study highlights the fact that in countries where there is effective communication and collaboration  between FIs, NFSAs and CSPs the cloud market is able to evolve more quickly. Therefore we recommend  that FIs to engage with CSPs and NFSAs, with the following objectives:  1. NFSAs to define national good practices and (de-facto) standards in the areas of cloud governance and  risk management for the adoption of Cloud computing in the finance sector.  2. NFSAs to define good practices and de-facto standards for incident information sharing. On-going  efforts, such as those conducted at the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS- ISAC), have limitations both in terms of geographic spread and in level of details of the information  being shared. Therefore NFSAs with the help of FIs and CSPs should focus on mechanisms to increase  the level of trust between the members of the information sharing platform, and consequently increase  the amount and level of detail of the incident information.  Referring to the previous point, we recommend that NFSAs work together at the global and European levels  to define a set of common good practices for cloud security and privacy. Priority should be given to:  3. NFSAs with the help of EU Institutions (EBA, EC) to create harmony between legal and regulatory  requirements. We recommend a consolidated approach to regulation of cloud computing in Europe.  While supervisory authorities in Europe seem to have similar attitude with regards to cloud computing,  their approach to the regulation varies significantly. Harmonising current national legislations, and  defining baseline requirements and guidance on cloud computing throughout the European finance  sector, would decrease the effort required for all parties involved.  It would also provide much needed  clear/formal regulatory positions on cloud computing to FIs, which would enable successful cloud  adoption projects across multiple regulatory jurisdictions in Europe. Furthermore, with clear and  consolidated guidance from supervisory authorities, FIs will be able to develop detailed corporate risk  assessments and strategies for cloud computing, while clearly understanding the prudential statutory  and subsidiary legislation relevant to the subject of cloud computing. Baseline regulatory requirements  should addressing confidentiality, integrity, availability and location of data. Contractual right to audit  clauses should be considered as a baseline assurance mechanism for FIs. Supervisory authorities should  agree on a consensus approach to oversee CSPs, ideally through existing assurance mechanisms  available in the industry, coupled with additional guidance specific for financial industry.  4. Minimum security and privacy requirements for the adoption of cloud based services: We recommend  that regulators work on the definition of the security and privacy requirements/principles that should  be adopted by FIs when adopting cloud services. Those requirements should reflect the different level  of service criticality and impact (e.g., a service moderate impact would require the implementation of  baseline requirements). The definition of criticality / impact levels for services and corresponding  security and privacy requirements would offer several benefits such as:  a. Support smaller FIs and CSPs in their cloud risk assessment and management approach  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  36  b. Help CSPs develop a standard offering depending on the level of criticality of services  c. Provide FIs and CSPs with a uniform set of baseline security requirements to support the security  interoperability between services  Organisations such as ENISA Information Assurance Framework49), and NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 450 have  already developed security controls frameworks that are sufficiently mature and could be used to derive  minimum security and privacy requirements for the finance sector. An increased collaboration between  NFSAs is desirable also in relation to cloud systemic risks we referred to earlier.  5. Policy makers (EC, EBA, ENISA) to identify existing and/or create new European / global mechanisms for  security and privacy compliance, including possible further enhancements of existing certifications and  certification practices.  5.2 Risk-based approach (risk assessment/cloud strategy)  6. We recommend that FIs develop a cloud computing strategy in order to define their approach to cloud  computing. Organisations should adopt a risk-based approach when moving to the cloud, and their  strategy should be aligned with their corporate risk assessment. By understanding and evaluating their  assets they will be able to assess confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements for deployment  of cloud services within their organisation. Based on the security and risk requirements, organisations  should have a good idea of their comfort level for transitioning to the cloud, and which combinations  of deployment, service models and locations fit their risk tolerance. We recommend that FIs perform a  corporate risk assessment on cloud computing by using their corporate risk assessment framework, and  by leveraging existing cloud specific tools and methodologies.  5.3 Transparency & Assurance  7. In the section on Information Campaigns, we highlight the need to better inform both regulators and  FIs about the security risks and opportunities connected to the use of cloud computing. We believe that  both FIs and NFSAs are overly cautious in their approach to cloud computing due to misconceptions  about the technology. In order to address this issue, an increased level of transparency and trust is  needed. Thus, we recommend that CSPs continue their efforts to provide sufficient transparency and  help their customers and supervisory authorities understand the level of assurance that their cloud  offerings provide. Such an effort should be based on:  a. Mechanisms that align the classification of assets (services and information) of the customer with  the classification adopted by CSPs.  b. Information sharing about CSPs risk management process.  c. Statements and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) on security and privacy controls applied to the  service provided. These SLAs should be simple, unambiguous, measurable and comparable.  d. Right to audit, or alternatively show adherence to suitable security and privacy standards through  certification (or 3rd party assessment). This should be required especially in the cases of critical  services.  e. Create specific information documents addressed to supervisory authorities and financial service  risk/security/compliance/audit officers.  49 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance- framework/at_download/fullReport.

We recommend that the European Commission, other relevant European Agencies (e.g., EBA, ENISA)  as well as industry bodies work together to create information campaigns for the financial industry with  the following objectives:  a. Increasing the understanding of the NFSAs, other financial regulators and FIs on cloud based  services and their connected security risks as well as security benefits  b. Clarifying the differences between cloud based services and outsourcing  c. Clarifying the trade-offs between Public cloud, Private cloud, outsourcing and in-house IT  d. Explaining the tools, techniques, certifications, good practices and standards that, if adopted,  could facilitate safe adoption of cloud based services  e. Clarifying the role that security and privacy certifications could have on increasing the level of  trust in cloud services. As a starting point we recommend using specific tools, such as CCSL and  CCSM developed by ENISA, which will promote and understanding of the characteristics of  certification schemes, and how they accomplish security objectives.

However, the adoption  approach is not yet mature. The vast majority of Financial Institutions (FIs) still rely on in-house  infrastructure.  Finance sector Institutions and supervisory authorities seem to have a clear view of the financial and  technical benefits connected to the adoption of both Public and Private Cloud1 deployment models, but they  remain cautious about the risk of losing control over information assets.  The most common approach used by FIs is a Hybrid of Private and Public Cloud. Even then, the services most  often migrated to the cloud are test environments and email management2. Financial Institutions consider  that Private Cloud is a better overall fit for the financial market due to privacy and compliance concerns.  Private Cloud is certainly favoured by the National Financial Supervisory Authorities (NFSAs), as it provides  more control over data and operations.  In creating this report we analysed input from a number of different sources to better understand the usage  of cloud services in the finance sector. Based on the analysis we provide recommendations to financial  institutions, regulators and cloud service providers about what we believe should be done to support secure  adoption of cloud services in the finance sector.  As with business sectors even less critical than the finance sector, loss of control and compliance top the FIs’  and regulators’ list of risks. Whether the risk is perceived or real, this certainly poses challenges for the cloud  market players to address. Those challenges include the ability to:   Manage the governance and compliance risk   Provide better tools for contract/SLAs negotiation (especially for smaller financial institutions)   Increase the level of transparency of the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)   Increase the information understanding of cloud security in NFSAs and FIs   Clarify the differences between outsourcing and cloud computing   Push the NFSAs to provide more guidance on cloud adoption   Improve currently available security and privacy certification schemes  From the information collected through the surveys and interviews, it appears that the most pressing short- term issues for promoting the adoption of cloud services are:   Reducing the information gap. Neither FIs nor NFSAs consider security as a main benefit of cloud  services, despite the fact that security is considered a very important factor by CSPs, and by expert  bodies including ENISA, which has published reports (e.g., the ENISA Cloud Risk Assessment)  describing the security benefits of cloud computing. Furthermore, in many instances regulators do  not differentiate between outsourcing and cloud computing.  1 Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds, ENISA (2013)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good- practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  2 \"Cloud computing - statistics on the use by enterprises\", Eurostat (2014) http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/governmental-cloud-security/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  6   Providing clearer and fit for purpose regulatory guidance. That CSPs, FIs and NFSAs have such  different views and understandings of the relevance of national regulations for the cloud computing  seems to confirm that the financial market needs better guidance and communication between the  players.   Simplifying and streamlining compliance. Further guidance from NFSAs would facilitate the  adoption of cloud services in the finance sector while meeting the regulatory requirements. Various  FIs find ENISA’s Cloud Computing Security Risk Assessment3 as a helpful tool for developing a  corporate risk assessment for cloud computing.  In the longer term, some NFSAs fear a systemic failure stemming from the use of cloud computing by pan- European banking groups in connection to global cloud providers that offer services to multiple financial  institutions. Such a risk of failure calls for stronger coordination and collaboration between NFSAs, and a  more open dialogue with FIs and CSPs.  In terms of mitigating actions, while FIs are relying on SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001, PCI DSS, some are also  leveraging ENISA’s cloud computing security risk assessment, which helps them identify key risks associated  with Cloud and what actions to take.  CSPs report that for FIs, sometimes the biggest obstacle to cloud adoption is misconceptions about the  technology. In fact, many EU NFSAs tend to block cloud usage, since they judge that CSPs are not sufficiently  transparent. Therefore, it encourages CSPs to strive for transparency and help customers understanding the  security implications of various cloud offerings.  In this study we provide the following recommendations:   NFSAs, FIs and CSPs to cooperate on extending the national good practices and standards in the  areas of Cloud governance and risk management   NFSAs to define practices and standards for incident information sharing   NFSAs to define minimum security requirements for adoption of Cloud computing in FIs   FIs to develop a Cloud strategy in order to define their approach to Cloud computing   CSPs to continue their efforts to provide transparency and assurance to NFSAs and FIs   EU institutions in cooperation with CSPs to create information campaigns to better inform both  regulators and FIs about the security risks and opportunities connected to the use of cloud  computing   EU institutions in cooperation with NFSAs to continue their work on harmonizing the legal and  regulatory environment within the European Union  This study presents not just challenges and issues, but also some significant success stories that will be of  good guidance and an example for those FIs, supervisory authorities and CSPs that are still at the beginning  of their journey towards cloud. One conclusion we can derive from our surveys and analysis is that whenever  the rules of the game are clear, more players are encouraged to participate.  Lastly, most of the issues highlighted in this report represent from our standpoint an opportunity for CSPs  and technology providers to strengthen their offerings in order to enable financial institutions to better  leverage the benefits of cloud computing.  3 \"Cloud Computing Risk Assessment\", ENISA (2009) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  7  1. Introduction  Financial Institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and other financial service providers had an  initially cautious approach towards cloud computing. This is mainly due to the many compliance and  reputational risks, that such a new approach to IT service provisioning could entail. Nevertheless, in the  recent years driven by the compelling business and economic benefits, FIs have been rapidly rolling out their  cloud strategies. Currently, it appears that very few FIs still have a strict “no cloud” policy.  1.1 Policy Context  Cloud computing drives the vast spectrum of current and emerging applications, digital products and  services.  It is also a key technology enabler for the future Internet. Its direct economic value to the European  Union is unambiguously significant. Cloud computing is an accepted enabler for innovation and also widely  advocated as such by the European Commission (EC) in the Digital Single Market4 which considers cloud  computing an economic game changer. It also considers that the main obstacles impeding cloud adoption  are standards, certification, data protection, interoperability, lock-in, and legal certainty5.  The European Cloud Computing Strategy, contains the key actions that the European Commission identified  to support the uptake of Cloud computing in Europe.  The European Cloud Computing Strategy has two main objectives:   To make Europe cloud-friendly and cloud-active   To connect digital agenda initiatives  Achieving these two objectives requires the execution of three key actions:   Standards and certification   Fair Service Level Agreements (SLAs)   A European Cloud Partnership  As identified in the ENISA study Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector6, information  security measures are dispersed across many European and National regulations. Such fragmentation  increases the need for common and shared guidelines as companies operate more and more at the pan- European level.  Trust and security in the digital world are the very foundations of a Digital Single Market (DSM)7. The DSM  strategy aims to open up digital opportunities for people and business and enhance Europe's position as a  world leader in the digital economy. The European Commission has identified the completion of the DSM as  4 \"A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe\" COM(2015)192, European Commission, (2015)  http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-communication_en.pdf  5 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/docs/pg_en.pdf.  6 Network and Information Security in the Finance Sector.

The 2013 European Commission proposal for a Network and Information Security  (NIS) Directive 9 aims to ensure a high, common level of cybersecurity in the EU, by:   Improving Member States' national cybersecurity capabilities   Improving cooperation between Member States, and between public and private sectors   Requiring companies in critical sectors – such as energy, transport, finance and health – as well as  key Internet services to adopt risk management practices and report major incidents to the national  authorities  Another important initiative from the European Commission is the Capital Markets Union 10(CMU). With the  CMU, the Commission will explore ways of reducing fragmentation in financial markets, diversifying  financing sources, strengthening cross border capital flows and improving access to finance for businesses,  particularly SMEs. The CMU is a new frontier of Europe’s single market and is included in the political  guidelines announced11 by the Juncker Commission.  Finally, there is a large body of related work on the security and governance aspects of cloud computing,  including ENISA work related to this analysis:   Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Recommendations for Information Security12, which covers the  evaluation of security risks of migrating to the cloud, legal considerations and the ENISA Cloud  Computing Information Assurance Framework13   Security and Resilience in Governmental Clouds14, which provides a guide for public bodies in the  definition of their security and resilience requirements, and how to evaluate and choose from the  different cloud computing service delivery models   ENISA’s survey of current practice in public procurement15, which covers over 140 public  organisations across Europe   Procure Secure16, a guide to monitoring of security service levels in cloud contracts   Critical Cloud Computing17, a Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) perspective on  cloud computing services  8 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/network-and-information-security-nis-directive.  9 \"Concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union\"  COM(2013)48, European Commission (2013) http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1666  10 http://ec.europa.eu/finance/capital-markets-union/index_en.htm  11 http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/docs/pg_en.pdf.  12 Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Recommendations for Information Security.

The collection of data was based on:   Desktop Research. This included sources such as: 1) studies and reports from relevant analysts, 2)  blogs, web articles, white papers available on the Internet, 3) scientific publications, and 4) vendor- specific white papers (a complete list of references can be found in Annexes 1 and 4)   Surveys and interviews. Two questionnaires were developed, one addressed to FIs and CSPs and  another to NFSAs (see Annexes 2 and 3 respectively). In order to ensure the quality and plausibility  of the surveys, the questions were reviewed by a selected group of individual representing the three  categories to be surveyed. The questionnaires were used to survey a list of contacts including 83  representatives of FIs, 40 CSPs and 24 NFSAs. During the survey’s phases, information was initially  collected in written form and then, based on the participants’ availability, discussed in a phone  interview.  A total of 42 organisations participated in the survey (24 FIs, 6 CSPs and 12 NFSAs), and a total of 24  interviews were conducted (13 with FIs, 1 CSP and 10 with NFSAs). We have tried to contact many  more organizations from all parties (FIs, NFSA and CSPs) and from different member states. Due to  time limitations only the ones that have responded to us, have been included in the survey and the  interviews.  The information collected from research, surveys and interviews was consolidated and analysed to support  developing the conclusions and recommendations. The content and structure of the designed surveys drove  the analysis of the data collected.  1.5 Document structure  This document is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the current state and approach of the financial  industry to cloud computing, incentives and benefits, regulatory environment, risks and challenges and  mitigation measures. It also contains the analysis of risks and opportunities from the perspective of different  stakeholders. Section 3 details the relevant outcomes from the state of the art survey and desktop research,  and also introduces the underlying roles and definitions to be used in this report. Section 4 summarizes the  main conclusions and recommendations drawn from this report. Annexes 2 and 3 present the questionnaire  used during the interviews with the selected representatives from FIs, NFSAs and CSPs.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  11  2. Cloud adoption in the European Finance Sector  2.1 Current state and approach to cloud computing  The European financial industry is still in its early stages of cloud adoption. Many FIs use a limited range of  cloud based services. Their approach using cloud based services is not strategically placed and in some cases  they may be unaware that their services are cloud based.  As shown in Figure 1, almost 88% of FIs are already using cloud based services before June 2015, and 81%  were aware these were cloud-based and their implications. In approximately 1 out of 4 organisations  consulted, there were business units using cloud based services without the involvement of the respective  IT department (“shadow IT”).  Figure 1 - Has the organisation you work for ever used cloud services?  Confirming the relatively low level of maturity of the adoption of cloud-based services by the finance sector,  only 50% of finance sector involved in this study already have an explicit cloud strategy. The most common  approaches use a hybrid of Private Cloud and Public Cloud (50%). Rather common (42%) is also the practice  of relying on in-house IT and moving non-critical services (e.g., email management, collaboration and  content management tools) to a cloud based service. Some organisations are using cloud based service as a  testing environment and to develop use cases to better assess a hybrid of Public Cloud and in-house, on- premises hosting of cloud-based services. Public Cloud is also used by those FIs as test beds for new  applications.  It must be stated that according to the results of our survey, a small percentage (8%) of FIs have chosen a  strict Private Cloud only policy. The main reasons are privacy and compliance concerns, as well as the  confidence that a Private Cloud can satisfy the business requirements of the organization. The vast majority  (92%) of the organisations with an already developed strategy rely on a hybrid of Public and Private Cloud  hosted both externally and also as in-house IT services. This is a sign of growing confidence towards the  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  12  adoption of cloud based services. However, we have noted a certain level of prudency when it comes to  moving critical services to the cloud. Some are avoiding moving core banking activities to the cloud, instead  opting to use it for the digital transformation of their business.  42% of FIs participating in this study either do not have an explicit cloud strategy or are just now in the early  stages of developing one.  The main reasons21 for FIs not having a well-defined cloud strategy are:  • Regulation restrictions that prevent financial institutions from using the cloud  (50%)  • Lack of strategic approach to cloud computing within the organisation (30%)  • Concerns over public breach notification (20%)  • Doubts about the real value of Cloud Computing (20%)  • Lack of interest - resources to assess the cloud opportunities (10%)  • Concerns over government surveillance (10%)  Finally, around 8% of the FIs have a no-cloud strategy, i.e., either they will not adopt cloud based services or  they have not yet had the time or resources to address this topic.  The main reasons22 for FIs having a no-cloud approach are:  •  Security concerns (100%)  •  Privacy concerns (100%)  •  Legal/Regulatory/Supervision compliance (100%)  •  Cloud providers do not comply with our internal policies (100%)  •  We are waiting for a wider adoption from the industry (50%)  The majority (60%) of the NFSAs declared to have a conservative or very conservative adoption of new  technologies such as cloud. However, 40% considered themselves to be progressive or very progressive  when referring to the adoption of cloud based services.  Almost half of NFSAs declared to have a level of knowledge of cloud computing that can be described as  medium (27%) or poor (18%). It must also be pointed out that NFSAs declared similar levels of expertise with  regard to information security (64% claim proficient/expert, but 36% have a medium or poor level of  knowledge on the matter).  21 These are not cumulative to 100%, as participants could choose more than one reason in response to this survey  question.  22 These are not cumulative to 100%, as participants could choose more than one reason in response to this survey  question.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  13  Finally, the low level of maturity within the  Finance sector- with regards to the adoption of  cloud based services- is evidenced by the  answers provided by the NFSAs. The general  perception of the NFSAs is that the level of  adoption of cloud based services in the finance  sector is low (64%) or very low (18%), and only  18% believe that the level of adoption is medium  or high. This suggests that the NFSAs seem to be  aware that cloud based services are still in the  early stages of adoption within a Financial  Institution. However, this underestimates the  real level of cloud adoption.  For example the experience of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) is much closer to that of the FIs. In their  opinion, only 1 out of 5 FIs are already using cloud based services. CSPs report that the FIs they interacted  with have either developed a clear cloud strategy, or have developed one during the design phase of a cloud  adoption project.  The top public cloud services/applications that are being adopted provide a snapshot of what organisations  are leveraging from current cloud providers. As seen from Figure 2a, the services most often bought by FIs  from public CSPs are (1) email management23, (2) business management24 and (3) application development/  test environment. From the NFSAs standpoint, the most appropriate services that FIs should buy from  providers of Public cloud based services are instead (1) application development/ test environment, (2)  business management and (3) email management. From CSP experience with the FIs, the most often used  public cloud services are (1) application development/ test environment, (2) mobile security elements, and  many others.  23 E-mail and spam management  24 Collaboration and content management platforms, CRM, HR, ERP, Marketing and Customer support/ticketing  Since security and privacy are considered as  two of the main reasons preventing a wider  adoption of cloud, it is clear that a better  understanding within NFSAs about cloud  based services, information security and the  cyber security risks related to cloud adoption,  would greatly help the market to mature and  improve.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  14  Figure 2a - Adoption of Public cloud based services  It is significant to note the inconsistencies between the opinions of FIs, CSPs and NFSAs with respect to which  services should be bought from Public Clouds. While it is true that the three different groups have different  priorities in mind, it is also true that email management and application development/test environment  services rank very high in their assessments.  It should be noted that 23% of the participating NFSAs believe that Public cloud services should never be  used in the finance sector.  Figure 2b –Adoption of externally hosted, Private cloud based services  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  15  When it comes to the use of Private cloud based services (Figure 2b), it appears that FIs are mostly adopting  (1) Application development/ test environment and (2) Processing & Analytics25. NFSAs believe that most  Private cloud based services are appropriate, with (1) Financial services and (2) Mobile Security Elements  being on top of the list. As seen from Figures 2a and 2b, NFSAs feel much more comfortable with the use of  Private cloud over Public cloud. Again, CSP experience with FIs is that the Private cloud services that are used  most often are (1) Processing & Analytics and (2) Business management.  By comparing the information depicted in Figure 2a and 2b, it is clear that while CSPs believe that Public  cloud is fit for the FI’s purpose, NFSAs for FIs are more in favour of using Private cloud. More neutral, and  perhaps more informed and less biased, is the opinion of the FIs.  The messages that we can derive from the FIs’ answers is that they prefer doing email management in a  Public cloud rather than in a Private cloud, and that both Private and public clouds are suitable environments  for application development and testing.  The strongest divergence between FIs, NFSAs and CSPs is related to the use of mobile security elements:  from the viewpoint of the CSPs mobile security could be moved into the Public cloud, possibly to be offered  a Security as a Service, while from the point of view of NFSAs those services should be provided from a  Private cloud (possibly to guarantee scalability and keep full control as seen in Figure 2b). Finally from the  point of view of FIs, mobile security elements are suitable for neither the Public nor the Private cloud.  2.2 Examples of cloud adoption in the Finance sector  In this section we provide several examples of how European supervisory authorities have been addressing  some of the challenges from cloud based services, and how FIs are adopting cloud based services.  National Supervisory Authorities  DNB - The Dutch banking regulator  In 2012, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Netherlands’ national banking regulator, was one of the  initiators in Europe that enacted legislation allowing FIs to use cloud based services.  Now, DNB has included Amazon Web Services (AWS) for use by the country’s finance sector, clarifying key  supervision criteria (see “Guideline” below) for Dutch organisations looking to move infrastructure or  services to the AWS cloud. The DNB’s announcement means that Dutch banks and other FIs are if they  comply to those guidelines now permitted to use AWS, Salesforce, IBM, KPN and Microsoft Azure26 for a  range of services including websites, mobile applications, retail banking platforms, high performance  computing and credit risk analysis solutions.  The guidelines require that the DNB be allowed to oversee and confirm that the IT infrastructure (including  cloud infrastructure) used by financial firms is compliant with its regulations. DNB confirmed that use of AWS  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) meets this requirement. However, it has said that the FIs must still meet  other requirements, such as carrying out a standard risk analysis for their use of IaaS cloud based services.  25 Processing capacity, data analysis and Intelligence, big data, storage/disaster recovery/data archiving, virtual  desktops  26 http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/dutch-regulator-de-nederlandsche-bank-makes-cloud-migration-a- seamless-reality/ .Last accessed 30th November 2015  http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/dutch-regulator-de-nederlandsche-bank-makes-cloud-migration-a-seamless-reality/ http://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/dutch-regulator-de-nederlandsche-bank-makes-cloud-migration-a-seamless-reality/  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  16  The DNB guidelines require27 institutions to:   report their intention to use cloud computing to DNB beforehand   draw up a risk analysis   also meet the requirements laid down in the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht  – Wft)   allow DNB the right to examine the bank   make sure exit clauses are included in the contract  FINMA - Swiss Banking Regulator  FINMA exercises prudential and risk-oriented supervision over banks and securities dealers. As a financial  regulator it aims at protecting creditors and maintaining the stability of the financial system. Therefore, it  centres on ensuring that licensing, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements, are met at all times.  FINMA's level of supervision is most intensive in areas where risk is greatest. It assigns banks, insurance  companies, collective investment schemes, self-regulatory organisations (SROs) and directly subordinated  financial intermediaries (DSFIs) to six different supervisory categories depending on their size, complexity  and risk structure.  When shortcomings arise and licensed institutions break the rules, FINMA orders appropriate measures to  enforce supervisory law28.  FINMA has allowed the use of cloud based services in Switzerland and the most prevalent are those offered  by Safe Swiss Cloud. Safe Swiss Cloud claims to be a safe and secure cloud computing service based in  Switzerland that offers innovative compute, storage and managed cloud services. They emphasize the  privacy of customers29 by committing to not share data with third parties, to fully comply with to Swiss30 and  EU laws31 on data protection and data transfer.  Moreover FINMA adopts a risk-based approach32 to asset management. There are six different supervisory  categories to which licence holders are assigned, depending on their potential risk impact on creditors,  investors, the system as a whole and the reputation of the Swiss financial centre. Licence holders of major  and global systemic importance that are exposed to significant risks are assigned to Category 1. The risk  potential of the institutions in the other categories decreases gradually down to Category 5. Market  participants in Category 6 are not placed under prudential supervision since they are considered very low  risk. Such an approach is also relevant to cloud computing.  27 DNB. (2015).

It has provided online banking services since  1996, when they pioneered the offering of real-time stock market operations. More than 60% of Bankinter  transactions are performed through remote channels, and 46% of those transactions are conducted over  the Internet.  Bankinter uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an integral part of their credit-risk simulation application,  developing complex algorithms to simulate diverse scenarios in order to evaluate the financial health of  Bankinter clients. According to the Bankinter Director of Technological Innovation, they perform at least  5,000,000 simulations to get realistic results. Bankinter uses the flexibility and power of Amazon Elastic  Compute Cloud (EC2) to perform these simulations, subdividing processes through a grid of AWS EC2  instances, and implementing simulations in parallel on several AWS EC2 instances to obtain the result in a  very short time period.  Through the use of AWS, Bankinter decreased the average time-to-solution from 23 hours to 20 minutes and  dramatically reduced processing (and cost), with the capability to reduce even further when needed.  Bankinter reports that the AWS platform, with its unlimited and flexible computational power, is a good fit  for their risk-simulation process requirements. They are empowered to decide how quickly to obtain  simulation results. More importantly, they say that they have the ability to run simulations that were not  before possible due to the large amount of infrastructure required34.  ING  ING is using cloud-based software from ServiceNow to deliver HR services to its 25,000 staff in the  Netherlands. ServiceNow and ING built a branded portal to give staff access to information and to automate  previously manual tasks. ING previously used call centres and face-to-face interactions for most HR  enquiries. Now a self-service portal gives employees faster and easier access to a knowledge base with over  1,200 articles on topics such as health and compensation. This improved user satisfaction and reduced the  cost and time of providing services. ING sees ServiceNow as a key partner in their transformation efforts35.  33 https://www.bankinter.com/www2/particulares/es/inicio/bienvenida  34 Amazon Web Services. AWS Case Study: Bankinter.

Figure 3a – Which Public cloud based services are you interested in adopting?  It appears that FIs do not see particular benefits in the use of Public cloud based services. The only use cases  in which they see some value are application development/test environment (25%) and email management  (19%). NFSAs appear to have similar opinions, as they believe that Public cloud is fit for application  development/test environment (64%) as well as email management (45%) and business management (45%).  It might come as a surprise that NFSAs seem to see more benefits in the use of Public cloud (e.g. for business  management and e-mail management services) than the FIs themselves. FIs are somewhat open in using  public cloud for collaboration and content management platforms (29%), and e-mail (29%), but beyond  these services the interest in Public cloud based services is generally lower.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  19  Figure 3b - Which Private cloud based services are you interested in adopting?  Similar to what we see in the Public cloud based services, FIs do not have high interest in adopting Private  cloud based services, as the highest interest has been again noted in application development/test  environment (29%) and while the interest in business management services is generally low, 38% of  respondents were interested in collaboration and content management platforms. Based on the analysis of  the data reported in Figure 3a and 3b, adjusted on the basis of the input collected during the interviews, we  can state that both FIs and NFSAs see more benefits in the use of Private cloud rather than Public cloud.  Moreover, most NFSAs strongly support and believe that Private cloud based services are mostly  appropriate for use in finance sector, which represents an opportunity for growth in the cloud market.  In summary, by analysing the answers provided by FIs on their interest about Public and Private cloud, it is  evident that FIs generally consider application development and testing as the best possible use cases for  both Private and Public cloud. However, it is also noticeable that FIs perceive more benefits in the use of  Public clouds for email management and financial services applications.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  20  2.4 Incentives and Benefits  Our analysis shows that both financial institutions and supervisory authorities have a similar understanding  of the benefits that the cloud based services are offering.  Figure 4 - Primary reasons for adopting cloud computing  Some of the top reasons to move to the Cloud (Figure 4) are reduced total cost of ownership (TCO), reduced  time for provisioning, reduced time to market, and infrastructure and pricing flexibility. NFSAs also see  business continuity as one of the important incentives for adopting cloud based services. On the other hand,  NFSAs and almost 70% of the surveyed FIs do not consider mobility as an important reason for adopting the  cloud, whereas CSPs believe it is, together with business continuity and security, the biggest reasons for the  adoption of cloud computing services. However, CSPs do not believe that cloud computing can be leveraged  by FIs for optimisation of in-house technical and human resources, which is a primary reason for 45% of the  FIs.  It is worth highlighting that neither FIs nor NFSAs  consider information security as one of main benefits  and incentives for adopting cloud based services,  although security is considered as very important  factor from the CSPs perspective. This might be due to  the fact that the security measures provided by the  CSPs are not very well communicated to the NFSAs  and the FIs. The opinion of the FIs and NFSAs seems  to be in contradiction not only with that of the CSPs,  In general it appears that while both FIs and  NFSAs are aware of benefits that cloud brings  (specialization, economy of scale, flexibility),  they are not willing to take the chance of losing  over what is arguably the most valuable asset  for a financial institution: the information.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  21  but also with the perspective of other relevant experts (including ENISA) as stated in published reports (e.g.  ENISA Cloud Risk Assessment36) regarding the security benefits of cloud based services. Some NFSAs say that  better security is a benefit brought by cloud based services only for small FIs.  2.5 Regulatory Environment  Supervisory authorities around Europe are aware that an increasing number of FIs are adopting or  considering the use of cloud based services. From the NFSA’s perspective, it is important to understand the  prudential statutory and subsidiary legislation relevant to cloud based services. In general, from the NFSAs’  point of view, cloud based services are considered as a form of outsourcing and therefore the same rules  apply to cloud based services as for outsourced services. Moreover, it appears that most of NFSAs are very  cautious towards cloud base services, recommending the use of Private cloud over Public cloud, which they  view as a suitable option only for non critical services.  Despite the fact that some NFSAs around Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Finland) have  published opinions related to outsourcing/cloud based services, it appears that the financial industry is  dealing with a lack of clear, formal guidance that is consistent across all NFSAs on the specificities of cloud  based services.  For instance, half of the participating NFSAs request that FIs notify them when adopting cloud services only  if moving critical services or sensitive data (50%). However, this cannot be considered a general rule. Some  NFSAs require to be notified always (33%), and just some of them when migrating to a Public cloud (8%).  Our respondents have described various cases  in which the need to notify NFSAs about the  adoption of cloud based services has caused  severe delays, or even blocked the prospective  use of cloud services in their FIs. This on one  hand is because information was not provided  by the CSPs, but on the other hand also due to  lack of guidance from the NFSAs on what  specific information to be provided.  It appears reasonable to assume that those issues could have been mitigated by increasing the level of  understanding of NFSAs about cloud based services and CSPs providing more specific information, which  calls for better understanding, increased CSP transparency and a more structured and strategic approach  from FIs and NFSAs. There is still a smaller group of NFSAs (8%) that have no specific requirements on the  matter.  However, however they do appreciate voluntary notification by the FIs.  About 70% of participating FIs indicate that they have engaged with regulatory bodies in discussions about  requirements for the adoption of cloud based services in the finance sector. Several FIs are following specific  regulations and standards to govern the migration to the cloud. These specific regulatory requirements are  presented in Figure 5. The vast majority of the FIs need to comply with data protection legislations and other  specific national regulations issued by individual NFSAs (e.g., IT service providers based in Luxembourg and  offering IT operation services to a FI must obtain a license of finance sector professionals, also known as  Support PSF to provide a secure and confidential processing of the data in Luxembourg). The Payment Card  36 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  A lack of formal guidelines for cloud based  services, and the lack of mature evaluation  processes, has forced the relevant NFSAs to  perform evaluation that cause severe delays or  even block the prospective use of cloud based  services by FIs.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  22  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is certainly another very important sector-specific standard with  which the majority of the FIs must comply.  Figure 5 - Notable regulations - FI perspective  It appears that CSPs do not overly emphasise the importance of national regulations and PCI-DSS. Based on  the experience they have in dealing with the FIs, the two most important regulatory requirements are data  protection and corporate governance.  The fact that CSPs, FIs and NFSAs have such a different view and understanding of the relevance of national  regulations for cloud based services seems to confirm that the finance sector is in the need of better  guidance and better communication between the relevant players.  It should be noted however that even if there is still work to be done from the NFSAs’ side, some virtuous  examples already exists, for instance the DNB in the Netherlands. The Dutch Authority has provided formal  guidance that states37:  “When using third-party cloud computing services, the supervised institution is subject to the legal  requirements that apply to outsourcing:  37 http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/binaries/51-224828.pdf  http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/en/binaries/51-224828.pdf  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  23   Risks must be demonstrably known and mitigated, and   Outsourcing to third parties may not obstruct supervision.  Before a supervised institution proceeds to engage in cloud computing, DNB expects to be informed of this  prospective outsourcing arrangement. DNB will ask the supervised institution to submit its risk analysis  concerning cloud computing for assessment in the context of risk-based supervision.”  Furthermore, DNB requests that explicit attention is given to risks associated with, among other things, data  integrity, confidentiality and availability. DNB also requires assurance with regards to the location where the  business data are to be processed and stored. In the event that the supervised institution interrupts the use  of third party services, it must secure all data and verify that they have been removed from the third party’s  systems. The DNB has also defined the requirements for cloud computing risk assessment. Banks are  required to prepare a risk assessment using a risk analysis framework38 and contractually agree to a ‘right to  examine.’ The ENISA Cloud Computing Security Risk Assessment is one that is known to have been used  among others as well. The requirements set out in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) also have to be  met.  An area where there is consistency in the approaches of the various NFSAs is risk assessment and  management. All the NFSAs require FIs to provide evidence that the information security risks connected to  the use of cloud based services are properly identified, assessed, treated and communicated.  For instance, BaFin 40requires that, in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG) and  the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk), FIs ensure the integrity,  availability, authenticity and confidentiality of data within their IT systems and IT  processes. In recent years, BaFin has increased its efforts in the area of IT security. Special  audits have helped to raise awareness about IT security amongst the FIs.  38 http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/binaries/50-228202.pdf  39 http://www.prarulebook.co.uk/rulebook/Content/Part/214147/11-09-2015  40 http://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffen- tlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2013/fa_bj_2013_11_it_sicherheit_en.html  DNB has agreed to a ‘right to examine’ with various parties, including KPN, Microsoft, IBM,  Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce.com. This ‘right to examine’ (right to audit) is a  standard clause in the contracts that Dutch financial institutions use for cloud services  provided by these CSPs. This allows financial institutions to meet one of the statutory  requirements for cloud services.  In Germany, BaFin requires FIs to maintain full audit rights for its external and internal  auditors. The same requirement applies for BaFin too when outsourcing to a provider. Any  CSPs that are not willing to grant these rights cannot serve the German banks.  Bank of England requires FIs to make available on request to the Prudential Regulation  Authority (PRA), as well as to any other relevant competent authority, all information  necessary to enable competent authority to supervise the compliance of the performance of  the outsourced activities with the requirements of the regulatory system.39  http://www.toezicht.dnb.nl/binaries/50-228202.pdf http://www.prarulebook.co.uk/rulebook/Content/Part/214147/11-09-2015 http://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2013/fa_bj_2013_11_it_sicherheit_en.html http://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2013/fa_bj_2013_11_it_sicherheit_en.html  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  24  Banking supervision in Germany covers all risks related to the IT management/control,  availability, confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the data, internal control system  of the IT organisation, IT strategy, and the use of information technology. BaFin has noted  the challenge to maintain IT security at a high level when the framework conditions  change. As many FIs have outsourced their IT, BaFin believes that it is crucial for them to  integrate the service provider in their information security management  functions/systems, since the same requirements apply irrespective of whether the IT  systems and processes are managed by the FIs themselves or by service providers.  Financial institutions in Luxembourg are required to have a minimum internal IT capacity, which is  proportionate to their business and system complexity. 41  CSSF in Luxembourg requires FIs to follow at least three prudential principles:  • The financial institutions shall always have their activities under control from a  technical and operational perspective;  • The risks shall be correctly assessed, reduced, transferred or accepted;  • The residual risks shall be known and accepted.  41 http://www.cssf.lu/filead-min/files/Publications/Rapports_annuels/Rapport_2011/RA2011_chapter_10_eng.pdf  42 http://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/vigilanza/normativa/archivio-norme/circolari/c263/263CIRC_15AGG.pdf  Bank of Italy42 (BOI) requires FIs to choose CSPs on the basis of an analysis of the risk, which should  include an estimate of:  • The risks connected to the resources and services to be outsourced  • The risks attaching to possible suppliers  • The quality of sub-contractors  • The redundancy of the lines of communication used  • The reliability, security and scalability of the technologies adopted  BOI also requires FIs to know the location of data centres and the number of staff that have access  to confidential data or critical components, with the outsourcer obliged to update the data  periodically.  Finally, BOI warn FIs to be especially cautious in evaluating CSP offerings. The regulator believes  that in the case of acquisition of community or public cloud services, the potential risks are greater  and may require a more complex system of controls, especially when critical components are  outsourced. It is important that the locations of the data centres be notified in advance, and  adequate mechanisms must be provided for isolating each client’s data to protect their  confidentiality and integrity. CSPs must contractually guarantee to comply with the agreed levels of  service, including in emergencies or when other clients call for resources. CSPs should also ensure  that data access and modifications can be fully reconstructed, including for inspections. According  to BOI, FIs must agree on adequate audit procedures with the CSP.  http://www.bancaditalia.it/compiti/vigilanza/normativa/archivio-norme/circolari/c263/263CIRC_15AGG.pdf  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  25  NFSAs have noted that CSPs are proactively working to improve the level of transparency, but they still note  differences between the approach that different CSPs have, and their ability to provide the sufficient level  of transparency. As NFSAs require access to sufficient information to be able to understand risk exposure of  FIs, there is an increased tendency to use a certification scheme for CSPs as a starting point for achieving  compliance.  Finally, as banking groups with a global or pan-European presence have started using cloud computing,  NFSAs started to consider cloud services as systemic services, and to be concerned with concentration of  risk. Therefore, while some NFSAs have no interest to regulate the CSPs directly, some of them have  expressed the potential need to oversee providers who are offering critical services to banks with a global  presence, as they represent a source of systemic risk.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  26  3. Risks and Challenges  3.1 Security concerns  The study shows a continued concern over security issues related to cloud. NFSAs unanimously agree that  risks related to in-house IT can be much easier controlled and operationally managed than in the Cloud. With  security concerns being a key consideration when adopting cloud services, we asked respondents to rank a  list of common security risks on scale of one to five (with five being the greatest concern).  Figure 6 - Cloud computing security concerns ranked  The FIs have many security concerns related to cloud based services, but they are especially worried about  data confidentiality, data breach, and compliance and legal issues. The NFSAs however perceive loss of  governance, lack of transparency and lack of auditing features as additional top risks, in addition to those  mentioned by FIs.  CSPs report that when they discuss security concerns with FIs, usually data breach, integrity and availability  are top the list. It is worth noticing that lack of forensic capabilities is not considered as a particularly relevant  issue, and generally all other risks are substantially less relevant than those expressed by FIs and NFSAs.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  27  Similarly to other economic sectors43, security concerns are considered the main limiting factor for cloud  adoption in the finance sector (see Section 3.1). Analysing the answers provided to risk-related questions, it  appears that NFSAs are generally more concerned than FIs. The biggest differences in perception noted are  loss of control of the data (governance), integrity, lack of transparency and lack of auditing features.  Figure 7 - Have you or your team developed a detailed corporate risk assessment of  Cloud Computing?  3.2 Corporate Risk Assessment  Despite the fact that FIs seem to be aware of specific risks connected to the use of cloud computing and that  NFSAs are requiring that supervised institutions to identify, assess and mitigate the risks, 46% of the  respondents have not developed a detailed corporate risk assessment for cloud computing.  Such high percentage of FIs without a developed corporate risk management strategy for cloud computing  is not surprising considering that, as noted in Section 3.1, 42% of the FIs do not have a fully structured cloud  strategy.  The lack of clear and formal regulatory guidance could be another explanation  of the fact that despite 88% of FIs having already used cloud services, 46% have  not developed a detailed corporate risk assessment.  43 http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_- _statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  28  From our standpoint, some further guidance from NFSAs could improve the situation and facilitate the  adoption of cloud services in the finance sector while meeting the regulatory requirements. Various FIs find  ENISA Cloud Computing Security Risk Assessment as a helpful tool on the market for developing a corporate  risk assessment for cloud based services. Additionally, some of the respondents have identified Technology  Risk Management Guidelines44 issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as very useful to better guide  for addressing existing and emerging technology risks.  Figure 8 - Main challenges to cloud based services  Finally we asked CSPs and FIs which are the main challenges to their adoption of cloud based services.  Their opinions from these interested parties are divergent. In fact from the FIs standpoint, regulatory  obligations represent by far the biggest challenge during the migration to cloud-based services. For the  CSPs however, the most complex challenge relates to the migration of high frequency trading  solutions. In contrast, high frequency trading solutions are not seen as a challenge to FIs, perhaps  because they are not planning to move these applications in the cloud. We believe it is important to  note that while a third of the FIs recognise that log collection and analysis in cloud is an issue,  44 http://www.mas.gov.sg/regulations-and-financial-stability/regulatory-and-supervisory-framework/risk- management/technology-risk.aspx  http://www.mas.gov.sg/regulations-and-financial-stability/regulatory-and-supervisory-framework/risk-management/technology-risk.aspx http://www.mas.gov.sg/regulations-and-financial-stability/regulatory-and-supervisory-framework/risk-management/technology-risk.aspx  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  29  particularly in Public Clouds, the CSPs do not share the same opinion and they appear to judge the  challenge of log collection as completely irrelevant. These divergent opinions seem to reflect the need  of FIs to be in direct control of what happens in the cloud (and logs are a good tool for that).  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  30  4. Security requirements and mitigation measures  In this section we provide an analysis of the security requirements both from the point of view of FIs and  CSPs. We report and analyse the security measures that NFSAs, FIs and CSPs would like to adopt within the  finance sector.  4.1 Security requirements  When adopting (or planning) cloud services, financial institutions are strictly requiring:   Thoroughly implemented security measures (75%)   Deep auditing permission in case of incident (63%)   Penalty clauses in case of incident (54%)   Not moving client data to the cloud (50%)  Figure 9 - Security requirements  CSPs mostly confirm that FIs ask for thoroughly implemented security measures, deep auditing permission  in case of incident, and not moving client data to the cloud. However, it appears that penalty clauses in case  of incidents are not required from FIs.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  31  Isolating answers from smaller CSPs from those of leading European providers, it appears that FIs demand  more from small CSPs, from whom they usually require deep auditing permission in case of an incident.  Moreover, FIs do not move client data into clouds of smaller providers. FIs also seem more able to enforce  penalty clauses in case of incidents to small CSPs, which is not the case with big providers. However it should  be noted that we cannot consider this statistically significant since the sample of CSPs used was too small.  In previous sections we have already noted that many NFSAs still have concerns about the adoption of cloud  based services by FIs. Those concerns are reflected by the fact that NFSAs require FIs to follow strict security  requirements, starting with a risk assessment of security measures that need to be implemented.  Due to those stringent requirements and supervision by NFSAs, compliance is a crucial operating  requirement for FIs, and cloud adoption must be considered within the context of maintaining regulatory  compliance. This study found that organisations typically approach compliance assurance with cloud  providers through these means:   Specific contract clauses (92%)   SLAs (83%)   Certification (71%)   Audits (29%)  Figure 10 - Ensuring compliance by service providers  During the interviews we identified two challenges for FIs in their compliance efforts:   Lack of negotiation power. FIs do not have enough power when negotiating specific  contract clauses with large CSPs.   Perceived limitation in the area of certification. While FIs see high value in attestation,  e.g. SOC 2, or audits performed by NFSAs, there are mixed feelings about certification  of cloud services. On one hand, there is consensus that certifications provide high  value and are a good means for CSPs to assure their compliance with standards. On  the other hand, it appears that financial market players are sceptical towards existing  cloud certification schemes, especially due to lack of information about the relevance  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  32  of existing cloud security standards to the financial market. The latter suggest a clear  awareness gap since governance and assurance standards specifically developed for  and aimed at the cloud already exist, and some of them are considered mature enough  to be adopted. ISO 2700145 and PCI-DSS46 are the most commonly used standards, but  various FIs express that cloud-specific certification frameworks would be a more  helpful approach to compliance.  Additionally, ENISA has developed two specific tools for supporting security awareness  in the cloud:   Cloud Certification Schemes List (CCSL)47 is a list of existing certification schemes  relevant to cloud computing customers. CCSL provides potential customers with an  overview of objective characteristics per scheme, to help them understand how the  scheme works and if it is appropriate for their setting. CCSL is being improved  continuously and updated by ENISA and stakeholders from industry and public sector.   Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework (CCSM)48, is a framework that collects  public sector security requirements and groups them into 27 security objectives. These  security objectives are then mapped against the cloud certification schemes included  in the CCSL. The goal of CCSM is to provide more transparency and help customers in  the public sector with their procurement of cloud computing services.  Furthermore, experience of CSPs shows that for FIs sometimes the biggest obstacle in overcoming the risk  of cloud computing comes from the misconceptions about the technology. It behoves CSPs to be more  transparent about their cloud offerings.  45 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm  46 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php  47 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  48 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  33  4.2 Mitigation Measures  To mitigate the risks introduced by adoption of cloud computing, FI’s willingness to engage has much to do  with whether the cloud services offer specific functions and features. Some of these functions and features  are needed for improving trust, and others are needed for security and compliance purposes.  Figure 11 - Top features desired from cloud providers  The top desired features are depicted in Figure 11. NFSAs would generally desire more security features than  the FIs, however the only area where NFSAs are less interested was forensics and e-discovery. FIs consider  those features as important. CSPs noted that the majority of desired features shown in Figure 9 are being  driven by privacy requirements.  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  34  We conclude from this data that some FIs are making a priori decisions about  not using the cloud for sensitive data rather, than basing their decision on a  mature analysis and assessment of the risks.  Figure 12 - Mitigation measures adopted  When asked about the mitigation measures implemented during migration to cloud services, the  majority of respondents requested from their CSPs specific contract clauses such as right to audit,  develop exit strategies, require information assurance and security certifications, thoroughly  implemented security measures and clearly defined SLAs. It is clearly visible that NFSAs want a much  stricter approach than the FIs are taking, although this should be noted as normal as this is due to their  nature being not for profit, but prudence based. However, they are much less reluctant about moving  client (vs. the FI’s) data to the cloud, assuming that a risk assessment has been performed and the risks  adequately mitigated. The percentage of FIs who have not moved client data to the cloud is consistent  with the number of FIs who have not developed a detailed corporate risk assessment for cloud based  services (Figure 7).  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  35  5. Recommendations  In this section we provide a list of recommendations addressed mainly to FIs and regulators. The recommendations  are grouped into four key areas: collaboration, risks based approach, transparency and assurance and information  campaigns.  5.1 Cooperation between FIs, NFSA and CSPs  This study highlights the fact that in countries where there is effective communication and collaboration  between FIs, NFSAs and CSPs the cloud market is able to evolve more quickly. Therefore we recommend  that FIs to engage with CSPs and NFSAs, with the following objectives:  1. NFSAs to define national good practices and (de-facto) standards in the areas of cloud governance and  risk management for the adoption of Cloud computing in the finance sector.  2. NFSAs to define good practices and de-facto standards for incident information sharing. On-going  efforts, such as those conducted at the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS- ISAC), have limitations both in terms of geographic spread and in level of details of the information  being shared. Therefore NFSAs with the help of FIs and CSPs should focus on mechanisms to increase  the level of trust between the members of the information sharing platform, and consequently increase  the amount and level of detail of the incident information.  Referring to the previous point, we recommend that NFSAs work together at the global and European levels  to define a set of common good practices for cloud security and privacy. Priority should be given to:  3. NFSAs with the help of EU Institutions (EBA, EC) to create harmony between legal and regulatory  requirements. We recommend a consolidated approach to regulation of cloud computing in Europe.  While supervisory authorities in Europe seem to have similar attitude with regards to cloud computing,  their approach to the regulation varies significantly. Harmonising current national legislations, and  defining baseline requirements and guidance on cloud computing throughout the European finance  sector, would decrease the effort required for all parties involved.  It would also provide much needed  clear/formal regulatory positions on cloud computing to FIs, which would enable successful cloud  adoption projects across multiple regulatory jurisdictions in Europe. Furthermore, with clear and  consolidated guidance from supervisory authorities, FIs will be able to develop detailed corporate risk  assessments and strategies for cloud computing, while clearly understanding the prudential statutory  and subsidiary legislation relevant to the subject of cloud computing. Baseline regulatory requirements  should addressing confidentiality, integrity, availability and location of data. Contractual right to audit  clauses should be considered as a baseline assurance mechanism for FIs. Supervisory authorities should  agree on a consensus approach to oversee CSPs, ideally through existing assurance mechanisms  available in the industry, coupled with additional guidance specific for financial industry.  4. Minimum security and privacy requirements for the adoption of cloud based services: We recommend  that regulators work on the definition of the security and privacy requirements/principles that should  be adopted by FIs when adopting cloud services. Those requirements should reflect the different level  of service criticality and impact (e.g., a service moderate impact would require the implementation of  baseline requirements). The definition of criticality / impact levels for services and corresponding  security and privacy requirements would offer several benefits such as:  a. Support smaller FIs and CSPs in their cloud risk assessment and management approach  Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector  December 2015  36  b. Help CSPs develop a standard offering depending on the level of criticality of services  c. Provide FIs and CSPs with a uniform set of baseline security requirements to support the security  interoperability between services  Organisations such as ENISA Information Assurance Framework49), and NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 450 have  already developed security controls frameworks that are sufficiently mature and could be used to derive  minimum security and privacy requirements for the finance sector. An increased collaboration between  NFSAs is desirable also in relation to cloud systemic risks we referred to earlier.  5. Policy makers (EC, EBA, ENISA) to identify existing and/or create new European / global mechanisms for  security and privacy compliance, including possible further enhancements of existing certifications and  certification practices.  5.2 Risk-based approach (risk assessment/cloud strategy)  6. We recommend that FIs develop a cloud computing strategy in order to define their approach to cloud  computing. Organisations should adopt a risk-based approach when moving to the cloud, and their  strategy should be aligned with their corporate risk assessment. By understanding and evaluating their  assets they will be able to assess confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements for deployment  of cloud services within their organisation. Based on the security and risk requirements, organisations  should have a good idea of their comfort level for transitioning to the cloud, and which combinations  of deployment, service models and locations fit their risk tolerance. We recommend that FIs perform a  corporate risk assessment on cloud computing by using their corporate risk assessment framework, and  by leveraging existing cloud specific tools and methodologies.  5.3 Transparency & Assurance  7. In the section on Information Campaigns, we highlight the need to better inform both regulators and  FIs about the security risks and opportunities connected to the use of cloud computing. We believe that  both FIs and NFSAs are overly cautious in their approach to cloud computing due to misconceptions  about the technology. In order to address this issue, an increased level of transparency and trust is  needed. Thus, we recommend that CSPs continue their efforts to provide sufficient transparency and  help their customers and supervisory authorities understand the level of assurance that their cloud  offerings provide. Such an effort should be based on:  a. Mechanisms that align the classification of assets (services and information) of the customer with  the classification adopted by CSPs.  b. Information sharing about CSPs risk management process.  c. Statements and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) on security and privacy controls applied to the  service provided. These SLAs should be simple, unambiguous, measurable and comparable.  d. Right to audit, or alternatively show adherence to suitable security and privacy standards through  certification (or 3rd party assessment). This should be required especially in the cases of critical  services.  e. Create specific information documents addressed to supervisory authorities and financial service  risk/security/compliance/audit officers.  49 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance- framework/at_download/fullReport.

We recommend that the European Commission, other relevant European Agencies (e.g., EBA, ENISA)  as well as industry bodies work together to create information campaigns for the financial industry with  the following objectives:  a. Increasing the understanding of the NFSAs, other financial regulators and FIs on cloud based  services and their connected security risks as well as security benefits  b. Clarifying the differences between cloud based services and outsourcing  c. Clarifying the trade-offs between Public cloud, Private cloud, outsourcing and in-house IT  d. Explaining the tools, techniques, certifications, good practices and standards that, if adopted,  could facilitate safe adoption of cloud based services  e. Clarifying the role that security and privacy certifications could have on increasing the level of  trust in cloud services. As a starting point we recommend using specific tools, such as CCSL and  CCSM developed by ENISA, which will promote and understanding of the characteristics of  certification schemes, and how they accomplish security objectives.

CYBER  EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION  REPORT Findings from a cyber crisis  exercise in Europe  2  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 3  TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive summary 6 Key findings and recommendations 8  SECTION I  EXERCISE OVERVIEW 11  1.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 11 1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE 11 1.3 SET-UP 11 1.4 SCENARIO 13 1.5 PLANNING 13 1.6 EVALUATION PROCESS 15  4  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Cyber Europe 2016 was the fourth pan-European cyber crisis exercise organised by  the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). Over 1 000  participants working mostly in the ICT sector, from public and private organisations from  all 28 Member States of the European Union and two from the European Free Trade  Association (EFTA), joined in a programme of activities ranging from training sessions and  communication checks to technical competitions and cooperation exercises.  The exercise simulated a realistic crisis build-up over an actual period of 6 months,  culminating in a 48 hour event on 13 and 14 October 2016.  Cyber Europe 2016 was based on three pillars essential to the successful mitigation  of large-scale crises caused by cybersecurity incidents: cooperation at national and  international levels and sound cybersecurity capabilities.  First, the exercise fostered cooperation between targets of simulated cybersecurity  incidents, security providers and national authorities, shedding light on national-level  public–private and private–private cooperation. Participants had to follow existing  business processes, agreements, communication protocols and regulations to mitigate  effectively the situations presented to them. Such mechanisms were not always in place  for all participants, which hindered the overall ability to reach full EU-level situational  awareness. The EU network and information security directive identifies many of the  associated shortcomings and proposes measures that ENISA and Member States are  already implementing to improve the situation.  Second, Cyber Europe 2016 helped participants understand how cybersecurity  authorities would cooperate with each other and EU bodies in the event of a large-scale  crisis. Undoubtedly, crisis cooperation at EU level is very much maturing and improving.  Most, if not all, Member States have come to realise the importance of sharing structured  information across national borders. With the active support of ENISA, they have  leveraged the benefits of EU-level situational awareness for their own crisis management  activities. Yet despite such progress, Cyber Europe 2016 highlighted, as previous  exercises did, the absence of a cooperation framework at EU level for crises stemming  from cybersecurity incidents, officially endorsed cooperation procedures or a centralised  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 5  hub. The creation of the EU CSIRTs Network and the European Commission initiative to  publish a crisis cooperation blueprint in 2017 are excellent developments in that regard.  They will surely benefit from the detailed findings in this report.  Last, the exercise offered countless opportunities for participants to enhance their  cybersecurity capabilities, from their technical and operational expertise to their  capacity to handle crisis communication. Organisational and individual cybersecurity  preparedness and capabilities in the EU were excellent overall. Technical expertise,  business continuity and crisis communications procedures were of a high standard.  Nevertheless, the vision required to link technical- and operational-level response  activities to strategic crisis management mechanisms was sometimes lacking, which  proved detrimental to fostering crisis exit strategies supporting decision-making.  Additionally, many lessons were learned from the use of the prototype platforms  developed by ENISA to support cooperation at EU level; they will reflect positively on the  development of the EU-level crisis cooperation infrastructure financed by the Connecting  Europe Facility (CEF).  6  KEY FINDINGS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  KEY FINDINGS  Participating organisations responded adequately to most challenges they faced during  the exercise. Cybersecurity experts employed in a wide array of sectors in the EU  demonstrated high levels of expertise and appetite to resolve complex cybersecurity  issues. Their ability to cooperate in the most difficult times is an important finding.  No participant questioned the essence of cyber incident cooperation at EU level. Rather,  all actors focussed their efforts on lifting the remaining barriers. Such cooperation was  particularly insightful and led to a full understanding of all facets of the crisis within a few  hours, which supported the swift mitigation of a simulated large-scale attack against EU  interests. In particular, the EU Cyber Standard Operational Procedures helped to provide  EU-level situational awareness and structured cooperation activities.  The exercise in itself proved to be an excellent opportunity to increase individual  and collective knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. Participants developed skills,  procedures and relationships. Most importantly, they reiterated their appreciation in the  exercise series: 99% indicated interest to participate in the next exercise.  Innovation and transformation were at the heart of Cyber Europe 2016. From a product,  process, rhetoric and service perspectives, the exercise planning team, composed of  Member States and ENISA representatives, pushed established boundaries to transform  the EU cybersecurity society. The European Union Ombudsman underlined this joint  effort in March 2017 with an award for excellence in innovation and transformation.  Participants repeatedly asked for more opportunities to test their technical skills  regularly against a variety of advanced scenarios. Many were grateful for the multiple  options offered by ENISA to involve media, legal and financial policy experts and hope  for more to come as leaders across the EU realise that cybersecurity goes beyond  information security.  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 7  The Cyber Crisis Cooperation Platform prototype developed by ENISA provided  numerous insights into technical means supporting EU-level cooperation. These will be  of paramount importance in order to ensure the buy-in from Member States in such  a cooperation platform, currently under development.  The Cyber Exercise Platform proved to be a powerful tool to plan, conduct and evaluate  the exercise. In particular, the simulated environment developed by ENISA supported  the crisis build-up in a realistic fashion with an unprecedented emphasis on written and  visual storytelling.  Key recommendations  1.  Following their revision, the operational procedures which drive the cooperation  activities during a cyber crisis should be endorsed by the CSIRTs Network established  by the Network and Information Security Directive. Training opportunities on the use of  these procedures and tailored exercises should be offered regularly.  2.  An EU-level cyber crisis cooperation framework is currently being developed by the  European Commission. It should build upon these findings to develop interconnections  between cooperation mechanisms, identify and empower key actors, from CSIRTs to  law enforcement, and set a clear vision for the future of EU cyber response.  3.  Future Cyber Europe should focus on cooperation activities on technical and operational  topics. Other options should be pursued to offer training and exercise opportunities on  a variety of other topics increasingly associated with cybersecurity. In particular, ENISA  should support EU-wide capacity building on cyber crisis communication.  I  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 9  1.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  The three goals of the Cyber Europe 2016 exercise  built upon those set in Cyber Europe 2014, following  an in-depth assessment of their relevance performed  in the after action report of the latter exercise1.  G1. Test EU-level cooperation processes.  G2.  Provide opportunities for Member States to test  their national-level cooperation processes.  G3. Train EU- and national-level capabilities.  Consequent objectives were derived from the  high-level goals in order to drive the development  of the exercise, as presented in Table 1 (next page).  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  Participation in Cyber Europe 2016 was limited to  organisations from the European Union institutions,  European Member States and European Free Trade  Association Member States (collectively called  Member States hereafter), and private companies  operating in the latter countries.  The main target audience of the exercise  was individuals and organisations involved in  information security activities in the information  and telecommunications technology (ICT) sector.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ce2014-after-action-report  Some Member States chose to involve individuals  and organisations from other sectors as well, as  indicated in Figure 1.  In total, 948 participants officially registered for  the exercise, of whom two thirds came from the  private sector.  NB: These figures account only for those participants  who registered in the Cyber Exercise Platform.  Several organisations chose to use one account and  distribute exercise information between multiple  participants. As a result, one can assume the actual  total number of participants to be significantly higher.  1.3 SET-UP  Cyber Europe 2010 and 2012 were 1-day all-inclusive  exercises. Cyber Europe 2014 was the first exercise  in the series in which technical cybersecurity incident  handling was combined with operational crisis  management activities in three different phases.  Building upon the latter, Cyber Europe 2016 was  a collection of exercising activities, offering prolonged  opportunities to participants to learn, train and  exercise their technical and operational capabilities.

Training sessions (from September 2015 to  October 2016)  On-site training on exercise planning provided  during the initial and main planning conferences.  On-site crisis planning and management training  for public participants.  Online training on the EU cyber standard  operational procedures (EU-CSOPs) and the pilot  cooperation platform offered to representatives  of EU national and governmental computer  security incident response teams (CSIRTs).  2.  Preparatory exercises  (from April to October 2016)  Technical cybersecurity challenges released every  month between April and October 2016, all part  of the overall Cyber Europe 2016 scenario, building  up into a crisis in a realistic fashion over the course  of 6 months.  EuroSOPex, an exercise organised in June  2016 involving 24 countries split into four  separate groups. This exercise helped to train  the representatives of the EU national and  governmental CSIRTs on the use of the EU-CSOPs.  3. Main exercise (13–14 October 2016)  An all-inclusive cybersecurity exercise building upon:  technical cybersecurity incident analysis;  business continuity and crisis management,  including media pressure handling;  intra- and inter-organisational cooperation at  national and international levels;  escalation;  situational awareness.  1.4 SCENARIO  In the midst of the finalisation of the NIS directive3,  physical sabotage attempts via cyber means and  attacks against the digital market, the following  narrative ark was used as a driver for the  development of the scenario material:  The European ICT industry is one of the most  advanced in the world. Making the EU’s single market  fit for the digital age could contribute EUR 415 billion  per year to our economy and create hundreds of  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  thousands of new jobs. The pervasiveness of high- speed connectivity and the richness and quality of  online services in the European Union are among  the best globally. Such advantages have considerably  increased the dependability of EU citizens on  ICT services. These two elements — quality of  services and customer base — make this industry  particularly appealing to global business. What if  this important piece of the global economy becomes  a target? Computer security attacks are increasingly  used to perform industrial reconnaissance, lead  disinformation campaigns, manipulate stock markets,  leak sensitive information, tamper with customer data  and sabotage critical infrastructures.  The detailed scenario of the exercise consisted of  hundreds of documents including:  structured and unstructured, useful and  misleading data scattered in simulated online  blogs, magazines, forums and file storage  infrastructure;  thousands of simulated personal and professional  social media profiles on simulated platforms;  a simulated news channel, depicting the event  through filmed news reports in a realistic fashion,  supported by simulated formal written news  websites containing hundreds of news articles;  hundreds of tailor-made documents supporting  the scenario for participants to analyse, from  technical incident material to legal and public  affairs documents.  1.5 PLANNING  Key dates of exercise programme planning and  delivery of activities were:  12–13 May 2015: concept development  conference — Rome;  26–27 October 2015: initial planning  conference — Athens;  17–18 February 2016: main planning  conference — Lisbon;  late May-early June 2016: EuroSOPex exercise;  13–17 June 2016: final planning  conference — Athens;  April-Oct 2016: pre-exercise release of  technical challenges;  14–15 September 2016: dry run — Athens;  13–14 October 2016: main exercise event  — distributed/exercise control in Athens.  12  A graphical timeline of the Cyber Europe 2016 programme planning process  and the programme activities is shown in Figure 2.

CYBER  EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION  REPORT Findings from a cyber crisis  exercise in Europe  2  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 3  TABLE OF CONTENTS Executive summary 6 Key findings and recommendations 8  SECTION I  EXERCISE OVERVIEW 11  1.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 11 1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE 11 1.3 SET-UP 11 1.4 SCENARIO 13 1.5 PLANNING 13 1.6 EVALUATION PROCESS 15  4  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Cyber Europe 2016 was the fourth pan-European cyber crisis exercise organised by  the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). Over 1 000  participants working mostly in the ICT sector, from public and private organisations from  all 28 Member States of the European Union and two from the European Free Trade  Association (EFTA), joined in a programme of activities ranging from training sessions and  communication checks to technical competitions and cooperation exercises.  The exercise simulated a realistic crisis build-up over an actual period of 6 months,  culminating in a 48 hour event on 13 and 14 October 2016.  Cyber Europe 2016 was based on three pillars essential to the successful mitigation  of large-scale crises caused by cybersecurity incidents: cooperation at national and  international levels and sound cybersecurity capabilities.  First, the exercise fostered cooperation between targets of simulated cybersecurity  incidents, security providers and national authorities, shedding light on national-level  public–private and private–private cooperation. Participants had to follow existing  business processes, agreements, communication protocols and regulations to mitigate  effectively the situations presented to them. Such mechanisms were not always in place  for all participants, which hindered the overall ability to reach full EU-level situational  awareness. The EU network and information security directive identifies many of the  associated shortcomings and proposes measures that ENISA and Member States are  already implementing to improve the situation.  Second, Cyber Europe 2016 helped participants understand how cybersecurity  authorities would cooperate with each other and EU bodies in the event of a large-scale  crisis. Undoubtedly, crisis cooperation at EU level is very much maturing and improving.  Most, if not all, Member States have come to realise the importance of sharing structured  information across national borders. With the active support of ENISA, they have  leveraged the benefits of EU-level situational awareness for their own crisis management  activities. Yet despite such progress, Cyber Europe 2016 highlighted, as previous  exercises did, the absence of a cooperation framework at EU level for crises stemming  from cybersecurity incidents, officially endorsed cooperation procedures or a centralised  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 5  hub. The creation of the EU CSIRTs Network and the European Commission initiative to  publish a crisis cooperation blueprint in 2017 are excellent developments in that regard.  They will surely benefit from the detailed findings in this report.  Last, the exercise offered countless opportunities for participants to enhance their  cybersecurity capabilities, from their technical and operational expertise to their  capacity to handle crisis communication. Organisational and individual cybersecurity  preparedness and capabilities in the EU were excellent overall. Technical expertise,  business continuity and crisis communications procedures were of a high standard.  Nevertheless, the vision required to link technical- and operational-level response  activities to strategic crisis management mechanisms was sometimes lacking, which  proved detrimental to fostering crisis exit strategies supporting decision-making.  Additionally, many lessons were learned from the use of the prototype platforms  developed by ENISA to support cooperation at EU level; they will reflect positively on the  development of the EU-level crisis cooperation infrastructure financed by the Connecting  Europe Facility (CEF).  6  KEY FINDINGS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  KEY FINDINGS  Participating organisations responded adequately to most challenges they faced during  the exercise. Cybersecurity experts employed in a wide array of sectors in the EU  demonstrated high levels of expertise and appetite to resolve complex cybersecurity  issues. Their ability to cooperate in the most difficult times is an important finding.  No participant questioned the essence of cyber incident cooperation at EU level. Rather,  all actors focussed their efforts on lifting the remaining barriers. Such cooperation was  particularly insightful and led to a full understanding of all facets of the crisis within a few  hours, which supported the swift mitigation of a simulated large-scale attack against EU  interests. In particular, the EU Cyber Standard Operational Procedures helped to provide  EU-level situational awareness and structured cooperation activities.  The exercise in itself proved to be an excellent opportunity to increase individual  and collective knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. Participants developed skills,  procedures and relationships. Most importantly, they reiterated their appreciation in the  exercise series: 99% indicated interest to participate in the next exercise.  Innovation and transformation were at the heart of Cyber Europe 2016. From a product,  process, rhetoric and service perspectives, the exercise planning team, composed of  Member States and ENISA representatives, pushed established boundaries to transform  the EU cybersecurity society. The European Union Ombudsman underlined this joint  effort in March 2017 with an award for excellence in innovation and transformation.  Participants repeatedly asked for more opportunities to test their technical skills  regularly against a variety of advanced scenarios. Many were grateful for the multiple  options offered by ENISA to involve media, legal and financial policy experts and hope  for more to come as leaders across the EU realise that cybersecurity goes beyond  information security.  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 7  The Cyber Crisis Cooperation Platform prototype developed by ENISA provided  numerous insights into technical means supporting EU-level cooperation. These will be  of paramount importance in order to ensure the buy-in from Member States in such  a cooperation platform, currently under development.  The Cyber Exercise Platform proved to be a powerful tool to plan, conduct and evaluate  the exercise. In particular, the simulated environment developed by ENISA supported  the crisis build-up in a realistic fashion with an unprecedented emphasis on written and  visual storytelling.  Key recommendations  1.  Following their revision, the operational procedures which drive the cooperation  activities during a cyber crisis should be endorsed by the CSIRTs Network established  by the Network and Information Security Directive. Training opportunities on the use of  these procedures and tailored exercises should be offered regularly.  2.  An EU-level cyber crisis cooperation framework is currently being developed by the  European Commission. It should build upon these findings to develop interconnections  between cooperation mechanisms, identify and empower key actors, from CSIRTs to  law enforcement, and set a clear vision for the future of EU cyber response.  3.  Future Cyber Europe should focus on cooperation activities on technical and operational  topics. Other options should be pursued to offer training and exercise opportunities on  a variety of other topics increasingly associated with cybersecurity. In particular, ENISA  should support EU-wide capacity building on cyber crisis communication.  I  CYBER EUROPE 2016: AFTER ACTION REPORT 9  1.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  The three goals of the Cyber Europe 2016 exercise  built upon those set in Cyber Europe 2014, following  an in-depth assessment of their relevance performed  in the after action report of the latter exercise1.  G1. Test EU-level cooperation processes.  G2.  Provide opportunities for Member States to test  their national-level cooperation processes.  G3. Train EU- and national-level capabilities.  Consequent objectives were derived from the  high-level goals in order to drive the development  of the exercise, as presented in Table 1 (next page).  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  Participation in Cyber Europe 2016 was limited to  organisations from the European Union institutions,  European Member States and European Free Trade  Association Member States (collectively called  Member States hereafter), and private companies  operating in the latter countries.  The main target audience of the exercise  was individuals and organisations involved in  information security activities in the information  and telecommunications technology (ICT) sector.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ce2014-after-action-report  Some Member States chose to involve individuals  and organisations from other sectors as well, as  indicated in Figure 1.  In total, 948 participants officially registered for  the exercise, of whom two thirds came from the  private sector.  NB: These figures account only for those participants  who registered in the Cyber Exercise Platform.  Several organisations chose to use one account and  distribute exercise information between multiple  participants. As a result, one can assume the actual  total number of participants to be significantly higher.  1.3 SET-UP  Cyber Europe 2010 and 2012 were 1-day all-inclusive  exercises. Cyber Europe 2014 was the first exercise  in the series in which technical cybersecurity incident  handling was combined with operational crisis  management activities in three different phases.  Building upon the latter, Cyber Europe 2016 was  a collection of exercising activities, offering prolonged  opportunities to participants to learn, train and  exercise their technical and operational capabilities.

Training sessions (from September 2015 to  October 2016)  On-site training on exercise planning provided  during the initial and main planning conferences.  On-site crisis planning and management training  for public participants.  Online training on the EU cyber standard  operational procedures (EU-CSOPs) and the pilot  cooperation platform offered to representatives  of EU national and governmental computer  security incident response teams (CSIRTs).  2.  Preparatory exercises  (from April to October 2016)  Technical cybersecurity challenges released every  month between April and October 2016, all part  of the overall Cyber Europe 2016 scenario, building  up into a crisis in a realistic fashion over the course  of 6 months.  EuroSOPex, an exercise organised in June  2016 involving 24 countries split into four  separate groups. This exercise helped to train  the representatives of the EU national and  governmental CSIRTs on the use of the EU-CSOPs.  3. Main exercise (13–14 October 2016)  An all-inclusive cybersecurity exercise building upon:  technical cybersecurity incident analysis;  business continuity and crisis management,  including media pressure handling;  intra- and inter-organisational cooperation at  national and international levels;  escalation;  situational awareness.  1.4 SCENARIO  In the midst of the finalisation of the NIS directive3,  physical sabotage attempts via cyber means and  attacks against the digital market, the following  narrative ark was used as a driver for the  development of the scenario material:  The European ICT industry is one of the most  advanced in the world. Making the EU’s single market  fit for the digital age could contribute EUR 415 billion  per year to our economy and create hundreds of  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  thousands of new jobs. The pervasiveness of high- speed connectivity and the richness and quality of  online services in the European Union are among  the best globally. Such advantages have considerably  increased the dependability of EU citizens on  ICT services. These two elements — quality of  services and customer base — make this industry  particularly appealing to global business. What if  this important piece of the global economy becomes  a target? Computer security attacks are increasingly  used to perform industrial reconnaissance, lead  disinformation campaigns, manipulate stock markets,  leak sensitive information, tamper with customer data  and sabotage critical infrastructures.  The detailed scenario of the exercise consisted of  hundreds of documents including:  structured and unstructured, useful and  misleading data scattered in simulated online  blogs, magazines, forums and file storage  infrastructure;  thousands of simulated personal and professional  social media profiles on simulated platforms;  a simulated news channel, depicting the event  through filmed news reports in a realistic fashion,  supported by simulated formal written news  websites containing hundreds of news articles;  hundreds of tailor-made documents supporting  the scenario for participants to analyse, from  technical incident material to legal and public  affairs documents.  1.5 PLANNING  Key dates of exercise programme planning and  delivery of activities were:  12–13 May 2015: concept development  conference — Rome;  26–27 October 2015: initial planning  conference — Athens;  17–18 February 2016: main planning  conference — Lisbon;  late May-early June 2016: EuroSOPex exercise;  13–17 June 2016: final planning  conference — Athens;  April-Oct 2016: pre-exercise release of  technical challenges;  14–15 September 2016: dry run — Athens;  13–14 October 2016: main exercise event  — distributed/exercise control in Athens.  12  A graphical timeline of the Cyber Europe 2016 programme planning process  and the programme activities is shown in Figure 2.

Technical cybersecurity challenges  Anonymised statistics about incident results  (see Annex 2).  Incident-specific feedback forms.  EuroSOPex  Evaluation survey results (see Annex 1).  Platform and chat logs.  National and EU integrated situation reports.  Audioconference minutes.  Main event  Evaluation survey results (see Annex 3).  Observation and status reports.  Platform logs.  National and EU integrated situation reports.  Audioconference minutes.  Observations, challenges, recommendations and  actions drawn from the analysis of the findings  highlighted in the elements mentioned above, are  analysed as follows:  Chapter 2: findings related to EU-level cooperation;  Chapter 3: findings related to national-level  cooperation;  Chapter 4: findings related to training at national  and EU levels;  Chapter 5: findings related to exercise organisation.  An action plan summary and four annexes containing  detailed results complement the report.  Given the sensitivity of some of the lessons learned,  three versions of this report exist:  a full version, available only to EU national and  governmental CSIRTs (TLP AMBER) and Member  States’ exercise planners;  a version without the findings related to  EU-level cooperation, available to all participants  in Cyber Europe 2016 (TLP GREEN);  a public version (TLP WHITE), containing  only Chapter 1.  NB: ENISA consulted planners from the respective  participating Member States upon drafting this report  and integrated consensual feedback. Non-consensual  feedback was added to Annex 5.

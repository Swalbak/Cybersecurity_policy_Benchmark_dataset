This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2012.  This report provides an aggregated analysis of the incident reports about severe outages, looking at  the impact of incidents, root cause categories and detailed causes. It does not include details about  individual countries, individual providers, or individual incidents.  In total 18 countries reported 79 significant incidents, 9 countries reported no significant incidents.,  Below we summarize the main conclusions that can be drawn from the incident reports.   Most incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile Internet (about 50 % of the incidents  respectively). Incidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile Internet also affected most  users (around 1,8 million users per incident). This is consistent with the high penetration  rate of mobile telephony and mobile Internet.   In 37 % of the incidents there was an impact on the emergency number 112.   For most incident reports  the root cause was “System failures” (75 % of the incidents). This  was the most common root cause category also for each of the four services (fixed and  mobile telephony and fixed and mobile Internet). In the category “System failures”,  hardware failures were the most common cause, followed by software bugs. The assets  most often affected by  system failures were switches (e.g. routers and local exchange  points) and home location registers.   Incidents categorized with root cause third party failures, mostly power supply failures,  affected around 2.8 Million user connections on average. Incidents involving the detailed  cause overload affected around 9.4 million user connections on average.   Incidents caused by natural phenomena (mainly storms and heavy snowfall) lasted the  longest: around 36 hours on average.   Incidents caused by overload followed by power failures respectively had most impact in  terms of number of users affected times duration.   Overall, switches and home location registers were the network components or assets most  affected by incidents.  ENISA, together with the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the different EU Member States,  discusses specific incidents in more detail in the Article 13a Expert Group. Where needed ENISA  drafts technical guidance for NRAs and providers about mitigating incidents. For example, following  last year’s report, ENISA is now drafting recommendations on power supply dependencies and  national roaming for resilience.  ENISA publishes an annual report to provide industry and government bodies in the EU with data  about significant incidents. The next annual report will be published in summer 2014, covering  incidents that occurred in 2013.  We thank the regulators and the EC for a fruitful collaboration and we are looking forward to  leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve the security and resilience of the electronic  communication networks in the EU electronic communications sector and more generally for  supervision of security in other critical sectors.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’ 2  3 Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure 3  4 Analysis of the incidents 6  4.1 Examples of incidents 6  4.2 Impact 8  4.2.1 Incidents per service 8  4.2.2 Number of users affected per incident per service 8  4.2.3 Percentage of the national user base affected 9  4.2.4 Impact on emergency services and interconnections 10  4.3 Root cause categories 11  4.3.1 Incidents per root cause category 11  4.3.2 Average duration of incidents per root cause category 11  4.3.3 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category 12  4.4 Detailed causes 13  4.4.1 Detailed causes 13  4.4.2 Detailed causes per service 14  4.4.3 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause 15  4.5 Impact in user hours 16  4.5.1 User hours lost per root cause category 16  4.5.2 User-hours lost per detailed cause 16  4.6 Assets affected 17  4.6.1 Assets affected overall 17  4.6.2 Affected assets by system failures 17  5 Conclusions 18  References 19  Annex A: Incident causes split out per service 20  Annex B: VoIP versus PSTN 24  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  For the second time in the EU significant security incidents were reported to ENISA and the  European Commission, under Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), a new article  introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications. In this  document, ENISA analyses the 79 incident reports of severe outages of electronic communication  networks or services that were submitted for 2012. This year’s reports were also compared with last  year’s annual reporting. The Executive Summary of this report provides a snapshot of this analysis.  Note that in this document ENISA does not provide details from the individual incident reports. The  analysis is only an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU. ENISA does not  make any references here to specific countries or specific providers. The incidents are discussed in  more detail in the Article 13a Expert Group.  This document is structured as follows. Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the  details of the technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by  the different NRAs of the EU Member States. Section 4  analyses the incidents which were reported,  and this paper concludes with some general conclusions (Section 5) which follow from the incidents.  For the interested reader, the annex contains data about root causes and detailed causes per service  as well as the detailed causes and impact for Circuit Switched Telephony and VoIP respectively.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2011 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2011 http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  2  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009  and was transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework  Directive. Article 13a addresses the security and integrity1 of public electronic communications  networks and services. The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and  providers of public electronic communications networks and services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to  guarantee security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must report to competent national authorities about significant breaches of security or  integrity.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary,  for example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission (EC) about the incidents.  The incident reporting flows are shown in the diagram below. This document analyses the incidents  that have been reported to ENISA and the EC (the black dashed arrow).

In these meetings,  a group of experts from NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non- binding technical documents providing guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States :   Technical Guidelines for Incident Reporting and   Technical Guidelines for Minimum Security Measures.  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to discuss the implementation  of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector) and to share  knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  3.1 Technical Guidelines on Incident reporting  The last two years, NRAs have used version 1.0 of the Technical Guidelines on Incident Reporting. At  the end of last year, in agreement with NRAs, ENISA amended and improved the reporting  thresholds and the incident reporting template, to be used for the 2013 reporting. This was done in  a separate document, describing the procedure for 2013 reporting.  From January 2013 the NRAs will be using version 2.0 of the Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting.  3.1.1 Services in scope  NRAs should report incidents affecting the following communication services and networks:   Fixed telephony (e.g. PSTN, VoIP over DSL, Cable, Fiber, et cetera),   Mobile telephony (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, et cetera ),   Fixed Internet access (e.g. Dial up, DSL, Cable, Fiber, et cetera),   Mobile Internet access (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, et cetera)  NRAs may also report about incidents affecting other types of services.  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs should report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of  electronic communications networks or services.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines  in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up2:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and  Internet access, and which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the  past 3 months).  2. The number of  subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are  purchased separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  2  Here we follow the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  4  3.1.4 Thresholds  The threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the duration and the number of users of a  service affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is more than 15%,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 10%,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 5%,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 2%, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 1%.  The threshold should be understood ‘per service’. In other words, if one incident involves impact on  multiple services, then for one of the services the threshold should be passed. NRAs may also report  incidents with an impact below the threshold.  1 h  <...<2 h  2 h  <...<4 h  4 h  <...<6 h  6 h  <...<8 h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Figure 2 Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  3.1.5 Root cause categories  In the incident reports five categories of root causes have been distinguished.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by natural disasters. For  instance storms, floods, heavy snowfall, earthquakes, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees  of the provider.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by an attack, a cyber-attack or a  cable theft e.g.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure of hardware or  software.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a  third party.  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  5  3.1.6 Reporting procedure  In spring 2012 the European Commission agreed with the EU Member States  (in meetings of the  Communications Committee, COCOM) to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the  2011 incidents. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed  within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA  implemented the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a  guidelines for incident reporting. There was also an agreement that in the following years, annual  reporting would be carried out by the end of February each year.  In the automn of 2012 ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which  replaces the electronic forms exchanged by email. The goal of CIRAS is to allow NRAs more control  over the data reported and to improve the collection and aggregation of incident reports.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  6  4 Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States participated in this process. 18 countries reported in total 79  significant incidents, 9 countries reported there were no significant incidents and 1 country hadn’t  implemented incident reporting yet.  In this section the 79 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, some examples of  incidents are given (in Section 4.1), then the impact per service is analysed (in Section 4.2), then the  impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.3), and in Section 4.4  detailed causes are  examined. In Section 4.5 impact as a product of user connections affected and duration of the  incidents is analysed and in Section 4.6 the components or assets affected by the incidents are  considered.  At this point there is a need to stress that statistical conclusions based on these numbers should be  drawn with care. The smaller incidents are not reported at an EU level and this means that the view  is biased towards the larger incidents. Another remark is that the reporting to ENISA has only been  carried out for two years, and this is not enough to draw conclusions on trends. However, where  there are data from 2011, diagrams are displayed as a comparison.  4.1 Examples of incidents  In this section, we give some anonymized examples of inccidents, to give an idea of the different  incidents that have been reported over the last two years.  4.1.1 Overload caused VoIP outage (hours, thousands, system failure)  In the shift from a temporary to a permanent network solution, voice over IP service were lost for 400  000 users. Basically the IMS3 became overloaded as a result of too many simultaneous registrations  of customer devices. The provider had to limit registrations and was handling full traffic again after  14 hours.  3  IMS = IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem, a functional architecture designed to enable providers to  deliver a wide range of real-time, packet-based services.  18 9  1 Number of countries reporting significant incidents  Number of countries reporting no significant incidents  Number of countries without Article 13a implementation  (2011)  Figure 3 Countries involved in the annual summary reporting over 2012.  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  7  4.1.2 Faulty upgrade halted IP-base traffic (hours, millions, human error)  An upgrade in a core router went seriously wrong, and caused a drop of all IP based traffic for the  provider causing many services to go down, including the emergency number 112. This incident led to  an outage of 17 hours affecting 3 million users. The provider downgraded to make the network  stable. The post incident action was to change the routines for upgrades including new procedures  for suppliers and integrators.  4.1.3 Cable theft causing fibre optic cable break (hours, thousands, malicious attack)  A fiber optic cable was cut off due to a cable theft attempt. The incident affected 70 000 fixed  telephony users and 90 000 fixed Internet users for 10 hours. During repairs a temporary path was  established.  4.1.4 DDoS attacks on DNS affected mobile Internet (hours, millions, malicious attack)  A series of Distributed Denial of Service attacks targeted a provider’s domain name service. Up to 2,5  million mobile Internet users were affected during 1-2 hours. The attacking IP-addresses were  tracked and blocked, the load balancing units were restarted and the traffic could be recovered. As  post-incident actions additional DNS servers were installed, configuration changes were made on  firewalls and hardware was expanded to withstand similar attacks.  4.1.5 Big storm affecting power supply causing large scale outage (days, millions, natural  disaster)  A severe storm hit several countries. The storm had a major impact on the power grid infrastructure  and to a limited extent also on mobile network equipment (like mobile base stations). The prolonged  power cuts eventually caused many mobile base stations to run out of power. As a result around a  million users were without mobile communication services for 24 hours, and in some cases up to two  weeks.  4.1.6 Configuration error (hours, millions, configuration error)  An employee of a fixed telephony provider made a configuration error. The error prevented fixed  telephony users to make outgoing international phone calls to Western European countries for 4  hours. The incident was resolved after a reconfiguration and a reboot.  4.1.7 Vandalism by former employee affected DSL (days, thousands, malicious attack)  A former employee of a provider deliberately set fire to a switching system, which was used for  providing fixed Internet service to around 10.000 subscribers. The incident was resolved by replacing  the switch. Around 36 hours later the fixed Internet service was working again.  4.1.8 Faulty software update affected mobile telephony (hours, thousands, software failure)  A provider applied a regular software update at a Home Location Register (HLR) which turned out to  be faulty. The failure at the HLR impacted mobile telephony and Internet services. The incident  affected about half of the provider’s customers and lasted around 8 hours.  4.1.9 Submarine cable cut from anchorage (hours, thousands, third party)  A ship’s anchoring damaged one of four submarine cables connecting two islands. Contingency plans  were triggered quickly, which meant that only a smaller number of users were affected.  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  8  4.2 Impact  This section focusses on the impact of the incidents on the electronic communication services.  4.2.1 Incidents per service  Figure 4 shows which percentage of incidents affected which services. Most incidents have an  impact on two or more services (which is why the percentages in the chart add up to 152%).  Most incidents (around 48%) affected mobile telephony or mobile Internet. This would suggest that  mobile services are more at risk of large-scale outages. We drew a similar conclusion last year.  4.2.2 Number of users affected per incident per service  Figure 5 shows the average number of users affected, per incident, per service (in 1000s).  37  25  48 49  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  (2011)  400  300  1800  1700  0  200  400  600  800  1000  1200  1400  1600  1800  2000  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  (2011)  Figure 4 Incidents per service (percentage)  Figure 5 Average number of users affected per incident per service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  9  Incidents affecting mobile telephony and mobile Internet involve on average 1,8 million users. This is  partly due to the fact that mobile telephony has more customers (on average 110% of the  population for mobile telephony, compared to 50% for fixed telephony). Note that the EU averages  in this calculation are not always representative for the sizes of incidents that could occur nationally  regarding users affected, because of differences in national network topologies. Also, since the  thresholds for reporting to ENISA and the EC are based on the percentage of national users affected,  smaller outages are underrepresented  in the EU averages.  4.2.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Figure 6 shows the percentage of the national user base affected, on average per incident, per  service.  On average, incidents affecting mobile internet affect 16% of the users. This is more than the  percentages for the mobile telephony and the fixed communication services. This would suggest  that, not only mobile Internet services are more vulnerable, but also that a larger portion of the  users is affected in the incidents that were reported.  10  8 9  16  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  (2011)  Figure 6 Number of users affected per incident per service (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  10  4.2.4 Impact on emergency services and interconnections  In figures 7 and 8 we show the impact on emergency services and interconnections respectively.  In 37 % of the incidents there was impact on emergency calls - i.e. the possibility for users to contact  emergency call-centres using the emergency number 112.  In 11 % of the incidents there was an impact on interconnections to other providers.  37 63  Emergency Calls  Affected  Not affected  (2011)  11  89  Interconnections  Affected  Not affected  (2011)  Figure 7 Impact on emergency calls.

Most of the incidents fall in the rootcause category ‘System failures’ (76%). Note that the numbers  add up to more than 100% because for a few incidents multiple root cause categories were  indicated.  4.3.2 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  Figure 10 shows the average duration of incident per root case category.  6  5  8  76  13  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failure  (2011)  36  26  4  9  13  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failure  (2011)  Figure 9 Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Figure 10 Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  12  Natural phenomena need the longest recovery time compared with the other root cause categories:  an average of 36 hours. Also incidents in the root cause category ‘Human Error’ needed long  recovery time, 26 hours in average.  4.3.3 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  Figure 11 shows the average number of affected user connections in each incident for a certain root  cause category. Note that a single user could have access to multiple services, so in certain incidents  the affected users are counted multiple times. For this reason we count the number of user  connections affected per service.  Although incidents caused by natural phenomena lasted longest (36 hours on average), the number  of user connections in these cases was relatively limited (on average 560.000 connections)  compared to other root cause categories. The incidents caused by third party failures affected most  connections (around 2.8 Million), and they lasted fairly long (on average 13 hours). A high proportion  of these incidents (60%) were caused by failures related to power supply. It is difficult to draw  conclusions on why the number of affected connections was so high this year. There were some  incidents that generated a very high number of affected user connections, mainly five incidents on  mobile networks that affected a range of 4 million to 50 million user connections.  557  447  1528  2330  2808  0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failure  (2011)  Figure 11 Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  13  4.4 Detailed causes  In this section, instead of looking at the five root cause categories, we examine initial causes and  subsequent causes triggering the incident. For example, when a storm led to a power cut which  leads to a network outage, then for this incident both power cut and storm are counted as detailed  causes. We call them: “detailed causes”.  4.4.1 Detailed causes  Figure 12 shows the detailed causes of incidents.  Hardware failure was the most common cause, followed by software bugs.  38  23  13 11 9 6 6 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  0 5  10 15 20 25 30 35 40  Figure 12 Detailed causes of reported incidents  (2011)  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  14  4.4.2 Detailed causes per service  Figure 13 shows the causes of incidents per service.  For incidents in all four services, hardware failure was the most common cause. The second most  common cause for fixed telephony was software bug. Half of those incidents affected VoIP. For fixed  Internet, cyber attack was the second most common cause. For mobile telephony and mobile  internet the second most common cause was a software bug.  0 5  10 15 20 25 30 35 40  Fixed Telephony  Fixed Internet  Mobile Telephony  Mobile Internet  Figure 13 Detailed causes per service  (2011)  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  15  4.4.3 Average duration of incidents and number of user connections affected per detailed cause  Figure 14 shows the average duration of the incidents, per detailed cause4.

Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  18  5 Conclusions  In this document ENISA summarized how the incident reporting scheme, mandated by Article 13a of  the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), was implemented across the EU and analysed the incident  reports. ENISA and the EC received as part of the second round of reporting: 79 reports about major  incidents that occurred in 2012.  From the 79 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the EC, the following conclusions can be  drawn.   Mobile networks most affected: Most incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile  Internet (about 50 % of the incidents respectively).   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile  Internet affected most users (around 1,8 million users per incident). This is consistent with  the high penetration rate of mobile telephony and mobile Internet.   Emergency Service are affected by incidents: In 37 % of the incidents there was impact on  emergency calls using the emergency number 112.   System failures are the most common root cause: Most incidents were caused by root  causes in the category “System failures” (75 % of the incidents). This was the most common  root cause category also for each of the four services (fixed and mobile telephony and fixed  and mobile Internet). In the category “System failures”, hardware failures were the most  common cause, followed by software bugs. The assets most often affected by  system  failures were switches (e.g. routers and local exchange points) and home location registers.   Third party failures and overload affect many users: Incidents categorized with the root  cause third party failures, mostly power supply failures, affected around 2.8 Million user  connections on average. Incidents involving the detailed cause overload affected around 9.4  million user connections on average.   Natural phenomena cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by natural phenomena  (mainly storms and heavy snowfall) lasted around 36 hours on average.   Overload and power failures have most impact: Incidents caused by overload followed by  power failures respectively had most impact in terms of number of users times duration.   Switches and home location registers most affected by incidents: Overall, switches and  home location registers were the network components most affected by incidents.  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group, will discuss specific incidents in more detail  with the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, the European Member States and the  European Commission for the fruitful collaboration, which has allowed for an efficient and rapid  implementation of the incident reporting process. We believe that this process (Article 13a) is a  good example for supervision of cyber security in other sectors. In fact, the proposal for a cyber  security directive, rececntly proposed by the EC, explicitly mentions that the Framework directive  was used as a model, and Article 14 of that proposal is very similar to Article 13a. ENISA is looking  forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to assist the EU Commission and the Member States in  further improving the security and resilience of the electronic communication networks in the EU.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  19  References  Related ENISA papers   The Article 13a WG technical guidelines on incident reporting and on minimum security  measures: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s report about the 2011 incidents, reported under Article 13a:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual- reports/annual-incident-reports-2011   ENISA’s whitepaper on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security  measures: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of  the situation in the EU 4 years ago.

Figure 28  shows the detailed causes, for  PSTN and VoIP services.  Both PSTN and VoIP were mostly affected by hardware failures. VoIP was more affected by software  bugs, power cuts and cyber attacks, wereas PSTN was more affected by cable cuts.  Figure 29  shows the impact per detailed cause in user hours, for PSTN an VoIP services.  For PSTN, the detailed cause with most impact, in terms of user hours, was software bugs, followed  by overload.

This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2012.  This report provides an aggregated analysis of the incident reports about severe outages, looking at  the impact of incidents, root cause categories and detailed causes. It does not include details about  individual countries, individual providers, or individual incidents.  In total 18 countries reported 79 significant incidents, 9 countries reported no significant incidents.,  Below we summarize the main conclusions that can be drawn from the incident reports.   Most incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile Internet (about 50 % of the incidents  respectively). Incidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile Internet also affected most  users (around 1,8 million users per incident). This is consistent with the high penetration  rate of mobile telephony and mobile Internet.   In 37 % of the incidents there was an impact on the emergency number 112.   For most incident reports  the root cause was “System failures” (75 % of the incidents). This  was the most common root cause category also for each of the four services (fixed and  mobile telephony and fixed and mobile Internet). In the category “System failures”,  hardware failures were the most common cause, followed by software bugs. The assets  most often affected by  system failures were switches (e.g. routers and local exchange  points) and home location registers.   Incidents categorized with root cause third party failures, mostly power supply failures,  affected around 2.8 Million user connections on average. Incidents involving the detailed  cause overload affected around 9.4 million user connections on average.   Incidents caused by natural phenomena (mainly storms and heavy snowfall) lasted the  longest: around 36 hours on average.   Incidents caused by overload followed by power failures respectively had most impact in  terms of number of users affected times duration.   Overall, switches and home location registers were the network components or assets most  affected by incidents.  ENISA, together with the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the different EU Member States,  discusses specific incidents in more detail in the Article 13a Expert Group. Where needed ENISA  drafts technical guidance for NRAs and providers about mitigating incidents. For example, following  last year’s report, ENISA is now drafting recommendations on power supply dependencies and  national roaming for resilience.  ENISA publishes an annual report to provide industry and government bodies in the EU with data  about significant incidents. The next annual report will be published in summer 2014, covering  incidents that occurred in 2013.  We thank the regulators and the EC for a fruitful collaboration and we are looking forward to  leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve the security and resilience of the electronic  communication networks in the EU electronic communications sector and more generally for  supervision of security in other critical sectors.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’ 2  3 Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure 3  4 Analysis of the incidents 6  4.1 Examples of incidents 6  4.2 Impact 8  4.2.1 Incidents per service 8  4.2.2 Number of users affected per incident per service 8  4.2.3 Percentage of the national user base affected 9  4.2.4 Impact on emergency services and interconnections 10  4.3 Root cause categories 11  4.3.1 Incidents per root cause category 11  4.3.2 Average duration of incidents per root cause category 11  4.3.3 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category 12  4.4 Detailed causes 13  4.4.1 Detailed causes 13  4.4.2 Detailed causes per service 14  4.4.3 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause 15  4.5 Impact in user hours 16  4.5.1 User hours lost per root cause category 16  4.5.2 User-hours lost per detailed cause 16  4.6 Assets affected 17  4.6.1 Assets affected overall 17  4.6.2 Affected assets by system failures 17  5 Conclusions 18  References 19  Annex A: Incident causes split out per service 20  Annex B: VoIP versus PSTN 24  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  For the second time in the EU significant security incidents were reported to ENISA and the  European Commission, under Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), a new article  introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications. In this  document, ENISA analyses the 79 incident reports of severe outages of electronic communication  networks or services that were submitted for 2012. This year’s reports were also compared with last  year’s annual reporting. The Executive Summary of this report provides a snapshot of this analysis.  Note that in this document ENISA does not provide details from the individual incident reports. The  analysis is only an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU. ENISA does not  make any references here to specific countries or specific providers. The incidents are discussed in  more detail in the Article 13a Expert Group.  This document is structured as follows. Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the  details of the technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by  the different NRAs of the EU Member States. Section 4  analyses the incidents which were reported,  and this paper concludes with some general conclusions (Section 5) which follow from the incidents.  For the interested reader, the annex contains data about root causes and detailed causes per service  as well as the detailed causes and impact for Circuit Switched Telephony and VoIP respectively.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2011 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2011 http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  2  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009  and was transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework  Directive. Article 13a addresses the security and integrity1 of public electronic communications  networks and services. The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and  providers of public electronic communications networks and services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to  guarantee security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must report to competent national authorities about significant breaches of security or  integrity.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary,  for example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission (EC) about the incidents.  The incident reporting flows are shown in the diagram below. This document analyses the incidents  that have been reported to ENISA and the EC (the black dashed arrow).

In these meetings,  a group of experts from NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non- binding technical documents providing guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States :   Technical Guidelines for Incident Reporting and   Technical Guidelines for Minimum Security Measures.  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to discuss the implementation  of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector) and to share  knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  3.1 Technical Guidelines on Incident reporting  The last two years, NRAs have used version 1.0 of the Technical Guidelines on Incident Reporting. At  the end of last year, in agreement with NRAs, ENISA amended and improved the reporting  thresholds and the incident reporting template, to be used for the 2013 reporting. This was done in  a separate document, describing the procedure for 2013 reporting.  From January 2013 the NRAs will be using version 2.0 of the Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting.  3.1.1 Services in scope  NRAs should report incidents affecting the following communication services and networks:   Fixed telephony (e.g. PSTN, VoIP over DSL, Cable, Fiber, et cetera),   Mobile telephony (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, et cetera ),   Fixed Internet access (e.g. Dial up, DSL, Cable, Fiber, et cetera),   Mobile Internet access (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, et cetera)  NRAs may also report about incidents affecting other types of services.  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs should report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of  electronic communications networks or services.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines  in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up2:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and  Internet access, and which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the  past 3 months).  2. The number of  subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are  purchased separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  2  Here we follow the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  4  3.1.4 Thresholds  The threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the duration and the number of users of a  service affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is more than 15%,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 10%,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 5%,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 2%, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is more than 1%.  The threshold should be understood ‘per service’. In other words, if one incident involves impact on  multiple services, then for one of the services the threshold should be passed. NRAs may also report  incidents with an impact below the threshold.  1 h  <...<2 h  2 h  <...<4 h  4 h  <...<6 h  6 h  <...<8 h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Figure 2 Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  3.1.5 Root cause categories  In the incident reports five categories of root causes have been distinguished.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by natural disasters. For  instance storms, floods, heavy snowfall, earthquakes, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees  of the provider.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by an attack, a cyber-attack or a  cable theft e.g.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure of hardware or  software.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a  third party.  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  5  3.1.6 Reporting procedure  In spring 2012 the European Commission agreed with the EU Member States  (in meetings of the  Communications Committee, COCOM) to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the  2011 incidents. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed  within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA  implemented the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a  guidelines for incident reporting. There was also an agreement that in the following years, annual  reporting would be carried out by the end of February each year.  In the automn of 2012 ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which  replaces the electronic forms exchanged by email. The goal of CIRAS is to allow NRAs more control  over the data reported and to improve the collection and aggregation of incident reports.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  6  4 Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States participated in this process. 18 countries reported in total 79  significant incidents, 9 countries reported there were no significant incidents and 1 country hadn’t  implemented incident reporting yet.  In this section the 79 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, some examples of  incidents are given (in Section 4.1), then the impact per service is analysed (in Section 4.2), then the  impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.3), and in Section 4.4  detailed causes are  examined. In Section 4.5 impact as a product of user connections affected and duration of the  incidents is analysed and in Section 4.6 the components or assets affected by the incidents are  considered.  At this point there is a need to stress that statistical conclusions based on these numbers should be  drawn with care. The smaller incidents are not reported at an EU level and this means that the view  is biased towards the larger incidents. Another remark is that the reporting to ENISA has only been  carried out for two years, and this is not enough to draw conclusions on trends. However, where  there are data from 2011, diagrams are displayed as a comparison.  4.1 Examples of incidents  In this section, we give some anonymized examples of inccidents, to give an idea of the different  incidents that have been reported over the last two years.  4.1.1 Overload caused VoIP outage (hours, thousands, system failure)  In the shift from a temporary to a permanent network solution, voice over IP service were lost for 400  000 users. Basically the IMS3 became overloaded as a result of too many simultaneous registrations  of customer devices. The provider had to limit registrations and was handling full traffic again after  14 hours.  3  IMS = IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem, a functional architecture designed to enable providers to  deliver a wide range of real-time, packet-based services.  18 9  1 Number of countries reporting significant incidents  Number of countries reporting no significant incidents  Number of countries without Article 13a implementation  (2011)  Figure 3 Countries involved in the annual summary reporting over 2012.  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  7  4.1.2 Faulty upgrade halted IP-base traffic (hours, millions, human error)  An upgrade in a core router went seriously wrong, and caused a drop of all IP based traffic for the  provider causing many services to go down, including the emergency number 112. This incident led to  an outage of 17 hours affecting 3 million users. The provider downgraded to make the network  stable. The post incident action was to change the routines for upgrades including new procedures  for suppliers and integrators.  4.1.3 Cable theft causing fibre optic cable break (hours, thousands, malicious attack)  A fiber optic cable was cut off due to a cable theft attempt. The incident affected 70 000 fixed  telephony users and 90 000 fixed Internet users for 10 hours. During repairs a temporary path was  established.  4.1.4 DDoS attacks on DNS affected mobile Internet (hours, millions, malicious attack)  A series of Distributed Denial of Service attacks targeted a provider’s domain name service. Up to 2,5  million mobile Internet users were affected during 1-2 hours. The attacking IP-addresses were  tracked and blocked, the load balancing units were restarted and the traffic could be recovered. As  post-incident actions additional DNS servers were installed, configuration changes were made on  firewalls and hardware was expanded to withstand similar attacks.  4.1.5 Big storm affecting power supply causing large scale outage (days, millions, natural  disaster)  A severe storm hit several countries. The storm had a major impact on the power grid infrastructure  and to a limited extent also on mobile network equipment (like mobile base stations). The prolonged  power cuts eventually caused many mobile base stations to run out of power. As a result around a  million users were without mobile communication services for 24 hours, and in some cases up to two  weeks.  4.1.6 Configuration error (hours, millions, configuration error)  An employee of a fixed telephony provider made a configuration error. The error prevented fixed  telephony users to make outgoing international phone calls to Western European countries for 4  hours. The incident was resolved after a reconfiguration and a reboot.  4.1.7 Vandalism by former employee affected DSL (days, thousands, malicious attack)  A former employee of a provider deliberately set fire to a switching system, which was used for  providing fixed Internet service to around 10.000 subscribers. The incident was resolved by replacing  the switch. Around 36 hours later the fixed Internet service was working again.  4.1.8 Faulty software update affected mobile telephony (hours, thousands, software failure)  A provider applied a regular software update at a Home Location Register (HLR) which turned out to  be faulty. The failure at the HLR impacted mobile telephony and Internet services. The incident  affected about half of the provider’s customers and lasted around 8 hours.  4.1.9 Submarine cable cut from anchorage (hours, thousands, third party)  A ship’s anchoring damaged one of four submarine cables connecting two islands. Contingency plans  were triggered quickly, which meant that only a smaller number of users were affected.  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  8  4.2 Impact  This section focusses on the impact of the incidents on the electronic communication services.  4.2.1 Incidents per service  Figure 4 shows which percentage of incidents affected which services. Most incidents have an  impact on two or more services (which is why the percentages in the chart add up to 152%).  Most incidents (around 48%) affected mobile telephony or mobile Internet. This would suggest that  mobile services are more at risk of large-scale outages. We drew a similar conclusion last year.  4.2.2 Number of users affected per incident per service  Figure 5 shows the average number of users affected, per incident, per service (in 1000s).  37  25  48 49  0  10  20  30  40  50  60  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  (2011)  400  300  1800  1700  0  200  400  600  800  1000  1200  1400  1600  1800  2000  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  (2011)  Figure 4 Incidents per service (percentage)  Figure 5 Average number of users affected per incident per service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  9  Incidents affecting mobile telephony and mobile Internet involve on average 1,8 million users. This is  partly due to the fact that mobile telephony has more customers (on average 110% of the  population for mobile telephony, compared to 50% for fixed telephony). Note that the EU averages  in this calculation are not always representative for the sizes of incidents that could occur nationally  regarding users affected, because of differences in national network topologies. Also, since the  thresholds for reporting to ENISA and the EC are based on the percentage of national users affected,  smaller outages are underrepresented  in the EU averages.  4.2.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Figure 6 shows the percentage of the national user base affected, on average per incident, per  service.  On average, incidents affecting mobile internet affect 16% of the users. This is more than the  percentages for the mobile telephony and the fixed communication services. This would suggest  that, not only mobile Internet services are more vulnerable, but also that a larger portion of the  users is affected in the incidents that were reported.  10  8 9  16  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  (2011)  Figure 6 Number of users affected per incident per service (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  10  4.2.4 Impact on emergency services and interconnections  In figures 7 and 8 we show the impact on emergency services and interconnections respectively.  In 37 % of the incidents there was impact on emergency calls - i.e. the possibility for users to contact  emergency call-centres using the emergency number 112.  In 11 % of the incidents there was an impact on interconnections to other providers.  37 63  Emergency Calls  Affected  Not affected  (2011)  11  89  Interconnections  Affected  Not affected  (2011)  Figure 7 Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 8 Impact on interconnections  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  11  4.3 Root cause categories  This section shows the impact of incidents, per root cause category.  4.3.1 Incidents per root cause category  Figure 9  shows the percentage of incidents per root cause category.  Most of the incidents fall in the rootcause category ‘System failures’ (76%). Note that the numbers  add up to more than 100% because for a few incidents multiple root cause categories were  indicated.  4.3.2 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  Figure 10 shows the average duration of incident per root case category.  6  5  8  76  13  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failure  (2011)  36  26  4  9  13  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failure  (2011)  Figure 9 Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Figure 10 Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  12  Natural phenomena need the longest recovery time compared with the other root cause categories:  an average of 36 hours. Also incidents in the root cause category ‘Human Error’ needed long  recovery time, 26 hours in average.  4.3.3 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  Figure 11 shows the average number of affected user connections in each incident for a certain root  cause category. Note that a single user could have access to multiple services, so in certain incidents  the affected users are counted multiple times. For this reason we count the number of user  connections affected per service.  Although incidents caused by natural phenomena lasted longest (36 hours on average), the number  of user connections in these cases was relatively limited (on average 560.000 connections)  compared to other root cause categories. The incidents caused by third party failures affected most  connections (around 2.8 Million), and they lasted fairly long (on average 13 hours). A high proportion  of these incidents (60%) were caused by failures related to power supply. It is difficult to draw  conclusions on why the number of affected connections was so high this year. There were some  incidents that generated a very high number of affected user connections, mainly five incidents on  mobile networks that affected a range of 4 million to 50 million user connections.  557  447  1528  2330  2808  0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Third party failure  (2011)  Figure 11 Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  13  4.4 Detailed causes  In this section, instead of looking at the five root cause categories, we examine initial causes and  subsequent causes triggering the incident. For example, when a storm led to a power cut which  leads to a network outage, then for this incident both power cut and storm are counted as detailed  causes. We call them: “detailed causes”.  4.4.1 Detailed causes  Figure 12 shows the detailed causes of incidents.  Hardware failure was the most common cause, followed by software bugs.  38  23  13 11 9 6 6 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  0 5  10 15 20 25 30 35 40  Figure 12 Detailed causes of reported incidents  (2011)  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  14  4.4.2 Detailed causes per service  Figure 13 shows the causes of incidents per service.  For incidents in all four services, hardware failure was the most common cause. The second most  common cause for fixed telephony was software bug. Half of those incidents affected VoIP. For fixed  Internet, cyber attack was the second most common cause. For mobile telephony and mobile  internet the second most common cause was a software bug.  0 5  10 15 20 25 30 35 40  Fixed Telephony  Fixed Internet  Mobile Telephony  Mobile Internet  Figure 13 Detailed causes per service  (2011)  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  15  4.4.3 Average duration of incidents and number of user connections affected per detailed cause  Figure 14 shows the average duration of the incidents, per detailed cause4.  Incidents caused by bad weather, mainly storms and heavy snowfall, had the longest duration.  Figure 15 shows the average number of user connections affected, per detailed cause.  Overload was the cause affecting by far most user connections, more than 9 million connections on  average per incident. In second and third place came software bugs with 4 million affected  connections and power cuts with 3 million connections.  4  Note that ENISA does not have comparable data from the 2011 incidents.  84 72 72  36  22  14 10 9 8 8 8 8 6 5 3 3  0  10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90  9410  4295  3147  1803 1465 1000 450 429 386 300 271 192 153 64 28 6  0  1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000  10000  Figure 14 Average duration of incidents per detailed causes (hours).

The root cause category third party failure had most impact in terms of user-hours lost followed by  natural phenomena.  4.5.2 User-hours lost per detailed cause  Figure 17 shows the impact from the detailed causes in user-hours.

Switches were the assets most affected, followed by user and location and mobile network base  stations.  4.6.2 Affected assets by system failures  System failures is the most common root cause category.

Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  18  5 Conclusions  In this document ENISA summarized how the incident reporting scheme, mandated by Article 13a of  the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), was implemented across the EU and analysed the incident  reports. ENISA and the EC received as part of the second round of reporting: 79 reports about major  incidents that occurred in 2012.  From the 79 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the EC, the following conclusions can be  drawn.   Mobile networks most affected: Most incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile  Internet (about 50 % of the incidents respectively).   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile  Internet affected most users (around 1,8 million users per incident). This is consistent with  the high penetration rate of mobile telephony and mobile Internet.   Emergency Service are affected by incidents: In 37 % of the incidents there was impact on  emergency calls using the emergency number 112.   System failures are the most common root cause: Most incidents were caused by root  causes in the category “System failures” (75 % of the incidents). This was the most common  root cause category also for each of the four services (fixed and mobile telephony and fixed  and mobile Internet). In the category “System failures”, hardware failures were the most  common cause, followed by software bugs. The assets most often affected by  system  failures were switches (e.g. routers and local exchange points) and home location registers.   Third party failures and overload affect many users: Incidents categorized with the root  cause third party failures, mostly power supply failures, affected around 2.8 Million user  connections on average. Incidents involving the detailed cause overload affected around 9.4  million user connections on average.   Natural phenomena cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by natural phenomena  (mainly storms and heavy snowfall) lasted around 36 hours on average.   Overload and power failures have most impact: Incidents caused by overload followed by  power failures respectively had most impact in terms of number of users times duration.   Switches and home location registers most affected by incidents: Overall, switches and  home location registers were the network components most affected by incidents.  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group, will discuss specific incidents in more detail  with the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, the European Member States and the  European Commission for the fruitful collaboration, which has allowed for an efficient and rapid  implementation of the incident reporting process. We believe that this process (Article 13a) is a  good example for supervision of cyber security in other sectors. In fact, the proposal for a cyber  security directive, rececntly proposed by the EC, explicitly mentions that the Framework directive  was used as a model, and Article 14 of that proposal is very similar to Article 13a. ENISA is looking  forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to assist the EU Commission and the Member States in  further improving the security and resilience of the electronic communication networks in the EU.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2012  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  August 2013  Page  19  References  Related ENISA papers   The Article 13a WG technical guidelines on incident reporting and on minimum security  measures: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s report about the 2011 incidents, reported under Article 13a:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual- reports/annual-incident-reports-2011   ENISA’s whitepaper on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security  measures: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of  the situation in the EU 4 years ago.

The data shows that for all services, except fixed Internet, most incidents were caused by hardware  failures followed by software bugs. For fixed Internet most incidents were caused by hardware  failures followed by cyber attacks.  (2011)  Figure 24  Detailed causes for fixed telephony.

Figure 28  shows the detailed causes, for  PSTN and VoIP services.  Both PSTN and VoIP were mostly affected by hardware failures. VoIP was more affected by software  bugs, power cuts and cyber attacks, wereas PSTN was more affected by cable cuts.  Figure 29  shows the impact per detailed cause in user hours, for PSTN an VoIP services.  For PSTN, the detailed cause with most impact, in terms of user hours, was software bugs, followed  by overload. For VoIP the impact of overload was highest, followed by software bugs.  4691  16538  135  11128  112  1271  5588  372 135  10753  112  0  2000  4000  6000  8000  10000  12000  14000  16000  18000  Hardware failure  Software bug  Cable cut Power cut Cyber attack  Overload Power surges  Impact PSTN  Impact VoIP  14  3 3  10  3  14  10  7  10 10  3  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  Hardware failure  Software bug Cable cut Power cut Cyber attack Overload Power surges  PSTN  VoIP  Figure 29  Impact in users hours of incidents per detailed cause, for PSTN and VoIP.

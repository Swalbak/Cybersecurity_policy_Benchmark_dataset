TLP:CLEAR  http://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/  TLP:CLEAR  Summary  This guidance is the result of a collaborative effort from the United States Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the  United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United Kingdom National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC-UK), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre  for Cyber Security (CCCS), and the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ).  These cybersecurity authorities—herein referred to as “authoring organizations”—are aware  that communities may seek cost-savings and quality-of-life improvements through the digital  transformation of infrastructure to create “smart cities.” In this context, the term “smart cities”  refers to communities that:  • Integrate information and communications technologies (ICT), community-wide data,  and intelligent solutions to digitally transform infrastructure and optimize governance  in response to citizens’ needs.  • Connect the operational technology (OT) managing physical infrastructure with  networks and applications that collect and analyze data using ICT components—such  as internet of things (IoT) devices, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G.  Note: Terms that also refer to communities with this type of integration include “connected  places,” “connected communities,” and “smart places.” The communities adopting smart city  technologies in their infrastructure vary in size and include university campuses, military  installations, towns, and cities.  Integrating public services into a connected environment can increase the efficiency and  resilience of the infrastructure that supports day-to-day life in our communities. However,  communities considering becoming smart cities should thoroughly assess and mitigate the  cybersecurity risk that comes with this integration. Smart cities are attractive targets for  malicious cyber actors because of:  • The data being collected, transmitted, stored, and processed, which can include  significant amounts of sensitive information from governments, businesses, and  private citizens.  • The complex artificial intelligence-powered software systems, which may have  vulnerabilities, that smart cities sometimes use to integrate this data.  The intrinsic value of the large data sets and potential vulnerabilities in digital systems means  there is a risk of exploitation for espionage and for financial or political gain by malicious  threat actors, including nation-states, cybercriminals, hacktivists, insider threats, and  terrorists.

As communities implement smart city  technologies, this guidance provides recommendations to balance efficiency and innovation  with cybersecurity, privacy protections, and national security. Organizations should implement  these best practices in alignment with their specific cybersecurity requirements to ensure the  safe and secure operation of infrastructure systems, protection of citizens’ private data, and  security of sensitive government and business data.

Cyber threat activity  against OT systems is increasing globally, and the interconnection between OT systems and  smart city infrastructure increases the attack surface and heightens the potential  consequences of compromise.  Smart cities are an attractive target for criminals and cyber threat actors to exploit vulnerable  systems to steal critical infrastructure data and proprietary information, conduct ransomware  operations, or launch destructive cyberattacks. Successful cyberattacks against smart cities  could lead to disruption of infrastructure services, significant financial losses, exposure of  citizens’ private data, erosion of citizens’ trust in the smart systems themselves, and physical  impacts to infrastructure that could cause physical harm or loss of life. Communities  implementing smart city technologies should account for these associated risks as part of  their overall risk management approach. The authoring organizations recommend the  following resources for guidance on cyber risk management:  • An introduction to the cyber threat environment (CCCS)  • Control System Defense: Know the Opponent (CISA, NSA)  • Cyber threat bulletin: Cyber threat to operational technology (CCCS)  • Cyber Assessment Framework (NCSC-UK)  Expanded and Interconnected Attack Surface  Integrating a greater number of previously separate infrastructure systems into a single  network environment expands the digital attack surface for each interconnected organization.  This expanded attack surface increases the opportunity for threat actors to exploit a  vulnerability for initial access, move laterally across networks, and cause cascading, cross- sector disruptions of infrastructure operations, or otherwise threaten confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of organizational data, systems, and networks. For example, malicious actors  accessing a local government IoT sensor network might be able to obtain lateral access into  emergency alert systems if the systems are interconnected.  Additionally, as a result of smart cities integrating more systems and increasing connectivity  between subnetworks, network administrators and security personnel may lose visibility into  collective system risks. This potential loss of visibility includes components owned and  operated by vendors providing their infrastructure as a service to support integration. It is  critical that system owners maintain awareness and control of the evolving network topology  as well as the individuals/vendors responsible for the overall system and each segment.  Ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities could degrade the system’s cybersecurity  posture and incident response capabilities. Communities implementing smart city technology  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  4  https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/introduction-cyber-threat-environment https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/22/2003083007/-1/-1/0/CSA_ICS_Know_the_Opponent_.PDF https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-bulletin-cyber-threat-operational-technology https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/cyber-assessment-framework  TLP:CLEAR  should assess and manage these risks associated with complex interconnected systems.  Risks From the ICT Supply Chain and Vendors  Communities building smart infrastructure systems often rely on vendors to procure and  integrate hardware and software that link infrastructure operations via data connections.  Vulnerabilities in ICT supply chains—either intentionally developed by cyber threat actors for  malicious purposes or unintentionally created via poor security practices—can enable:  • Theft of data and intellectual property,  • Loss of confidence in the integrity of a smart city system, or  • A system or network failure through a disruption of availability in operational  technology.  ICT vendors providing smart city technology should take a holistic approach to security by  adhering to secure-by-design and secure-by-default development practices. Software products  developed in accordance with these practices decrease the burden on resource-constrained  local jurisdictions and increase the cybersecurity baseline across smart city networks. See the  following resource for guidance on secure-by-design and secure-by-default development  practices:  • Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security-by- Design and -Default (CISA, NSA, FBI, ACSC, NCSC-UK, CCCS, BSI, NCSC-NL, CERT NZ,  NCSC-NZ)  The risk from a single smart city vendor could be much higher than in other ICT supply chains  or infrastructure operations, given the increased interdependencies between technologies and  basic or vital services. Organizations should consider risks from each vendor carefully to avoid  exposing citizens, businesses, and communities to both potentially unreliable hardware and  software and deliberate exploitation of supply chain vulnerabilities as an attack vector. This  includes scrutinizing vendors from nation-states associated with cyberattacks, or those  subject to national legislation requiring them to hand over data to foreign intelligence services.  Illicit access gained through a vulnerable ICT supply chain could allow the degradation or  disruption of infrastructure operations and the compromise or theft of sensitive data from  utility operations, emergency service communications, or visual surveillance technologies.  Smart city IT vendors may also have access to vast amounts of sensitive data from multiple  communities to support the integration of infrastructure services—including sensitive  government information and personally identifiable information (PII)—which would be an  attractive target for malicious actors. The aggregation of sensitive data may provide malicious  actors with information that could expose vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and put  citizens at risk. See the following resources for guidance on mitigating supply chain risks:  • Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain Risk Management (CISA)  • Supply chain security guidance (NCSC-UK)  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  5  https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security  TLP:CLEAR  • Identifying Cyber Supply Chain Risks (ACSC)  • Cyber supply chain: An approach to assessing risk (CCCS)  Automation of Infrastructure Operations  Smart cities can achieve efficiencies by automating operations, such as wastewater treatment  or traffic management. Automation reduces the requirement for direct human control of those  systems. Automation can also allow for better consistency, reliability, and speed for  standardized operations. However, automation can also introduce new vulnerabilities because  it increases the number of remote entry points into the network (e.g., IoT sensors and remote  access points). The volume of data and complexity of automated operations—including  reliance on third-party vendors to monitor and manage operations—can reduce visibility into  system operations and potentially hinder real-time incident response.  Automation for infrastructure operations in smart city environments may require the use of  sensors and actuators that increase the number of endpoints and network connections that  are vulnerable to compromise. The integration of AI and complex digital systems could  introduce new unmitigated attack vectors and additional vulnerable network components.  Reliance on an AI system or other complex systems may decrease overall transparency into  the operations of networked devices as these systems make and execute operational  decisions based on algorithms instead of human judgment.  Recommendations  Secure Planning and Design  The authoring organizations strongly recommend communities include strategic foresight and  proactive cybersecurity risk management processes in their plans and designs for integrating  smart city technologies into their infrastructure systems. New technology should be deliberately  and carefully integrated into legacy infrastructure designs. Communities should ensure any  “smart” or connected features they are planning to include in new infrastructure are secure by  design and incorporate secure connectivity with any remaining legacy systems. Additionally,  communities should be aware that legacy infrastructure may require a redesign to securely  deploy smart city systems. Security planning should focus on creating resilience through  defense in depth and account for both physical and cyber risk as well as the converged cyber- physical environment that IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) systems introduce. See the following  consolidated, baseline practices that organizations of all sizes can implement to reduce the  likelihood and impact of known IT and OT risks.  • Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CISA)  See the following additional resources for guidance on accounting for risks in the cyber,  physical, and converged environments:  • Improving ICS Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies (CISA)  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  6  https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/identifying-cyber-supply-chain-risks https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-supply-chain-approach-assessing-risk-itsap10070 https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf  TLP:CLEAR  • Cybersecurity and Physical Security Convergence (CISA)  • Consequence-Driven Cyber-Informed Engineering (INL)  Apply the principle of least privilege.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should apply the  principle of least privilege throughout their network environments. As defined by the U.S.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the principle of least privilege is, “The  principle that a security architecture should be designed so that each entity is granted the  minimum system resources and authorizations that the entity needs to perform its function.”  Administrators should review default and existing configurations along with hardening  guidance from vendors to ensure that hardware and software is only permissioned to access  other systems and data that it needs to perform its functions. Administrators should also  immediately update privileges upon changes in administrative roles or the addition of new  users or administrators from newly integrated systems. They should use a tiered model with  different levels of administrative access based on job requirements. Administrators should  limit access to accounts with full privileges across an enterprise to dedicated, hardened  privileged access workstations (PAWs). Administrators should also use time-based or just-in- time privileges and identify high-risk devices, services, and users to minimize their access. For  detailed guidance, see:  • Defend Privileges and Accounts (NSA)  • Restricting Administrative Privileges (ACSC)  • Managing and controlling administrative privileges (CCCS)  Enforce multifactor authentication.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should secure remote  access applications and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on local and remote  accounts and devices where possible to harden the infrastructure that enables access to  networks and systems. Organizations should explicitly require MFA where users perform  privileged actions or access important (sensitive or high-availability) data repositories. Russian  state-sponsored APT actors have recently demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA  protocols. Organizations responsible for implementing smart cities should review configuration  policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios. See the following resource  for guidance on implementing MFA:  • #More Than a Password (CISA)  • Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default  Multifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability (FBI, CISA)  • Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication (NSA)  • MFA for online services (NCSC-UK)  • Implementing MFA (ACSC)  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  7  https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-and-physical-security-convergence https://inl.gov/cce/ https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180330/-1/-1/0/Defend%20Privileges%20and%20Accounts%20-%20Copy.pdf https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/restricting-administrative-privileges https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/managing-and-controlling-administrative-privileges-itsap10094 https://www.cisa.gov/mfa https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180346/-1/-1/0/Transition%20to%20Multi-factor%20Authentication%20-%20Copy.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/implementing-multi-factor-authentication  TLP:CLEAR  • Zero trust architecture design principles - Authenticate and authorize (NCSC-UK)  Implement zero trust architecture.  Implementing zero trust network design principles will create a more secure network  environment that requires authentication and authorization for each new connection with a  layered, defense-in-depth approach to security. Zero trust also allows for greater visibility into  network activity, trend identification through analytics, issue resolution through automation  and orchestration, and more efficient network security governance. See the following  resources for guidance on implementing zero trust:  • Zero trust architecture design principles (NCSC-UK)  • Zero Trust Maturity Model (CISA)  • Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model (NSA)  • A zero trust approach to security architecture (CCCS)  • Zero Trust security model (CCCS)  Note: Both zero trust architecture and MFA should be applied wherever operationally feasible  in balance with requirements for endpoint trust relationships. Some OT networks may require  trust-by-default architectures, but organizations should isolate such networks and ensure all  interconnections with that network are secured using zero trust and related principles.  Manage changes to internal architecture risks.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should understand their  environment and carefully manage communications between subnetworks, including newly  interconnected subnetworks linking infrastructure systems. Network administrators should  maintain awareness of their evolving network architecture and the personnel accountable for the  security of the integrated whole and each individual segment. Administrators should identify,  group, and isolate critical business systems and apply the appropriate network security controls  and monitoring systems to reduce the impact of a compromise across the community. See the  following resources for detailed guidance:  • CISA Vulnerability Scanning (CISA)  • Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Services (NCSC-UK)  • Security architecture anti-patterns (NCSC-UK)  • Preventing Lateral Movement (NCSC-UK)  • Segment Networks and Deploy Application-aware Defenses (NSA)  Securely manage smart city assets.

See the following resources for guidance on protecting devices by securing remote access:  • Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions (CISA, NSA)  • Using Virtual Private Networks (ACSC)  • Virtual private networks (CCCS)  Protect internet-facing services.  See the following resources for guidance on protecting internet-facing services:  • Protecting internet-facing services on public service CNI (NCSC-UK)  • Strategies for protecting web application systems against credential stuffing attacks (CCCS)  • Isolate web-facing applications (CCCS)  Patch systems and applications in a timely manner.  Where possible, enable automatic patching processes for all software and hardware devices  that include authenticity and integrity validation. Leverage threat intelligence to identify active  threats and ensure exposed systems and infrastructure are protected. Secure software assets  through an asset management program that includes a product lifecycle process. This process  should include planning replacements for components and software nearing or past end-of- life, as patches may cease to be developed by manufacturers or developers. See the following  resources for guidance on protecting systems and networks via asset management:  • Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog (CISA)  • Asset management for cyber security (NCSC-UK)  Review the legal, security, and privacy risks associated with deployments.  Implement processes that continuously evaluate and manage the legal and privacy risks  associated with deployed solutions.  Proactive Supply Chain Risk Management  All organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should proactively  manage ICT supply chain risk for any new technology, including hardware or software that  supports the implementation of smart city systems or service providers supporting  implementation and operations. Organizations should use only trusted ICT vendors and  components. The ICT supply chain risk management process should include participation from  all levels of the organization and have full support from program leaders implementing smart  city systems. Procurement officials from communities implementing smart city systems should  also communicate minimum security requirements to vendors and articulate actions they will  take in response to breaches of those requirements. Smart city technology supply chains  should be transparent to the citizens whose data the systems will collect and process.

Product vendors should also assume some of the risk associated with their products and  develop smart city technology in adherence to secure-by-design and secure-by-default  principles and active maintenance for the products they provide. Vendors adhering to these  principles give the organizations responsible for procuring and implementing smart city  technology more confidence in the products they introduce into their networks.

These organizations should perform due-diligence research on  how parts are sourced and assembled to create products. They should also determine how the  devices store and share data and how the devices secure data at rest, in transit, and in use.  Organizations should maintain a risk register that identifies both their own and their vendors’  reliance on cloud computing support, externally sourced components, and similar  dependencies.

Organizations  should account for the risks of contracting with third-party vendors in their overall risk  management planning and ensure organizational security standards are included in  contractual agreements with external parties. Similarly, organizations should carefully review  cloud service agreements, including data security provisions and responsibility sharing  models.

Those contingencies should include plans for disconnecting  infrastructure systems from one another or from the public internet to operate autonomously.  In the event of a compromise, organizations should be prepared to isolate affected systems  and operate other infrastructure with as little disruption as possible.  Backup systems and data.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should create, maintain,  and test backups, both for IT system records and for manual operational capabilities for the  physical systems integrated in a smart city network. These organizations should identify how  and where data will be collected, processed, stored, and transmitted and ensure each node in  that data lifecycle is protected. System administrators should store IT backups separately and  isolate them to inhibit the spread of ransomware—many ransomware variants attempt to find  and encrypt/delete accessible backups. Isolating backups enables restoration of  systems/data to their previous state in the case of a ransomware attack.

For detailed guidance, see:  • Offline backups in an online world (NCSC-UK)  Conduct workforce training.  Though implementation of smart city technology may include extensive automation,  employees responsible for managing infrastructure operations should be prepared to isolate  compromised IT systems from OT and manually operate core functions if necessary.  Organizations should train new and existing employees on integrated, automated operations  as well as isolated, manual backup procedures, including processes for restoring service after  a restart. Organizations should update training regularly to account for new technologies and  components. For detailed guidance, see:  • ICS Training Available Through CISA (CISA)  Develop and exercise incident response and recovery plans.  Incident response and recovery plans should include roles and responsibilities for all  stakeholders including executive leaders, technical leads, and procurement officers from  inside and outside the smart city implementation team. The organizations responsible for  implementing smart city technology should maintain up-to-date and accessible hard copies of  these plans for responders should the network be inaccessible (e.g., due to a ransomware  attack).

TLP:CLEAR  http://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/  TLP:CLEAR  Summary  This guidance is the result of a collaborative effort from the United States Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the  United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United Kingdom National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC-UK), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre  for Cyber Security (CCCS), and the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ).  These cybersecurity authorities—herein referred to as “authoring organizations”—are aware  that communities may seek cost-savings and quality-of-life improvements through the digital  transformation of infrastructure to create “smart cities.” In this context, the term “smart cities”  refers to communities that:  • Integrate information and communications technologies (ICT), community-wide data,  and intelligent solutions to digitally transform infrastructure and optimize governance  in response to citizens’ needs.  • Connect the operational technology (OT) managing physical infrastructure with  networks and applications that collect and analyze data using ICT components—such  as internet of things (IoT) devices, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G.  Note: Terms that also refer to communities with this type of integration include “connected  places,” “connected communities,” and “smart places.” The communities adopting smart city  technologies in their infrastructure vary in size and include university campuses, military  installations, towns, and cities.  Integrating public services into a connected environment can increase the efficiency and  resilience of the infrastructure that supports day-to-day life in our communities. However,  communities considering becoming smart cities should thoroughly assess and mitigate the  cybersecurity risk that comes with this integration. Smart cities are attractive targets for  malicious cyber actors because of:  • The data being collected, transmitted, stored, and processed, which can include  significant amounts of sensitive information from governments, businesses, and  private citizens.  • The complex artificial intelligence-powered software systems, which may have  vulnerabilities, that smart cities sometimes use to integrate this data.  The intrinsic value of the large data sets and potential vulnerabilities in digital systems means  there is a risk of exploitation for espionage and for financial or political gain by malicious  threat actors, including nation-states, cybercriminals, hacktivists, insider threats, and  terrorists.

As communities implement smart city  technologies, this guidance provides recommendations to balance efficiency and innovation  with cybersecurity, privacy protections, and national security. Organizations should implement  these best practices in alignment with their specific cybersecurity requirements to ensure the  safe and secure operation of infrastructure systems, protection of citizens’ private data, and  security of sensitive government and business data.  The authoring organizations recommend reviewing this guidance in conjunction with NCSC- UK’s Connected Places Cyber Security Principles, ACSC’s An Introduction to Securing Smart  Places, CCCS’s Security Considerations for Critical Infrastructure, CISA’s Cross-Sector  Cybersecurity Performance Goals, Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and  Approaches for Security-by-Design and -Default, and Protecting Against Cyber Threats to  Managed Service Providers and their Customers.

Cyber threat activity  against OT systems is increasing globally, and the interconnection between OT systems and  smart city infrastructure increases the attack surface and heightens the potential  consequences of compromise.  Smart cities are an attractive target for criminals and cyber threat actors to exploit vulnerable  systems to steal critical infrastructure data and proprietary information, conduct ransomware  operations, or launch destructive cyberattacks. Successful cyberattacks against smart cities  could lead to disruption of infrastructure services, significant financial losses, exposure of  citizens’ private data, erosion of citizens’ trust in the smart systems themselves, and physical  impacts to infrastructure that could cause physical harm or loss of life. Communities  implementing smart city technologies should account for these associated risks as part of  their overall risk management approach. The authoring organizations recommend the  following resources for guidance on cyber risk management:  • An introduction to the cyber threat environment (CCCS)  • Control System Defense: Know the Opponent (CISA, NSA)  • Cyber threat bulletin: Cyber threat to operational technology (CCCS)  • Cyber Assessment Framework (NCSC-UK)  Expanded and Interconnected Attack Surface  Integrating a greater number of previously separate infrastructure systems into a single  network environment expands the digital attack surface for each interconnected organization.  This expanded attack surface increases the opportunity for threat actors to exploit a  vulnerability for initial access, move laterally across networks, and cause cascading, cross- sector disruptions of infrastructure operations, or otherwise threaten confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of organizational data, systems, and networks. For example, malicious actors  accessing a local government IoT sensor network might be able to obtain lateral access into  emergency alert systems if the systems are interconnected.  Additionally, as a result of smart cities integrating more systems and increasing connectivity  between subnetworks, network administrators and security personnel may lose visibility into  collective system risks. This potential loss of visibility includes components owned and  operated by vendors providing their infrastructure as a service to support integration. It is  critical that system owners maintain awareness and control of the evolving network topology  as well as the individuals/vendors responsible for the overall system and each segment.  Ambiguity regarding roles and responsibilities could degrade the system’s cybersecurity  posture and incident response capabilities. Communities implementing smart city technology  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  4  https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/introduction-cyber-threat-environment https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/22/2003083007/-1/-1/0/CSA_ICS_Know_the_Opponent_.PDF https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-bulletin-cyber-threat-operational-technology https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/cyber-assessment-framework  TLP:CLEAR  should assess and manage these risks associated with complex interconnected systems.  Risks From the ICT Supply Chain and Vendors  Communities building smart infrastructure systems often rely on vendors to procure and  integrate hardware and software that link infrastructure operations via data connections.  Vulnerabilities in ICT supply chains—either intentionally developed by cyber threat actors for  malicious purposes or unintentionally created via poor security practices—can enable:  • Theft of data and intellectual property,  • Loss of confidence in the integrity of a smart city system, or  • A system or network failure through a disruption of availability in operational  technology.  ICT vendors providing smart city technology should take a holistic approach to security by  adhering to secure-by-design and secure-by-default development practices. Software products  developed in accordance with these practices decrease the burden on resource-constrained  local jurisdictions and increase the cybersecurity baseline across smart city networks. See the  following resource for guidance on secure-by-design and secure-by-default development  practices:  • Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security-by- Design and -Default (CISA, NSA, FBI, ACSC, NCSC-UK, CCCS, BSI, NCSC-NL, CERT NZ,  NCSC-NZ)  The risk from a single smart city vendor could be much higher than in other ICT supply chains  or infrastructure operations, given the increased interdependencies between technologies and  basic or vital services. Organizations should consider risks from each vendor carefully to avoid  exposing citizens, businesses, and communities to both potentially unreliable hardware and  software and deliberate exploitation of supply chain vulnerabilities as an attack vector. This  includes scrutinizing vendors from nation-states associated with cyberattacks, or those  subject to national legislation requiring them to hand over data to foreign intelligence services.  Illicit access gained through a vulnerable ICT supply chain could allow the degradation or  disruption of infrastructure operations and the compromise or theft of sensitive data from  utility operations, emergency service communications, or visual surveillance technologies.  Smart city IT vendors may also have access to vast amounts of sensitive data from multiple  communities to support the integration of infrastructure services—including sensitive  government information and personally identifiable information (PII)—which would be an  attractive target for malicious actors. The aggregation of sensitive data may provide malicious  actors with information that could expose vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and put  citizens at risk. See the following resources for guidance on mitigating supply chain risks:  • Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain Risk Management (CISA)  • Supply chain security guidance (NCSC-UK)  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  5  https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security  TLP:CLEAR  • Identifying Cyber Supply Chain Risks (ACSC)  • Cyber supply chain: An approach to assessing risk (CCCS)  Automation of Infrastructure Operations  Smart cities can achieve efficiencies by automating operations, such as wastewater treatment  or traffic management. Automation reduces the requirement for direct human control of those  systems. Automation can also allow for better consistency, reliability, and speed for  standardized operations. However, automation can also introduce new vulnerabilities because  it increases the number of remote entry points into the network (e.g., IoT sensors and remote  access points). The volume of data and complexity of automated operations—including  reliance on third-party vendors to monitor and manage operations—can reduce visibility into  system operations and potentially hinder real-time incident response.  Automation for infrastructure operations in smart city environments may require the use of  sensors and actuators that increase the number of endpoints and network connections that  are vulnerable to compromise. The integration of AI and complex digital systems could  introduce new unmitigated attack vectors and additional vulnerable network components.  Reliance on an AI system or other complex systems may decrease overall transparency into  the operations of networked devices as these systems make and execute operational  decisions based on algorithms instead of human judgment.  Recommendations  Secure Planning and Design  The authoring organizations strongly recommend communities include strategic foresight and  proactive cybersecurity risk management processes in their plans and designs for integrating  smart city technologies into their infrastructure systems. New technology should be deliberately  and carefully integrated into legacy infrastructure designs. Communities should ensure any  “smart” or connected features they are planning to include in new infrastructure are secure by  design and incorporate secure connectivity with any remaining legacy systems. Additionally,  communities should be aware that legacy infrastructure may require a redesign to securely  deploy smart city systems. Security planning should focus on creating resilience through  defense in depth and account for both physical and cyber risk as well as the converged cyber- physical environment that IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) systems introduce. See the following  consolidated, baseline practices that organizations of all sizes can implement to reduce the  likelihood and impact of known IT and OT risks.  • Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CISA)  See the following additional resources for guidance on accounting for risks in the cyber,  physical, and converged environments:  • Improving ICS Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies (CISA)  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  6  https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/identifying-cyber-supply-chain-risks https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-supply-chain-approach-assessing-risk-itsap10070 https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf  TLP:CLEAR  • Cybersecurity and Physical Security Convergence (CISA)  • Consequence-Driven Cyber-Informed Engineering (INL)  Apply the principle of least privilege.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should apply the  principle of least privilege throughout their network environments. As defined by the U.S.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the principle of least privilege is, “The  principle that a security architecture should be designed so that each entity is granted the  minimum system resources and authorizations that the entity needs to perform its function.”  Administrators should review default and existing configurations along with hardening  guidance from vendors to ensure that hardware and software is only permissioned to access  other systems and data that it needs to perform its functions. Administrators should also  immediately update privileges upon changes in administrative roles or the addition of new  users or administrators from newly integrated systems. They should use a tiered model with  different levels of administrative access based on job requirements. Administrators should  limit access to accounts with full privileges across an enterprise to dedicated, hardened  privileged access workstations (PAWs). Administrators should also use time-based or just-in- time privileges and identify high-risk devices, services, and users to minimize their access. For  detailed guidance, see:  • Defend Privileges and Accounts (NSA)  • Restricting Administrative Privileges (ACSC)  • Managing and controlling administrative privileges (CCCS)  Enforce multifactor authentication.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should secure remote  access applications and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on local and remote  accounts and devices where possible to harden the infrastructure that enables access to  networks and systems. Organizations should explicitly require MFA where users perform  privileged actions or access important (sensitive or high-availability) data repositories. Russian  state-sponsored APT actors have recently demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA  protocols. Organizations responsible for implementing smart cities should review configuration  policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios. See the following resource  for guidance on implementing MFA:  • #More Than a Password (CISA)  • Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default  Multifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability (FBI, CISA)  • Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication (NSA)  • MFA for online services (NCSC-UK)  • Implementing MFA (ACSC)  CISA | NSA | FBI | NCSC-UK | ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  7  https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-and-physical-security-convergence https://inl.gov/cce/ https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180330/-1/-1/0/Defend%20Privileges%20and%20Accounts%20-%20Copy.pdf https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/restricting-administrative-privileges https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/managing-and-controlling-administrative-privileges-itsap10094 https://www.cisa.gov/mfa https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180346/-1/-1/0/Transition%20to%20Multi-factor%20Authentication%20-%20Copy.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/implementing-multi-factor-authentication  TLP:CLEAR  • Zero trust architecture design principles - Authenticate and authorize (NCSC-UK)  Implement zero trust architecture.  Implementing zero trust network design principles will create a more secure network  environment that requires authentication and authorization for each new connection with a  layered, defense-in-depth approach to security. Zero trust also allows for greater visibility into  network activity, trend identification through analytics, issue resolution through automation  and orchestration, and more efficient network security governance. See the following  resources for guidance on implementing zero trust:  • Zero trust architecture design principles (NCSC-UK)  • Zero Trust Maturity Model (CISA)  • Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model (NSA)  • A zero trust approach to security architecture (CCCS)  • Zero Trust security model (CCCS)  Note: Both zero trust architecture and MFA should be applied wherever operationally feasible  in balance with requirements for endpoint trust relationships. Some OT networks may require  trust-by-default architectures, but organizations should isolate such networks and ensure all  interconnections with that network are secured using zero trust and related principles.  Manage changes to internal architecture risks.  The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should understand their  environment and carefully manage communications between subnetworks, including newly  interconnected subnetworks linking infrastructure systems. Network administrators should  maintain awareness of their evolving network architecture and the personnel accountable for the  security of the integrated whole and each individual segment. Administrators should identify,  group, and isolate critical business systems and apply the appropriate network security controls  and monitoring systems to reduce the impact of a compromise across the community.

Implement processes that continuously evaluate and manage the legal and privacy risks  associated with deployed solutions.  Proactive Supply Chain Risk Management  All organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should proactively  manage ICT supply chain risk for any new technology, including hardware or software that  supports the implementation of smart city systems or service providers supporting  implementation and operations. Organizations should use only trusted ICT vendors and  components. The ICT supply chain risk management process should include participation from  all levels of the organization and have full support from program leaders implementing smart  city systems. Procurement officials from communities implementing smart city systems should  also communicate minimum security requirements to vendors and articulate actions they will  take in response to breaches of those requirements. Smart city technology supply chains  should be transparent to the citizens whose data the systems will collect and process.

Product vendors should also assume some of the risk associated with their products and  develop smart city technology in adherence to secure-by-design and secure-by-default  principles and active maintenance for the products they provide. Vendors adhering to these  principles give the organizations responsible for procuring and implementing smart city  technology more confidence in the products they introduce into their networks.

These organizations should perform due-diligence research on  how parts are sourced and assembled to create products. They should also determine how the  devices store and share data and how the devices secure data at rest, in transit, and in use.  Organizations should maintain a risk register that identifies both their own and their vendors’  reliance on cloud computing support, externally sourced components, and similar  dependencies.

The organizations responsible for implementing smart city technology should create, maintain,  and test backups, both for IT system records and for manual operational capabilities for the  physical systems integrated in a smart city network. These organizations should identify how  and where data will be collected, processed, stored, and transmitted and ensure each node in  that data lifecycle is protected. System administrators should store IT backups separately and  isolate them to inhibit the spread of ransomware—many ransomware variants attempt to find  and encrypt/delete accessible backups. Isolating backups enables restoration of  systems/data to their previous state in the case of a ransomware attack.

For detailed guidance, see:  • Offline backups in an online world (NCSC-UK)  Conduct workforce training.  Though implementation of smart city technology may include extensive automation,  employees responsible for managing infrastructure operations should be prepared to isolate  compromised IT systems from OT and manually operate core functions if necessary.  Organizations should train new and existing employees on integrated, automated operations  as well as isolated, manual backup procedures, including processes for restoring service after  a restart. Organizations should update training regularly to account for new technologies and  components. For detailed guidance, see:  • ICS Training Available Through CISA (CISA)  Develop and exercise incident response and recovery plans.  Incident response and recovery plans should include roles and responsibilities for all  stakeholders including executive leaders, technical leads, and procurement officers from  inside and outside the smart city implementation team. The organizations responsible for  implementing smart city technology should maintain up-to-date and accessible hard copies of  these plans for responders should the network be inaccessible (e.g., due to a ransomware  attack). Organizations should exercise their plans annually and coordinate with continuity  managers to ensure continuity of operations.

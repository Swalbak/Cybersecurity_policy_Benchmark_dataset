While some years ago  applications would be mainly run on servers on their own premises or dedicated data centres,  now  applications are outsourced to large cloud service providers and run in a few large data centres. Public  data on the uptake of cloud computing shows that in a couple of years around 80% of organisations  will be dependent on cloud computing. Large cloud providers will be serving tens of millions of end- users.  From a CIIP perspective this concentration of IT resources is a ‘double edged sword’: On the one hand,  large cloud providers can deploy state of the art security and resilience measures and spread the  associated costs across the customers. On the other hand, if an outage or a security breach occurs the  consequences could be big, affecting a lot of data, many organizations and a large number of citizens,  at once. In fact in the last year there were a number of outages affecting several very large sites with  millions of users.  The EU member states have committed to protecting critical ICT systems via the European  Commission’s CIIP action plan by preventing large cyber-attacks and cyber disruptions of critical ICT  systems. In the follow-up the European commission asks for a discussion about a governance strategy  for cloud computing services, in the context of CIIP.  In this report we look cloud computing from a CIIP perspective and we look at a number of scenarios  and threats relevant from a CIIP perspective, based on a survey of public sources on uptake of cloud  computing and large cyber attacks and disruptions of cloud computing services.  From the scenarios and the data about uptake and incidents we draw a number of conclusions.   Cloud computing is critical: Cloud computing usage is growing and in the near future the vast  majority of organizations will rely on some form of cloud computing services. This makes cloud  computing services critical in themselves. When cyber attacks and cyber disruptions happen,  millions of users are affected. Cloud computing is being adopted also in critical sectors, like  finance, energy and transport.   Cloud computing and natural disasters: A key benefit of cloud computing is resilience in the  face of regional power cuts or local natural disasters. It is difficult to mitigate the impact of  fairly common regional disasters like floods, storms, or earthquakes in a set up with only a  single datacentre, or a traditional set-up with a legacy onsite IT deployment.   Cloud computing and overloads or DDoS attacks: Elasticity is a key benefit of cloud computing  and this elasticity helps to cope with load and mitigates the risk of overload or DDoS attacks. It  is difficult to mitigate the impact of peak usage or a DDoS attack with limited computing  resources.   Cyber attacks: Cyber attacks which exploit software flaws can cause very large data breaches,  affecting millions of users directly. The impact of cyber attacks is multiplied by the  concentration of resources which is a result of the uptake in cloud computing.   Infrastructure and platform as a Service the most critical: The most critical services are large  IaaS and PaaS services which deliver services to other IT vendors who service in turn millions of  users and organisations.   Administrative and legal disputes: Cloud computing is not immune to administrative or legal  issues. If there is a legal dispute involving the provider or one of its customers, than this could  have an impact on the data of all the other co- customers (or co-tenants).  http://www.wired.com/business/2011/04/lessons-amazon-cloud-failure/ http://www.wired.com/business/2011/04/lessons-amazon-cloud-failure/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  iv  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  The CIIP action plan calls for a discussion about governance strategies for cloud computing and also in  speeches about the EU Cyber Security Strategy the issue of cyber security governance is addressed.  Below we make a number of recommendations related to the issue of national governance of critical  cloud computing services.  Governance, from a national perspective, can be split into three key processes: 1) Risk assessment, 2)  ensuring that appropriate security measures are taken, and 3) collecting incident reports.   Risk assessment: Risk assessment is the basis for security governance.  o Assets in scope: It is important to take a pragmatic approach and address the most critical  cloud computing services first. It is easy to say that ‘all cloud computing services are  critical’ but it is infeasible to address everything at once. As mentioned, since outages at  IaaS or PaaS providers can have an impact across a range of organizations, this means that  they should be treated with priority.  o Assessing dependencies on cloud computing: Most countries, when making national risk  assessments, from a critical infrastructure perspective, take into account power supply  and electronic communications networks. Public sources on uptake cloud computing  suggest that it is necessary to take into account also large cloud computing services and  large datacentres.  o Transparency about logical and physical dependencies: A risk assessment requires a clear  view of the dependencies. It should be clear which critical operators and critical services  depend on which cloud computing services. The special nature of cloud computing creates  resilience but it can also increase interdependencies and cause cascading failures. Outages  at an underlying IaaS or PaaS provider can affect a range of (otherwise unrelated) services  across society. It is important to map all the main logical and physical dependencies.   Security measures: Taking appropriate security measures is the focus of security governance.  o Foster exchange of best practices to achieve a security baseline: It goes without saying  that it is important that cloud providers take appropriate security measures. These  measures should be based on best-practices. It is important for government authorities to  support and foster the exchange of such best practices. Security is constantly changing and  security measures must be improved continuously. Government authorities should  encourage an open culture of exchange and discussion about security measures. Security  is about continuous improvement and government authorities should avoid a situation  where a specific set of best practices is cast in stone (by regulation or self-regulation).  o Logical redundancy: Cloud computing services are often set-up with several redundant  datacentres to withstand outages of single datacentres (due to power cuts or natural  disasters, for example). Many cyber attacks, however, capitalise and exploit software  flaws, which are persist across the datacentres. It is important to prevent and mitigate the  impact of cyber attacks by creating also logical redundancy – that is, to use different layers  of defence and to use separate systems with a different logical structure, to cross-check  transactions and to detect attacks.  o Standardisation: From a CIIP perspective standardization in cloud computing is very  important, because it allows customers to mitigate issues related to a specific provider or  a specific platform. Standardization, especially for IaaS and PaaS services, would allow  customers to move workload to other providers in case one provider has suffers a large  outages caused by system failures or even administrative or legal disputes.  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-12-204_en.htm?locale=en  v  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  o Monitoring, audits, tests, and exercises: There is a lot of information security literature  about the importance of auditing and testing systems. Cloud computing providers should  schedule frequent audits and tests, by internal testers and auditors, and, when relevant,  by external testers and auditors. In discussions about governance, often the need for  certification, by independent external auditors is stressed. But it is hard for an external  auditor to assess the security of a complex and continuously changing system, by  performing an audit once per year. Cloud computing providers and government  authorities should have a continuous program of monitoring, audits, tests and exercises in  place. Yearly audits by external parties are only a small part of such a program.   Incident reporting: Incident reporting provides a cross-check on the security measures, it  provides the input for an improved risk assessment, and it provides strategic feedback about  the overall governance process.  o Mandatory reporting: Without incident reports it is very difficult to understand the impact  of security incidents on cloud computing providers. This complicates risk assessment, both  for cloud computing service providers, as well as, at a national level, for government  authorities like agencies responsible for (civil) contingency planning. Lack of data about  incidents makes it very difficult to prioritize security measures, and in this way security  governance becomes inefficient or even ineffective. Government authorities and cloud  providers should agree on the thresholds for reporting and the type of services that should  be in scope.  o Legal consequences: Secondly, it is important to consider that certain cyber attacks are  stealthy and their traces may be difficult to spot even for system administrators who know  the cloud computing systems inside out. There is always a risk that security incidents are  not reported to higher management or to authorities for fear of reprisal or legal  consequences. Member states should consider giving incentives to providers who report  security breaches which would otherwise go unnoticed.  vi  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Table of Contents  Executive summary .............................................................................................................................. iii  1 Introduction ................................................................................................................................. 1  2 Uptake of Cloud Computing.......................................................................................................... 3  3 CIIP Perspective of Cloud Computing ............................................................................................ 6  3.1 Concentration of ICT resources .............................................................................................. 6  3.2 Cloud and CIIP ....................................................................................................................... 7  3.2.1 Cyber disruptions ........................................................................................................... 7  3.2.2 Cyber attacks ................................................................................................................. 9  3.3 Relevant threats .................................................................................................................. 10  4 Cloud computing scenarios ......................................................................................................... 11  4.1 Financial services ................................................................................................................. 11  4.1.1 Cyber attack................................................................................................................. 12  4.1.2 Other cyber-attacks affecting cloud computing services ............................................... 13  4.2 Health services .................................................................................................................... 14  4.2.1 Natural disaster ........................................................................................................... 15  4.3 eGovernment services ......................................................................................................... 16  4.3.1 Overload ...................................................................................................................... 17  4.3.2 System failure .............................................................................................................. 18  4.3.3 Other system failures causing large outages or data loss .............................................. 19  4.4 Administrative or legal disputes ........................................................................................... 21  5 Conclusions & Recommendations ............................................................................................... 22  5.1.1 Risk assessment ........................................................................................................... 23  5.1.2 Security measures ........................................................................................................ 24  5.1.3 Incident reporting ........................................................................................................ 25  6 References ................................................................................................................................. 26  1  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  1 Introduction  Public and private sector organisations are switching to cloud computing and single cloud service  providers sometimes provide services for millions of users and a range of organizations and  businesses. This means that also from a CIIP perspective cloud computing becomes relevant. In this  paper we look at key risks for cloud computing services from a CIIP perspective. We look at data about  the usage and uptake of cloud computing and we analyse some scenarios. We conclude with  recommendations for government bodies, like regulators and contingency agencies, about addressing  the risks of cloud computing.  Policy context  The EU Member States have committed to protecting CII, via the European Commission’s  Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP)1. The CIIP action plan focusses  on strengthening the security and resilience of CII, and preventing large cyber-attacks and cyber  disruptions. The communication mentions cyber attacks, natural disasters and technical failures as the  main threats, and cites two examples: the DDoS attacks on Estonia in 2007, and the transatlantic  submarine cable cuts in 2008. The communication explicitly calls for discussion about the best  governance strategy for cloud computing services in this respect.  Critical information infrastructures (CII) are the ICT systems which are vital for the economy or the  society of a country (or a group of countries). There are several definitions of CII in the literature. The  European Commission (in the Communication on CIIP) has defined Critical Information Infrastructures  as all ICT systems which are either, a) critical infrastructure themselves, or b) essential for the  operation of other critical infrastructures. The OECD defined CII as those information systems and  networks, the disruption or destruction of which would have a serious impact on the health, safety,  security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the effective functioning of government or the  economy2.  The European Commission is also developing a European Cyber Security Strategy. The roadmap for  the strategy refers mentions extending Article 13a (a regulation on security and resilience of  telecommunications) to other business sectors.  Goal  The goal of this document is to look at the security and resilience of using cloud computing, from a CIIP  perspective.  Target audience  This document is targeted at IT officers in government bodies, like regulators and contingency  agencies, national and EU level policy makers, and also cloud computing vendors who deliver cloud  critical cloud computing services.

This means that we are primarily focussed on large- scale impact on society (for example caused by large outages or large cyber-attacks). We do not go  into details about issues like data protection, legal compliance or governance of individual cloud  service contracts and SLAs, for example.  For the full range of security risks and benefits for organisations (SMEs or government organisations)  when adopting cloud computing we refer to earlier ENISA papers.  Disclaimer about examples  For the sake of clarification we provide numerous examples, referring to public sources about cloud  services, cloud customers, security incidents, and so on. By no means is it our intention to single out  individual organizations for praise or criticism.  Structure of this document  In Section 2 we show the uptake of cloud computing, by listing several public sources. In Section 3 we  explain the CIIP perspective on cloud computing and in Section 4 we go over a number of specific  scenarios, based on public sources about cloud computing usage and passed incidents. In the  conclusions we make some key recommendations for mitigating the impact of large failures with  critical cloud computing services.  3  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  2 Uptake of Cloud Computing  Public and private sector organisations are switching to cloud computing: While years ago software  applications were running on servers on their own premises or dedicated data centres, now  applications are outsourced to large cloud service providers and run in very large data centres.  Cloud computing is being adopted rapidly across society, and across different sectors of society. Many  analysts predict a further growth (of around 30% a year). We give some examples:   IDC November 2011: The total cloud services market in Western Europe alone will grow from  3.3 billion euros in 2010 to 15 billion by 2015, which translates to a 35% growth rate. IDC  estimates that by 2014 most organizations will turn to the cloud first to implement new  functionality needed.   Gartner 2012: Almost 33% of the organisations polled are either already using or planning to  use cloud based SaaS offerings to augment their Business Intelligence functions.   AT&T 2011: According to London-based business continuity survey, almost 37% of companies  are considering using cloud technology to help them deal with disruptive events to ensure  business continuity.   Forrester 2012: 18% of high-tech industries have already adopted IaaS solutions and as many  as 25% plan to adopt them in the near future. In the more regulated sectors like government,  financial and health, the uptake is less. For example, in the government sector about 10% has  already adopted use of IaaS services, while about 5% plan to use IaaS in the near future.  Similar figures are reported for the healthcare and financial services sector.  The public data tells only part of the story -  from public data it is difficult to understand how many  end-users or organizations depend on a cloud computing provider, because cloud computing providers  often offer services to other organisations, which in turn provide services to the (sometimes millions  of) customers. For example, a SaaS cloud computing provider who uses the cloud (an IaaS cloud  computing provider) for computing and storage resources. This kind of reselling of IT resources makes  it hard to estimate how many end-users depend on a single cloud provider and this makes it hard to  estimate the full impact of an outage in society. We give some examples:   Amazon 2011: Amazon AWS infrastructure is reported to carry as much as 1% of the all  internet consumer traffic in North America and on an average a third of all internet users visit  an AWS powered site daily3. Amazon reports having customers like Zynga, Animoto, Reddit,  MySpace, Netflix, Dropbox, airbnb, Ericssons, European Space Agency, HootSuite, IBM,  Mahindra Satyam, Newsweek, UniCredit, Spiegel.Tv, PBS, Yelp, IMDB, Linden Labs,  FourSquare, SmugSmug, Alexa, The Guardian, Farmville, Sitepoint, EventBrite.   Rackspace 2011: By the end of 2011 Rackspace reportedly served 172,510 customers,  including Transport of London, Virgin Trains, UK MoD, NHS Direct, Fiverr, Pitchfork, The  Register, the Royal Navy, and TweetPhoto.  3 http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/  http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.business.att.com/enterprise/Family/hosting-services/cloud/ http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/  4  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   Google 2011: Google reports that Google Apps customers include US General Services  Adminstration, Essilor, Ispen, BBVA Spain, Capgemini, SNL Financials, Salesforce.com, Essence,  The Guradian, LSI Logic, The Telegraph, and so on.   Microsoft: Microsoft Dynamics CRM is reported to generate about $500 million from its on- premise and cloud offerings4. Its set of customers includes Aer Lingus, Dow Chemicals, Hyatt  Hotels, Univ. of Georgia, Los Angeles Community College District etc.  Other companies use cloud computing services as part of private arrangements (private cloud) and  these arrangements are not public.   92% of IT decision makers at large companies have indicated that they will “definitely or  probably” expand their datacentre footprint in 20125.   Global investment in data centre facilities will grow in excess of 16% to top 30 billion euros in  20126.  The datacentres used for cloud computing are very large. We give some examples of public cloud  providers:   It is estimated that the Amazon EC2 is powered by half a million blade servers, over 50,000 of  which are hosted in the Dublin datacenter7.   The new Facebook server farm in the US state of Oregon measures 14000 square meters and  cost around 200 million US dollars to build8.  There are a number of other critical sectors where cloud computing is being adopted. Below we give  examples from the finance sector, the transport sector and the energy sector:   In 2011 Banco Bilbao started using cloud for email and calendar applications. The bank has  100.000 employees across the globe9.   In 2011 NYSE Euronext announced the creation of Capital Markets Community Platform, a  community cloud for traders, offering on-demand computing resources.   In 2012 the NASDAQ OMX Group announced the launch of FinQloud, a new cloud computing  platform powered by Amazon Web Services and designed for the financial services industry.   ITA, the air transport IT specialist launched the ATI Cloud, a form of community cloud, for the  airline industry to provide a wide range of on-demand business and IT resources that are  tailored specifically for the industry. SITA’s network connects over 17,000 sites globally and  4 http://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-strategy-coming-into-focus-2012-03-12  5 https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/03/12/cloud-growth-spurs-demand-for-data-centers/  6 Data Center Dynamics Growth, www.datacenterdynamics.com/research/market-growth-2011-2012  7  https://huanliu.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/amazon-data-center-size/  8 http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/16838342  9http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_goog le_apps.html  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-strategy-coming-into-focus-2012-03-12 https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/03/12/cloud-growth-spurs-demand-for-data-centers/ http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/research/market-growth-2011-2012 https://huanliu.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/amazon-data-center-size/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/16838342 http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html  5  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  links with 90% of the world’s airlines.

IDC Energy Insights projects that global oil and gas industry investment in public  cloud will rise to more than USD 2 billion in 201413.  Key Points  The data describing the uptake of cloud computing shows two aspects to take into account:   Cloud computing usage is growing and in the near future the vast majority of organizations will  rely on some form of cloud computing services. This makes cloud computing services critical in  themselves – simply because so many organizations and users now use cloud computing on a  day to day basis.   Cloud computing is being adopted also in critical sectors, like finance, energy, transport and  even governmental services.  10 http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=217569  11  “Six questions every executive in the energy industry should ask about cloud computing”  http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture_Energy_Cloud_Computing_POV.pdf  12 http://www.rickscloud.com/cloud-benefits-in-the-energy-and-utility-industry/  13 Oil and Gas: Into the Cloud?, Jill Feblowitz,  http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2011/05/11Management.pdf  http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=217569 http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture_Energy_Cloud_Computing_POV.pdf http://www.rickscloud.com/cloud-benefits-in-the-energy-and-utility-industry/ http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2011/05/11Management.pdf  6  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  3 CIIP Perspective of Cloud Computing  In this document we take a CIIP perspective on the uptake of cloud computing, and we identify the  main risks for critical cloud computing services.  3.1 Concentration of ICT resources  Adoption of cloud computing implies a concentration of IT resources in very large datacentres. This is  depicted in diagram below (Figure 1), where the squares are (connected) organizations or operators,  and the blue areas indicate IT resources. In information security, the concentration of IT resources is a  ‘double edged sword’: On the one hand, large cloud providers can deploy state of the art security and  business continuity measures and spread the associated costs across the customers. On the other  hand, if an outage or a security breach occurs then the consequences could be big, affecting many  citizens, many organizations, at once. To illustrate this paradox, we look at three past incidents:   Resilience: The Japanese earthquake of 2011 showed how resilient cloud computing can be in  the face of disaster and in the aftermath. Cloud services survived power outages by using  emergency fuel and data connections over mobile networks and fixed networks held up.  Traditional IT deployments in the disaster area on the other hand went offline. In the  aftermath of the disaster, cloud service providers provided support for emergency services,  and in the recovery phase cloud computing was used by organisation to quickly get services up  and running.   Single point of failure  o Lightning struck in the Dublin region in summer 2011 affecting the cloud services of  some major cloud providers. The outage lasted 2 days and affected many of their  customers.  o In summer 2011 a software flaw in a SaaS cloud service product for backups and  document storage allowed each user to see documents of millions of other users, for  up to 8 hours.  The concentration of IT resources makes cloud computing services critical and relevant to look at from  a CIIP perspective.  IT  IT  IT  IT  IT  IT  IT  Figure 1. Transition to Cloud Computing from a national perspective  7  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  3.2 Cloud and CIIP  Critical information infrastructures (CII) are the ICT systems which are vital for the economy or the  society of a country (or a group of countries). There are many definitions of CII in the literature. The  European Commission has defined Critical Information Infrastructures as all ICT systems which are  either, a) critical infrastructure themselves, or b) essential for the operation of other critical  infrastructures. From a CIIP perspective cloud computing service can be critical in two ways:  1. Cloud computing services can be critical in themselves.  2. Cloud computing services can be critical for other critical services  It is not always clear how to distinguish between the two categories. Consider for example an eHealth  record platform implemented using cloud computing (users and doctors log in to upload health record  data about symptoms and treatment). Obviously the eHealth record platform is critical, but it is not  clear if it falls in category 1 (the eHealth record platform is critical in itself) or in category 2 (the  eHealth record platform is not critical in itself, but needed for emergency health care, which is critical).  We refrain from distinguishing between these two cases, and call the cloud computing services in both  cases ‘critical’.  The CIIP action plan addresses two kinds of large-scale security incidents:   cyber disruptions (or outage) with a large impact,   cyber attacks with a large impact We take the same perspective in this document. We go over  the two types of incidents14.  3.2.1 Cyber disruptions  A cyber disruption in this context means (temporary or permanent) loss of service, with impact on  users of the cloud service who rely on its continuity. A good example is when critical services, such as  emergency care, depend on these cloud services. When looking at these dependencies it is important  to distinguish between the different levels of continuity required. Some cloud services can be offline  for a day without causing significant impact in society. For other cloud services a couple of hours of  downtime is already disastrous. We illustrate continuity dependencies in Figure 2, where we show how  different critical assets (like banking/trading), with different continuity requirements (90%, 99%, or  99,9%), may depend on continuity of power, network and cloud services or datacentres.  For example, consider a power outage in a data centre of a telecommunications provider. This could  cause the outage of a telephony network, which could in turn affect the continuity (or availability) of  emergency call centres. The continuity requirements for emergency call centres are high and therefore  also the continuity requirements for the telephony service and the datacentre of the provider are high.  14 There is some overlap between the two types: Cyber attacks can cause cyber disruptions (for example in DDoS attacks the  goal is to create an outage).  8  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Online services,  cloud computing  Public datacenters  Private D2D links  Private datacenters Public ecomms  Telco sites, switch  areas,  interconnections  Regional network  infra, cables, wires  (10000s km2)  Public transport  Emergency calls  eGovernment  Emergency care  (police/firefighters/  ambulances)  Banks/trading  Regional power  supply  Powerplants Regional power grid  (10000s km2)  Red – 99.9% – 8h outages are disastrous Light red – 99%  – 3 day outages are disastrous White – 90%  – 30 day outages are disastrous  Public  administration  Figure 2 Dependencies on the continuity of services and the integrity of infrastructure  Public sources on cloud computing outages show that the number of users affected per outage is  increasing. Recent outages already affect in the order of millions of end-users.   Gartner analysed the highly publicised services outages during the last 10 years, and came to  the conclusion that the number of cloud service outages (48 cases) outnumbered the more  traditional datacentre outages (29 cases), and that 47% of all documented large outages were  caused by cloud services outages15, with a visible acceleration in the past two years (12 cases  in 2010 and 10 in 2011). The duration of cloud outages ranged between 40 minutes and five  days with an average of 17 hours.   Ponemon Institute studied the financial impact of downtime at datacentres by looking at 41  independent datacentres in the United States16 and found that outages on average cost  500,000 US$ (ranging from 40,000 US$ up to a 1 million US$) and that costs are proportional  15 Gartner, \"The Realities of Cloud Services Downtime: What You Must Know and Do\", 20 October 2011  16http://blog.newvem.com/main/2011/08/availability-story-of-the-inevitable-outage-of-the-cloud.html  http://blog.newvem.com/main/2011/08/availability-story-of-the-inevitable-outage-of-the-cloud.html  9  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  to the duration of the outage, and the size of the datacentre. On an average a data centre  downtime cost about US$5,600 per minute.  This should not come as a surprise. Consolidation (of services and infrastructure) means that the  impact of a failure is also bigger. It is difficult to tell if the overall impact of outages and breaches is  decreasing (or increasing) because of the adoption of cloud computing. Note also that while there is  some data and press coverage about larger outages (affecting many end-users), but there is hardly any  data about smaller incidents (regarding data breaches and outages). This makes it difficult to compare  the impact of (presumably many, but smaller) incidents in legacy systems with the impact of outages  concerning cloud services. Cyber attacks  In some settings it is also important to take into account logical dependencies between critical  services, for example via software or secret information like passwords.  For example, consider an attacker who manages to alter software or access secret data at an IT vendor  which delivers information technology to a range of organisations. The attack could have  consequences across a range of organisations which use the software of this vendor. Recent examples  include:   the attack on RSA Secure ID, which had an impact on a range of (otherwise unrelated or  disconnected) organisations using the RSA tokens.   the attack on Diginotar which had an impact in Iran and across the Dutch e-government.   the attack on Google, Adobe, Juniper, et cetera, called Aurora, which saw cyber attackers  target source code repositories  We illustrate this type of dependency in Figure 3 where we take as an example an IT vendor who  delivers office software to a range of organisations (banks, hospitals, power plants, and public office)  who install the software locally on user machines. The security of these organisations depends on the  security of the IT vendor and in particular the security of the service delivery processes (software  development e.g.). An internet outage at the IT vendor would not have a direct impact, a cyber attack  at the IT vendor, for example tampering of the source code by an attacker, could have a large impact.

Logical dependencies on an software vendor  10  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  3.3 Relevant threats  From a CIIP perspective the relevant threats are different than the threats to consider from an SME  perspective. Take for example one of the high risks in ENISA’s 2009 cloud computing risk assessment  for SMEs: vendor lockin. Vendor lockin is a high risk for an SME, and the associated costs (switching  costs, or high bills) can be high. At the same time, a vendor lockin does not have a direct impact on the  health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens. Similarly, although subpoena or e-discovery  may be a relevant risk to take into account from an SME perspective, it is not relevant from a CIIP  perspective, because access of law enforcement to certain data stored at the cloud computing  provider does not have a direct impact on the economy or the society.  Based on the survey of past outages, we select the key threats which can have a large- scale impact:  For cyber disruption the most relevant threats are:  - Natural disaster, power outage, or hardware failure  - Resource exhaustion (due to an overload or a DDoS attack)  - Cyber attack (due to a software flaw)  - Administrative or legal issues  For cyber attacks the most relevant threats are:  - Resource exhaustion (due to a DDoS attack)  - Cyber attack (due to a software flaw)  In the next section we will look at several scenarios involving critical sectors, and we focus on these  threats.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  11  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  4 Cloud computing scenarios  We look at two types of large-scale security incidents: large disruptions (or outages) and cyber attacks,  by discussing 4 different scenarios where cloud services are critical – in each scenario we look at  different threats:   Financial services   Health services   eGovernment services   Cloud services  These scenarios are based on public data about usage of cloud computing services and past incidents.  We look at 4 different key threats to cloud computing services:  - Natural disaster, power outage, or hardware failure  - Resource exhaustion (due to an overload or a DDoS attack)  - Cyber attack (due to a software flaw)  - Administrative or legal issues  Note that we discuss a number of large security incidents (breaches and outages) related to cloud  computing, to give an overview of relevant threats. We do not intend to make a comparison with  security incidents in traditional IT deployments – and we do not want to suggest that cloud computing  is more vulnerable than traditional IT.  For the sake of illustration we provide several examples, referring to public sources about cloud  services, cloud customers, security incidents, and so on. By no means is it our intention to single out  individual organizations for praise or criticism.  4.1 Financial services  We look at the scenario of a large financial services company using cloud computing. In the financial  services sector a range of services are now being implemented using cloud computing.   In 2011 Banco Bilbao started using cloud for email and calendar applications. The bank has  100.000 employees across the globe17.   In 2011 NYSE Euronext announced the creation of Capital Markets Community Platform, a  community cloud for traders, offering on-demand computing resources.   In 2012 the NASDAQ OMX Group announced the launch of FinQloud, a new cloud computing  platform powered by Amazon Web Servicses and exclusively designed for the financial services  industry.  Assume a trading platform, implemented using cloud computing technology. The set-up is as depicted  in Figure 4.   Full duplication of systems across multiple data centres.   Private network links between datacentres are duplicated.  17http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_goo gle_apps.html  http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html  12  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   Inside datacentres, all systems are duplicated, planning for minimal downtime.   The platform has a public (web-facing) interface for traders.  Trading platform (SaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  Operator  Trader Trader  Private network, D2D links:  Public internet, telephony:  Figure 4. Trading platform implemented using cloud computing  4.1.1 Cyber attack  Suppose a cyber-attack was waged against the trading platform. Trading systems are generally  considered part of a nation’s critical information infrastructure.   An attack of this kind took place at NASDAQ in 2010. In that case the attack did not impact  trading. The attack was discovered only months later. NASDAQ sustains there was no direct  impact on trading or assets.  Let’s assume the computers of operators were infected with malicious software, which in turn exploits  flaws in the trading platform, providing the attackers access to privileged financial data. The attackers  obtain access to the control functions of the financial transaction system and they are able to tamper  with trades causing large financial losses. A fault tree for this scenario would be as follows.  Outage  datacentre 1  Regional power  cut  Trading  platform  unavailable  Outage  datacentre 2  Outage  datacentre 3  &  Datacentre  hardware  failure  Software flaw Cyber attack  &  Regional  eComms  outage  Trading  platform  unavailable to  some  Local natural  disaster  Trading fraud  and data  breaches  Figure 5. Impact of a cyber attack on a trading platform  http://arstechnica.com/security/2011/02/fbi-justice-deparment-investigating-nasdaq-hacking-attempts/  13  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Outages of the public network would prevent traders from reaching the trading platform, but regional  outages only have only a limited impact, on some of the traders. All the faults affecting single  datacentres are mitigated by the redundancy across the datacentres. This mitigates the impact of, for  example, regional power cuts. Physical redundancy, however, does not help to prevent a cyber attack  which exploits a flaw in the software of the trading platform.  4.1.2 Other cyber-attacks affecting cloud computing services  There are other examples of cyber attacks on cloud computing services with a large-scale impact:   In 2012 Credit card processor Global Payments said there had been a security breach that  exposed 1.5 million consumers to (credit card) fraud. The incident is costing Global Payments  an estimate $84.4 million dollars.   In 2012 LinkedIn was breached and 6.5 million unsalted SHA-1 hashed passwords were found  on underground forums. Linkedin has 160 million members worldwide.   In 2012 Zapos fell victim to a cyber attack which breached data of about 24 million customers,  including customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, the last four  digits of the customer card numbers and encrypted passwords.   Epsilon was hacked in early December 2011, and leaked data included information relating to  the customers of at least 50 companies, including Best Buy, Citi, Hilton, LL Bean, Marriott,  Target, TiVo, and Walgreens.  Key points  The set-up of the trading platform is focussed on physical redundancy. The main goal is to prevent  outages due to high loads or power cuts or incidents affecting individual datacentres. In such a setup  the overall risk of disruptions decreases. At the same time cyber-attacks which exploit software flaws  can cause very large data breaches, affecting millions of users directly.   Security is crucial for critical cloud computing services – one flaw can impact a wide range of  organizations directly. From a logical perspective the cloud computing service is a single point  of failure.   Cloud service providers have the scale and resources to address and prevent cyber attacks in a  more professional way than most other organizations. It is important to prevent and mitigate  the impact of cyber attacks by creating also logical redundancy – that is, to use different layers  of defence and to use separate systems with a different logical structure, to cross-check  transactions and to detect attacks.  14  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  4.2 Health services  A number of hospitals are now adopting cloud computing. Information technology and cloud  computing in particular are expected to bring important efficiency gains. We give some examples:   By 2011, about 30% of the healthcare organizations had developed a strategic plan for  adopting cloud computing services18. It is expected that by 2016 about 30% of IT budget of  healthcare organizations would be devoted for cloud computing based expenses. 73% plan to  make greater use of cloud-based technologies in the future19.   In 2010, a leading Italian children’s hospital switched to an online solution for email services  for its 2500 employees20. Another Italian hospital USL of Asolo in Veneto is reported to be  using cloud computing to help operative tasks21.   The Swedish Red Cross adopted a cloud computing solution to help them reduce their costs by  about 20% and enhanced communication in real time between its employees21.   A Russian cardiovascular centre, Penza, adopted a cloud computing solution to coordinate  activities, diagnosis and decisions on treatment and surgery between doctors around the  country, with crucial gains for the patients22.  Consider a scenario where the data centre is set up with:   Redundant power and cooling - two independent power grid feeds are taken into an  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system that powers ICT and cooling systems   UPS has dual feeds to all equipment within the data centre.   Diesel generators rated to carry the entire data centre load.  In the event of grid loss, the UPS maintains electrical load until the generator has started and spun up  to load, and the generator is fuelled with enough diesel to maintain supply for a day. Such facilities will  contract with a fuel supplier to start tanker refuelling of the generator immediately upon loss of mains  power (with the understanding that the logistics of supply are such that it could take up to 24 hours to  replenish the local fuel tank).  We assume that the datacentre is one of several other datacentres providing the cloud service to  users, as depicted in the diagram below:  18 From Tactic to Strategy: The CDW 2011 Cloud Computing Tracking Poll, 2011  http://webobjects.cdw.com/webobjects/media/pdf/Newsroom/CDW-Cloud-Tracking-Poll-Report-0511.pdf  19 Six questions every health industry executive should ask about cloud computing, Accenture, 2010  20 “Economics of Cloud Computing” http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/Report.pdf  21 “Understanding Cloud Computing Competition, Environment and Finance”  http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/EBR.pdf  22 Understanding Cloud Computing Competition, Environment and Finance, European Business Review, 2011  http://webobjects.cdw.com/webobjects/media/pdf/Newsroom/CDW-Cloud-Tracking-Poll-Report-0511.pdf http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/Report.pdf http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/EBR.pdf  15  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  e-Health record platform (SaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  Hospital Hospital  Figure 6. e-Health record platform using cloud computing  4.2.1 Natural disaster  Consider a severe weather event which impacts the regional power supply and the data centre. For  example, high volumes of precipitation during summer storms in the UK, have caused flash flooding in  areas not normally deemed to be high-risk flood risk areas. Data centres are often located in rural  areas, outside of conurbations, and as such are highly dependent on the surrounding infrastructure  (power, communications, drainage and transportation) in order to maintain services.  Most datacentres are equipped with redundant power grid connections and backup generators to  mitigate the impact of extreme weather and power cuts. When a power cuts persists, of course,  resupply of generator fuel becomes an issue. In Japan, following the earthquake, in fact there are now  discussions to prioritize fuel for datacenters23.   (2 hours, millions of users) In June 2012 a severe thunder storm affected an Amazon EC2  datacenter. The outage caused problems for some major websites with millions of users, like  Instagram, Netflix and Pinterest.   (48 hours, large segment of multiple clouds) In August 2011, a lightning strike in Dublin  caused Microsoft BPOS, the Amazon EC2, and its Relational Database Service (RDS) to be out  for several hours24. It took over 48 hours for full functionality to be restored on the AWS  service.  23 https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/03/15/japan-may-prioritize-power-for-data-centers/  24 http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/07/lightning-in-dublin-knocks-amazon-microsoft- data-centers-offline/  https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/03/15/japan-may-prioritize-power-for-data-centers/ http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/07/lightning-in-dublin-knocks-amazon-microsoft-data-centers-offline/ http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/07/lightning-in-dublin-knocks-amazon-microsoft-data-centers-offline/  16  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Outage  datacentre 1  Regional power  cut  Cloud service  unavailable  Outage  datacentre 2  Outage  datacentre 3  &  Datacentre  hardware  failure  Software flaw Cyber attack  &  Local natural  disaster  Figure 7. Impact of natural disaster  Let’s assume bad weather (heavy rain) causes a regional power cut and that the fuel supply fails to  arrive at the datacentre, due to the flooding, and that the datacentre eventually goes offline. In a  redundant cloud computing setup an outage at a single datacentre has limited impact on the  continuity of services. In this case the availability of e-health records, for example, would be  guaranteed, because the other datacentres can take over the load.  Key points  A key benefit of cloud computing is resilience to withstand regional power cuts or local natural  disasters. It is difficult to mitigate the impact of fairly common events like floods, storms, or  earthquakes in a set up with only a single datacentre.   Cloud computing services can be more resilient, and the risk of disruptions due to natural  disasters decreases.  4.3 eGovernment services  A number of public sector organisations are now using IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services, to implement  internal IT and to implement e-government services, in a more efficient way .   The UK G-Cloud \"framework\", worth up to £60 million will operate for an initial six-month  period, after which successful applicants will be able to sell a range of tools the government  expects will include email, word processing, hosting, ERP, records management, CRM and  other office productivity software25.  25http://www.itnews.com.au/News/282746,sme-suppliers-rush-on-uks-g-cloud.aspx  http://www.itnews.com.au/News/282746,sme-suppliers-rush-on-uks-g-cloud.aspx  17  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   The UK Gov Cloud app store “GovStore”26 has over 1,700 information and communications  services available to the UK public sector, and contains details of each of the suppliers and  their services.   In 2011, the Catalan Government, the largest user of cloud computing public services in Spain,  had over 741,000 business users and organisations (such as Ferrovial, MRW, Government of  Aragon, and Madrid City Council) take advantage of the technology27.  We assume that the datacentre is part of a number of datacentres supporting the provisioning of a  SaaS cloud platform, specifically for government organizations. In this way several government  organizations can set-up (in a scalable, and quick fashion) e-government services to serve the citizens.  The set-up is depicted in Figure 8. The datacentres have the scale to deal with peak loads on either of  the websites.  Gov cloud app store (PaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  eGovernment  website (SaaS)  eGovernment  website (SaaS)  Figure 8. A gov-cloud appstore used for eGovernment web services  4.3.1 Overload  Consider the situation of a big disaster and a rush for information on one of the (e-Government)  websites for public disaster information. For example, in 2012, following a large explosion, a local  Dutch radio station referred citizens to an emergency webpage, for emergency information. The  website went offline immediately due to an overload of visitors.  The elasticity of cloud computing prevents an outage because the service runs on some very large  datacentres with vast computing power. Large peak loads of the e-Government websites have been  taken into account.  26 http://www.govstore.net/  27http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote- %E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe  http://www.govstore.net/ http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe  18  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Key points  Cloud computing makes it easier to mitigate a surge in traffic, due to a particular event or a deliberate  (DDoS) attack, and in this way prevent an outage. It would be prohibitively expensive to implement a  datacentre with the required scale to handle such peak loads.  4.4 Software as a cloud service  A number of cloud service providers, who offer so-called Software as a Service (SaaS) to customers,  rely on other cloud service providers to provide more basic IT resources, such as operating systems  and application servers (called IaaS or SaaS providers).   Amazon 2011: Amazon infrastructure is reported to carry as much as 1% of the all internet  consumer traffic in North America and on an average a third of all internet users visit an AWS  powered site daily28. Amazon reports having customers like Zynga, Reddit, MySpace, Netflix,  Dropbox, HootSuite, et cetera.  Consider the following setup where two different IT vendors rely on the same underlying IaaS/PaaS  provider for basic IT resources.  Infrastructure or platform as a service (PaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  Webmail  provider (SaaS)  Online backup  service (SaaS)  Figure 9. e-Government applications (SaaS) running on a governmental app store (PaaS)  4.4.1 System failure  Let’s assume the IaaS/PaaS provider suffers an outage due to a system failure, say a software flaw.  There are numerous examples of cases where flaws and failures affect the services of IaaS/PaaS  providers:    (24 hours, multiple regions) Microsoft Azure was offline from 28th February 2012 due to a  leap year problem. The outage affected the compute service in a number of regions29. Service  28 http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/  29 https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/windows-azure-service-disruption-update.aspx  http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/ https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/windows-azure-service-disruption-update.aspx  19  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  to majority of customers was restored in around 9 hours, while full service restoration took  another 24 hours30. The affected customer base included the UK G-Gov CloudStore31.   (48 hours, large segment of users) In April 2011 Amazon's EC2 cloud suffered multiday  outages resulting in loss of availability and loss of data. This took down the data of several high  profiles sites including Reddit (over 36 hours32), Foursquares, Hootsuite and Quora (48  hours33).    (10 hours, service-wide) VMWare Cloud Foundry suffered two outages in April 2011 due to  power outage (10 hours) and subsequent misconfiguration (90 minutes)34.    (3 hours, service-wide) Microsoft BPOS suffered various outages in May 2011 due to three  different issues, creating lengthy email backlogs that created delays of upto 3 hours35.  The impact of failure at an IaaS/PaaS provider can have an impact across a range of organizations,  affecting many end-users. It can also have strange side-effects. Take for example an organization  which relies on the webmail provider for emails and on the online backup provider for backups, to  mitigate outages or data loss at the webmail provider. In case of a software flaw the organization  would still risk its vital data because both services rely on the same underlying IaaS/PaaS provider.  4.4.2 Other system failures causing large outages or data loss  System failures causing outages are not rare. Below we list a number of examples of incidents in which  a system failure caused a large-scale outage or data loss.   (24 hours, 7,500 users) In March 2009 7,500 Carbonite customers lost their backups.  Eventually after over 24 hour, all except 54 of these customers were able to retrieve their  backups36.   (Two months, 1 million users) In October 2009 T-Mobile’s Sidekick 1 million users lost their  contacts, calendar entries, to-do lists and photos when Microsoft subsidiary Danger suffered a  server failure37.  30 https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/window-azure-service-disruption- resolved.aspx  31 http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/feb/29/cloudstore-gcloud-microsoft- azure-outage  32 http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gva4t/on_reddits_outage/  33 http://www.quora.com/Why-is-some-data-missing-from-Quora-after-the-April-2011-outage  34 http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/050211-vmware-foundry-outage.html  35https://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2011/05/13/update-on-bpos-standard-email-issues.aspx  36 http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and- sues-suppliers/  37 http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont- have-a-backup/  https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/window-azure-service-disruption-resolved.aspx https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/window-azure-service-disruption-resolved.aspx http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/feb/29/cloudstore-gcloud-microsoft-azure-outage http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/feb/29/cloudstore-gcloud-microsoft-azure-outage http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gva4t/on_reddits_outage/ http://www.quora.com/Why-is-some-data-missing-from-Quora-after-the-April-2011-outage http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/050211-vmware-foundry-outage.html https://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2011/05/13/update-on-bpos-standard-email-issues.aspx http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and-sues-suppliers/ http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and-sues-suppliers/ http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont-have-a-backup/ http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont-have-a-backup/  20  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   (Permanent data loss, over 6300 users) Between 1-4th July 2010, Evernote experienced  several hardware failures leading to loss of data of over 6,32338 Evernote customers.   (48 hours, service-wide) In December 2010 17,355 Microsoft Hotmail accounts lost all emails  for two days before it was restored by the provider39.   (Four days, 35,000 users) In February 2011 over 35,000 Gmail accounts and Google Apps  customers lost all the data in the accounts. Google had to resort to restoring backups from  tapes, in an operation lasting four days40.   (Several hours, service-wide) On 6,11 and 15 August 2008, Google’s enterprise e-mail system,  Apps Premier Edition,  suffered an outage and disrupted some organizations and users that  rely on the service41. One of the outages affected nearly all users for approximately two hours;  while the other two affected part of the user base for about 24 hours.   (30 minutes, service-wide) In September 2011, Google Docs, Google Docs List and Google  went offline for a period of around 30 minutes, affecting all its users42.   (72 hours, as big as 70m users) Millions of Blackberry users across Europe, Middle East and  Africa suffered outage for three days in October 2011.  The company has about 70m users  around the world. Speculation is that most of the global customer base may have been  affected at some point during the 72 hours43.   (Seven hours, 3.8 percent of customer base) In February 2012 Microsoft Azure platform  suffers outage that lasted more than seven hours, affecting 3.8% of the customer base44.  Key points  It is quite common for (SaaS) cloud computing providers to rely on other (IaaS/PaaS) cloud computing  providers. These relations create more dependencies between organizations and between cloud  computing service providers. Outages or other incidents at a single service provider could have an  impact on a range of organizations, including other cloud service providers and customers.   Cloud computing services are not immune to system failures – overall the risk of system  failures may be reduced when compared to traditional IT deployments, but if a system failure  occurs then there may be a large impact (and a lot of media attention).   Particularly for IaaS and PaaS providers it is crucial to mitigate outages and system failures  because so many other cloud service providers or other organizations depend on them.  38 http://blog.evernote.com/2010/08/09/july1/  39 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/04/microsoft_apologizes_empty_hotmail/  40 http://blogs.computerworld.com/17897/google_apps_and_gmail_outage_outrage_problem_resolved  41  https://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=seo&id=750739  42  http://www.informationweek.com/news/cloud-computing/software/231600978  43http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/blackberry-outage-2011-rim-says-services- returning_n_1008596.html  44 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/29/windows_azure_outage/  http://blog.evernote.com/2010/08/09/july1/ http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/04/microsoft_apologizes_empty_hotmail/ http://blogs.computerworld.com/17897/google_apps_and_gmail_outage_outrage_problem_resolved https://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=seo&id=750739 http://www.informationweek.com/news/cloud-computing/software/231600978 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/blackberry-outage-2011-rim-says-services-returning_n_1008596.html http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/blackberry-outage-2011-rim-says-services-returning_n_1008596.html http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/29/windows_azure_outage/  21  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  4.5 Administrative or legal disputes  Another type of outage which is worth mentioning are outages caused by administrative or legal  disputes. We give a number of examples:   (Permanent data loss, service-wide) The Megaupload cloud storage service was taken down  by the US prosecutors alleging copyright infringement. At the time of closure it had  180,000,000 registered users hosting over 25 petabyte (25000 terabyte) of storage45. It was  the 13th most visited site on the Internet.   (Permanent shutdown, 20,000 users) In August 2008, The Linkup, a service offering online  data storage lost access to unspecified amount of customer data and soon after on 8th August  shutdown the service, effecting over 20,000 paying customers46.   (Permanent shutdown, unknown number of users47) In February 2009, Onsite3, a leading  global provider of electronic evidence solutions for law firms and corporations filed for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy and that it is being bought over by Integreon, a provider of outsourced  knowledge, legal, and administrative support services48.  We do not go into details about this kind of threat much further, because technically this threat is not  specific for cloud computing, but could affect any kind of ICT service provider. At the same time we  would like to stress that the criticality of certain cloud computing services raises the issue of such  administrative or legal disputes. If a very large cloud computing service provider stops services over a  legal dispute then a large number of customers is affected, and the impact on the economy and on  society can be significant.  Key points  Administrative and legal issues concerning a cloud computing provider are amplified by the sheer size  of cloud computing services.   Cloud computing services are not immune to administrative or legal issues. If there is a legal  dispute involving the provider or one of its customers, then this could have an impact on the  data of all the other co- customers (or co-tenants).  45  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload  46  https://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/081108-linkup-failure.html  47 Indicative customer base number not available  48 http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/02/daily105.html?page=all  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload https://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/081108-linkup-failure.html http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/02/daily105.html?page=all  22  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  5 Conclusions & Recommendations  In this paper we have looked at cloud computing from a CIIP perspective. We gave an overview of  public sources on cloud computing uptake and we look at different cloud computing scenarios large  cyber attacks and large cyber disruptions.  Conclusions  We summarize our conclusions:   Cloud computing is critical: Cloud computing usage is growing and in the near future the vast  majority of organizations will rely on some form of cloud computing services. This makes cloud  computing services critical in themselves. Cloud computing is being adopted also in critical  sectors, like finance, energy and transport.   Cloud computing and natural disasters: A key benefit of cloud computing is resilience in the  face of regional power cuts or local natural disasters. It is difficult to mitigate the impact of  fairly common regional disasters like floods, storms, or earthquakes in a set up with only a  single datacentre, or a traditional set-up with a legacy onsite IT deployment.   Cloud computing and overloads or DDoS attacks: Elasticity is a key benefit of cloud computing  and this elasticity helps to cope with load and mitigates the risk of overload or DDoS attacks. It  is difficult to mitigate the impact of peak usage or a DDoS attack with limited computing  resources.   Cyber attacks: Cyber attacks which exploit software flaws can cause very large data breaches,  affecting millions of users directly. The impact of cyber attacks is multiplied by the  concentration of resources which is a result of the uptake in cloud computing.   IaaS and Paas the most critical: The most critical services are large IaaS and PaaS services  which deliver services to other IT vendors who service in turn millions of users and  organisations.   Administrative and legal disputes: Cloud computing is not immune to administrative or legal  issues. If there is a legal dispute involving the provider or one of its customers, than this could  have an impact on the data of all the other co- customers (or co-tenants).  Recommendations  The CIIP action plan calls for a discussion on a governance strategy for cloud computing. Below we  make several recommendations for policy makers and national CIO’s that should be taken into account  when setting such a strategy. From a CIIP perspective the goal would be to prevent large security  incidents. Governance of security, across a region, a sector, or group of providers, can be subdivided in  three key processes (see figure 10):  1. RA: Making a risk assessment – to determine which are critical infrastructures, what is their  value for economy and society, and what kind of incidents need to be prevented.  2. SM: Taking security measures (or make sure they are taken) – to prevent large incidents or to  mitigate their impact.  3. IR: Collecting incident reports – to understand weaknesses in security measures and to  evaluate and validate the risk assessment.  This triangle of governance processes can be supervised by a government authority (a regulator, say)  or some industry association (a body of auditors, say), or in combination. We make several  recommendations for each of these processes.  23  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Risk assessment  Security Measures Incident reporting  RA  SM IR  Figure 10. Key security governance processes  5.1.1 Risk assessment  Risk assessment is at the start of governance. The main goal of risks assessment is to prioritize security  measures. We make several recommendations related to risk assessment.   Assets in scope: It is important to take a pragmatic approach and address the most critical  cloud computing services first. It is easy to say that ‘all cloud computing services are  critical’ but it is infeasible to address all cloud computing services at once. As mentioned,  since outages at IaaS or PaaS providers can have an impact across a range of organizations,  this means that these services should be treated with priority. Often in cloud computing a  range of SaaS services depend on a IaaS/PaaS services and network connections and  power supply. The IaaS/PaaS service depends on network connection and power supply.  This suggests that the criticality of power supply and network connections is higher than  the criticality of the IaaS/PaaS provider, and that the criticality of the IaaS/PaaS provider is  higher than the SaaS provider.   Assessing dependencies on cloud computing: Most countries, when making national risk  assessments, from a critical infrastructure perspective, take into account already power  supply and electronic communications networks. They should also take into account large  cloud computing services and large datacentres. Agencies responsible for establishing and  maintaining national contingency plans should take into account the dependencies of  modern society on IT.   Transparency about logical and physical dependencies: A risk assessment requires a clear  view of the dependencies. It should be clear which critical operators and critical services  depend on which cloud computing services. The special nature of cloud computing plays a  role here. It is inherent to the cloud computing model, that hardware and software is  shared between multiple tenants. This is exactly what creates a benefit when it comes to  withstanding DDoS attacks or peak loads. At the same time, this complexity in  dependencies can create strange side-effects. Outages at an underlying IaaS or PaaS  provider can affect a range of (otherwise unrelated) services across society. It is important  to map the main logical and physical dependencies.  24  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  5.1.2 Security measures  The main goal of security governance is to mitigate incidents by taking security measures.   Foster exchange of best practices to achieve a security baseline: It goes without saying  that it is important that cloud providers take appropriate security measures. There is a  host of literature on best practices, ranging from best practices on how to set-up  datacentres and networks, to how to securely engineer software and services. In this  document we refrain from making specific technical recommendations about these best  practices, so for example, we do not go into details about best practices like ‘deploying  security patches to operating systems’. We do stress that it is important for government  authorities to support and foster the exchange of such best practices. Security is  constantly changing and security measures must be improved continuously. Government  authorities should encourage an open culture of exchange and discussion about security  measures. Security is about continuous improvement and government authorities should  avoid a situation where a specific set of best practices is cast in stone (by regulation or  self-regulation).   Logical redundancy: We would like to stress one particular issue: Cloud computing  services are often set-up with several redundant datacentres to withstand outages of  single datacentres (due to power cuts or natural disasters, for example). However, most  cyber attacks capitalise and exploit software flaws, which are persist across the  datacentres. Software flaws can cause outages by themselves. Arguably, cloud service  providers have the scale and resources to address and prevent software flaws and cyber  attacks in a much more professional way than most other organizations. Still it is  important to of the concentration important to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyber  attacks by creating also logical redundancy – that is, to use different layers of defence and  to use separate systems with a different logical structure, to cross-check transactions and  to detect attacks.   Physical redundancy: Related to the previous point, most relevant threats, from a CIIP  perspective, are related to lack of logical or physical redundancy. A single point of failure  must be avoided. One effective way to do this is to make sure that the software and  hardware are standardized and not dependent on specific technology of a specific  provider. Standardization, especially for IaaS and PaaS services, would allow customers to  move workload to other providers in case one provider has an issue. If a service is  standardized and if frequent backups are made, then even an outage caused by an  administrative or legal dispute can be addressed, by simply taking the backups and  deploying them at the site of another (competing) cloud computing provider. This kind of  mutual aid is only possible when the cloud services infrastructure is standardized. From a  CIIP perspective standardization in cloud computing is very important, because it allows  customers to mitigate any (legal or administrative) issues they may have with the cloud  service provider.   Audits, tests, and exercises: There is a lot of information security literature about the  importance of auditing and testing systems. Cloud computing providers should schedule  frequent audits and tests, by internal testers and auditors, and, when relevant, by external  testers and auditors. In discussions about governance, often the need for independent  external auditors is stressed. Such audits are often organized as part of a certification  25  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  process. We would like to stress that ICT systems are constantly changing (software is  updated daily) and that this reduces the effect of periodic (yearly) audits. Moreover, the  complexity of the systems underpinning cloud computing services makes it very difficult to  assess security or resilience. Cloud computing providers and government authorities  should ensure there is a continuous program of audits, tests and exercises in place. Audits  by external parties are only one part of this program.  5.1.3 Incident reporting  Incident reporting provides the cross check on the effectiveness of security measures and it provides  input to the risk assessment.   Mandatory reporting: Without incident reports it is very difficult to understand the impact  of security incidents on cloud computing providers. This complicates risk assessment, both  for cloud computing service providers, as well as, at a national level, for government  authorities like contingency agencies. Lack of data about incidents makes it very difficult to  prioritize security measures, and in this way security governance becomes inefficient or  even ineffective. Government authorities and cloud providers should agree on the  thresholds for reporting and the type of services that should be in scope.   Legal consequences: Secondly, it is important to consider the following. Certain cyber  attacks are stealthy and their traces may be difficult to spot even for system  administrators who know the cloud computing systems inside out. There is always a risk  that security incidents are not reported to higher management or to authorities for fear of  reprisal or legal consequences. Member States should consider the possible benefits of  providing immunity for providers who reported security breaches which would otherwise  go unnoticed.   Outages and security breaches: While there are some good information sources about  data breaches49 there are no good information sources about cloud computing service  outages. Reliable information is often difficult to find. And even for some fairly high-profile  incidents it is difficult to find basic information like numbers of users affected or duration.  To be able to assess overall risks and assess the effectiveness of security measures in  place, it is crucial to have incident reports about outages and security breaches from a  wide range of cloud computing providers.  49  For instance http://datalossdb.org collects, and provides an overview of, data breaches.  http://datalossdb.org/  26  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  6 References  Related ENISA papers   The 2009 ENISA Cloud computing risk assessment assess risks and benefits for SMEs who  consider adopting cloud computing.   The 2011 ENISA report on security and resilience of Governmental clouds provides guidance  for government organisations for selecting cloud computing services.   The 2012 ENISA report on secure procurement of cloud computing services, focusses on  monitoring service levels of cloud computing services.

While some years ago  applications would be mainly run on servers on their own premises or dedicated data centres,  now  applications are outsourced to large cloud service providers and run in a few large data centres. Public  data on the uptake of cloud computing shows that in a couple of years around 80% of organisations  will be dependent on cloud computing. Large cloud providers will be serving tens of millions of end- users.  From a CIIP perspective this concentration of IT resources is a ‘double edged sword’: On the one hand,  large cloud providers can deploy state of the art security and resilience measures and spread the  associated costs across the customers. On the other hand, if an outage or a security breach occurs the  consequences could be big, affecting a lot of data, many organizations and a large number of citizens,  at once. In fact in the last year there were a number of outages affecting several very large sites with  millions of users.  The EU member states have committed to protecting critical ICT systems via the European  Commission’s CIIP action plan by preventing large cyber-attacks and cyber disruptions of critical ICT  systems. In the follow-up the European commission asks for a discussion about a governance strategy  for cloud computing services, in the context of CIIP.  In this report we look cloud computing from a CIIP perspective and we look at a number of scenarios  and threats relevant from a CIIP perspective, based on a survey of public sources on uptake of cloud  computing and large cyber attacks and disruptions of cloud computing services.  From the scenarios and the data about uptake and incidents we draw a number of conclusions.   Cloud computing is critical: Cloud computing usage is growing and in the near future the vast  majority of organizations will rely on some form of cloud computing services. This makes cloud  computing services critical in themselves. When cyber attacks and cyber disruptions happen,  millions of users are affected. Cloud computing is being adopted also in critical sectors, like  finance, energy and transport.   Cloud computing and natural disasters: A key benefit of cloud computing is resilience in the  face of regional power cuts or local natural disasters. It is difficult to mitigate the impact of  fairly common regional disasters like floods, storms, or earthquakes in a set up with only a  single datacentre, or a traditional set-up with a legacy onsite IT deployment.   Cloud computing and overloads or DDoS attacks: Elasticity is a key benefit of cloud computing  and this elasticity helps to cope with load and mitigates the risk of overload or DDoS attacks. It  is difficult to mitigate the impact of peak usage or a DDoS attack with limited computing  resources.   Cyber attacks: Cyber attacks which exploit software flaws can cause very large data breaches,  affecting millions of users directly. The impact of cyber attacks is multiplied by the  concentration of resources which is a result of the uptake in cloud computing.   Infrastructure and platform as a Service the most critical: The most critical services are large  IaaS and PaaS services which deliver services to other IT vendors who service in turn millions of  users and organisations.   Administrative and legal disputes: Cloud computing is not immune to administrative or legal  issues. If there is a legal dispute involving the provider or one of its customers, than this could  have an impact on the data of all the other co- customers (or co-tenants).  http://www.wired.com/business/2011/04/lessons-amazon-cloud-failure/ http://www.wired.com/business/2011/04/lessons-amazon-cloud-failure/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  iv  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  The CIIP action plan calls for a discussion about governance strategies for cloud computing and also in  speeches about the EU Cyber Security Strategy the issue of cyber security governance is addressed.  Below we make a number of recommendations related to the issue of national governance of critical  cloud computing services.  Governance, from a national perspective, can be split into three key processes: 1) Risk assessment, 2)  ensuring that appropriate security measures are taken, and 3) collecting incident reports.   Risk assessment: Risk assessment is the basis for security governance.  o Assets in scope: It is important to take a pragmatic approach and address the most critical  cloud computing services first. It is easy to say that ‘all cloud computing services are  critical’ but it is infeasible to address everything at once. As mentioned, since outages at  IaaS or PaaS providers can have an impact across a range of organizations, this means that  they should be treated with priority.  o Assessing dependencies on cloud computing: Most countries, when making national risk  assessments, from a critical infrastructure perspective, take into account power supply  and electronic communications networks. Public sources on uptake cloud computing  suggest that it is necessary to take into account also large cloud computing services and  large datacentres.  o Transparency about logical and physical dependencies: A risk assessment requires a clear  view of the dependencies. It should be clear which critical operators and critical services  depend on which cloud computing services. The special nature of cloud computing creates  resilience but it can also increase interdependencies and cause cascading failures. Outages  at an underlying IaaS or PaaS provider can affect a range of (otherwise unrelated) services  across society. It is important to map all the main logical and physical dependencies.   Security measures: Taking appropriate security measures is the focus of security governance.  o Foster exchange of best practices to achieve a security baseline: It goes without saying  that it is important that cloud providers take appropriate security measures. These  measures should be based on best-practices. It is important for government authorities to  support and foster the exchange of such best practices. Security is constantly changing and  security measures must be improved continuously. Government authorities should  encourage an open culture of exchange and discussion about security measures. Security  is about continuous improvement and government authorities should avoid a situation  where a specific set of best practices is cast in stone (by regulation or self-regulation).  o Logical redundancy: Cloud computing services are often set-up with several redundant  datacentres to withstand outages of single datacentres (due to power cuts or natural  disasters, for example). Many cyber attacks, however, capitalise and exploit software  flaws, which are persist across the datacentres. It is important to prevent and mitigate the  impact of cyber attacks by creating also logical redundancy – that is, to use different layers  of defence and to use separate systems with a different logical structure, to cross-check  transactions and to detect attacks.  o Standardisation: From a CIIP perspective standardization in cloud computing is very  important, because it allows customers to mitigate issues related to a specific provider or  a specific platform. Standardization, especially for IaaS and PaaS services, would allow  customers to move workload to other providers in case one provider has suffers a large  outages caused by system failures or even administrative or legal disputes.  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-12-204_en.htm?locale=en  v  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  o Monitoring, audits, tests, and exercises: There is a lot of information security literature  about the importance of auditing and testing systems. Cloud computing providers should  schedule frequent audits and tests, by internal testers and auditors, and, when relevant,  by external testers and auditors. In discussions about governance, often the need for  certification, by independent external auditors is stressed. But it is hard for an external  auditor to assess the security of a complex and continuously changing system, by  performing an audit once per year. Cloud computing providers and government  authorities should have a continuous program of monitoring, audits, tests and exercises in  place. Yearly audits by external parties are only a small part of such a program.   Incident reporting: Incident reporting provides a cross-check on the security measures, it  provides the input for an improved risk assessment, and it provides strategic feedback about  the overall governance process.  o Mandatory reporting: Without incident reports it is very difficult to understand the impact  of security incidents on cloud computing providers. This complicates risk assessment, both  for cloud computing service providers, as well as, at a national level, for government  authorities like agencies responsible for (civil) contingency planning. Lack of data about  incidents makes it very difficult to prioritize security measures, and in this way security  governance becomes inefficient or even ineffective. Government authorities and cloud  providers should agree on the thresholds for reporting and the type of services that should  be in scope.  o Legal consequences: Secondly, it is important to consider that certain cyber attacks are  stealthy and their traces may be difficult to spot even for system administrators who know  the cloud computing systems inside out. There is always a risk that security incidents are  not reported to higher management or to authorities for fear of reprisal or legal  consequences. Member states should consider giving incentives to providers who report  security breaches which would otherwise go unnoticed.  vi  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Table of Contents  Executive summary .............................................................................................................................. iii  1 Introduction ................................................................................................................................. 1  2 Uptake of Cloud Computing.......................................................................................................... 3  3 CIIP Perspective of Cloud Computing ............................................................................................ 6  3.1 Concentration of ICT resources .............................................................................................. 6  3.2 Cloud and CIIP ....................................................................................................................... 7  3.2.1 Cyber disruptions ........................................................................................................... 7  3.2.2 Cyber attacks ................................................................................................................. 9  3.3 Relevant threats .................................................................................................................. 10  4 Cloud computing scenarios ......................................................................................................... 11  4.1 Financial services ................................................................................................................. 11  4.1.1 Cyber attack................................................................................................................. 12  4.1.2 Other cyber-attacks affecting cloud computing services ............................................... 13  4.2 Health services .................................................................................................................... 14  4.2.1 Natural disaster ........................................................................................................... 15  4.3 eGovernment services ......................................................................................................... 16  4.3.1 Overload ...................................................................................................................... 17  4.3.2 System failure .............................................................................................................. 18  4.3.3 Other system failures causing large outages or data loss .............................................. 19  4.4 Administrative or legal disputes ........................................................................................... 21  5 Conclusions & Recommendations ............................................................................................... 22  5.1.1 Risk assessment ........................................................................................................... 23  5.1.2 Security measures ........................................................................................................ 24  5.1.3 Incident reporting ........................................................................................................ 25  6 References ................................................................................................................................. 26  1  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  1 Introduction  Public and private sector organisations are switching to cloud computing and single cloud service  providers sometimes provide services for millions of users and a range of organizations and  businesses. This means that also from a CIIP perspective cloud computing becomes relevant. In this  paper we look at key risks for cloud computing services from a CIIP perspective. We look at data about  the usage and uptake of cloud computing and we analyse some scenarios. We conclude with  recommendations for government bodies, like regulators and contingency agencies, about addressing  the risks of cloud computing.  Policy context  The EU Member States have committed to protecting CII, via the European Commission’s  Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP)1. The CIIP action plan focusses  on strengthening the security and resilience of CII, and preventing large cyber-attacks and cyber  disruptions. The communication mentions cyber attacks, natural disasters and technical failures as the  main threats, and cites two examples: the DDoS attacks on Estonia in 2007, and the transatlantic  submarine cable cuts in 2008. The communication explicitly calls for discussion about the best  governance strategy for cloud computing services in this respect.  Critical information infrastructures (CII) are the ICT systems which are vital for the economy or the  society of a country (or a group of countries). There are several definitions of CII in the literature. The  European Commission (in the Communication on CIIP) has defined Critical Information Infrastructures  as all ICT systems which are either, a) critical infrastructure themselves, or b) essential for the  operation of other critical infrastructures. The OECD defined CII as those information systems and  networks, the disruption or destruction of which would have a serious impact on the health, safety,  security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the effective functioning of government or the  economy2.  The European Commission is also developing a European Cyber Security Strategy. The roadmap for  the strategy refers mentions extending Article 13a (a regulation on security and resilience of  telecommunications) to other business sectors.  Goal  The goal of this document is to look at the security and resilience of using cloud computing, from a CIIP  perspective.  Target audience  This document is targeted at IT officers in government bodies, like regulators and contingency  agencies, national and EU level policy makers, and also cloud computing vendors who deliver cloud  critical cloud computing services.

This means that we are primarily focussed on large- scale impact on society (for example caused by large outages or large cyber-attacks). We do not go  into details about issues like data protection, legal compliance or governance of individual cloud  service contracts and SLAs, for example.  For the full range of security risks and benefits for organisations (SMEs or government organisations)  when adopting cloud computing we refer to earlier ENISA papers.  Disclaimer about examples  For the sake of clarification we provide numerous examples, referring to public sources about cloud  services, cloud customers, security incidents, and so on. By no means is it our intention to single out  individual organizations for praise or criticism.  Structure of this document  In Section 2 we show the uptake of cloud computing, by listing several public sources. In Section 3 we  explain the CIIP perspective on cloud computing and in Section 4 we go over a number of specific  scenarios, based on public sources about cloud computing usage and passed incidents. In the  conclusions we make some key recommendations for mitigating the impact of large failures with  critical cloud computing services.  3  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  2 Uptake of Cloud Computing  Public and private sector organisations are switching to cloud computing: While years ago software  applications were running on servers on their own premises or dedicated data centres, now  applications are outsourced to large cloud service providers and run in very large data centres.  Cloud computing is being adopted rapidly across society, and across different sectors of society. Many  analysts predict a further growth (of around 30% a year). We give some examples:   IDC November 2011: The total cloud services market in Western Europe alone will grow from  3.3 billion euros in 2010 to 15 billion by 2015, which translates to a 35% growth rate. IDC  estimates that by 2014 most organizations will turn to the cloud first to implement new  functionality needed.   Gartner 2012: Almost 33% of the organisations polled are either already using or planning to  use cloud based SaaS offerings to augment their Business Intelligence functions.   AT&T 2011: According to London-based business continuity survey, almost 37% of companies  are considering using cloud technology to help them deal with disruptive events to ensure  business continuity.   Forrester 2012: 18% of high-tech industries have already adopted IaaS solutions and as many  as 25% plan to adopt them in the near future. In the more regulated sectors like government,  financial and health, the uptake is less. For example, in the government sector about 10% has  already adopted use of IaaS services, while about 5% plan to use IaaS in the near future.  Similar figures are reported for the healthcare and financial services sector.  The public data tells only part of the story -  from public data it is difficult to understand how many  end-users or organizations depend on a cloud computing provider, because cloud computing providers  often offer services to other organisations, which in turn provide services to the (sometimes millions  of) customers. For example, a SaaS cloud computing provider who uses the cloud (an IaaS cloud  computing provider) for computing and storage resources. This kind of reselling of IT resources makes  it hard to estimate how many end-users depend on a single cloud provider and this makes it hard to  estimate the full impact of an outage in society. We give some examples:   Amazon 2011: Amazon AWS infrastructure is reported to carry as much as 1% of the all  internet consumer traffic in North America and on an average a third of all internet users visit  an AWS powered site daily3. Amazon reports having customers like Zynga, Animoto, Reddit,  MySpace, Netflix, Dropbox, airbnb, Ericssons, European Space Agency, HootSuite, IBM,  Mahindra Satyam, Newsweek, UniCredit, Spiegel.Tv, PBS, Yelp, IMDB, Linden Labs,  FourSquare, SmugSmug, Alexa, The Guardian, Farmville, Sitepoint, EventBrite.   Rackspace 2011: By the end of 2011 Rackspace reportedly served 172,510 customers,  including Transport of London, Virgin Trains, UK MoD, NHS Direct, Fiverr, Pitchfork, The  Register, the Royal Navy, and TweetPhoto.  3 http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/  http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/business_continuity/london_business_continuity_summary_2011.pdf http://www.business.att.com/enterprise/Family/hosting-services/cloud/ http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/  4  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   Google 2011: Google reports that Google Apps customers include US General Services  Adminstration, Essilor, Ispen, BBVA Spain, Capgemini, SNL Financials, Salesforce.com, Essence,  The Guradian, LSI Logic, The Telegraph, and so on.   Microsoft: Microsoft Dynamics CRM is reported to generate about $500 million from its on- premise and cloud offerings4. Its set of customers includes Aer Lingus, Dow Chemicals, Hyatt  Hotels, Univ. of Georgia, Los Angeles Community College District etc.  Other companies use cloud computing services as part of private arrangements (private cloud) and  these arrangements are not public.   92% of IT decision makers at large companies have indicated that they will “definitely or  probably” expand their datacentre footprint in 20125.   Global investment in data centre facilities will grow in excess of 16% to top 30 billion euros in  20126.  The datacentres used for cloud computing are very large. We give some examples of public cloud  providers:   It is estimated that the Amazon EC2 is powered by half a million blade servers, over 50,000 of  which are hosted in the Dublin datacenter7.   The new Facebook server farm in the US state of Oregon measures 14000 square meters and  cost around 200 million US dollars to build8.  There are a number of other critical sectors where cloud computing is being adopted. Below we give  examples from the finance sector, the transport sector and the energy sector:   In 2011 Banco Bilbao started using cloud for email and calendar applications. The bank has  100.000 employees across the globe9.   In 2011 NYSE Euronext announced the creation of Capital Markets Community Platform, a  community cloud for traders, offering on-demand computing resources.   In 2012 the NASDAQ OMX Group announced the launch of FinQloud, a new cloud computing  platform powered by Amazon Web Services and designed for the financial services industry.   ITA, the air transport IT specialist launched the ATI Cloud, a form of community cloud, for the  airline industry to provide a wide range of on-demand business and IT resources that are  tailored specifically for the industry. SITA’s network connects over 17,000 sites globally and  4 http://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-strategy-coming-into-focus-2012-03-12  5 https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/03/12/cloud-growth-spurs-demand-for-data-centers/  6 Data Center Dynamics Growth, www.datacenterdynamics.com/research/market-growth-2011-2012  7  https://huanliu.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/amazon-data-center-size/  8 http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/16838342  9http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_goog le_apps.html  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-strategy-coming-into-focus-2012-03-12 https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/03/12/cloud-growth-spurs-demand-for-data-centers/ http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/research/market-growth-2011-2012 https://huanliu.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/amazon-data-center-size/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/16838342 http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html  5  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  links with 90% of the world’s airlines.

IDC Energy Insights projects that global oil and gas industry investment in public  cloud will rise to more than USD 2 billion in 201413.  Key Points  The data describing the uptake of cloud computing shows two aspects to take into account:   Cloud computing usage is growing and in the near future the vast majority of organizations will  rely on some form of cloud computing services. This makes cloud computing services critical in  themselves – simply because so many organizations and users now use cloud computing on a  day to day basis.   Cloud computing is being adopted also in critical sectors, like finance, energy, transport and  even governmental services.  10 http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=217569  11  “Six questions every executive in the energy industry should ask about cloud computing”  http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture_Energy_Cloud_Computing_POV.pdf  12 http://www.rickscloud.com/cloud-benefits-in-the-energy-and-utility-industry/  13 Oil and Gas: Into the Cloud?, Jill Feblowitz,  http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2011/05/11Management.pdf  http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=217569 http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture_Energy_Cloud_Computing_POV.pdf http://www.rickscloud.com/cloud-benefits-in-the-energy-and-utility-industry/ http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2011/05/11Management.pdf  6  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  3 CIIP Perspective of Cloud Computing  In this document we take a CIIP perspective on the uptake of cloud computing, and we identify the  main risks for critical cloud computing services.  3.1 Concentration of ICT resources  Adoption of cloud computing implies a concentration of IT resources in very large datacentres. This is  depicted in diagram below (Figure 1), where the squares are (connected) organizations or operators,  and the blue areas indicate IT resources. In information security, the concentration of IT resources is a  ‘double edged sword’: On the one hand, large cloud providers can deploy state of the art security and  business continuity measures and spread the associated costs across the customers. On the other  hand, if an outage or a security breach occurs then the consequences could be big, affecting many  citizens, many organizations, at once. To illustrate this paradox, we look at three past incidents:   Resilience: The Japanese earthquake of 2011 showed how resilient cloud computing can be in  the face of disaster and in the aftermath. Cloud services survived power outages by using  emergency fuel and data connections over mobile networks and fixed networks held up.  Traditional IT deployments in the disaster area on the other hand went offline. In the  aftermath of the disaster, cloud service providers provided support for emergency services,  and in the recovery phase cloud computing was used by organisation to quickly get services up  and running.   Single point of failure  o Lightning struck in the Dublin region in summer 2011 affecting the cloud services of  some major cloud providers. The outage lasted 2 days and affected many of their  customers.  o In summer 2011 a software flaw in a SaaS cloud service product for backups and  document storage allowed each user to see documents of millions of other users, for  up to 8 hours.  The concentration of IT resources makes cloud computing services critical and relevant to look at from  a CIIP perspective.  IT  IT  IT  IT  IT  IT  IT  Figure 1. Transition to Cloud Computing from a national perspective  7  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  3.2 Cloud and CIIP  Critical information infrastructures (CII) are the ICT systems which are vital for the economy or the  society of a country (or a group of countries). There are many definitions of CII in the literature. The  European Commission has defined Critical Information Infrastructures as all ICT systems which are  either, a) critical infrastructure themselves, or b) essential for the operation of other critical  infrastructures. From a CIIP perspective cloud computing service can be critical in two ways:  1. Cloud computing services can be critical in themselves.  2. Cloud computing services can be critical for other critical services  It is not always clear how to distinguish between the two categories. Consider for example an eHealth  record platform implemented using cloud computing (users and doctors log in to upload health record  data about symptoms and treatment). Obviously the eHealth record platform is critical, but it is not  clear if it falls in category 1 (the eHealth record platform is critical in itself) or in category 2 (the  eHealth record platform is not critical in itself, but needed for emergency health care, which is critical).  We refrain from distinguishing between these two cases, and call the cloud computing services in both  cases ‘critical’.  The CIIP action plan addresses two kinds of large-scale security incidents:   cyber disruptions (or outage) with a large impact,   cyber attacks with a large impact We take the same perspective in this document. We go over  the two types of incidents14.  3.2.1 Cyber disruptions  A cyber disruption in this context means (temporary or permanent) loss of service, with impact on  users of the cloud service who rely on its continuity. A good example is when critical services, such as  emergency care, depend on these cloud services. When looking at these dependencies it is important  to distinguish between the different levels of continuity required. Some cloud services can be offline  for a day without causing significant impact in society. For other cloud services a couple of hours of  downtime is already disastrous. We illustrate continuity dependencies in Figure 2, where we show how  different critical assets (like banking/trading), with different continuity requirements (90%, 99%, or  99,9%), may depend on continuity of power, network and cloud services or datacentres.  For example, consider a power outage in a data centre of a telecommunications provider. This could  cause the outage of a telephony network, which could in turn affect the continuity (or availability) of  emergency call centres. The continuity requirements for emergency call centres are high and therefore  also the continuity requirements for the telephony service and the datacentre of the provider are high.  14 There is some overlap between the two types: Cyber attacks can cause cyber disruptions (for example in DDoS attacks the  goal is to create an outage).  8  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Online services,  cloud computing  Public datacenters  Private D2D links  Private datacenters Public ecomms  Telco sites, switch  areas,  interconnections  Regional network  infra, cables, wires  (10000s km2)  Public transport  Emergency calls  eGovernment  Emergency care  (police/firefighters/  ambulances)  Banks/trading  Regional power  supply  Powerplants Regional power grid  (10000s km2)  Red – 99.9% – 8h outages are disastrous Light red – 99%  – 3 day outages are disastrous White – 90%  – 30 day outages are disastrous  Public  administration  Figure 2 Dependencies on the continuity of services and the integrity of infrastructure  Public sources on cloud computing outages show that the number of users affected per outage is  increasing. Recent outages already affect in the order of millions of end-users.   Gartner analysed the highly publicised services outages during the last 10 years, and came to  the conclusion that the number of cloud service outages (48 cases) outnumbered the more  traditional datacentre outages (29 cases), and that 47% of all documented large outages were  caused by cloud services outages15, with a visible acceleration in the past two years (12 cases  in 2010 and 10 in 2011). The duration of cloud outages ranged between 40 minutes and five  days with an average of 17 hours.   Ponemon Institute studied the financial impact of downtime at datacentres by looking at 41  independent datacentres in the United States16 and found that outages on average cost  500,000 US$ (ranging from 40,000 US$ up to a 1 million US$) and that costs are proportional  15 Gartner, \"The Realities of Cloud Services Downtime: What You Must Know and Do\", 20 October 2011  16http://blog.newvem.com/main/2011/08/availability-story-of-the-inevitable-outage-of-the-cloud.html  http://blog.newvem.com/main/2011/08/availability-story-of-the-inevitable-outage-of-the-cloud.html  9  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  to the duration of the outage, and the size of the datacentre. On an average a data centre  downtime cost about US$5,600 per minute.  This should not come as a surprise. Consolidation (of services and infrastructure) means that the  impact of a failure is also bigger. It is difficult to tell if the overall impact of outages and breaches is  decreasing (or increasing) because of the adoption of cloud computing. Note also that while there is  some data and press coverage about larger outages (affecting many end-users), but there is hardly any  data about smaller incidents (regarding data breaches and outages). This makes it difficult to compare  the impact of (presumably many, but smaller) incidents in legacy systems with the impact of outages  concerning cloud services. Cyber attacks  In some settings it is also important to take into account logical dependencies between critical  services, for example via software or secret information like passwords.  For example, consider an attacker who manages to alter software or access secret data at an IT vendor  which delivers information technology to a range of organisations. The attack could have  consequences across a range of organisations which use the software of this vendor. Recent examples  include:   the attack on RSA Secure ID, which had an impact on a range of (otherwise unrelated or  disconnected) organisations using the RSA tokens.   the attack on Diginotar which had an impact in Iran and across the Dutch e-government.   the attack on Google, Adobe, Juniper, et cetera, called Aurora, which saw cyber attackers  target source code repositories  We illustrate this type of dependency in Figure 3 where we take as an example an IT vendor who  delivers office software to a range of organisations (banks, hospitals, power plants, and public office)  who install the software locally on user machines. The security of these organisations depends on the  security of the IT vendor and in particular the security of the service delivery processes (software  development e.g.). An internet outage at the IT vendor would not have a direct impact, a cyber attack  at the IT vendor, for example tampering of the source code by an attacker, could have a large impact.  Power plant  Banks  Hospitals  Public  administration  IT vendor for Office  software  Air traffic  controllers  Figure 3. Logical dependencies on an software vendor  10  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  3.3 Relevant threats  From a CIIP perspective the relevant threats are different than the threats to consider from an SME  perspective. Take for example one of the high risks in ENISA’s 2009 cloud computing risk assessment  for SMEs: vendor lockin. Vendor lockin is a high risk for an SME, and the associated costs (switching  costs, or high bills) can be high. At the same time, a vendor lockin does not have a direct impact on the  health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens. Similarly, although subpoena or e-discovery  may be a relevant risk to take into account from an SME perspective, it is not relevant from a CIIP  perspective, because access of law enforcement to certain data stored at the cloud computing  provider does not have a direct impact on the economy or the society.  Based on the survey of past outages, we select the key threats which can have a large- scale impact:  For cyber disruption the most relevant threats are:  - Natural disaster, power outage, or hardware failure  - Resource exhaustion (due to an overload or a DDoS attack)  - Cyber attack (due to a software flaw)  - Administrative or legal issues  For cyber attacks the most relevant threats are:  - Resource exhaustion (due to a DDoS attack)  - Cyber attack (due to a software flaw)  In the next section we will look at several scenarios involving critical sectors, and we focus on these  threats.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  11  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  4 Cloud computing scenarios  We look at two types of large-scale security incidents: large disruptions (or outages) and cyber attacks,  by discussing 4 different scenarios where cloud services are critical – in each scenario we look at  different threats:   Financial services   Health services   eGovernment services   Cloud services  These scenarios are based on public data about usage of cloud computing services and past incidents.  We look at 4 different key threats to cloud computing services:  - Natural disaster, power outage, or hardware failure  - Resource exhaustion (due to an overload or a DDoS attack)  - Cyber attack (due to a software flaw)  - Administrative or legal issues  Note that we discuss a number of large security incidents (breaches and outages) related to cloud  computing, to give an overview of relevant threats. We do not intend to make a comparison with  security incidents in traditional IT deployments – and we do not want to suggest that cloud computing  is more vulnerable than traditional IT.  For the sake of illustration we provide several examples, referring to public sources about cloud  services, cloud customers, security incidents, and so on. By no means is it our intention to single out  individual organizations for praise or criticism.  4.1 Financial services  We look at the scenario of a large financial services company using cloud computing. In the financial  services sector a range of services are now being implemented using cloud computing.   In 2011 Banco Bilbao started using cloud for email and calendar applications. The bank has  100.000 employees across the globe17.   In 2011 NYSE Euronext announced the creation of Capital Markets Community Platform, a  community cloud for traders, offering on-demand computing resources.   In 2012 the NASDAQ OMX Group announced the launch of FinQloud, a new cloud computing  platform powered by Amazon Web Servicses and exclusively designed for the financial services  industry.  Assume a trading platform, implemented using cloud computing technology. The set-up is as depicted  in Figure 4.   Full duplication of systems across multiple data centres.   Private network links between datacentres are duplicated.  17http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_goo gle_apps.html  http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247851/spanish_bank_to_move_100000_employees_to_google_apps.html  12  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   Inside datacentres, all systems are duplicated, planning for minimal downtime.   The platform has a public (web-facing) interface for traders.  Trading platform (SaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  Operator  Trader Trader  Private network, D2D links:  Public internet, telephony:  Figure 4. Trading platform implemented using cloud computing  4.1.1 Cyber attack  Suppose a cyber-attack was waged against the trading platform. Trading systems are generally  considered part of a nation’s critical information infrastructure.   An attack of this kind took place at NASDAQ in 2010. In that case the attack did not impact  trading. The attack was discovered only months later. NASDAQ sustains there was no direct  impact on trading or assets.  Let’s assume the computers of operators were infected with malicious software, which in turn exploits  flaws in the trading platform, providing the attackers access to privileged financial data. The attackers  obtain access to the control functions of the financial transaction system and they are able to tamper  with trades causing large financial losses. A fault tree for this scenario would be as follows.  Outage  datacentre 1  Regional power  cut  Trading  platform  unavailable  Outage  datacentre 2  Outage  datacentre 3  &  Datacentre  hardware  failure  Software flaw Cyber attack  &  Regional  eComms  outage  Trading  platform  unavailable to  some  Local natural  disaster  Trading fraud  and data  breaches  Figure 5. Impact of a cyber attack on a trading platform  http://arstechnica.com/security/2011/02/fbi-justice-deparment-investigating-nasdaq-hacking-attempts/  13  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Outages of the public network would prevent traders from reaching the trading platform, but regional  outages only have only a limited impact, on some of the traders. All the faults affecting single  datacentres are mitigated by the redundancy across the datacentres. This mitigates the impact of, for  example, regional power cuts. Physical redundancy, however, does not help to prevent a cyber attack  which exploits a flaw in the software of the trading platform.  4.1.2 Other cyber-attacks affecting cloud computing services  There are other examples of cyber attacks on cloud computing services with a large-scale impact:   In 2012 Credit card processor Global Payments said there had been a security breach that  exposed 1.5 million consumers to (credit card) fraud. The incident is costing Global Payments  an estimate $84.4 million dollars.   In 2012 LinkedIn was breached and 6.5 million unsalted SHA-1 hashed passwords were found  on underground forums. Linkedin has 160 million members worldwide.   In 2012 Zapos fell victim to a cyber attack which breached data of about 24 million customers,  including customer names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, the last four  digits of the customer card numbers and encrypted passwords.   Epsilon was hacked in early December 2011, and leaked data included information relating to  the customers of at least 50 companies, including Best Buy, Citi, Hilton, LL Bean, Marriott,  Target, TiVo, and Walgreens.  Key points  The set-up of the trading platform is focussed on physical redundancy. The main goal is to prevent  outages due to high loads or power cuts or incidents affecting individual datacentres. In such a setup  the overall risk of disruptions decreases. At the same time cyber-attacks which exploit software flaws  can cause very large data breaches, affecting millions of users directly.   Security is crucial for critical cloud computing services – one flaw can impact a wide range of  organizations directly. From a logical perspective the cloud computing service is a single point  of failure.   Cloud service providers have the scale and resources to address and prevent cyber attacks in a  more professional way than most other organizations. It is important to prevent and mitigate  the impact of cyber attacks by creating also logical redundancy – that is, to use different layers  of defence and to use separate systems with a different logical structure, to cross-check  transactions and to detect attacks.  14  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  4.2 Health services  A number of hospitals are now adopting cloud computing. Information technology and cloud  computing in particular are expected to bring important efficiency gains. We give some examples:   By 2011, about 30% of the healthcare organizations had developed a strategic plan for  adopting cloud computing services18. It is expected that by 2016 about 30% of IT budget of  healthcare organizations would be devoted for cloud computing based expenses. 73% plan to  make greater use of cloud-based technologies in the future19.   In 2010, a leading Italian children’s hospital switched to an online solution for email services  for its 2500 employees20. Another Italian hospital USL of Asolo in Veneto is reported to be  using cloud computing to help operative tasks21.   The Swedish Red Cross adopted a cloud computing solution to help them reduce their costs by  about 20% and enhanced communication in real time between its employees21.   A Russian cardiovascular centre, Penza, adopted a cloud computing solution to coordinate  activities, diagnosis and decisions on treatment and surgery between doctors around the  country, with crucial gains for the patients22.  Consider a scenario where the data centre is set up with:   Redundant power and cooling - two independent power grid feeds are taken into an  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system that powers ICT and cooling systems   UPS has dual feeds to all equipment within the data centre.   Diesel generators rated to carry the entire data centre load.  In the event of grid loss, the UPS maintains electrical load until the generator has started and spun up  to load, and the generator is fuelled with enough diesel to maintain supply for a day. Such facilities will  contract with a fuel supplier to start tanker refuelling of the generator immediately upon loss of mains  power (with the understanding that the logistics of supply are such that it could take up to 24 hours to  replenish the local fuel tank).  We assume that the datacentre is one of several other datacentres providing the cloud service to  users, as depicted in the diagram below:  18 From Tactic to Strategy: The CDW 2011 Cloud Computing Tracking Poll, 2011  http://webobjects.cdw.com/webobjects/media/pdf/Newsroom/CDW-Cloud-Tracking-Poll-Report-0511.pdf  19 Six questions every health industry executive should ask about cloud computing, Accenture, 2010  20 “Economics of Cloud Computing” http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/Report.pdf  21 “Understanding Cloud Computing Competition, Environment and Finance”  http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/EBR.pdf  22 Understanding Cloud Computing Competition, Environment and Finance, European Business Review, 2011  http://webobjects.cdw.com/webobjects/media/pdf/Newsroom/CDW-Cloud-Tracking-Poll-Report-0511.pdf http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/Report.pdf http://www.intertic.org/Policy%20Papers/EBR.pdf  15  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  e-Health record platform (SaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  Hospital Hospital  Figure 6. e-Health record platform using cloud computing  4.2.1 Natural disaster  Consider a severe weather event which impacts the regional power supply and the data centre. For  example, high volumes of precipitation during summer storms in the UK, have caused flash flooding in  areas not normally deemed to be high-risk flood risk areas. Data centres are often located in rural  areas, outside of conurbations, and as such are highly dependent on the surrounding infrastructure  (power, communications, drainage and transportation) in order to maintain services.  Most datacentres are equipped with redundant power grid connections and backup generators to  mitigate the impact of extreme weather and power cuts. When a power cuts persists, of course,  resupply of generator fuel becomes an issue. In Japan, following the earthquake, in fact there are now  discussions to prioritize fuel for datacenters23.   (2 hours, millions of users) In June 2012 a severe thunder storm affected an Amazon EC2  datacenter. The outage caused problems for some major websites with millions of users, like  Instagram, Netflix and Pinterest.   (48 hours, large segment of multiple clouds) In August 2011, a lightning strike in Dublin  caused Microsoft BPOS, the Amazon EC2, and its Relational Database Service (RDS) to be out  for several hours24. It took over 48 hours for full functionality to be restored on the AWS  service.  23 https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/03/15/japan-may-prioritize-power-for-data-centers/  24 http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/07/lightning-in-dublin-knocks-amazon-microsoft- data-centers-offline/  https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/03/15/japan-may-prioritize-power-for-data-centers/ http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/07/lightning-in-dublin-knocks-amazon-microsoft-data-centers-offline/ http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/07/lightning-in-dublin-knocks-amazon-microsoft-data-centers-offline/  16  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Outage  datacentre 1  Regional power  cut  Cloud service  unavailable  Outage  datacentre 2  Outage  datacentre 3  &  Datacentre  hardware  failure  Software flaw Cyber attack  &  Local natural  disaster  Figure 7. Impact of natural disaster  Let’s assume bad weather (heavy rain) causes a regional power cut and that the fuel supply fails to  arrive at the datacentre, due to the flooding, and that the datacentre eventually goes offline. In a  redundant cloud computing setup an outage at a single datacentre has limited impact on the  continuity of services. In this case the availability of e-health records, for example, would be  guaranteed, because the other datacentres can take over the load.  Key points  A key benefit of cloud computing is resilience to withstand regional power cuts or local natural  disasters. It is difficult to mitigate the impact of fairly common events like floods, storms, or  earthquakes in a set up with only a single datacentre.   Cloud computing services can be more resilient, and the risk of disruptions due to natural  disasters decreases.  4.3 eGovernment services  A number of public sector organisations are now using IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services, to implement  internal IT and to implement e-government services, in a more efficient way .   The UK G-Cloud \"framework\", worth up to £60 million will operate for an initial six-month  period, after which successful applicants will be able to sell a range of tools the government  expects will include email, word processing, hosting, ERP, records management, CRM and  other office productivity software25.  25http://www.itnews.com.au/News/282746,sme-suppliers-rush-on-uks-g-cloud.aspx  http://www.itnews.com.au/News/282746,sme-suppliers-rush-on-uks-g-cloud.aspx  17  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   The UK Gov Cloud app store “GovStore”26 has over 1,700 information and communications  services available to the UK public sector, and contains details of each of the suppliers and  their services.   In 2011, the Catalan Government, the largest user of cloud computing public services in Spain,  had over 741,000 business users and organisations (such as Ferrovial, MRW, Government of  Aragon, and Madrid City Council) take advantage of the technology27.  We assume that the datacentre is part of a number of datacentres supporting the provisioning of a  SaaS cloud platform, specifically for government organizations. In this way several government  organizations can set-up (in a scalable, and quick fashion) e-government services to serve the citizens.  The set-up is depicted in Figure 8. The datacentres have the scale to deal with peak loads on either of  the websites.  Gov cloud app store (PaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  eGovernment  website (SaaS)  eGovernment  website (SaaS)  Figure 8. A gov-cloud appstore used for eGovernment web services  4.3.1 Overload  Consider the situation of a big disaster and a rush for information on one of the (e-Government)  websites for public disaster information. For example, in 2012, following a large explosion, a local  Dutch radio station referred citizens to an emergency webpage, for emergency information. The  website went offline immediately due to an overload of visitors.  The elasticity of cloud computing prevents an outage because the service runs on some very large  datacentres with vast computing power. Large peak loads of the e-Government websites have been  taken into account.  26 http://www.govstore.net/  27http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote- %E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe  http://www.govstore.net/ http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe http://catalannewsagency.com/news/society-science/microsoft-chooses-catalan-government-promote-%E2%80%98cloud-computing%E2%80%99-europe  18  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Key points  Cloud computing makes it easier to mitigate a surge in traffic, due to a particular event or a deliberate  (DDoS) attack, and in this way prevent an outage. It would be prohibitively expensive to implement a  datacentre with the required scale to handle such peak loads.  4.4 Software as a cloud service  A number of cloud service providers, who offer so-called Software as a Service (SaaS) to customers,  rely on other cloud service providers to provide more basic IT resources, such as operating systems  and application servers (called IaaS or SaaS providers).   Amazon 2011: Amazon infrastructure is reported to carry as much as 1% of the all internet  consumer traffic in North America and on an average a third of all internet users visit an AWS  powered site daily28. Amazon reports having customers like Zynga, Reddit, MySpace, Netflix,  Dropbox, HootSuite, et cetera.  Consider the following setup where two different IT vendors rely on the same underlying IaaS/PaaS  provider for basic IT resources.  Infrastructure or platform as a service (PaaS)  Datacenter Datacenter Datacenter  Webmail  provider (SaaS)  Online backup  service (SaaS)  Figure 9. e-Government applications (SaaS) running on a governmental app store (PaaS)  4.4.1 System failure  Let’s assume the IaaS/PaaS provider suffers an outage due to a system failure, say a software flaw.  There are numerous examples of cases where flaws and failures affect the services of IaaS/PaaS  providers:    (24 hours, multiple regions) Microsoft Azure was offline from 28th February 2012 due to a  leap year problem. The outage affected the compute service in a number of regions29. Service  28 http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/  29 https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/windows-azure-service-disruption-update.aspx  http://blog.deepfield.net/2012/04/18/how-big-is-amazons-cloud/ https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/windows-azure-service-disruption-update.aspx  19  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  to majority of customers was restored in around 9 hours, while full service restoration took  another 24 hours30. The affected customer base included the UK G-Gov CloudStore31.   (48 hours, large segment of users) In April 2011 Amazon's EC2 cloud suffered multiday  outages resulting in loss of availability and loss of data. This took down the data of several high  profiles sites including Reddit (over 36 hours32), Foursquares, Hootsuite and Quora (48  hours33).    (10 hours, service-wide) VMWare Cloud Foundry suffered two outages in April 2011 due to  power outage (10 hours) and subsequent misconfiguration (90 minutes)34.    (3 hours, service-wide) Microsoft BPOS suffered various outages in May 2011 due to three  different issues, creating lengthy email backlogs that created delays of upto 3 hours35.  The impact of failure at an IaaS/PaaS provider can have an impact across a range of organizations,  affecting many end-users. It can also have strange side-effects. Take for example an organization  which relies on the webmail provider for emails and on the online backup provider for backups, to  mitigate outages or data loss at the webmail provider. In case of a software flaw the organization  would still risk its vital data because both services rely on the same underlying IaaS/PaaS provider.  4.4.2 Other system failures causing large outages or data loss  System failures causing outages are not rare. Below we list a number of examples of incidents in which  a system failure caused a large-scale outage or data loss.   (24 hours, 7,500 users) In March 2009 7,500 Carbonite customers lost their backups.  Eventually after over 24 hour, all except 54 of these customers were able to retrieve their  backups36.   (Two months, 1 million users) In October 2009 T-Mobile’s Sidekick 1 million users lost their  contacts, calendar entries, to-do lists and photos when Microsoft subsidiary Danger suffered a  server failure37.  30 https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/window-azure-service-disruption- resolved.aspx  31 http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/feb/29/cloudstore-gcloud-microsoft- azure-outage  32 http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gva4t/on_reddits_outage/  33 http://www.quora.com/Why-is-some-data-missing-from-Quora-after-the-April-2011-outage  34 http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/050211-vmware-foundry-outage.html  35https://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2011/05/13/update-on-bpos-standard-email-issues.aspx  36 http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and- sues-suppliers/  37 http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont- have-a-backup/  https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/window-azure-service-disruption-resolved.aspx https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/01/window-azure-service-disruption-resolved.aspx http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/feb/29/cloudstore-gcloud-microsoft-azure-outage http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/feb/29/cloudstore-gcloud-microsoft-azure-outage http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gva4t/on_reddits_outage/ http://www.quora.com/Why-is-some-data-missing-from-Quora-after-the-April-2011-outage http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/050211-vmware-foundry-outage.html https://blogs.technet.com/b/msonline/archive/2011/05/13/update-on-bpos-standard-email-issues.aspx http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and-sues-suppliers/ http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/online-backup-company-carbonite-loses-customers-data-blames-and-sues-suppliers/ http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont-have-a-backup/ http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont-have-a-backup/  20  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing   (Permanent data loss, over 6300 users) Between 1-4th July 2010, Evernote experienced  several hardware failures leading to loss of data of over 6,32338 Evernote customers.   (48 hours, service-wide) In December 2010 17,355 Microsoft Hotmail accounts lost all emails  for two days before it was restored by the provider39.   (Four days, 35,000 users) In February 2011 over 35,000 Gmail accounts and Google Apps  customers lost all the data in the accounts. Google had to resort to restoring backups from  tapes, in an operation lasting four days40.   (Several hours, service-wide) On 6,11 and 15 August 2008, Google’s enterprise e-mail system,  Apps Premier Edition,  suffered an outage and disrupted some organizations and users that  rely on the service41. One of the outages affected nearly all users for approximately two hours;  while the other two affected part of the user base for about 24 hours.   (30 minutes, service-wide) In September 2011, Google Docs, Google Docs List and Google  went offline for a period of around 30 minutes, affecting all its users42.   (72 hours, as big as 70m users) Millions of Blackberry users across Europe, Middle East and  Africa suffered outage for three days in October 2011.  The company has about 70m users  around the world. Speculation is that most of the global customer base may have been  affected at some point during the 72 hours43.   (Seven hours, 3.8 percent of customer base) In February 2012 Microsoft Azure platform  suffers outage that lasted more than seven hours, affecting 3.8% of the customer base44.  Key points  It is quite common for (SaaS) cloud computing providers to rely on other (IaaS/PaaS) cloud computing  providers. These relations create more dependencies between organizations and between cloud  computing service providers. Outages or other incidents at a single service provider could have an  impact on a range of organizations, including other cloud service providers and customers.   Cloud computing services are not immune to system failures – overall the risk of system  failures may be reduced when compared to traditional IT deployments, but if a system failure  occurs then there may be a large impact (and a lot of media attention).   Particularly for IaaS and PaaS providers it is crucial to mitigate outages and system failures  because so many other cloud service providers or other organizations depend on them.  38 http://blog.evernote.com/2010/08/09/july1/  39 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/04/microsoft_apologizes_empty_hotmail/  40 http://blogs.computerworld.com/17897/google_apps_and_gmail_outage_outrage_problem_resolved  41  https://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=seo&id=750739  42  http://www.informationweek.com/news/cloud-computing/software/231600978  43http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/blackberry-outage-2011-rim-says-services- returning_n_1008596.html  44 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/29/windows_azure_outage/  http://blog.evernote.com/2010/08/09/july1/ http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/04/microsoft_apologizes_empty_hotmail/ http://blogs.computerworld.com/17897/google_apps_and_gmail_outage_outrage_problem_resolved https://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=seo&id=750739 http://www.informationweek.com/news/cloud-computing/software/231600978 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/blackberry-outage-2011-rim-says-services-returning_n_1008596.html http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/blackberry-outage-2011-rim-says-services-returning_n_1008596.html http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/29/windows_azure_outage/  21  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  4.5 Administrative or legal disputes  Another type of outage which is worth mentioning are outages caused by administrative or legal  disputes. We give a number of examples:   (Permanent data loss, service-wide) The Megaupload cloud storage service was taken down  by the US prosecutors alleging copyright infringement. At the time of closure it had  180,000,000 registered users hosting over 25 petabyte (25000 terabyte) of storage45. It was  the 13th most visited site on the Internet.   (Permanent shutdown, 20,000 users) In August 2008, The Linkup, a service offering online  data storage lost access to unspecified amount of customer data and soon after on 8th August  shutdown the service, effecting over 20,000 paying customers46.   (Permanent shutdown, unknown number of users47) In February 2009, Onsite3, a leading  global provider of electronic evidence solutions for law firms and corporations filed for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy and that it is being bought over by Integreon, a provider of outsourced  knowledge, legal, and administrative support services48.  We do not go into details about this kind of threat much further, because technically this threat is not  specific for cloud computing, but could affect any kind of ICT service provider. At the same time we  would like to stress that the criticality of certain cloud computing services raises the issue of such  administrative or legal disputes. If a very large cloud computing service provider stops services over a  legal dispute then a large number of customers is affected, and the impact on the economy and on  society can be significant.  Key points  Administrative and legal issues concerning a cloud computing provider are amplified by the sheer size  of cloud computing services.   Cloud computing services are not immune to administrative or legal issues. If there is a legal  dispute involving the provider or one of its customers, then this could have an impact on the  data of all the other co- customers (or co-tenants).  45  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload  46  https://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/081108-linkup-failure.html  47 Indicative customer base number not available  48 http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/02/daily105.html?page=all  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaupload https://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/081108-linkup-failure.html http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/02/daily105.html?page=all  22  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  5 Conclusions & Recommendations  In this paper we have looked at cloud computing from a CIIP perspective. We gave an overview of  public sources on cloud computing uptake and we look at different cloud computing scenarios large  cyber attacks and large cyber disruptions.  Conclusions  We summarize our conclusions:   Cloud computing is critical: Cloud computing usage is growing and in the near future the vast  majority of organizations will rely on some form of cloud computing services. This makes cloud  computing services critical in themselves. Cloud computing is being adopted also in critical  sectors, like finance, energy and transport.   Cloud computing and natural disasters: A key benefit of cloud computing is resilience in the  face of regional power cuts or local natural disasters. It is difficult to mitigate the impact of  fairly common regional disasters like floods, storms, or earthquakes in a set up with only a  single datacentre, or a traditional set-up with a legacy onsite IT deployment.   Cloud computing and overloads or DDoS attacks: Elasticity is a key benefit of cloud computing  and this elasticity helps to cope with load and mitigates the risk of overload or DDoS attacks. It  is difficult to mitigate the impact of peak usage or a DDoS attack with limited computing  resources.   Cyber attacks: Cyber attacks which exploit software flaws can cause very large data breaches,  affecting millions of users directly. The impact of cyber attacks is multiplied by the  concentration of resources which is a result of the uptake in cloud computing.   IaaS and Paas the most critical: The most critical services are large IaaS and PaaS services  which deliver services to other IT vendors who service in turn millions of users and  organisations.   Administrative and legal disputes: Cloud computing is not immune to administrative or legal  issues. If there is a legal dispute involving the provider or one of its customers, than this could  have an impact on the data of all the other co- customers (or co-tenants).  Recommendations  The CIIP action plan calls for a discussion on a governance strategy for cloud computing. Below we  make several recommendations for policy makers and national CIO’s that should be taken into account  when setting such a strategy. From a CIIP perspective the goal would be to prevent large security  incidents. Governance of security, across a region, a sector, or group of providers, can be subdivided in  three key processes (see figure 10):  1. RA: Making a risk assessment – to determine which are critical infrastructures, what is their  value for economy and society, and what kind of incidents need to be prevented.  2. SM: Taking security measures (or make sure they are taken) – to prevent large incidents or to  mitigate their impact.  3. IR: Collecting incident reports – to understand weaknesses in security measures and to  evaluate and validate the risk assessment.  This triangle of governance processes can be supervised by a government authority (a regulator, say)  or some industry association (a body of auditors, say), or in combination. We make several  recommendations for each of these processes.  23  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  Risk assessment  Security Measures Incident reporting  RA  SM IR  Figure 10. Key security governance processes  5.1.1 Risk assessment  Risk assessment is at the start of governance. The main goal of risks assessment is to prioritize security  measures. We make several recommendations related to risk assessment.   Assets in scope: It is important to take a pragmatic approach and address the most critical  cloud computing services first. It is easy to say that ‘all cloud computing services are  critical’ but it is infeasible to address all cloud computing services at once. As mentioned,  since outages at IaaS or PaaS providers can have an impact across a range of organizations,  this means that these services should be treated with priority. Often in cloud computing a  range of SaaS services depend on a IaaS/PaaS services and network connections and  power supply. The IaaS/PaaS service depends on network connection and power supply.  This suggests that the criticality of power supply and network connections is higher than  the criticality of the IaaS/PaaS provider, and that the criticality of the IaaS/PaaS provider is  higher than the SaaS provider.   Assessing dependencies on cloud computing: Most countries, when making national risk  assessments, from a critical infrastructure perspective, take into account already power  supply and electronic communications networks. They should also take into account large  cloud computing services and large datacentres. Agencies responsible for establishing and  maintaining national contingency plans should take into account the dependencies of  modern society on IT.   Transparency about logical and physical dependencies: A risk assessment requires a clear  view of the dependencies. It should be clear which critical operators and critical services  depend on which cloud computing services. The special nature of cloud computing plays a  role here. It is inherent to the cloud computing model, that hardware and software is  shared between multiple tenants. This is exactly what creates a benefit when it comes to  withstanding DDoS attacks or peak loads. At the same time, this complexity in  dependencies can create strange side-effects. Outages at an underlying IaaS or PaaS  provider can affect a range of (otherwise unrelated) services across society. It is important  to map the main logical and physical dependencies.  24  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  5.1.2 Security measures  The main goal of security governance is to mitigate incidents by taking security measures.   Foster exchange of best practices to achieve a security baseline: It goes without saying  that it is important that cloud providers take appropriate security measures. There is a  host of literature on best practices, ranging from best practices on how to set-up  datacentres and networks, to how to securely engineer software and services. In this  document we refrain from making specific technical recommendations about these best  practices, so for example, we do not go into details about best practices like ‘deploying  security patches to operating systems’. We do stress that it is important for government  authorities to support and foster the exchange of such best practices. Security is  constantly changing and security measures must be improved continuously. Government  authorities should encourage an open culture of exchange and discussion about security  measures. Security is about continuous improvement and government authorities should  avoid a situation where a specific set of best practices is cast in stone (by regulation or  self-regulation).   Logical redundancy: We would like to stress one particular issue: Cloud computing  services are often set-up with several redundant datacentres to withstand outages of  single datacentres (due to power cuts or natural disasters, for example). However, most  cyber attacks capitalise and exploit software flaws, which are persist across the  datacentres. Software flaws can cause outages by themselves. Arguably, cloud service  providers have the scale and resources to address and prevent software flaws and cyber  attacks in a much more professional way than most other organizations. Still it is  important to of the concentration important to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyber  attacks by creating also logical redundancy – that is, to use different layers of defence and  to use separate systems with a different logical structure, to cross-check transactions and  to detect attacks.   Physical redundancy: Related to the previous point, most relevant threats, from a CIIP  perspective, are related to lack of logical or physical redundancy. A single point of failure  must be avoided. One effective way to do this is to make sure that the software and  hardware are standardized and not dependent on specific technology of a specific  provider. Standardization, especially for IaaS and PaaS services, would allow customers to  move workload to other providers in case one provider has an issue. If a service is  standardized and if frequent backups are made, then even an outage caused by an  administrative or legal dispute can be addressed, by simply taking the backups and  deploying them at the site of another (competing) cloud computing provider. This kind of  mutual aid is only possible when the cloud services infrastructure is standardized. From a  CIIP perspective standardization in cloud computing is very important, because it allows  customers to mitigate any (legal or administrative) issues they may have with the cloud  service provider.   Audits, tests, and exercises: There is a lot of information security literature about the  importance of auditing and testing systems. Cloud computing providers should schedule  frequent audits and tests, by internal testers and auditors, and, when relevant, by external  testers and auditors. In discussions about governance, often the need for independent  external auditors is stressed. Such audits are often organized as part of a certification  25  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  process. We would like to stress that ICT systems are constantly changing (software is  updated daily) and that this reduces the effect of periodic (yearly) audits. Moreover, the  complexity of the systems underpinning cloud computing services makes it very difficult to  assess security or resilience. Cloud computing providers and government authorities  should ensure there is a continuous program of audits, tests and exercises in place. Audits  by external parties are only one part of this program.  5.1.3 Incident reporting  Incident reporting provides the cross check on the effectiveness of security measures and it provides  input to the risk assessment.   Mandatory reporting: Without incident reports it is very difficult to understand the impact  of security incidents on cloud computing providers. This complicates risk assessment, both  for cloud computing service providers, as well as, at a national level, for government  authorities like contingency agencies. Lack of data about incidents makes it very difficult to  prioritize security measures, and in this way security governance becomes inefficient or  even ineffective. Government authorities and cloud providers should agree on the  thresholds for reporting and the type of services that should be in scope.   Legal consequences: Secondly, it is important to consider the following. Certain cyber  attacks are stealthy and their traces may be difficult to spot even for system  administrators who know the cloud computing systems inside out. There is always a risk  that security incidents are not reported to higher management or to authorities for fear of  reprisal or legal consequences. Member States should consider the possible benefits of  providing immunity for providers who reported security breaches which would otherwise  go unnoticed.   Outages and security breaches: While there are some good information sources about  data breaches49 there are no good information sources about cloud computing service  outages. Reliable information is often difficult to find. And even for some fairly high-profile  incidents it is difficult to find basic information like numbers of users affected or duration.  To be able to assess overall risks and assess the effectiveness of security measures in  place, it is crucial to have incident reports about outages and security breaches from a  wide range of cloud computing providers.  49  For instance http://datalossdb.org collects, and provides an overview of, data breaches.  http://datalossdb.org/  26  Critical Cloud Computing  CIIP Perspective on Cloud Computing  6 References  Related ENISA papers   The 2009 ENISA Cloud computing risk assessment assess risks and benefits for SMEs who  consider adopting cloud computing.   The 2011 ENISA report on security and resilience of Governmental clouds provides guidance  for government organisations for selecting cloud computing services.   The 2012 ENISA report on secure procurement of cloud computing services, focusses on  monitoring service levels of cloud computing services.

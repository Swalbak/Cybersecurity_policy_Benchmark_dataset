We have welcomed the publication of the proposal of the European Commission, last September, with  great pleasure. The Commission proposes not only a clear plan for our future mandate, but also introduces  a long awaited and clear proposal for a European approach to cybersecurity including a proposal for  certification of ICT products and services.  It is estimated that the value of the EU cyber security market this year will exceed 24 Billion Euro and that  it will grow by 6% annually.  My intervention will shortly address our views on the proposal, including certification.  Please, allow me to make a disclaimer: in the current stage of the mandate review process the draft  legislation is in the hands of legislative bodies, namely the Council and the EP.  Also, as requested, I will end my intervention with sharing briefly some views about the European Cyber  Security Month.  1. ENISA’s general view on the new mandate  The Commission proposal is that ENISA will contribute to a high level of cybersecurity in the EU, by acting  as an independent centre of expertise, by supporting Member State capacity and capabilities, by  promoting cooperation and coordination as well as assisting policymaking at Union level, and by raising  awareness among citizens and businesses. Additionally, the Commission’s proposal involves ENISA in the  proposed EU cybersecurity certification framework.  ENISA’s view on the proposal, which foresees a strengthened and reinforced role for the Agency, is  positive.  Firstly, ENISA is very pleased about the proposed permanent mandate. ENISA welcomes the proposal for a  permanent mandate and believes that this will make the Agency more attractive for staff and facilitate the  delivery of better results in the long term.  Secondly, ENISA welcomes the proposed increased financial and human resources, as well as the  opportunity to carry out new tasks, and to strengthen the implementation of the NIS Directive. The  proposal suggests doubling the budget by 2022 and significantly increasing the staff over the forthcoming  years.1  Thirdly, ENISA welcomes the proposed enhanced cooperation with CERT-EU and the opportunity to bring  the expertise of ENISA to partake in a more operational role that will support Member States. In light of  the current European threat landscape, more cooperation within, and outside the EU, is simply necessary.  1 Involving over 5 million euros of budget increase, see: COM(2017) 477, p. 82. Comment: statutory staff will increase  by 32, and the number of SNEs will be increased by 9, giving a total increase of 41 by 2022. The expenditure plan  provides for increased resources from July 2019.  Towards a new role and mandate for ENISA and the European Cyber Security Month  Brussels, Belgium | January 2018  03  Fourthly, ENISA welcomes the Blueprint for a coordinated response to large-scale cybersecurity incidents  and crises, and it recognises the need for the sharing of technical information.  Lastly, ENISA welcomes the challenge of addressing certification on a pan EU basis with the introduction of  a cybersecurity certification scheme and the creation of the ‘EU cyber security certification group’.  2. Certification  Given the level of debate currently taking place on Certification I would like to use this opportunity to  briefly share my view on the certification proposal, in particular its importance to the European society.  ENISA welcomes the proposal of the Commission to develop a certification model for Europe. I believe that  this policy is in line with the ambition to create a single digital marketplace for Europe.  One of Europe’s great successes in certification was the development of pan EU standards for GSM. The  model resulted in a standardised mobile phone technology being available in all Member States. The  success of this model resulted in Europe leading the development, the manufacture and export of mobile  phone technology across the world.  There is no reason why this success cannot be duplicated in relation to cyber security products. If we take  the example of smart electricity meters, the development of a standardised product that can be deployed  in all Member States could be an opportunity to stimulate the market across the EU and to stimulate  exports to third countries.  In relation to consumer products, the proposed certification process would allow the certification of the  product in one country being eligible to put on the market in all Member States at the same time. This will  help to stimulate the market, and provide a marketplace with increased trust in the certified products.  I am strongly of the view that the proposed certification process would benefit all EU citizens and should  be supported.  3. Concluding remarks on the new mandate  Before I end my intervention with some messages on the European Cyber Security Month, I will conclude  our views on the proposed mandate and role for ENISA.  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. The digital revolution now touches nearly every aspect of our lives.  Consumers and service providers need to have confidence in the digital world. Cyberattacks are continually  evolving and are constantly becoming more sophisticated. Cyberattacks know no borders. Recent  cyberattacks have demonstrated significant disruptions to power systems, hospital operations and  confidence in ICT infrastructure.  I believe that ENISA as the EU Cybersecurity Agency has an important role in assisting Member States in  the delivery of EU cyber solutions for the European digital single market and I welcome the Commission’s  proposal.  Towards a new role and mandate for ENISA and the European Cyber Security Month  Brussels, Belgium | January 2018  04  4. European Cyber Security Month  On the specific request of the EESC, I will provide you with some brief insights on the European Cyber  Security Month (ECSM).  The objective of the European Cyber Security Month is producing general awareness about Network and  Information Security and promoting safer use of the Internet for all users. ENISA therefore actively involves  relevant EU stakeholders to not only increase national media interest but also to enhance attention and  interest with regard to information security through political and media coordination. We support Member  States in their campaigns, provide synergies and engage industry to support users with the tools that allow  them to take responsibility for their own actions online.  We believe that it is important that citizens develop the necessary skills and knowledge to protect  themselves and their information assets, that European society increases cyber resilience, that our  democracies, economies and freedoms are not compromised by cybersecurity incidents, and finally that  Europe fulfils its aspirations for a Digital Single Market. In this regard, the ECSM has an important role to  play.  In recent years the ECSM addressed themes such as:  • Cyber Security in the Workplace;  • Governance, Privacy and Data Protection; and  • Cyber Security in the Home.  In 2017, the theme of the ECSM was ‘Skills in Cyber Security’.  28 Member states and 9 non-Member states participated in the ECSM where 532 activities took place  across Europe last October.  To conclude this brief information on the ECSM, I want to share what ENISA considers the successes of the  campaign:  1. The continuous growth of the campaign with regard to the number of participating countries  across Europe, including all Member States  2. The continuous growth of the number of activities taking place across Europe  3. An important aspect of the campaign’s success in recent years is information sharing on promoting  cyber awareness between the Member States. Information sharing regarding the Member States  allows for the identification of synergies and cross-fertilization of ideas and concepts.  Thank you for your attention.

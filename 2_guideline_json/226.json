Although interesting approaches and  initiatives are taking place in some EU Member States, yet further steps can be done towards  an integrated EU vision and action.  This report shows that, despite recent efforts by national governments in developing CVD  policies, some industry players have taken the lead and developed vulnerability policies  and programmes at organisation level. Nevertheless, among the top industry expectations is  that the development of a national or European level CVD policy could help organisations and  public administrations to set vulnerability management as a priority and further encourage  security practices. In addition, the alignment of such policies with existing international  standards, can greatly help in promoting harmonization.  As far as vulnerability initiatives are concerned, Bug Bounties Programmes (BBP) is an area  that grew remarkably over the past few years. BBPs have considerably adapted their  business models in offering different type of services, hence different coverages of IT systems  and levels of involvement in vulnerability management processes. Today, BBPs platform  providers are now cooperating with key public institutions to run customised programmes  adapted to their needs and IT infrastructures. Further expansion is expected as long as the  community can continue relying on BBPs (i.e., confidentiality of internal information and data  protection) and ensuring trust between the stakeholders involved.  In terms of human capital, researchers play a fundamental role in the disclosure of  vulnerabilities. Accordingly, it is interesting to understand motivations, incentives and  challenges influencing researchers’ contribution. From their perspective, reputation remains  as a one of the key incentives to legally report vulnerabilities, as it leads to fame and  recognition. However, legal protection is also highly considered, especially because the  absence, uncertainty or non-clarity of legal conditions can push to illegal channels.  Collaborative challenges arise in the use of tools to improve vulnerability disclosure processes.  For example, when looking into vulnerabilities related to open-source software (OSS) and  considering how intertwined commercial and OSS are today, a need to further improve  coordination between OSS developers and private vendors was identified. Aspects such  as OSS vulnerability handling, responsibility and accountability are not yet clearly defined and  among actors involved across the IT product supply chains, which may hinder coordination  efforts.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  7  Challenges related to technical and technological issues also constitute a key area of  discussion and analysis. A forward-looking perspective on the use of automation as an  enabler to efficiently manage vulnerability identification, sourcing and classification is  also provided by this report. It is observed that, as vulnerability analysis and treatment still  require human expertise, the risk of deskilling experts due to automated processes may be  minimised.  Finally, alignment across different legislation as well as cooperation between industry players  and governments are needed to avoid silos. Harmonisation of CVD practices, coordination  and international cooperation among players are essential priorities both from a legal  and technical perspectives. In this regard, ENISA will continue offering advice, publishing  guidelines, promoting information sharing, raising awareness, and coordinating CVD-related  activities at national and EU level.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES  The implementation process of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) programmes in the  EU is taking place in a heterogeneous manner. Yet, whereas a few Member States count on  strategic approaches for the deployment of CVD programmes, some others are showing  progress at different speeds without following a common EU approach. Likewise, within a co-  existence of heterogenous approaches, common challenges have been identified, notably in the  economic, legal, technical and policy dimensions.  The objective of this report is two-fold. First, to gather evidence related to latest developments  and trends linked to the implementation of CVD programmes in the EU, and second, to deeply  analyse current issues faced by public bodies, industry and researchers at the time of deploying  CVD programmes in EU Member States. This report also elaborates on the analysis and  conclusions provided by the ENISA report: ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies in the  EU’1.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The primary target audience of this report is composed by public bodies holding responsibility in  the design and implementation of CVD policies in EU Member States. These entities are  expected to receive and explore showcased outputs, evidence and results, as a result of a  multidisciplinary consultation engaging more than 30 stakeholders. The added value of this  ENISA report lies on the facilitation of a discussion framework that helps to identify common  approaches for the implementation of CVD programmes across the EU.  The secondary target audience for this report is mainly composed by the general cybersecurity  community and entities that are involved in the vulnerability treatment lifecycle, and that can  benefit from the insights, challenges, and good practises identified herein.  1.3  REPORT STRUCTURE  This report includes the following chapters:  National CVD policy implementation – The industry perspective. This chapter explores and  captures the expectations of the industry regarding the implementation of national CVD  programmes and policies.  • 1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-in-the- eu/@@download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-in-the-eu/@@download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-in-the-eu/@@download/fullReport  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  9  Addressing legal challenges for security researchers. This chapter addresses legal issues  linked to the engagement of researchers in the disclosure of vulnerabilities. Good practices  oriented to minimise the effect of these issues are also presented and discussed.  Addressing collaborative challenges: The use of open-source software and bug-bounty  programs. In this chapter, collaborative challenges and approaches are analysed, particularly  those related to the use of open-source software and technology. In addition, bug bounty  programmes and initiatives are analysed and put into focus.  Addressing technical challenges: Automation initiatives supporting prioritisation and  treatment of vulnerabilities. This final chapter focuses on technical issues linked to the use of  tools and automated processes to speed up and support the vulnerability disclosure processes  and interactions.  1.4 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  A three-step approach was followed oriented to (i) build an in-depth understanding of the CVD  state of play, (ii) obtain specific data on latest CVD, and finally (iii) draw conclusions and  recommendations useful for policymakers in charge of the design and implementation of CVD  policies and programmes. The three steps are presented below:  1. Desk research. Collection and analysis of findings gathered from available literature. When  selecting the sources, particular attention was given to the relevance, quality and reliability of  sources, their geographical coverage and their pertinence to research scope outlined. To  perform an efficient data analysis, an analytical framework was developed allowing to treat data  in a structured manner.  2. Target consultation. A total of 13 interviewees and 2 focus groups involving more than 30  stakeholders were carried out. Interviewees were invited to answer 25 questions covering  current challenges and future perspectives allowing to take further steps towards a common EU  approach in the implementation of CVD programmes and policies. Two focus groups were  conducted to discuss key aspects linked to use of open source as driver of collaborative  frameworks and relations between CVD and bug bounty programmes.  3. Analysis of findings. By establishing correlations between desk research analysis and  outputs of consultations with stakeholders, the obtained findings were treated in an aggregated  manner. This work has allowed the elaboration of the primary information, and the identification  of trends and evidence showcased in the distinct chapters along the report.  The research and analysis were mostly based on a qualitative approach, enabling to shed light  on real life experiences and testimonials. It also served to identify other areas of analysis that  would help to tackle current identified challenges in this report.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  10  2. NATIONAL CVD POLICY  IMPLEMENTATION – THE  INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE  2.1 CONTEXT  The implementation of national CVD policies is expected to have a significantly positive impact  on security research around vulnerabilities, and their timely discovery, reporting and treatment.  However, there is little doubt that these national frameworks will also have an impact on  industry, as manufacturing becomes highly digitalised and increasingly dependent on  technology, software code, and data.  In this section, the report collects the latest trends and industry stakeholders’ inputs regarding  the development and implementation of national policies within EU Member States. The  section of the report is structured as followed:  1. Assessment and considerations on the creation of a national policy.  2. Good practices when developing and implementing of a CVD policy.  3. Challenges faced when developing and implementing a CVD policy.  To contextualise this part of the report, the study has referred to the findings from the ENISA  study ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies in the EU2’ especially on the CVD policy  state of play in the EU; and enriched these findings with desk research quoted throughout the  study.  2.2 ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL POLICIES  Despite the EU’s strong push towards cyber security within a global digital transformation trend,  the EU market is fragmented among EU Member States. Belgium, France, Lithuania and the  Netherlands are the only four EU Member States with a fully established national CVD policy.  Figure 1 presents an exhaustive state of play of the implementation of national CVD policy in  the EU.  2 ENISA, ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies in the EU‘, April 2022.

Four other Member States intend to set up a policy. In these cases, a proposal is either being  examined at the level of policymakers or is tested in pilot projects. 10 other EU Member States  are in the process of implementing a national CVD policy or are preparing to do so. However,  failure to reach an agreement at the political or legislative level has slowed down such a process.  Finally, nine Member States have not implemented a CVD policy and the process for establishing  one has not yet started.  Implementation of CVD policy at national level in Europe Figure 2 below presents a mapping of  the state of play in the implementation of CVD policies in the EU Member States. The map  divides countries based on a scale between (1) to (4), where (1) indicates that the country has a  policy in place, and (4) indicates that the countries have no policy in place. The values in  between indicate either that the process of implementing a policy is in progress, or that the  country is just on the brink of implementing one.

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  12  From the mapping of the state of play of CVD implementation, a relative greater maturity can be  seen of western European countries compared to other European regions. Conversely,  southern European countries and central and eastern European countries are rather lagging in  this process.  With this state of play in mind, the EU Member States are encouraged by the European  Commission, Parliament and ENISA to set up national cybersecurity strategies and resilience  programmes, surely including notions and action plans on vulnerability management3. The EU  landscape on CVD may evolve due to the NIS2 directive4 and cyber resilience act5 pointing  out the importance of vulnerability considerations and encouraging EU Member States to take  further action.  Consulted industry experts pointed out that regardless of the existence or not of national policy  actions, industry players (private companies) have already initiated CVD initiatives at  company level. On one hand, most actors involved in vulnerability management see these  private initiatives as an efficient move towards the creation of a safe IT ecosystem. In this  sense, the European Commission encourages private companies to set adequate vulnerability  strategies including mitigation measures in the case that a vulnerability cannot be patched  immediately (e.g. due to requiring testing before deploying to production environment). The  initiatives should include an appropriate incident response mechanism and guidelines on  information security, business continuity and organisational resilience6.  On the other hand, isolated company initiatives may create heterogeneity among practices  making it more difficult for national governments to harmonise practices within a national policy  on CVD. Along these lines, consulted stakeholders pointed out the importance for policy  makers to consider already implemented industry initiatives on CVD, for instance ISO  standards (ISO/IEC 30111:2019 and ISO/IEC 29147:2018), and may consider sector or  infrastructure-specific standards. The importance of aligning international cooperation,  industries and standards (to minimise the impact on already existing strategies and foster  international exchanges) is also reinforced by the OECD in their report ‘Encouraging  vulnerability treatment’7 which sets guidelines for policymakers on how to define a public policy.  In line with considerations presented in ENISA’s report 2022 on Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure8, ENISA’s role was to facilitate harmonisation and guide EU Member States in  the development and implementation of national policies. This role particularly applies in  support-related activity and the elaboration of CVD guidelines at EU level. The idea would  be to provide governmental entities with guidelines on vulnerability management, dedicated  processes and related responsibilities. Progress can be made, for example, through a standard  3 Joint Research Centre, ‘Cybersecurity, our digital anchor’, European Commission, June 2020.

To start with, policy  makers should understand the underlying motivations and barriers faced by stakeholders  involved in CVD. In this sense, policy makers would ensure that the planned objectives of the  national CVD policy cover all stakeholders’ needs and support the creation of a safer digital  environment.  Consulted experts both from industry and national agencies recommended that national CVD  policies should be developed with a particular attention given to content, format, transparency  and coherence.  • Content and format of national CVD policies. The content of a policy should be clear  and written in both the national language of the country and English (for foreign  security researchers). Authors of such a policy should address it to all stakeholders  involved in vulnerability disclosure and should clarify the roles, responsibilities, and  governance within national CVD. Importantly, the necessity of adding a section on the  roles of companies (e.g., code owners, manufacturers), prosecutors, and judges (often  in charge of monitoring lawsuits initiated by organisations on security researchers) was  pointed out. Prosecutors should be careful to examine each case thoroughly, and in  accordance with the applicable CVD policy, before deciding whether to prosecute or  not.  Similarly, due to the nature of their involvement in lawsuits, judges should be aware of  their role and responsibilities and have knowledgeable about the underlying legislation  to conduct trials of security researchers that are being sued by a CVD counterparty. On  this, EU Member States could follow the example of the United States’ ‘Judiciary  Launches Vulnerability Disclosure Program’ (October 2021), which provides clear  guidelines for security researchers on the best way to safely report vulnerabilities9.  Along these lines, industry players emphasised the importance of defining the notion of  ‘responsible disclosure’ which enables security researchers to safely report  vulnerabilities to security teams or other responsible organisations. Another aspect to  be considered is the limit between ‘ethical and unethical’ behaviour (i.e. what is  allowed/not allowed) not only to avoid creating grey areas for researchers when  reporting vulnerabilities but also to support judges in their assessment.  9 Judiciary Launches Vulnerability Disclosure Program, United States Courts, October 2021. Available at: https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/10/13/judiciary-launches-vulnerability-disclosure-  program.  A national or  European CVD policy  could help  organisations and  public administrations  set vulnerability  management as a  priority and  encourage security  practices.  https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/10/13/judiciary-launches-vulnerability-disclosure-program https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/10/13/judiciary-launches-vulnerability-disclosure-program  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  14  Lastly, a section of the policy should mention rewards provided to researchers for  finding a vulnerability as this should be the main incentive for researchers to legally  report their findings (subject covered in Section 4).  • Transparency of national CVD policies. While organisations tend to invest more  resources in developing CVD policies, information presented in them sometimes  remains high-level and not precise enough. Industry players pointed out that the policy  should present its objectives, scope, IT tools and disclosure process. To set the  scope, it is necessary to define which IT infrastructure will be exposed to security  researchers (external stakeholders) or submitted to the verification of the internal  security team only. ‘Website vulnerabilities’ (publicly exposed) are often discovered by  external researchers, while ‘infrastructure vulnerabilities’ that are rather managed  internally for confidentiality purposes. Lastly, industry players emphasised that having  a defined vulnerability equity process (VEP) is a recommended practice whenever a  national/ governmental entity is involved in the disclosure procedure.  • Coherence of national CVD policies. Any CVD policy developed at EU, national or  organisational level (by private companies) should be coherent with already existing  initiatives mainly present in the industry; in other words, it shouldn’t overlap with or  contradict any other policy (e.g., general data protection regulation 10). Additionally,  the revised NIS directive11 and the proposed cyber resilience act will both cover  aspects related to CVD policies. Therefore, policy makers should take a holistic  approach and ensure coherence among these initiatives. Additionally, ENISA and the  European Commission may agree and document an EU governance, the ownership  of CVD issues and the roles of these EU institutions.  Although not a part of the CVD ecosystem, other important aspect to consider is ‘government  vulnerability disclosure’ (GVD). As opposed to a CVD policy which may involve multiple  parties and is usually made public, GVD means “internal policymaking structures that  governments need to implement in order to adequately assess and weight the potential costs  and benefits of immediately disclosing knowledge of previously unidentified cybersecurity  vulnerabilities, versus retaining that knowledge based upon carefully considered and time-  limited justifications”12. Together with the notion of GVD stands the Vulnerability Equity  Process (VEP) allows vulnerabilities to be reviewed and decisions to be made on whether to  share them with affected companies, allowing entities to patch or withhold them for operational  purposes13. More importantly, the VEP process should clearly define the roles and  responsibilities of the parties involved. The main risks associated with GVD while not having a  transparent VEP process are the following:  10 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation).

An independently verified VEP process  ensures that all the benefits and drawbacks of disclosing or not disclosing a  vulnerability are being considered before deciding.  • Leak of government information. There has been a steep increase in vulnerability  information leaks from governments, some of which led to the creation of WannaCry  and NotPetya ransomware. Withholding vulnerability information indefinitely takes  away from the valuable time vendors have to implement fixes and reduce the impact to  industry and society.  • Parallel discovery. Simultaneous vulnerability discovery by researchers is a real  phenomenon14 and it is evident in cases like Spectre and Meltdown. When a  government discovers a vulnerability, it can be assumed that this vulnerability has  been found by other parties as well, potentially leaving consumers, organisations, and  even their own agencies at risk.  Further to the elements of content, format, transparency and coherence, as mentioned by a  consulted representative of a national cybersecurity agency, CVD matters and the creation of a  policy should be set as a priority by governments, however, should not create national silos or  leave some industry sector aside. While a European approach may be seen as the preferred  method, one should note that such a policy or guidelines should remain applicable to all  sectors. Specific sectors such as energy management and supply and underlying critical public  infrastructure may need a particular treatment when dealing with vulnerability management;  setting up a regulatory framework and action plan may become mandatory15. This may require  a reinforced cooperation between ‘Intra-EU’ governments and industry players in the context of  public private partnerships.  Recommendations were also provided by CVD experts on the implementation of such a  national policy.  A collaborative approach between policy makers, industry actors, academia and  researchers should be emphasised at the implementation stage, to ensure an optimal  coverage, an adequate set-up and applicability of the national policy and efficient adoption  among stakeholders. Additionally, industry experts have mentioned the possibility to appoint a  national institution to monitor the adoption and implementation of such a policy, similar to the  way it is done in the United States (US) by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the US implementation, the White House has  given the mandate to OMBs to foster the implementation of CVD policy at federal level. OMBs  specified that the DHS would be the leading agency drafting the text to be re-used and adapted  by each agency. To do so, the DHS used a Binding Operational Directive (CISA)16, which has  the force of law. All federal agencies were obliged to transpose the CVD policy unless they  applied for an exception. Together with this directive, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  14 Herr, T. and Schneier, B., ‘Taking stock: Estimating vulnerability rediscovery’, Belfer Center, July 2017, Available at: https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/taking-stock-estimating-vulnerability-rediscovery  15 Peter Firstbrook, Sam Olyaei, Pete Shoard, Katell Thielemann, Mary Ruddy, Felix Gaehtgens, Richard Addiscoott, William Candrick, ‘Top Trends in Cybersecurity 2022’, Gartner report,  February 2022.  16 CISA, ‘Binding Operational Directive 22-01- Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities‘, Regulation, November 2021.

In addition to allocating roles among vulnerability management governmental actors, this  type of directive could aim at fostering trust and transparency among actors by separating  offensive functions (e.g., military, cyber defence) from digital security agencies and ENISA, and  establishing transparent processes regarding how the government handles vulnerability  information. This aspect was also emphasised by the OECD when mentioning the offensive  roles of governments19. Some governments’ ambiguity on vulnerability management can  undermine other stakeholders’ trust and the effectiveness of national policies to promote CVD.  For this reason, most stakeholders could be suspicious when reporting such vulnerabilities.  Therefore, from some non-governmental stakeholders’ point of view, governments should  demonstrate that they are trusted counterparties. One way to do this would be to transparently  inform on the separation of the government’s defensive and offensive functions at institutional  level when dealing with CVD.  In the implementation of national policies it is equally important to raise awareness and  educate top management of organisations within the industry. Decision makers should be  aware and trained on the issue in order to smooth the adoption of CVD practices that are  aligned with the national policy and define a solid governance around vulnerability  management. This top-down approach should help change mindsets through trainings  exercises, the promotion of CVD good practices and awareness raising addressed to all  stakeholders. Final users should be trained and informed on how to benefit from it and  understand its value-added.  2.4 CHALLENGES FACED WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A  NATIONAL COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY  Among the 13 industry actors and experts in CVD consulted in the context of this study, a total  of nine stakeholders have replied to questions by providing several answers, each regarding  challenges faced when developing and implementing a national CVD policy. Figure 3 presents  the list of challenges that were the most frequently encountered by stakeholders when  developing and implementing CVD policies.  17 CISA, Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Template.

Interviewees (N=9).  The lack of legal framework and therefore no clear guidance in terms of cooperation among  actors at national and EU level is the most important challenge. This challenge also generates  uncertainties for national policy makers when framing the legal protection provided to security  researchers (covered in Section 4 of this report).  With regard to lack of financial resources, the budget dedicated to IT systems or products  security tends to be significantly lower than the one allocated to development and innovation.  Moreover, this budget is usually dedicated to operational tasks, i.e., report treatment and triage  of vulnerabilities. However, it is rarely used to write policies or guidelines or to train employees  on CVD-related topics, such as ‘security-by-design’, or develop advanced (and automated)  solutions to deal with reported vulnerabilities. Consequently, this results in other pain points  related to insufficient human capital and expertise. Indirectly, this also affects the rewards  attributed to researchers who usually target monetary compensations for their findings.  The lack of human capital and expertise are often interdependent, and both affect the  efficient management of operational tasks on dealing with vulnerabilities and the production of a  policy. As developing a CVD policy is not seen as a priority, staff and experts are not trained for  it and are often allocated to other activities. While Subject Matter Experts for writing the section  linked to technical topics on CVD may be available, the complexity appears when writing legal  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  18  information which require layers and particular legal expertise. As opposed to national  cybersecurity agencies that may have the capacity to involve lawyers to discuss legal questions  and produce the legal content of the policy, private organisations may struggle due to their  limited network and/or insufficient financial resources. In both public and private entities, staff in  charge of triage and vulnerability management are often not enough to efficiently process all the  reports received from researchers; this resulting into frustration on the reporters’ side and higher  risk due to pending untreated vulnerabilities. Due to limited human resource capacities, any  CVD policy and process becomes difficult to achieve and scale.  Another challenge pointed out by industry players was the unclear cooperation and  governance among EU institutions. Together with a vulnerability disclosure policy,  governments should define how industry, governments and EU institutions should collaborate,  define the dependencies and information management (e.g. access and retention), hence the  importance of having a clear VEP in place (Section 3.3). This VEP is necessary for industry  players to benefit from a stable, secure and framed environment in which roles and  responsibilities are clearly defined. Additionally, this transparency should support the effort to  create ‘capacity building’ among EU countries, private actors and international institutions, as  pointed out by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany, in 2021  in the report entitled ‘Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2021’20.  Lastly, a national CVD policy should be created and implemented by considering the underlying  IT infrastructure used by states and private actors. Experts pointed out issues linked to  inadequate IT systems and old-fashioned infrastructure that represent a barrier to the  implementation of automated CVD processes. This issue tends to complicate the vulnerability  treatment procedure and often leads to manual processing of vulnerability-related tasks, which  is time-consuming.  This list of challenges mentioned above is not exhaustive. Among others, there is rather low  attractiveness for security researchers to report vulnerabilities in a controlled manner. If  reporting is perceived as a cumbersome or risky process, the researchers may opt for a form of  full disclosure of their findings or forgo the disclosure entirely. In extreme cases, they might  favour ‘grey or illegal markets’21. This could be partially explained by the insufficient legal  protection for security researchers when legally reporting vulnerabilities, which is a gap that  a regulatory framework could fill. This notion is covered in more detail in the next Section.  20 Federal Ministry of the Interior Building and Community of Germany, ‘Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2021’, 2021.

ADDRESSING LEGAL  CHALLENGES FOR SECURITY  RESEARCHERS  3.1 CONTEXT  An integral part of national CVD policies is the legal protection of security researchers and the  provision of incentives for the legal reporting of vulnerabilities. This section focuses on  identifying legal barriers for security researchers. The fragmentation of the legal and policy  ecosystem with regard to vulnerability disclosure results in concrete challenges, if not  constraints, for researchers who are interested in reporting vulnerabilities through legal  channels and willing to do so. This observation has been widely documented by ENISA in the  2021 report on CVD and partially covered also by the previous section (Section 3).  Contributions from consulted industry players come as illustrative examples based on an  industry perspective together with the desk research conducted.  To address this objective, the research focused on three main areas:  1. incentives for security researchers to legally report vulnerabilities;  2. disincentives for security researchers to legally report vulnerabilities;  3. initiatives addressing the lack of legal protection for security researchers.  3.2 INCENTIVES FOR SECURITY RESEARCHERS TO LEGALLY REPORT  VULNERABILITIES  In the attempt to have a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons why vulnerabilities  are reported through legal channels once they are discovered, perspectives and experiences  shared by industry actors pointed towards a variety of incentives.  The primary incentive regards notoriety, as security researchers hope for reputational gains  from their discoveries and related disclosures. Notoriety can also result in concrete outcomes  like professional references, letters of appreciation for university studies, or job offers.  Identifying vulnerabilities requires expertise and time, for which researchers want to be properly  valued and acknowledged.  A similarly important, but almost contrasting incentive, is the legal protection of the researcher.  With clarity guaranteed, protection by reporting a vulnerability through legal channels motivates  many researchers to favour this route over illegal channels22. In a sometimes uncertain legal  context, ensuring that ethical hacking activities do not expose researchers to further legal risks  22 FIRST, ‘Guidelines and practices for multi-party vulnerability coordination and disclosure. Version 1.1’, 2020. Available at: https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vulnerability-  coordination/multiparty/guidelines-v1.1  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  20  is seen as necessary. Researchers should be aware of their rights, protections and limits  regarding ‘coordinated disclosure’ to avoid navigating the risks of legal suits. Criminal charges  are a serious consequence that all researchers should be aware of when operating in this  space.  Regarding ethical behaviour, there is also an honest interest in making the overall IT  ecosystem safer, without looking for additional gains, even though this does not represent the  driving factor all the time. Some researchers or professionals show ‘good faith’ intentions to  improving the state of the internet or the IT environment at large.  The role played by financial incentives represented an interesting aspect of this inquiry.  Diverging opinions among consulted experts emerged though. On one hand, many researchers  invest time in discovering and reporting vulnerabilities in exchange for monetary rewards; on the  other hand, it was also argued that if money was such a determinant factor, the ‘illegal market’  (i.e., reselling vulnerabilities illegally) would provide greater financial rewards. Addressing the  topic of vulnerability disclosure as a whole would not do justice to the history of this sub-field,  recalling the long-lasting battle fought by some researchers to be more recognised, better  legally protected and better valued for their work, exemplified by the ‘No More Free Bugs’  campaign23. However, despite the information around the illegal market and vulnerabilities rates  remaining opaque and incomplete, there has been sufficient research to show that much  greater gains can be achieved through illegal channels24.  Lastly, research and investigation represent an additional stimulus for many researchers to  pursue vulnerabilities. Researchers chase the intellectual challenge derived from looking for  and eventually discovering vulnerabilities and the learning opportunity to further advance  one’s knowledge and expertise. This is ultimately in line with recurring trends within IT and  cyber communities, where a deep curiosity for figuring out how systems work and in solving  complex problems pushed through a continuous learning and exploration process.  Unanimously, the target consultations highlighted the subjectivity of these incentives,  struggling to identify one single explanation valid for all types of researchers. In other words,  intrinsic motivations depend on each individual and vary across the spectrum, urging  policy makers and organisations’ legal departments to consider and address a handful of  incentives and avoid focusing only on one or two primary drivers.  3.3 DISINCENTIVES PREVENTING LEGAL REPORTING OF  VULNERABILITIES  While vulnerability reporting may be driven by multiple incentives, at the same time, some  factors might disincentivise researchers and professionals from reporting discovered  vulnerabilities legally. Six potential disincentives were reported by consulted industry players.  23 Fisher, D. (2009), ‘No more free bugs for software vendors’, Threat Post, March 2009. Available at:  https://threatpost.com/no-more-free-bugs-software-vendors-032309/72484/  24 Perlroth, N., This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends – The cyberweapons arms race, 2021.  Reputational  interests are a key  driver for researchers  to legally report  vulnerabilities, as the  public proof of  vulnerability  discovery and  disclosure brings  fame and recognition.  https://threatpost.com/no-more-free-bugs-software-vendors-032309/72484/  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  21  The primary reason discouraging the legal disclosure of vulnerabilities concerns the insufficient  legal protection and potential exposure to legal suits. This finding aligns with the existing  research showing the legal challenges that researchers still face (see the 2021 ENISA CVD  study and as OECD’s “Encouraging Vulnerability Treatment” report25). However, this might  seem in contrast with what was described in the previous section concerning the incentive to  report vulnerabilities legally, namely legal protection (see Section 4.2); the divergences between  different jurisdictions might explain this contradiction. In countries where researchers do not risk  facing legal consequences, the formal protection offered by ethical disclosure might look like a  convincing incentive (e.g. the Netherlands), as opposed to countries where there is no  protection in place.  Analysing this argument more in depth, two interesting points are worth observing. The issue  regards the insufficient legal protection and the lack of clarity around the legal framework,  which results in uncertainty and confusion due to unclear policies, undefined responsibilities or  unknown legal thresholds. In some situations, researchers are discouraged simply by the fact  that they cannot get around the complications of the legal systems and the unclear  requirements. Alternatively, a legal framework might indeed exist, but researchers may not be  aware of it and therefore cannot make mindful decisions about their actions. These instances  show two clear areas for policy intervention in the future.  When vulnerabilities are indeed disclosed, ensuring that the handling process is managed  properly can have an impact, as often highlighted by best practices as guidelines26. Inefficient  or missing follow-up and monitoring deter future reporting, as it seems that the case is not  taken seriously and acted upon in a timely manner. There is consensus on the significance of  managing processes and stakeholders effectively and efficiently, both among Subject Matter  Experts and previously published research27 28, which can be as important as developing  secured patches.  Likewise, administrative complications were reported as significant elements as well. Poor  communication among stakeholders involved in vulnerability reporting (i.e., delayed, unclear,  or totally absent responses) is a reason for not engaging in legal disclosures, as highlighted  also by publications from other prominent institutions covering this topic, such as the OECD29  and FIRST30. The administrative burden, due to the heavy reporting process, together with  the fact that most researchers are not used to or not comfortable interacting directly with  authorities, should be taken into consideration. Even though these aspects can be seen as  marginal, attention is required to implement the needed improvements in the vulnerability  disclosure process.  25 OECD, Encouraging Vulnerability Treatment: Overview for policy makers, OECD Digital Economy Papers, February 2021, Available at: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/0e2615ba-  en.pdf?expires=1662479285&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=7FDB7BA1D2905EAA43C2CD596A293D40  26 .

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  22  3.4 INITIATIVES ADDRESSING THE LACK OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS  The lack of legal protection has been addressed through two types of initiatives, touching upon  both concrete legal measures and awareness-raising measures.  Firstly, national cybersecurity agencies have been working on campaigns and projects meant  to further develop an ethical culture of responsible and coordinated disclosure of  vulnerabilities, such as ANSSI31. For instance, in November 2020, in the context of its  cooperation with the OEDC, ANSSI has confirmed its willingness to strengthen cooperative  efforts towards (i) ensuring security of products and services seen as a crucial issue for the  digital security of companies, citizens and administrations and (ii) improving responsible  vulnerability management, with the objective of strengthening digital security as a means of  stabilising cyberspace32.  Secondly, guidelines and judicial interpretations aim to better define the approach and the  boundaries of legal actions between ethical hacking and unauthorised, illegal compromises  and breaches, undertaken either by cybersecurity institutions or by judicial branches, like in the  US33.  In addition, the following good practices34 should be taken into considerations when addressing  legal barriers:  • ensure open, clear, and timely communication;  • develop clear CVD policies, being used as a contractual agreement between the  organisations and researchers;  • clarify expectations from the organisation that owns the CVD policy and programme,  • clarify legal protections for security researchers;  • train public institutions on CVD to not only restrict CVD to the private sector;  • promote education for all stakeholders involved in CVD vulnerability management  (and not only) ethical hackers;  • trigger national policy adaptations to allow security researchers to report vulnerability  in a safe legal and IT environment – this may come from a common policy developed  and implemented at EU level.  31 Agence National de la sécurité des systèmes d’information, ANSSI France, https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/  32 French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems, ‘L’ANSSI continue de s’investir dans les travaux de l’appel de Paris à l’OCDE’, ANSSI news, November 2020.

ADDRESSING  COLLABORATIVE  CHALLENGES: THE USE OF  OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE  AND BUG-BOUNTY  PROGRAMS  4.1 OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE – OSS  4.1.1 Context  When it comes to vulnerability discovery and disclosure, effective collaboration between  stakeholders and affected parties is essential. However, this is often challenging, especially in  the case of OSS where the lines of responsibility are sometimes blurred.  This section presents information obtained throughout desk research, along with the  contributions of industry experts and other actors such as open-source association  representatives. This section focuses on the following areas:  1. vulnerabilities’ impact, management and treatment within OSS;  2. usage of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) within the context of OSS;  3. governance to apply under the perspective of OSS (relating mainly to the attribution of  responsibility for vulnerabilities);  4. instances of OSS vulnerabilities within public and private organisations.  4.1.2 Vulnerabilities’ impact, management and treatment within OSS  In 2019, the average IT application consists of 70% open-source components which has  doubled when compared to 5 years ago35 (36% of open source code present in IT products in  201536). The product supply chain has become more complex as it includes codes from diverse  authors, sources and natures (open source and proprietary). Consequently, developers, public  and private organisations and product final users tend to hardly be aware of their risk exposure  and whether their IT infrastructure is affected or not by a disclosed vulnerability. The most-  frequently mentioned workaround by consulted CVD experts relies on the usage of a software  bill of material (SBOM) and/or software composition analysis (SCA)37 (defined in Section 5.3).  35 Carielli, S., DeMartine, A., Bongarzone, M. and Dostie, P., ‘Now tech: Software composition analysis, Q2 2021’, Forrester Overview, April 2021.  36 Carielli, S., DeMartine, A., Bongarzone, M. and Lynch, D., ‘The state of application security, 2021’, Forrester Overview, March 2021.  37 See footnote 35  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  24  With this in mind, most industry actors consulted in the context of this study commonly agreed  that the distinction between OSS and proprietary software is questionable.  In this sense, on one hand, when it comes to vulnerability treatment, OSS code tends to be  present in all commercial software (as shown in the case of Log4j38). When a vulnerability is  discovered in software code, the priority should be to fix it via a collaborative approach,  regardless of the nature of the software. On the other hand, the distinction between OSS and  proprietary software could make sense when it comes to governance and mainly  accountability and responsibility for the vulnerability. For a commercial software, the owner  of the impacted code is the product manufacturer which has the responsibility to fix the  vulnerability (easily identifiable). For OSS, identifying the code owner and/or the ‘adequate  person to contact’ to manage the vulnerability becomes more complicated as anybody is free to  publish, use and edit the code.  Diverging opinions related to vulnerability management in OSS co-exist among stakeholders  involved in CVD. On one side, some experts claim that vulnerabilities in OSS should be easier  to cope with via the above-mentioned cooperating approach on finding a fix. Projects such as  Alpha Omega initiatives39 aiming to handle vulnerabilities both in the OSS domain and in the  commercial one have proven their efficiency. Additionally, OSS is truly public whereas  proprietary software may not always be fully transparent on its vulnerabilities. This insufficient  transparency could potentially lead to a limited disclosure of vulnerabilities, hence resulting in a  less secured use of digital tools. On the other side, other experts tend to favour the usage of  proprietary components or products by stating that the open and publicly disclosure of OSS  vulnerabilities may lead to further exploitations and hence create a more dangerous  ecosystem.  Along the lines of the OECD when advising on how to ‘overcome co-ordination complexity’40,  most consulted experts agreed to say that with OSS being present in software produced and  used worldwide, there should be an international (or at least EU) coordination effort on the  management of vulnerabilities. This might be the role for ENISA or the European Commission  (covered in Section 8) to facilitate information sharing, and support the implementation of joint  procedures between Member States. The US Department of Defence recently held a large  industry meeting and published a memo41 touching upon vulnerability management in OSS.  This helped in getting a larger of pool of experts from different profiles into the discussion.  In 2020, the European Commission has launched its open-source strategy, aiming at  recognising and benefiting from the potential of open-source products and components within  EU IT innovations. This was recognised as an important step for the EU institution toward the  uptake and promotion of OSS. As part of this strategy, the Commission has emphasised that  any open-source code used in the context of this EC strategy to produce IT tools would be  38 Weaver, N., ‘What’s the deal with the Log4Shell security nightmare?’, Lawfare, December 2021.

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  25  submitted to systematic vulnerability scanning42. In the frame of this strategy, the EC has  launched a BBP (described in Section 7.5) for open-source solutions used by public services43.  4.1.3 Usage of ‘software bill of materials’ within the context of OSS  Risks due to attacks of software used in public and private organisations are becoming  significant enough to consider new mitigating approaches that involve more than risk-based  vendor/partner segmentation and scoring. These measures should focus more on requests for  evidence of security controls and secure best practices, a shift to a resilience-based thinking,  and other efforts44. SBOMs have emerged as a key building block in software security and  software supply chain risk management. An SBOM is defined by the CISA45 as a nested  inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components.  Over the past years, multiple regional and governmental institutions and industry organisations  have promoted the usage of SBOMs in security practices and software design and  development. According to the European Telecommunication Standard Institute (ETSI),  organisations should consider security management already at the product design and  development phases, and encourage the usage of the SBOMs46. Along these lines, in the EU at  national level, the German Federal Office for Information Security has recommended the  adoption of the SBOM of part of their national guidelines47. Similarly, the White House has  published an ‘Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity’ (May 2021) which  emphasises the importance of transparency and traceability when using open-source code and  promotes the use of the SBOM too. Lastly, the report produced by the Open Foundation, titled  ‘The Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan48, provides 10 concrete  recommendations including automation efforts, security by design and the utilisation of the  SBOM.  From a reporting perspective the SBOM could be perceived as an advanced version of a ‘static  registry or database’ of IT systems in an organisation. Applying the SBOM for OSS is seen as  complex due to the variety and numerous versions of codes later re-used in different IT  products. Nonetheless, a SBOM could be used at the scale of an organisation that has an in-  depth understanding of its IT infrastructure (‘know your asset’). With this, the SBOM can be  created to show interdependencies between IT products and elements within an entity.  Targeting similar objectives to the SBOM, the ‘Software Composition Analysis’ (SCA) was  presented in a Forrester article entitled ‘Now tech: Software composition analysis, Q2 2022’49.

Going beyond the  software components, this tool offers interesting capabilities to cope with versions issues along  with workarounds on how to better define remediating actions.  4.1.4 Governance under the perspective of OSS  When talking about governance for vulnerabilities found in OSS, the focus is placed on the  responsibility, liability and accountability of such an event.  • Responsibility refers to the obligation to perform the task or comply with the rule.  • Accountability implies answerability for the outcome of the task or process.  • Liability is the state of being legally responsible for something.  With these definitions in mind, industry experts confirmed that clear and standardised  guidelines should be produced in order to define these three notions and guide  governments and private organisations in the development of their policies. Responsibility may  be distinct from liability. In this case, developers would not be liable for code they openly  shared. This public code would be accepted as a common infrastructure and the response to a  vulnerability found on the latter should be a public effort – liability would not be put on the  developer (or its company). On the contrary, the liability may be put on the commercial  companies relying on OSS that produce and design products based on open source codes  while knowing that the code is affected by a vulnerability but deciding not to patch it. A gap  remains when it comes to allocating accountability to an individual or an entity.  4.1.5 Instances of OSS vulnerabilities within public and private  organisations  In Italy, a catalogue of OSS50 used by public administration was created by the Agency for  Digital Italy) and the Digital Transformation Department. Each public administration has the  obligation to store the purchased and used OSS in this library. However, software is not always  regularly maintained by public administrations that are often unaware of technical dependencies  on other IT products. In the past, several public administrations have been attacked with the  same exploit due to interdependencies of IT systems. Due to an insufficient knowledge of its IT  system, the Italian public administration was unable to implement automation or rapidly identify  risks on IT infrastructure when a vulnerability was reported. On top of being risky, this has  pointed out a limit of the OSS catalogue. Another issue is that an OSS may be recorded once in  this catalogue, however future software or code versions are rarely encoded.  An instance of a successful story of OSS in the Italian public administration51 relies on a public  administration which had released its software based on the Italian OSS catalogue prerequisites  and on guidelines on the acquisition and reuse of OSS52 published by the Agency for Digital  Italy and Team Digital. The system integrator did face a vulnerability. Because the software was  50 AGID and Digital Transformation Department, ‘Catalogue of OSS‘.

Needless to say, that this is also a danger as  somebody with malicious intentions could have exploited the vulnerability openly shared to the  public.  In this effort of clarifying roles and action when reporting a vulnerability, an article entitled  ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source’53 was published by an IT service  management company, so to guide security research within multi-party cooperation when  dealing with vulnerability in open-source products.  4.2 CONSIDERATIONS ON OUTSOURCING SECURITY VIA BUG BOUNTY  PROGRAMMES  4.2.1 Context  This section focuses on considerations of bug bounty programmes (BBPs) combined with  security-by-design practices. BBPs are dedicated programmes where security researchers  and professionals can submit vulnerabilities they have discovered, in exchange for a  compensation. Findings obtained through desk research were compared and combined with  outcomes of a focus group, for the sake of identifying areas of agreement and disagreement,  trends and shared experiences among experts in this field. Additionally, inputs collected on bug  bounties during further interviews were also included whenever they were deemed it relevant.  This section focuses on the following research areas:  • structure of BBPs;  • security-by-design;  • BBPs challenges;  • BBPs in public administrations;  • evolution of BBPs;  • ENISA’s role in BBPs.  4.2.2 Structure of bug bounty programmes  While various sources have studied BBPs and their variations, some key concepts are worth  reiterating54 55 56 57. Most BBPs are set up and structured around the following foundational  parameters.  53 Gariché, N., ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source projects’, Github, February 2022.

What goals are foreseen by the organising entity58 (e.g., outsourcing  vulnerability research, reinforcing the security posture of the company, providing more  transparency)?  • Scope. Which part(s) of the IT infrastructure will be exposed within the BBP  (qualitative scope definition)?  • Number of IT assets. How many assets will the BBPs cover at its outset and what  additional assets will potentially be included at a later stage (quantitative scope  definition)?  • Participants. Who will be involved in the BPP (external stakeholders to the organising  entity or internal experts from the company security team, or a combination of the two  types of actors)?  • Timeframe. How long will the BBP will last for?  • Rewards. What are the nature and value of the rewards given to security researchers  as a compensation for their findings (usually financial, but not necessarily)?  • Communication channels. How will researchers, the organising entity, and any  intermediary will communicate?  Once a BBP is set-up, it is fundamental for the organising entity to be ready to handle (address  and patch) vulnerabilities and manage required operational tasks. Practically, this means that  the organisation should anticipate the workload generated by the reception of vulnerability  reports by its security team and allocated resources accordingly. Dealing with a vulnerability  (including reception of the report, analysis of the issue, treatment of the vulnerability,  interactions with reporters and publication of a patch) should be done in a timely manner.  A good way to reduce the initial load of expected reports is, before launching the BBP, to  perform a self-assessment of the assets in scope with commonly available tools or services.  This way, it is likely that a large percentage of the existing vulnerabilities will be identified and  managed even before the BBP programme officially starts.  Concerning the distinction between internally and externally managed BBPs, larger  companies tend to rely relying on internal security teams, in order to have full control over the  reports. While offering many benefits in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and scalability,  external BBPs indeed bring other types of challenges, such as a lower level of control over  vulnerability information, higher risk of a data breach, the possibility that data is stored outside  of the EU, and limitations regarding the publication of vulnerabilities at any point. Besides legal  and contractual limitations, it is important to reiterate that the set-up of a BBP must guarantee  confidentiality, as it relies on multi-stakeholder trust.  There exist different types of BBP programmes, including three main models59:  58 By ‘organising entity’, we mean an organisation which has decided to run a BBP on its own IT infrastructure.  59 A detailed break-down of types of BBPs was not the primary of objective of this research. For this reason, a simplified distinction has been offered. However, a detailed view can be found  here: Algorithmic Justice League, BUG BOUNTIES FOR ALGORITHMIC HARMS?, January 2022. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f4hVwQNiwp13zy62wUhwIg84lOq0ciG_/view  The setup of a BBP  has to follow a well- defined structure,  built on an existing  solid IT security  posture, and a  gradual path to  ensure a proper  management of  vulnerability  disclosure.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  29  • Closed BBPs are invitation-based programmes involving a restricted number of  researchers who are selected and invited to participate exclusively by the organising  entity.  • Hybrid BBPs are registration-based programmes, involving interested researchers  who can freely register and are then vetted by the organising entity before  participating.  • Open BBPs are public programmes, involving any interested researcher willing to  participate.  Notwithstanding the differences that each programme can offer, different types of BBP can be  more apt for different organisations. To make a conscious decision, pros and cons and trade- offs of each model need to be considered by the organising entity. On one hand, highly  secure organisations might initially favour closed BBPs, given the higher level of control that  these provide, perhaps considering moving on to different models, or different variations, as the  organisation’s experience with BBPs matures. On the other hand, open programmes provide  greater visibility, offering a brand image based on ‘trust and safety’ to the organisation. These  programmes also allow to draw on a large pool of researchers with their unique skills and  ultimately bring value to the security posture of the organising entity, despite the effort and  resources needed to manage these larger programmes.  4.2.3 Security-by-design  There is a general consensus on the fact that BBPs and security-by-design should be seen  as complementary concepts ultimately improving the security of the IT ecosystem. Involving  researchers and developers more and more in BBPs should help foster security-by-design, as  awareness is raised regarding security issues. Increasing interactions between these actors  involved in products’ supply chain should result in a virtuous cycle. Additionally, the more  vendors and software manufacturers are involved in such programmes, the safer the overall  ecosystem becomes.  In parallel, it should be noted that adopting a ‘security-by-design’ approach brings challenges.  For instance, a different approach and mindset for software development and the need to adapt  the development practices might generate additional costs (e.g., implementation, training,  human resource, consulting services). In the infancy of a security programme, implementing a  secure software development lifecycle (SSDL) should remain the priority, followed by a further  evaluation of the benefits of BBPs to ensure products security.  The inherent tension between these two perspectives might be reconciled moving forward,  embracing the best results of both approaches. Most professionals in the field tend to see BBPs  as sustainable solutions thanks to their contribution to the market consolidation by creating  trust, ensuring safety and raising awareness among actors. Alternatively, bug bounties are  sometimes seen as an ‘add-on’ to an organisation’s security programme, rather than a  sustainable unique solution to address root causes.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  30  Despite the growing interest in BBPs over the last few years, no security expert has claimed that  BBPs can be the be-all and end-all solution to security vulnerabilities for any organisation, but  rather an important component of a much larger and articulated architecture, which should  include security-by-design.  4.2.4 Bug bounty programmes in public administrations  Public administrations face significant challenges in the establishment of BBPs with financial  rewards due to legal limitations and limited budgets. Nonetheless, there are already examples  to draw from, both focused directly on public administrations’ systems, such as the Hack the  Pentagon60 and Hack U.S.61, and focused on open-source software, such as the European  Commission programme62 launched in early 2022. These initiatives shows that BBPs are  possible even for public organisations, despite existing constraints or hesitations.  An important point when looking at the varied public administration systems among EU Member  States is that ENISA should follow a systematic approach when guiding public administration in  their BBP strategy. This method should avoid confusion, as decisions cannot be left to single  agencies or individuals, with the risk of ending up with a fragmented system. The reference  case in this context comes from the US federal system, where the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) required all public agencies to establish VDP through the  Binding Operational Directive (BOD 20-01), issued by the US., in support of the Office of  Management and Budget M-20-32, ‘Improving Vulnerability Identification, Management, and  Remediation’. This led to establishing best practices across the sector and triggering the VDP  adoption even within the private sector.  In line with the observed trends within public administration and stakeholders’ feedback, it is  reasonable to expect a continued growth in the adoption of BBPs by public  administrations worldwide. Always following a risk-based approach, the priority tends to  initially be on critical infrastructure. Nonetheless, each public administration is left with the  choice to implement the BBP strategy according to its specific objectives, needs and IT assets.  4.2.5 Bug bounty programmes challenges  As further BBPs are set up, it is worth noting that main BBPs challenges faced by organisations  who already gained significant experience, including:  • difficult identification of IT assets owners and unclear guidelines on how to define who  is responsible for fixing vulnerabilities;  • insufficient communication between researchers reporting vulnerabilities,  organisations’ developers, and organisations’ security teams;  • limited resources allocated to security teams, as opposed to development and  research,  60 Hackerone, ‘Hack the Pentagon’ Available at: https://www.hackerone.com/hack-the-pentagon. ‘”Hack the Pentagon” pilot programme opens for registration’, March 2016.

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  31  • unwillingness of private organisations to publicly disclose vulnerabilities;  • insufficient resources provided by national governments to support BBPs;  • complex definition of the line between ‘ethical and acceptable practices’ and ‘illegal  and unacceptable practices’ for security researchers.  While solving some of these challenges will require a longer time span, ENISA is well positioned  to provide a substantial contribution either by coordinating the policy debate among all  stakeholders involved or by producing public guidelines to support stakeholders’ progress on  these themes. On one hand, raising public awareness about CVDs and BBPs might result in a  larger budget allocation for such programmes and initiatives at the national level; on the other  hand, guidelines can better define certain concepts and points that are still unclear.  4.2.6 Evolution of bug bounty programmes  BBPs have evolved over time, presenting today some significant changes. First, there has been  a shift in acceptance and comfort in having a BBP and in working with the community of  researchers, as more organisations establish, rely on and appreciate the advantages on such  programmes. Second, BBPs have become more focused on the quality, rather than the  quantity of the reported vulnerabilities, which seems to be a natural evolution as programmes  mature. Moreover, BBPs have grown to cover a larger set of IT/digital tools and infrastructure,  thanks to the diversity of researchers’ expertise working under each programme.  In terms of future evolution, there seems to be overall agreement regarding the expected  exponential and sustained growth of the security research community in the next few  years, this triggering safer cooperation among actors. These two trends suggest a strong  basis for BBPs moving forward. Additional elements to consider entail the expansion of BBPs’  scope in the future to cover, for example, algorithmic harm, as pointed out by forward-looking  research in this space63.  63 Algorithmic Justice League, ‘BUG BOUNTIES FOR ALGORITHMIC HARMS?’, January 2022.

ADDRESSING TECHNICAL  CHALLENGES: AUTOMATION  INITIATIVES SUPPORTING  PRIORITISATION AND  TREATMENT OF  VULNERABILITIES  5.1 CONTEXT  An important chapter in vulnerability treatment is the use of automation address technical  challenges and increase efficiency and effectiveness. This chapter aims to collect stakeholders’  contributions regarding automation initiatives that can support the prioritisation and  treatment of vulnerabilities. The content of this section relies on desk research and primary  data collected within a focus group composed of industry experts on CVD from diverse  backgrounds. Information presented in this section is separated into the following two sections:  1. considerations on the usage of automated processes within vulnerability management.  2. CVD tools fostering the usage of automated workflows within vulnerability prioritisation  and treatment.  5.2 AUTOMATED PROCESSES WITHIN VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT  As pointed out in the Gartner report on Top Trends in Cybersecurity’ published in 2022,  ensuring the security of an organisation’s products and infrastructure should come from both the  organisation per se willing to improve its security posture and from security solution providers  that regularly innovates and considers emerging technologies when developing their product  portfolio. Among others, innovative product development, automation and the usage of artificial  intelligence technologies stand out.  As generally agreed by consulted industry players, ‘automation’ initiatives present a high  potential to enhance vulnerability management and are increasingly considered within  organisations. Hence, the more automation can be adopted, the better it is. Nonetheless,  stakeholders pointed out that substituting human in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities may not be  yet possible. Organisations should aim to find the nature of and balance between processes  that could/should be automated (e.g., repetitive tasks of researchers when seeking  vulnerabilities) and could/should be subject to human expertise. For instance, the Alpha  Omega project for OSS has been focusing on this approach and on identifying the criticality of  pieces of software that would need to be overseen by human actions (triaging the vulnerability  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  33  and fixing it rather requires human intervention). Otherwise, there are the risks that (i) new  vulnerabilities might be introduced, or (ii) vulnerabilities may be only partially fixed and  categorised as “fully remediated” while the infrastructure or code remain exposed to risks. Due  to the importance of human knowledge, industry experts commonly agreed that the deskilling  of vulnerability experts64 and security researchers should not be the result of the  automation of phases within vulnerability processes.  With this in mind, automation tends to apply to sourcing and publication rather than  vulnerability analysis or treatment. Automated processes could be restricted to the  reception, filtering, categorisation and acknowledgement of the reports. These phases  present a high potential for automation, as they are time-consuming, with a low value-added  and do not require a lot of expertise for being performed. However, an automated triage would  only be possible with the usage of a standard numbering methodology to classify vulnerabilities;  the CVE numbering method was strongly recommended. This automated referencing was also  touched upon by the ETSI, who recommend that each reported vulnerability should be  automatically assigned a unique reference number to enable researchers and organisations to  track the corresponding ticket65. This approach would enable the creation of an organised  database of all reported vulnerabilities according to an agreed-upon logic and without human  error (example of automation initiative done by the OASIS Common Security Advisory  Framework (CSAF) Technical Committee66, later described in Section 6.3)  5.3 COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE TOOLS FOSTERING  THE USAGE OF AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS WITHIN VULNERABILITY  PRIORITISATION AND TREATMENT  Automation could potentially be used when dealing with scoring. The scoring mechanism  as it is now can be very subjective (e.g., when a vulnerability is rated with a CVSS67 score equal  or higher than 7, it becomes a patching priority. However, distinguishing a vulnerability rated as  a 7 from one rated as a 6.9 is challenging). To cope with this subjectivity, new scoring  frameworks are being developed such as (i) Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization 68  and (ii) Exploit Prediction Scoring System 69. If those three scores could be considered jointly  and in an automated manner, the end result would be perceived as more reliable.  The SBOM is seen as a great tool to automatically identify interdependencies among products  and handle their classification accordingly. Without human intervention, the automated system  would draw a list of all affected software based on data encoded in the SBOM. Depending on  the nature of affected software and severity of the impact (i.e. namely on high-risk  infrastructure), mitigating measures could be put in place to deal with vulnerabilities efficiently.  64 On the issue of delegating threat detection completely to an AI system and its implication for the deskilling of experts, see: CEPS Task Force, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity:  Technology, governance and policy challenges, CEPS, 2021, p. 33.  65 ETSI, ‘Cyber security – Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure’, TR 103 838, January 2022.

SCA tools can inspect source code, software packages, binary files,  containers and more, and correlate this data with known vulnerability databases for automated  discovery. In addition, these tools can automatically create a software bill of materials to further  facilitate any future inspections.  The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) could be used as a complement to the  SBOM to foster automation within vulnerability management. The standard is a replacement of  the CVRF and was created by the OASIS CSAF Technical Committee70. CSAF is currently  ready for testing and implementation and will become an official OASIS standard end of 202271.  CSAF is a JSON based standard that vastly improved the capabilities of its predecessor CVRF  and can be used to share various types of vulnerability information along the supply chain in a  vendor-agnostic format.  Lastly, the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) documents and attestations72 can be  seen as an enhanced version of ‘traditional advisories’ and is perceived by experts as a great  catalyst to automating vulnerability management. VEX documents are machine readable and  are built to support integration into existing and new security management tools, along with  broader vulnerability monitoring mechanisms and systems. In addition, VEX can supplement  SBOM data and can make its use more effective by allowing an immediate assessment of the  exploitability of the vulnerabilities included in a product. The goal of VEX is to support greater  automation across the vulnerability ecosystem in terms of disclosure, vulnerability tracking, and  remediation.  Overall, on top of supporting an efficient vulnerability prioritisation and treatment, such tools  would also favour organisations’ resource management. In this sense, automation may help  to reduce the human workload and/or provide answers that are more specific to a particular  environment. A vulnerability may be critical to one user and/or infrastructure because of its  configuration and environment, yet might be non-critical to another one.  Lastly, the OECD and the White House have shared a similar recommendation73 on the usage  of automated and standardised messages at each stage of the vulnerability treatment among  counterparties. These communications may include status updates, requirements to complete a  vendor’s current stage, next steps, and points of contact for questions, etc. With this,  automation could be an advantage for vendors as automated communication like ‘we know  about the vulnerability and are investigating’ or ‘we are not affected’ can reduce the volume of  calls and emails received via the support hotline, thereby contributing to better management of  resource allocation.  70 OASIS CSAF Technical Committee presentation.

CONCLUSIONS  This report has provided a comprehensive overview of the information collected from consulted  industry players involved in CVD and national policy makers. For each one of the research  areas, the report presents trends, gaps to be offset, recommendations and attention points  mentioned by external stakeholders. These findings are supported by secondary data retrieved  from a literature composed of ENISA reports, EU and international institutions materials, public  administration documentations and private organisation tools and internal policies.  The information was reported with the aim of capturing industry expectations regarding CVD  policies, exploring challenges around CVD policy development, and identifying shared  perspectives and trends, along with areas of disagreements. Subsequently, in-depth analysis  was conducted to provide a better contextual understanding of all components and actors  playing a role in the establishment and development of CVD policies and programmes. In this  sense, reported findings and information sources go beyond the EU ecosystem and include  international references (e.g. US policy initiatives).  Although the research and analysis has tried to focus on a variety of practical and concrete  aspects related to CVD policies, the following main high-level conclusions can be drawn from  the study:  • National CVD policies can be an important example for the industry. The  development of national CVD policies is an important encouragement for industry  organizations to set vulnerability management and security practices as a priority. In  addition, the alignment with existing international standards around CVD, can greatly  contribute to a harmonized approach among all stakeholders.  • The CVD ecosystem remains fragmented. This outcome had already been identified  and described in detail within the ENISA CVD study (2021). The target consultation  carried out in 2022 highlighted industry professionals’ perceptions regarding  heterogeneity of the CVD ecosystem, and a lack of legal certainty in EU Member  States legislative frameworks. There is still an important and mostly unanswered need  to strengthen harmonisation, alignment, coordination, and cooperation between  industry players and governments.  • Education and awareness should be prioritised. Despite the decades-old existence  of vulnerabilities and vulnerability management in cybersecurity, a ‘security-by-default’  product development approach favoured by education and training is still too rarely  observed among developers and product manufacturers. Examples still emerge of  professionals not getting a full understanding of the issues at stake or the potential  solutions available. Therefore, there should be a substantial increase of vulnerability-  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  36  related education and awareness embedded in all levels of any code development or  product manufacturing training courses.  • Legal, economic and technological challenges have been identified and brought  under the spotlight and there is a growing effort to address them. Some of the changes  needed to address the externalities of the vulnerability market require massive work.  Nonetheless, each player can contribute at their own pace, however it needs to be  noted that a legal mandate to address vulnerabilities very likely to come (e.g. with the  CRA). Concrete solutions focusing on well-defined issues with a potential to be scaled  up and expanded into larger initiatives over time will play an equally important role in  moving forward the status quo on vulnerability management.  • Promote ‘security and privacy by design’ ideologies. In many cases it far better to  be proactive and address security as early as possible in the lifecycle of new products.  Significant resources and investment efforts are needed to further promote a security-  by-design approach and mindset such as ‘SecDevOps74’ practices and simply  prioritising security in IT systems at all levels. Integrating security and privacy thinking  from the inception phases of any code development or product manufacturing will likely  have the most significant benefit for the EU in the long run.  74 SecDevOps is a management approach that links security and operations teams in an IT context.

Although interesting approaches and  initiatives are taking place in some EU Member States, yet further steps can be done towards  an integrated EU vision and action.  This report shows that, despite recent efforts by national governments in developing CVD  policies, some industry players have taken the lead and developed vulnerability policies  and programmes at organisation level. Nevertheless, among the top industry expectations is  that the development of a national or European level CVD policy could help organisations and  public administrations to set vulnerability management as a priority and further encourage  security practices. In addition, the alignment of such policies with existing international  standards, can greatly help in promoting harmonization.  As far as vulnerability initiatives are concerned, Bug Bounties Programmes (BBP) is an area  that grew remarkably over the past few years. BBPs have considerably adapted their  business models in offering different type of services, hence different coverages of IT systems  and levels of involvement in vulnerability management processes. Today, BBPs platform  providers are now cooperating with key public institutions to run customised programmes  adapted to their needs and IT infrastructures. Further expansion is expected as long as the  community can continue relying on BBPs (i.e., confidentiality of internal information and data  protection) and ensuring trust between the stakeholders involved.  In terms of human capital, researchers play a fundamental role in the disclosure of  vulnerabilities. Accordingly, it is interesting to understand motivations, incentives and  challenges influencing researchers’ contribution. From their perspective, reputation remains  as a one of the key incentives to legally report vulnerabilities, as it leads to fame and  recognition. However, legal protection is also highly considered, especially because the  absence, uncertainty or non-clarity of legal conditions can push to illegal channels.  Collaborative challenges arise in the use of tools to improve vulnerability disclosure processes.  For example, when looking into vulnerabilities related to open-source software (OSS) and  considering how intertwined commercial and OSS are today, a need to further improve  coordination between OSS developers and private vendors was identified. Aspects such  as OSS vulnerability handling, responsibility and accountability are not yet clearly defined and  among actors involved across the IT product supply chains, which may hinder coordination  efforts.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  7  Challenges related to technical and technological issues also constitute a key area of  discussion and analysis. A forward-looking perspective on the use of automation as an  enabler to efficiently manage vulnerability identification, sourcing and classification is  also provided by this report. It is observed that, as vulnerability analysis and treatment still  require human expertise, the risk of deskilling experts due to automated processes may be  minimised.  Finally, alignment across different legislation as well as cooperation between industry players  and governments are needed to avoid silos. Harmonisation of CVD practices, coordination  and international cooperation among players are essential priorities both from a legal  and technical perspectives. In this regard, ENISA will continue offering advice, publishing  guidelines, promoting information sharing, raising awareness, and coordinating CVD-related  activities at national and EU level.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES  The implementation process of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) programmes in the  EU is taking place in a heterogeneous manner. Yet, whereas a few Member States count on  strategic approaches for the deployment of CVD programmes, some others are showing  progress at different speeds without following a common EU approach. Likewise, within a co-  existence of heterogenous approaches, common challenges have been identified, notably in the  economic, legal, technical and policy dimensions.  The objective of this report is two-fold. First, to gather evidence related to latest developments  and trends linked to the implementation of CVD programmes in the EU, and second, to deeply  analyse current issues faced by public bodies, industry and researchers at the time of deploying  CVD programmes in EU Member States. This report also elaborates on the analysis and  conclusions provided by the ENISA report: ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies in the  EU’1.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The primary target audience of this report is composed by public bodies holding responsibility in  the design and implementation of CVD policies in EU Member States. These entities are  expected to receive and explore showcased outputs, evidence and results, as a result of a  multidisciplinary consultation engaging more than 30 stakeholders. The added value of this  ENISA report lies on the facilitation of a discussion framework that helps to identify common  approaches for the implementation of CVD programmes across the EU.  The secondary target audience for this report is mainly composed by the general cybersecurity  community and entities that are involved in the vulnerability treatment lifecycle, and that can  benefit from the insights, challenges, and good practises identified herein.  1.3  REPORT STRUCTURE  This report includes the following chapters:  National CVD policy implementation – The industry perspective. This chapter explores and  captures the expectations of the industry regarding the implementation of national CVD  programmes and policies.  • 1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-in-the- eu/@@download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-in-the-eu/@@download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policies-in-the-eu/@@download/fullReport  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  9  Addressing legal challenges for security researchers. This chapter addresses legal issues  linked to the engagement of researchers in the disclosure of vulnerabilities. Good practices  oriented to minimise the effect of these issues are also presented and discussed.  Addressing collaborative challenges: The use of open-source software and bug-bounty  programs. In this chapter, collaborative challenges and approaches are analysed, particularly  those related to the use of open-source software and technology. In addition, bug bounty  programmes and initiatives are analysed and put into focus.  Addressing technical challenges: Automation initiatives supporting prioritisation and  treatment of vulnerabilities. This final chapter focuses on technical issues linked to the use of  tools and automated processes to speed up and support the vulnerability disclosure processes  and interactions.  1.4 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  A three-step approach was followed oriented to (i) build an in-depth understanding of the CVD  state of play, (ii) obtain specific data on latest CVD, and finally (iii) draw conclusions and  recommendations useful for policymakers in charge of the design and implementation of CVD  policies and programmes. The three steps are presented below:  1. Desk research. Collection and analysis of findings gathered from available literature. When  selecting the sources, particular attention was given to the relevance, quality and reliability of  sources, their geographical coverage and their pertinence to research scope outlined. To  perform an efficient data analysis, an analytical framework was developed allowing to treat data  in a structured manner.  2. Target consultation. A total of 13 interviewees and 2 focus groups involving more than 30  stakeholders were carried out. Interviewees were invited to answer 25 questions covering  current challenges and future perspectives allowing to take further steps towards a common EU  approach in the implementation of CVD programmes and policies. Two focus groups were  conducted to discuss key aspects linked to use of open source as driver of collaborative  frameworks and relations between CVD and bug bounty programmes.  3. Analysis of findings. By establishing correlations between desk research analysis and  outputs of consultations with stakeholders, the obtained findings were treated in an aggregated  manner. This work has allowed the elaboration of the primary information, and the identification  of trends and evidence showcased in the distinct chapters along the report.  The research and analysis were mostly based on a qualitative approach, enabling to shed light  on real life experiences and testimonials. It also served to identify other areas of analysis that  would help to tackle current identified challenges in this report.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  10  2. NATIONAL CVD POLICY  IMPLEMENTATION – THE  INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE  2.1 CONTEXT  The implementation of national CVD policies is expected to have a significantly positive impact  on security research around vulnerabilities, and their timely discovery, reporting and treatment.  However, there is little doubt that these national frameworks will also have an impact on  industry, as manufacturing becomes highly digitalised and increasingly dependent on  technology, software code, and data.  In this section, the report collects the latest trends and industry stakeholders’ inputs regarding  the development and implementation of national policies within EU Member States. The  section of the report is structured as followed:  1. Assessment and considerations on the creation of a national policy.  2. Good practices when developing and implementing of a CVD policy.  3. Challenges faced when developing and implementing a CVD policy.  To contextualise this part of the report, the study has referred to the findings from the ENISA  study ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies in the EU2’ especially on the CVD policy  state of play in the EU; and enriched these findings with desk research quoted throughout the  study.  2.2 ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL POLICIES  Despite the EU’s strong push towards cyber security within a global digital transformation trend,  the EU market is fragmented among EU Member States. Belgium, France, Lithuania and the  Netherlands are the only four EU Member States with a fully established national CVD policy.

Four other Member States intend to set up a policy. In these cases, a proposal is either being  examined at the level of policymakers or is tested in pilot projects. 10 other EU Member States  are in the process of implementing a national CVD policy or are preparing to do so. However,  failure to reach an agreement at the political or legislative level has slowed down such a process.  Finally, nine Member States have not implemented a CVD policy and the process for establishing  one has not yet started.  Implementation of CVD policy at national level in Europe Figure 2 below presents a mapping of  the state of play in the implementation of CVD policies in the EU Member States. The map  divides countries based on a scale between (1) to (4), where (1) indicates that the country has a  policy in place, and (4) indicates that the countries have no policy in place. The values in  between indicate either that the process of implementing a policy is in progress, or that the  country is just on the brink of implementing one.

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  12  From the mapping of the state of play of CVD implementation, a relative greater maturity can be  seen of western European countries compared to other European regions. Conversely,  southern European countries and central and eastern European countries are rather lagging in  this process.  With this state of play in mind, the EU Member States are encouraged by the European  Commission, Parliament and ENISA to set up national cybersecurity strategies and resilience  programmes, surely including notions and action plans on vulnerability management3. The EU  landscape on CVD may evolve due to the NIS2 directive4 and cyber resilience act5 pointing  out the importance of vulnerability considerations and encouraging EU Member States to take  further action.  Consulted industry experts pointed out that regardless of the existence or not of national policy  actions, industry players (private companies) have already initiated CVD initiatives at  company level. On one hand, most actors involved in vulnerability management see these  private initiatives as an efficient move towards the creation of a safe IT ecosystem. In this  sense, the European Commission encourages private companies to set adequate vulnerability  strategies including mitigation measures in the case that a vulnerability cannot be patched  immediately (e.g. due to requiring testing before deploying to production environment). The  initiatives should include an appropriate incident response mechanism and guidelines on  information security, business continuity and organisational resilience6.  On the other hand, isolated company initiatives may create heterogeneity among practices  making it more difficult for national governments to harmonise practices within a national policy  on CVD. Along these lines, consulted stakeholders pointed out the importance for policy  makers to consider already implemented industry initiatives on CVD, for instance ISO  standards (ISO/IEC 30111:2019 and ISO/IEC 29147:2018), and may consider sector or  infrastructure-specific standards. The importance of aligning international cooperation,  industries and standards (to minimise the impact on already existing strategies and foster  international exchanges) is also reinforced by the OECD in their report ‘Encouraging  vulnerability treatment’7 which sets guidelines for policymakers on how to define a public policy.  In line with considerations presented in ENISA’s report 2022 on Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure8, ENISA’s role was to facilitate harmonisation and guide EU Member States in  the development and implementation of national policies. This role particularly applies in  support-related activity and the elaboration of CVD guidelines at EU level. The idea would  be to provide governmental entities with guidelines on vulnerability management, dedicated  processes and related responsibilities.

To start with, policy  makers should understand the underlying motivations and barriers faced by stakeholders  involved in CVD. In this sense, policy makers would ensure that the planned objectives of the  national CVD policy cover all stakeholders’ needs and support the creation of a safer digital  environment.  Consulted experts both from industry and national agencies recommended that national CVD  policies should be developed with a particular attention given to content, format, transparency  and coherence.  • Content and format of national CVD policies. The content of a policy should be clear  and written in both the national language of the country and English (for foreign  security researchers). Authors of such a policy should address it to all stakeholders  involved in vulnerability disclosure and should clarify the roles, responsibilities, and  governance within national CVD. Importantly, the necessity of adding a section on the  roles of companies (e.g., code owners, manufacturers), prosecutors, and judges (often  in charge of monitoring lawsuits initiated by organisations on security researchers) was  pointed out. Prosecutors should be careful to examine each case thoroughly, and in  accordance with the applicable CVD policy, before deciding whether to prosecute or  not.  Similarly, due to the nature of their involvement in lawsuits, judges should be aware of  their role and responsibilities and have knowledgeable about the underlying legislation  to conduct trials of security researchers that are being sued by a CVD counterparty. On  this, EU Member States could follow the example of the United States’ ‘Judiciary  Launches Vulnerability Disclosure Program’ (October 2021), which provides clear  guidelines for security researchers on the best way to safely report vulnerabilities9.  Along these lines, industry players emphasised the importance of defining the notion of  ‘responsible disclosure’ which enables security researchers to safely report  vulnerabilities to security teams or other responsible organisations. Another aspect to  be considered is the limit between ‘ethical and unethical’ behaviour (i.e. what is  allowed/not allowed) not only to avoid creating grey areas for researchers when  reporting vulnerabilities but also to support judges in their assessment.  9 Judiciary Launches Vulnerability Disclosure Program, United States Courts, October 2021. Available at: https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/10/13/judiciary-launches-vulnerability-disclosure-  program.  A national or  European CVD policy  could help  organisations and  public administrations  set vulnerability  management as a  priority and  encourage security  practices.  https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/10/13/judiciary-launches-vulnerability-disclosure-program https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2021/10/13/judiciary-launches-vulnerability-disclosure-program  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  14  Lastly, a section of the policy should mention rewards provided to researchers for  finding a vulnerability as this should be the main incentive for researchers to legally  report their findings (subject covered in Section 4).  • Transparency of national CVD policies. While organisations tend to invest more  resources in developing CVD policies, information presented in them sometimes  remains high-level and not precise enough. Industry players pointed out that the policy  should present its objectives, scope, IT tools and disclosure process. To set the  scope, it is necessary to define which IT infrastructure will be exposed to security  researchers (external stakeholders) or submitted to the verification of the internal  security team only. ‘Website vulnerabilities’ (publicly exposed) are often discovered by  external researchers, while ‘infrastructure vulnerabilities’ that are rather managed  internally for confidentiality purposes. Lastly, industry players emphasised that having  a defined vulnerability equity process (VEP) is a recommended practice whenever a  national/ governmental entity is involved in the disclosure procedure.  • Coherence of national CVD policies. Any CVD policy developed at EU, national or  organisational level (by private companies) should be coherent with already existing  initiatives mainly present in the industry; in other words, it shouldn’t overlap with or  contradict any other policy (e.g., general data protection regulation 10). Additionally,  the revised NIS directive11 and the proposed cyber resilience act will both cover  aspects related to CVD policies. Therefore, policy makers should take a holistic  approach and ensure coherence among these initiatives. Additionally, ENISA and the  European Commission may agree and document an EU governance, the ownership  of CVD issues and the roles of these EU institutions.  Although not a part of the CVD ecosystem, other important aspect to consider is ‘government  vulnerability disclosure’ (GVD). As opposed to a CVD policy which may involve multiple  parties and is usually made public, GVD means “internal policymaking structures that  governments need to implement in order to adequately assess and weight the potential costs  and benefits of immediately disclosing knowledge of previously unidentified cybersecurity  vulnerabilities, versus retaining that knowledge based upon carefully considered and time-  limited justifications”12. Together with the notion of GVD stands the Vulnerability Equity  Process (VEP) allows vulnerabilities to be reviewed and decisions to be made on whether to  share them with affected companies, allowing entities to patch or withhold them for operational  purposes13. More importantly, the VEP process should clearly define the roles and  responsibilities of the parties involved. The main risks associated with GVD while not having a  transparent VEP process are the following:  10 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation).

An independently verified VEP process  ensures that all the benefits and drawbacks of disclosing or not disclosing a  vulnerability are being considered before deciding.  • Leak of government information. There has been a steep increase in vulnerability  information leaks from governments, some of which led to the creation of WannaCry  and NotPetya ransomware. Withholding vulnerability information indefinitely takes  away from the valuable time vendors have to implement fixes and reduce the impact to  industry and society.  • Parallel discovery. Simultaneous vulnerability discovery by researchers is a real  phenomenon14 and it is evident in cases like Spectre and Meltdown. When a  government discovers a vulnerability, it can be assumed that this vulnerability has  been found by other parties as well, potentially leaving consumers, organisations, and  even their own agencies at risk.  Further to the elements of content, format, transparency and coherence, as mentioned by a  consulted representative of a national cybersecurity agency, CVD matters and the creation of a  policy should be set as a priority by governments, however, should not create national silos or  leave some industry sector aside. While a European approach may be seen as the preferred  method, one should note that such a policy or guidelines should remain applicable to all  sectors. Specific sectors such as energy management and supply and underlying critical public  infrastructure may need a particular treatment when dealing with vulnerability management;  setting up a regulatory framework and action plan may become mandatory15. This may require  a reinforced cooperation between ‘Intra-EU’ governments and industry players in the context of  public private partnerships.  Recommendations were also provided by CVD experts on the implementation of such a  national policy.  A collaborative approach between policy makers, industry actors, academia and  researchers should be emphasised at the implementation stage, to ensure an optimal  coverage, an adequate set-up and applicability of the national policy and efficient adoption  among stakeholders. Additionally, industry experts have mentioned the possibility to appoint a  national institution to monitor the adoption and implementation of such a policy, similar to the  way it is done in the United States (US) by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the US implementation, the White House has  given the mandate to OMBs to foster the implementation of CVD policy at federal level. OMBs  specified that the DHS would be the leading agency drafting the text to be re-used and adapted  by each agency. To do so, the DHS used a Binding Operational Directive (CISA)16, which has  the force of law. All federal agencies were obliged to transpose the CVD policy unless they  applied for an exception. Together with this directive, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  14 Herr, T. and Schneier, B., ‘Taking stock: Estimating vulnerability rediscovery’, Belfer Center, July 2017, Available at: https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/taking-stock-estimating-vulnerability-rediscovery  15 Peter Firstbrook, Sam Olyaei, Pete Shoard, Katell Thielemann, Mary Ruddy, Felix Gaehtgens, Richard Addiscoott, William Candrick, ‘Top Trends in Cybersecurity 2022’, Gartner report,  February 2022.  16 CISA, ‘Binding Operational Directive 22-01- Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities‘, Regulation, November 2021. Available at: https://www.cisa.gov/binding-  operational-directive-22-01  Global cooperation  across different  legislation as well as  cooperation between  industry players and  governments need to  be strengthened to  avoid silos.  https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/taking-stock-estimating-vulnerability-rediscovery https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01 https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  16  Security Agency (CISA) has made available some guidelines and a vulnerability disclosure  policy (VDP) template17 which has been written to align with Department of Justice’s Framework  for a Vulnerability Disclosure Program for Online Systems18.  In addition to allocating roles among vulnerability management governmental actors, this  type of directive could aim at fostering trust and transparency among actors by separating  offensive functions (e.g., military, cyber defence) from digital security agencies and ENISA, and  establishing transparent processes regarding how the government handles vulnerability  information. This aspect was also emphasised by the OECD when mentioning the offensive  roles of governments19. Some governments’ ambiguity on vulnerability management can  undermine other stakeholders’ trust and the effectiveness of national policies to promote CVD.  For this reason, most stakeholders could be suspicious when reporting such vulnerabilities.  Therefore, from some non-governmental stakeholders’ point of view, governments should  demonstrate that they are trusted counterparties. One way to do this would be to transparently  inform on the separation of the government’s defensive and offensive functions at institutional  level when dealing with CVD.  In the implementation of national policies it is equally important to raise awareness and  educate top management of organisations within the industry. Decision makers should be  aware and trained on the issue in order to smooth the adoption of CVD practices that are  aligned with the national policy and define a solid governance around vulnerability  management. This top-down approach should help change mindsets through trainings  exercises, the promotion of CVD good practices and awareness raising addressed to all  stakeholders. Final users should be trained and informed on how to benefit from it and  understand its value-added.  2.4 CHALLENGES FACED WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A  NATIONAL COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY  Among the 13 industry actors and experts in CVD consulted in the context of this study, a total  of nine stakeholders have replied to questions by providing several answers, each regarding  challenges faced when developing and implementing a national CVD policy. Figure 3 presents  the list of challenges that were the most frequently encountered by stakeholders when  developing and implementing CVD policies.  17 CISA, Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Template.

Interviewees (N=9).  The lack of legal framework and therefore no clear guidance in terms of cooperation among  actors at national and EU level is the most important challenge. This challenge also generates  uncertainties for national policy makers when framing the legal protection provided to security  researchers (covered in Section 4 of this report).  With regard to lack of financial resources, the budget dedicated to IT systems or products  security tends to be significantly lower than the one allocated to development and innovation.  Moreover, this budget is usually dedicated to operational tasks, i.e., report treatment and triage  of vulnerabilities. However, it is rarely used to write policies or guidelines or to train employees  on CVD-related topics, such as ‘security-by-design’, or develop advanced (and automated)  solutions to deal with reported vulnerabilities. Consequently, this results in other pain points  related to insufficient human capital and expertise. Indirectly, this also affects the rewards  attributed to researchers who usually target monetary compensations for their findings.  The lack of human capital and expertise are often interdependent, and both affect the  efficient management of operational tasks on dealing with vulnerabilities and the production of a  policy. As developing a CVD policy is not seen as a priority, staff and experts are not trained for  it and are often allocated to other activities. While Subject Matter Experts for writing the section  linked to technical topics on CVD may be available, the complexity appears when writing legal  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  18  information which require layers and particular legal expertise. As opposed to national  cybersecurity agencies that may have the capacity to involve lawyers to discuss legal questions  and produce the legal content of the policy, private organisations may struggle due to their  limited network and/or insufficient financial resources. In both public and private entities, staff in  charge of triage and vulnerability management are often not enough to efficiently process all the  reports received from researchers; this resulting into frustration on the reporters’ side and higher  risk due to pending untreated vulnerabilities. Due to limited human resource capacities, any  CVD policy and process becomes difficult to achieve and scale.  Another challenge pointed out by industry players was the unclear cooperation and  governance among EU institutions. Together with a vulnerability disclosure policy,  governments should define how industry, governments and EU institutions should collaborate,  define the dependencies and information management (e.g. access and retention), hence the  importance of having a clear VEP in place (Section 3.3). This VEP is necessary for industry  players to benefit from a stable, secure and framed environment in which roles and  responsibilities are clearly defined. Additionally, this transparency should support the effort to  create ‘capacity building’ among EU countries, private actors and international institutions, as  pointed out by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany, in 2021  in the report entitled ‘Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2021’20.  Lastly, a national CVD policy should be created and implemented by considering the underlying  IT infrastructure used by states and private actors. Experts pointed out issues linked to  inadequate IT systems and old-fashioned infrastructure that represent a barrier to the  implementation of automated CVD processes. This issue tends to complicate the vulnerability  treatment procedure and often leads to manual processing of vulnerability-related tasks, which  is time-consuming.  This list of challenges mentioned above is not exhaustive. Among others, there is rather low  attractiveness for security researchers to report vulnerabilities in a controlled manner. If  reporting is perceived as a cumbersome or risky process, the researchers may opt for a form of  full disclosure of their findings or forgo the disclosure entirely. In extreme cases, they might  favour ‘grey or illegal markets’21. This could be partially explained by the insufficient legal  protection for security researchers when legally reporting vulnerabilities, which is a gap that  a regulatory framework could fill. This notion is covered in more detail in the next Section.  20 Federal Ministry of the Interior Building and Community of Germany, ‘Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 2021’, 2021.

ADDRESSING LEGAL  CHALLENGES FOR SECURITY  RESEARCHERS  3.1 CONTEXT  An integral part of national CVD policies is the legal protection of security researchers and the  provision of incentives for the legal reporting of vulnerabilities. This section focuses on  identifying legal barriers for security researchers. The fragmentation of the legal and policy  ecosystem with regard to vulnerability disclosure results in concrete challenges, if not  constraints, for researchers who are interested in reporting vulnerabilities through legal  channels and willing to do so. This observation has been widely documented by ENISA in the  2021 report on CVD and partially covered also by the previous section (Section 3).  Contributions from consulted industry players come as illustrative examples based on an  industry perspective together with the desk research conducted.  To address this objective, the research focused on three main areas:  1. incentives for security researchers to legally report vulnerabilities;  2. disincentives for security researchers to legally report vulnerabilities;  3. initiatives addressing the lack of legal protection for security researchers.  3.2 INCENTIVES FOR SECURITY RESEARCHERS TO LEGALLY REPORT  VULNERABILITIES  In the attempt to have a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons why vulnerabilities  are reported through legal channels once they are discovered, perspectives and experiences  shared by industry actors pointed towards a variety of incentives.  The primary incentive regards notoriety, as security researchers hope for reputational gains  from their discoveries and related disclosures. Notoriety can also result in concrete outcomes  like professional references, letters of appreciation for university studies, or job offers.  Identifying vulnerabilities requires expertise and time, for which researchers want to be properly  valued and acknowledged.  A similarly important, but almost contrasting incentive, is the legal protection of the researcher.  With clarity guaranteed, protection by reporting a vulnerability through legal channels motivates  many researchers to favour this route over illegal channels22. In a sometimes uncertain legal  context, ensuring that ethical hacking activities do not expose researchers to further legal risks  22 FIRST, ‘Guidelines and practices for multi-party vulnerability coordination and disclosure. Version 1.1’, 2020. Available at: https://www.first.org/global/sigs/vulnerability-  coordination/multiparty/guidelines-v1.1  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  20  is seen as necessary. Researchers should be aware of their rights, protections and limits  regarding ‘coordinated disclosure’ to avoid navigating the risks of legal suits. Criminal charges  are a serious consequence that all researchers should be aware of when operating in this  space.  Regarding ethical behaviour, there is also an honest interest in making the overall IT  ecosystem safer, without looking for additional gains, even though this does not represent the  driving factor all the time. Some researchers or professionals show ‘good faith’ intentions to  improving the state of the internet or the IT environment at large.  The role played by financial incentives represented an interesting aspect of this inquiry.  Diverging opinions among consulted experts emerged though. On one hand, many researchers  invest time in discovering and reporting vulnerabilities in exchange for monetary rewards; on the  other hand, it was also argued that if money was such a determinant factor, the ‘illegal market’  (i.e., reselling vulnerabilities illegally) would provide greater financial rewards. Addressing the  topic of vulnerability disclosure as a whole would not do justice to the history of this sub-field,  recalling the long-lasting battle fought by some researchers to be more recognised, better  legally protected and better valued for their work, exemplified by the ‘No More Free Bugs’  campaign23. However, despite the information around the illegal market and vulnerabilities rates  remaining opaque and incomplete, there has been sufficient research to show that much  greater gains can be achieved through illegal channels24.  Lastly, research and investigation represent an additional stimulus for many researchers to  pursue vulnerabilities. Researchers chase the intellectual challenge derived from looking for  and eventually discovering vulnerabilities and the learning opportunity to further advance  one’s knowledge and expertise. This is ultimately in line with recurring trends within IT and  cyber communities, where a deep curiosity for figuring out how systems work and in solving  complex problems pushed through a continuous learning and exploration process.  Unanimously, the target consultations highlighted the subjectivity of these incentives,  struggling to identify one single explanation valid for all types of researchers. In other words,  intrinsic motivations depend on each individual and vary across the spectrum, urging  policy makers and organisations’ legal departments to consider and address a handful of  incentives and avoid focusing only on one or two primary drivers.  3.3 DISINCENTIVES PREVENTING LEGAL REPORTING OF  VULNERABILITIES  While vulnerability reporting may be driven by multiple incentives, at the same time, some  factors might disincentivise researchers and professionals from reporting discovered  vulnerabilities legally. Six potential disincentives were reported by consulted industry players.  23 Fisher, D. (2009), ‘No more free bugs for software vendors’, Threat Post, March 2009. Available at:  https://threatpost.com/no-more-free-bugs-software-vendors-032309/72484/  24 Perlroth, N., This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends – The cyberweapons arms race, 2021.  Reputational  interests are a key  driver for researchers  to legally report  vulnerabilities, as the  public proof of  vulnerability  discovery and  disclosure brings  fame and recognition.  https://threatpost.com/no-more-free-bugs-software-vendors-032309/72484/  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  21  The primary reason discouraging the legal disclosure of vulnerabilities concerns the insufficient  legal protection and potential exposure to legal suits. This finding aligns with the existing  research showing the legal challenges that researchers still face (see the 2021 ENISA CVD  study and as OECD’s “Encouraging Vulnerability Treatment” report25). However, this might  seem in contrast with what was described in the previous section concerning the incentive to  report vulnerabilities legally, namely legal protection (see Section 4.2); the divergences between  different jurisdictions might explain this contradiction. In countries where researchers do not risk  facing legal consequences, the formal protection offered by ethical disclosure might look like a  convincing incentive (e.g. the Netherlands), as opposed to countries where there is no  protection in place.  Analysing this argument more in depth, two interesting points are worth observing. The issue  regards the insufficient legal protection and the lack of clarity around the legal framework,  which results in uncertainty and confusion due to unclear policies, undefined responsibilities or  unknown legal thresholds. In some situations, researchers are discouraged simply by the fact  that they cannot get around the complications of the legal systems and the unclear  requirements. Alternatively, a legal framework might indeed exist, but researchers may not be  aware of it and therefore cannot make mindful decisions about their actions. These instances  show two clear areas for policy intervention in the future.  When vulnerabilities are indeed disclosed, ensuring that the handling process is managed  properly can have an impact, as often highlighted by best practices as guidelines26. Inefficient  or missing follow-up and monitoring deter future reporting, as it seems that the case is not  taken seriously and acted upon in a timely manner. There is consensus on the significance of  managing processes and stakeholders effectively and efficiently, both among Subject Matter  Experts and previously published research27 28, which can be as important as developing  secured patches.  Likewise, administrative complications were reported as significant elements as well. Poor  communication among stakeholders involved in vulnerability reporting (i.e., delayed, unclear,  or totally absent responses) is a reason for not engaging in legal disclosures, as highlighted  also by publications from other prominent institutions covering this topic, such as the OECD29  and FIRST30. The administrative burden, due to the heavy reporting process, together with  the fact that most researchers are not used to or not comfortable interacting directly with  authorities, should be taken into consideration. Even though these aspects can be seen as  marginal, attention is required to implement the needed improvements in the vulnerability  disclosure process.  25 OECD, Encouraging Vulnerability Treatment: Overview for policy makers, OECD Digital Economy Papers, February 2021, Available at: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/0e2615ba-  en.pdf?expires=1662479285&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=7FDB7BA1D2905EAA43C2CD596A293D40  26 .

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  22  3.4 INITIATIVES ADDRESSING THE LACK OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS  The lack of legal protection has been addressed through two types of initiatives, touching upon  both concrete legal measures and awareness-raising measures.  Firstly, national cybersecurity agencies have been working on campaigns and projects meant  to further develop an ethical culture of responsible and coordinated disclosure of  vulnerabilities, such as ANSSI31. For instance, in November 2020, in the context of its  cooperation with the OEDC, ANSSI has confirmed its willingness to strengthen cooperative  efforts towards (i) ensuring security of products and services seen as a crucial issue for the  digital security of companies, citizens and administrations and (ii) improving responsible  vulnerability management, with the objective of strengthening digital security as a means of  stabilising cyberspace32.  Secondly, guidelines and judicial interpretations aim to better define the approach and the  boundaries of legal actions between ethical hacking and unauthorised, illegal compromises  and breaches, undertaken either by cybersecurity institutions or by judicial branches, like in the  US33.  In addition, the following good practices34 should be taken into considerations when addressing  legal barriers:  • ensure open, clear, and timely communication;  • develop clear CVD policies, being used as a contractual agreement between the  organisations and researchers;  • clarify expectations from the organisation that owns the CVD policy and programme,  • clarify legal protections for security researchers;  • train public institutions on CVD to not only restrict CVD to the private sector;  • promote education for all stakeholders involved in CVD vulnerability management  (and not only) ethical hackers;  • trigger national policy adaptations to allow security researchers to report vulnerability  in a safe legal and IT environment – this may come from a common policy developed  and implemented at EU level.  31 Agence National de la sécurité des systèmes d’information, ANSSI France, https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/  32 French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems, ‘L’ANSSI continue de s’investir dans les travaux de l’appel de Paris à l’OCDE’, ANSSI news, November 2020.

ADDRESSING  COLLABORATIVE  CHALLENGES: THE USE OF  OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE  AND BUG-BOUNTY  PROGRAMS  4.1 OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE – OSS  4.1.1 Context  When it comes to vulnerability discovery and disclosure, effective collaboration between  stakeholders and affected parties is essential. However, this is often challenging, especially in  the case of OSS where the lines of responsibility are sometimes blurred.  This section presents information obtained throughout desk research, along with the  contributions of industry experts and other actors such as open-source association  representatives. This section focuses on the following areas:  1. vulnerabilities’ impact, management and treatment within OSS;  2. usage of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) within the context of OSS;  3. governance to apply under the perspective of OSS (relating mainly to the attribution of  responsibility for vulnerabilities);  4. instances of OSS vulnerabilities within public and private organisations.  4.1.2 Vulnerabilities’ impact, management and treatment within OSS  In 2019, the average IT application consists of 70% open-source components which has  doubled when compared to 5 years ago35 (36% of open source code present in IT products in  201536). The product supply chain has become more complex as it includes codes from diverse  authors, sources and natures (open source and proprietary). Consequently, developers, public  and private organisations and product final users tend to hardly be aware of their risk exposure  and whether their IT infrastructure is affected or not by a disclosed vulnerability. The most-  frequently mentioned workaround by consulted CVD experts relies on the usage of a software  bill of material (SBOM) and/or software composition analysis (SCA)37 (defined in Section 5.3).  35 Carielli, S., DeMartine, A., Bongarzone, M. and Dostie, P., ‘Now tech: Software composition analysis, Q2 2021’, Forrester Overview, April 2021.  36 Carielli, S., DeMartine, A., Bongarzone, M. and Lynch, D., ‘The state of application security, 2021’, Forrester Overview, March 2021.  37 See footnote 35  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  24  With this in mind, most industry actors consulted in the context of this study commonly agreed  that the distinction between OSS and proprietary software is questionable.  In this sense, on one hand, when it comes to vulnerability treatment, OSS code tends to be  present in all commercial software (as shown in the case of Log4j38). When a vulnerability is  discovered in software code, the priority should be to fix it via a collaborative approach,  regardless of the nature of the software. On the other hand, the distinction between OSS and  proprietary software could make sense when it comes to governance and mainly  accountability and responsibility for the vulnerability. For a commercial software, the owner  of the impacted code is the product manufacturer which has the responsibility to fix the  vulnerability (easily identifiable). For OSS, identifying the code owner and/or the ‘adequate  person to contact’ to manage the vulnerability becomes more complicated as anybody is free to  publish, use and edit the code.  Diverging opinions related to vulnerability management in OSS co-exist among stakeholders  involved in CVD. On one side, some experts claim that vulnerabilities in OSS should be easier  to cope with via the above-mentioned cooperating approach on finding a fix. Projects such as  Alpha Omega initiatives39 aiming to handle vulnerabilities both in the OSS domain and in the  commercial one have proven their efficiency. Additionally, OSS is truly public whereas  proprietary software may not always be fully transparent on its vulnerabilities. This insufficient  transparency could potentially lead to a limited disclosure of vulnerabilities, hence resulting in a  less secured use of digital tools. On the other side, other experts tend to favour the usage of  proprietary components or products by stating that the open and publicly disclosure of OSS  vulnerabilities may lead to further exploitations and hence create a more dangerous  ecosystem.  Along the lines of the OECD when advising on how to ‘overcome co-ordination complexity’40,  most consulted experts agreed to say that with OSS being present in software produced and  used worldwide, there should be an international (or at least EU) coordination effort on the  management of vulnerabilities. This might be the role for ENISA or the European Commission  (covered in Section 8) to facilitate information sharing, and support the implementation of joint  procedures between Member States. The US Department of Defence recently held a large  industry meeting and published a memo41 touching upon vulnerability management in OSS.  This helped in getting a larger of pool of experts from different profiles into the discussion.  In 2020, the European Commission has launched its open-source strategy, aiming at  recognising and benefiting from the potential of open-source products and components within  EU IT innovations. This was recognised as an important step for the EU institution toward the  uptake and promotion of OSS. As part of this strategy, the Commission has emphasised that  any open-source code used in the context of this EC strategy to produce IT tools would be  38 Weaver, N., ‘What’s the deal with the Log4Shell security nightmare?’, Lawfare, December 2021.

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  25  submitted to systematic vulnerability scanning42. In the frame of this strategy, the EC has  launched a BBP (described in Section 7.5) for open-source solutions used by public services43.  4.1.3 Usage of ‘software bill of materials’ within the context of OSS  Risks due to attacks of software used in public and private organisations are becoming  significant enough to consider new mitigating approaches that involve more than risk-based  vendor/partner segmentation and scoring. These measures should focus more on requests for  evidence of security controls and secure best practices, a shift to a resilience-based thinking,  and other efforts44. SBOMs have emerged as a key building block in software security and  software supply chain risk management. An SBOM is defined by the CISA45 as a nested  inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components.  Over the past years, multiple regional and governmental institutions and industry organisations  have promoted the usage of SBOMs in security practices and software design and  development. According to the European Telecommunication Standard Institute (ETSI),  organisations should consider security management already at the product design and  development phases, and encourage the usage of the SBOMs46. Along these lines, in the EU at  national level, the German Federal Office for Information Security has recommended the  adoption of the SBOM of part of their national guidelines47. Similarly, the White House has  published an ‘Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity’ (May 2021) which  emphasises the importance of transparency and traceability when using open-source code and  promotes the use of the SBOM too. Lastly, the report produced by the Open Foundation, titled  ‘The Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan48, provides 10 concrete  recommendations including automation efforts, security by design and the utilisation of the  SBOM.  From a reporting perspective the SBOM could be perceived as an advanced version of a ‘static  registry or database’ of IT systems in an organisation. Applying the SBOM for OSS is seen as  complex due to the variety and numerous versions of codes later re-used in different IT  products. Nonetheless, a SBOM could be used at the scale of an organisation that has an in-  depth understanding of its IT infrastructure (‘know your asset’). With this, the SBOM can be  created to show interdependencies between IT products and elements within an entity.  Targeting similar objectives to the SBOM, the ‘Software Composition Analysis’ (SCA) was  presented in a Forrester article entitled ‘Now tech: Software composition analysis, Q2 2022’49.  This tool is defined as a product “that scans an application (without executing it) to identify  vulnerabilities, license risks, conflicts, and noncompliant usage in open-source and third-party  42 European Commission communication, ‘Open source software strategy 2020–2023’, C(2020) 7149 final, October 2020.

Going beyond the  software components, this tool offers interesting capabilities to cope with versions issues along  with workarounds on how to better define remediating actions.  4.1.4 Governance under the perspective of OSS  When talking about governance for vulnerabilities found in OSS, the focus is placed on the  responsibility, liability and accountability of such an event.  • Responsibility refers to the obligation to perform the task or comply with the rule.  • Accountability implies answerability for the outcome of the task or process.  • Liability is the state of being legally responsible for something.  With these definitions in mind, industry experts confirmed that clear and standardised  guidelines should be produced in order to define these three notions and guide  governments and private organisations in the development of their policies. Responsibility may  be distinct from liability. In this case, developers would not be liable for code they openly  shared. This public code would be accepted as a common infrastructure and the response to a  vulnerability found on the latter should be a public effort – liability would not be put on the  developer (or its company). On the contrary, the liability may be put on the commercial  companies relying on OSS that produce and design products based on open source codes  while knowing that the code is affected by a vulnerability but deciding not to patch it. A gap  remains when it comes to allocating accountability to an individual or an entity.  4.1.5 Instances of OSS vulnerabilities within public and private  organisations  In Italy, a catalogue of OSS50 used by public administration was created by the Agency for  Digital Italy) and the Digital Transformation Department. Each public administration has the  obligation to store the purchased and used OSS in this library. However, software is not always  regularly maintained by public administrations that are often unaware of technical dependencies  on other IT products. In the past, several public administrations have been attacked with the  same exploit due to interdependencies of IT systems. Due to an insufficient knowledge of its IT  system, the Italian public administration was unable to implement automation or rapidly identify  risks on IT infrastructure when a vulnerability was reported. On top of being risky, this has  pointed out a limit of the OSS catalogue. Another issue is that an OSS may be recorded once in  this catalogue, however future software or code versions are rarely encoded.  An instance of a successful story of OSS in the Italian public administration51 relies on a public  administration which had released its software based on the Italian OSS catalogue prerequisites  and on guidelines on the acquisition and reuse of OSS52 published by the Agency for Digital  Italy and Team Digital. The system integrator did face a vulnerability. Because the software was  50 AGID and Digital Transformation Department, ‘Catalogue of OSS‘. Available at: https://developers.italia.it/en/software.html  51 This instance was shared by an interviewed CVD expert who used to work for the Italian administration (target consultation findings).  52 ‘Linee Guida su acquisizione e riuso di software per le pubbliche amministrazioni’, 2019, https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/lg-acquisizione-e-riuso-software-per-pa-  docs/it/bozza/index.html  The vulnerability  handling process and  the responsibility and  accountability of  discovered OSS  vulnerabilities remain  points of contention.  https://developers.italia.it/en/software.html  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  27  open source, a former security researcher of this public administration became aware of the  vulnerability and has offered their help to fix it. Needless to say, that this is also a danger as  somebody with malicious intentions could have exploited the vulnerability openly shared to the  public.  In this effort of clarifying roles and action when reporting a vulnerability, an article entitled  ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source’53 was published by an IT service  management company, so to guide security research within multi-party cooperation when  dealing with vulnerability in open-source products.  4.2 CONSIDERATIONS ON OUTSOURCING SECURITY VIA BUG BOUNTY  PROGRAMMES  4.2.1 Context  This section focuses on considerations of bug bounty programmes (BBPs) combined with  security-by-design practices. BBPs are dedicated programmes where security researchers  and professionals can submit vulnerabilities they have discovered, in exchange for a  compensation. Findings obtained through desk research were compared and combined with  outcomes of a focus group, for the sake of identifying areas of agreement and disagreement,  trends and shared experiences among experts in this field. Additionally, inputs collected on bug  bounties during further interviews were also included whenever they were deemed it relevant.  This section focuses on the following research areas:  • structure of BBPs;  • security-by-design;  • BBPs challenges;  • BBPs in public administrations;  • evolution of BBPs;  • ENISA’s role in BBPs.  4.2.2 Structure of bug bounty programmes  While various sources have studied BBPs and their variations, some key concepts are worth  reiterating54 55 56 57. Most BBPs are set up and structured around the following foundational  parameters.  53 Gariché, N., ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source projects’, Github, February 2022.

What goals are foreseen by the organising entity58 (e.g., outsourcing  vulnerability research, reinforcing the security posture of the company, providing more  transparency)?  • Scope. Which part(s) of the IT infrastructure will be exposed within the BBP  (qualitative scope definition)?  • Number of IT assets. How many assets will the BBPs cover at its outset and what  additional assets will potentially be included at a later stage (quantitative scope  definition)?  • Participants. Who will be involved in the BPP (external stakeholders to the organising  entity or internal experts from the company security team, or a combination of the two  types of actors)?  • Timeframe. How long will the BBP will last for?  • Rewards. What are the nature and value of the rewards given to security researchers  as a compensation for their findings (usually financial, but not necessarily)?  • Communication channels. How will researchers, the organising entity, and any  intermediary will communicate?  Once a BBP is set-up, it is fundamental for the organising entity to be ready to handle (address  and patch) vulnerabilities and manage required operational tasks. Practically, this means that  the organisation should anticipate the workload generated by the reception of vulnerability  reports by its security team and allocated resources accordingly. Dealing with a vulnerability  (including reception of the report, analysis of the issue, treatment of the vulnerability,  interactions with reporters and publication of a patch) should be done in a timely manner.  A good way to reduce the initial load of expected reports is, before launching the BBP, to  perform a self-assessment of the assets in scope with commonly available tools or services.  This way, it is likely that a large percentage of the existing vulnerabilities will be identified and  managed even before the BBP programme officially starts.  Concerning the distinction between internally and externally managed BBPs, larger  companies tend to rely relying on internal security teams, in order to have full control over the  reports. While offering many benefits in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and scalability,  external BBPs indeed bring other types of challenges, such as a lower level of control over  vulnerability information, higher risk of a data breach, the possibility that data is stored outside  of the EU, and limitations regarding the publication of vulnerabilities at any point. Besides legal  and contractual limitations, it is important to reiterate that the set-up of a BBP must guarantee  confidentiality, as it relies on multi-stakeholder trust.  There exist different types of BBP programmes, including three main models59:  58 By ‘organising entity’, we mean an organisation which has decided to run a BBP on its own IT infrastructure.  59 A detailed break-down of types of BBPs was not the primary of objective of this research. For this reason, a simplified distinction has been offered. However, a detailed view can be found  here: Algorithmic Justice League, BUG BOUNTIES FOR ALGORITHMIC HARMS?, January 2022. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f4hVwQNiwp13zy62wUhwIg84lOq0ciG_/view  The setup of a BBP  has to follow a well- defined structure,  built on an existing  solid IT security  posture, and a  gradual path to  ensure a proper  management of  vulnerability  disclosure.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  29  • Closed BBPs are invitation-based programmes involving a restricted number of  researchers who are selected and invited to participate exclusively by the organising  entity.  • Hybrid BBPs are registration-based programmes, involving interested researchers  who can freely register and are then vetted by the organising entity before  participating.  • Open BBPs are public programmes, involving any interested researcher willing to  participate.  Notwithstanding the differences that each programme can offer, different types of BBP can be  more apt for different organisations. To make a conscious decision, pros and cons and trade- offs of each model need to be considered by the organising entity. On one hand, highly  secure organisations might initially favour closed BBPs, given the higher level of control that  these provide, perhaps considering moving on to different models, or different variations, as the  organisation’s experience with BBPs matures. On the other hand, open programmes provide  greater visibility, offering a brand image based on ‘trust and safety’ to the organisation. These  programmes also allow to draw on a large pool of researchers with their unique skills and  ultimately bring value to the security posture of the organising entity, despite the effort and  resources needed to manage these larger programmes.  4.2.3 Security-by-design  There is a general consensus on the fact that BBPs and security-by-design should be seen  as complementary concepts ultimately improving the security of the IT ecosystem. Involving  researchers and developers more and more in BBPs should help foster security-by-design, as  awareness is raised regarding security issues. Increasing interactions between these actors  involved in products’ supply chain should result in a virtuous cycle. Additionally, the more  vendors and software manufacturers are involved in such programmes, the safer the overall  ecosystem becomes.  In parallel, it should be noted that adopting a ‘security-by-design’ approach brings challenges.  For instance, a different approach and mindset for software development and the need to adapt  the development practices might generate additional costs (e.g., implementation, training,  human resource, consulting services). In the infancy of a security programme, implementing a  secure software development lifecycle (SSDL) should remain the priority, followed by a further  evaluation of the benefits of BBPs to ensure products security.  The inherent tension between these two perspectives might be reconciled moving forward,  embracing the best results of both approaches. Most professionals in the field tend to see BBPs  as sustainable solutions thanks to their contribution to the market consolidation by creating  trust, ensuring safety and raising awareness among actors. Alternatively, bug bounties are  sometimes seen as an ‘add-on’ to an organisation’s security programme, rather than a  sustainable unique solution to address root causes.  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  30  Despite the growing interest in BBPs over the last few years, no security expert has claimed that  BBPs can be the be-all and end-all solution to security vulnerabilities for any organisation, but  rather an important component of a much larger and articulated architecture, which should  include security-by-design.  4.2.4 Bug bounty programmes in public administrations  Public administrations face significant challenges in the establishment of BBPs with financial  rewards due to legal limitations and limited budgets. Nonetheless, there are already examples  to draw from, both focused directly on public administrations’ systems, such as the Hack the  Pentagon60 and Hack U.S.61, and focused on open-source software, such as the European  Commission programme62 launched in early 2022. These initiatives shows that BBPs are  possible even for public organisations, despite existing constraints or hesitations.  An important point when looking at the varied public administration systems among EU Member  States is that ENISA should follow a systematic approach when guiding public administration in  their BBP strategy. This method should avoid confusion, as decisions cannot be left to single  agencies or individuals, with the risk of ending up with a fragmented system. The reference  case in this context comes from the US federal system, where the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) required all public agencies to establish VDP through the  Binding Operational Directive (BOD 20-01), issued by the US., in support of the Office of  Management and Budget M-20-32, ‘Improving Vulnerability Identification, Management, and  Remediation’. This led to establishing best practices across the sector and triggering the VDP  adoption even within the private sector.  In line with the observed trends within public administration and stakeholders’ feedback, it is  reasonable to expect a continued growth in the adoption of BBPs by public  administrations worldwide. Always following a risk-based approach, the priority tends to  initially be on critical infrastructure. Nonetheless, each public administration is left with the  choice to implement the BBP strategy according to its specific objectives, needs and IT assets.  4.2.5 Bug bounty programmes challenges  As further BBPs are set up, it is worth noting that main BBPs challenges faced by organisations  who already gained significant experience, including:  • difficult identification of IT assets owners and unclear guidelines on how to define who  is responsible for fixing vulnerabilities;  • insufficient communication between researchers reporting vulnerabilities,  organisations’ developers, and organisations’ security teams;  • limited resources allocated to security teams, as opposed to development and  research,  60 Hackerone, ‘Hack the Pentagon’ Available at: https://www.hackerone.com/hack-the-pentagon. ‘”Hack the Pentagon” pilot programme opens for registration’, March 2016.

DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  31  • unwillingness of private organisations to publicly disclose vulnerabilities;  • insufficient resources provided by national governments to support BBPs;  • complex definition of the line between ‘ethical and acceptable practices’ and ‘illegal  and unacceptable practices’ for security researchers.  While solving some of these challenges will require a longer time span, ENISA is well positioned  to provide a substantial contribution either by coordinating the policy debate among all  stakeholders involved or by producing public guidelines to support stakeholders’ progress on  these themes. On one hand, raising public awareness about CVDs and BBPs might result in a  larger budget allocation for such programmes and initiatives at the national level; on the other  hand, guidelines can better define certain concepts and points that are still unclear.  4.2.6 Evolution of bug bounty programmes  BBPs have evolved over time, presenting today some significant changes. First, there has been  a shift in acceptance and comfort in having a BBP and in working with the community of  researchers, as more organisations establish, rely on and appreciate the advantages on such  programmes. Second, BBPs have become more focused on the quality, rather than the  quantity of the reported vulnerabilities, which seems to be a natural evolution as programmes  mature. Moreover, BBPs have grown to cover a larger set of IT/digital tools and infrastructure,  thanks to the diversity of researchers’ expertise working under each programme.  In terms of future evolution, there seems to be overall agreement regarding the expected  exponential and sustained growth of the security research community in the next few  years, this triggering safer cooperation among actors. These two trends suggest a strong  basis for BBPs moving forward. Additional elements to consider entail the expansion of BBPs’  scope in the future to cover, for example, algorithmic harm, as pointed out by forward-looking  research in this space63.  63 Algorithmic Justice League, ‘BUG BOUNTIES FOR ALGORITHMIC HARMS?’, January 2022.

ADDRESSING TECHNICAL  CHALLENGES: AUTOMATION  INITIATIVES SUPPORTING  PRIORITISATION AND  TREATMENT OF  VULNERABILITIES  5.1 CONTEXT  An important chapter in vulnerability treatment is the use of automation address technical  challenges and increase efficiency and effectiveness. This chapter aims to collect stakeholders’  contributions regarding automation initiatives that can support the prioritisation and  treatment of vulnerabilities. The content of this section relies on desk research and primary  data collected within a focus group composed of industry experts on CVD from diverse  backgrounds. Information presented in this section is separated into the following two sections:  1. considerations on the usage of automated processes within vulnerability management.  2. CVD tools fostering the usage of automated workflows within vulnerability prioritisation  and treatment.  5.2 AUTOMATED PROCESSES WITHIN VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT  As pointed out in the Gartner report on Top Trends in Cybersecurity’ published in 2022,  ensuring the security of an organisation’s products and infrastructure should come from both the  organisation per se willing to improve its security posture and from security solution providers  that regularly innovates and considers emerging technologies when developing their product  portfolio. Among others, innovative product development, automation and the usage of artificial  intelligence technologies stand out.  As generally agreed by consulted industry players, ‘automation’ initiatives present a high  potential to enhance vulnerability management and are increasingly considered within  organisations. Hence, the more automation can be adopted, the better it is. Nonetheless,  stakeholders pointed out that substituting human in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities may not be  yet possible. Organisations should aim to find the nature of and balance between processes  that could/should be automated (e.g., repetitive tasks of researchers when seeking  vulnerabilities) and could/should be subject to human expertise. For instance, the Alpha  Omega project for OSS has been focusing on this approach and on identifying the criticality of  pieces of software that would need to be overseen by human actions (triaging the vulnerability  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  33  and fixing it rather requires human intervention). Otherwise, there are the risks that (i) new  vulnerabilities might be introduced, or (ii) vulnerabilities may be only partially fixed and  categorised as “fully remediated” while the infrastructure or code remain exposed to risks. Due  to the importance of human knowledge, industry experts commonly agreed that the deskilling  of vulnerability experts64 and security researchers should not be the result of the  automation of phases within vulnerability processes.  With this in mind, automation tends to apply to sourcing and publication rather than  vulnerability analysis or treatment. Automated processes could be restricted to the  reception, filtering, categorisation and acknowledgement of the reports. These phases  present a high potential for automation, as they are time-consuming, with a low value-added  and do not require a lot of expertise for being performed. However, an automated triage would  only be possible with the usage of a standard numbering methodology to classify vulnerabilities;  the CVE numbering method was strongly recommended. This automated referencing was also  touched upon by the ETSI, who recommend that each reported vulnerability should be  automatically assigned a unique reference number to enable researchers and organisations to  track the corresponding ticket65. This approach would enable the creation of an organised  database of all reported vulnerabilities according to an agreed-upon logic and without human  error (example of automation initiative done by the OASIS Common Security Advisory  Framework (CSAF) Technical Committee66, later described in Section 6.3)  5.3 COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE TOOLS FOSTERING  THE USAGE OF AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS WITHIN VULNERABILITY  PRIORITISATION AND TREATMENT  Automation could potentially be used when dealing with scoring. The scoring mechanism  as it is now can be very subjective (e.g., when a vulnerability is rated with a CVSS67 score equal  or higher than 7, it becomes a patching priority. However, distinguishing a vulnerability rated as  a 7 from one rated as a 6.9 is challenging). To cope with this subjectivity, new scoring  frameworks are being developed such as (i) Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization 68  and (ii) Exploit Prediction Scoring System 69. If those three scores could be considered jointly  and in an automated manner, the end result would be perceived as more reliable.  The SBOM is seen as a great tool to automatically identify interdependencies among products  and handle their classification accordingly. Without human intervention, the automated system  would draw a list of all affected software based on data encoded in the SBOM. Depending on  the nature of affected software and severity of the impact (i.e. namely on high-risk  infrastructure), mitigating measures could be put in place to deal with vulnerabilities efficiently.  64 On the issue of delegating threat detection completely to an AI system and its implication for the deskilling of experts, see: CEPS Task Force, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity:  Technology, governance and policy challenges, CEPS, 2021, p. 33.  65 ETSI, ‘Cyber security – Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure’, TR 103 838, January 2022.

SCA tools can inspect source code, software packages, binary files,  containers and more, and correlate this data with known vulnerability databases for automated  discovery. In addition, these tools can automatically create a software bill of materials to further  facilitate any future inspections.  The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) could be used as a complement to the  SBOM to foster automation within vulnerability management. The standard is a replacement of  the CVRF and was created by the OASIS CSAF Technical Committee70. CSAF is currently  ready for testing and implementation and will become an official OASIS standard end of 202271.  CSAF is a JSON based standard that vastly improved the capabilities of its predecessor CVRF  and can be used to share various types of vulnerability information along the supply chain in a  vendor-agnostic format.  Lastly, the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) documents and attestations72 can be  seen as an enhanced version of ‘traditional advisories’ and is perceived by experts as a great  catalyst to automating vulnerability management. VEX documents are machine readable and  are built to support integration into existing and new security management tools, along with  broader vulnerability monitoring mechanisms and systems. In addition, VEX can supplement  SBOM data and can make its use more effective by allowing an immediate assessment of the  exploitability of the vulnerabilities included in a product. The goal of VEX is to support greater  automation across the vulnerability ecosystem in terms of disclosure, vulnerability tracking, and  remediation.  Overall, on top of supporting an efficient vulnerability prioritisation and treatment, such tools  would also favour organisations’ resource management. In this sense, automation may help  to reduce the human workload and/or provide answers that are more specific to a particular  environment. A vulnerability may be critical to one user and/or infrastructure because of its  configuration and environment, yet might be non-critical to another one.  Lastly, the OECD and the White House have shared a similar recommendation73 on the usage  of automated and standardised messages at each stage of the vulnerability treatment among  counterparties. These communications may include status updates, requirements to complete a  vendor’s current stage, next steps, and points of contact for questions, etc. With this,  automation could be an advantage for vendors as automated communication like ‘we know  about the vulnerability and are investigating’ or ‘we are not affected’ can reduce the volume of  calls and emails received via the support hotline, thereby contributing to better management of  resource allocation.  70 OASIS CSAF Technical Committee presentation.

CONCLUSIONS  This report has provided a comprehensive overview of the information collected from consulted  industry players involved in CVD and national policy makers. For each one of the research  areas, the report presents trends, gaps to be offset, recommendations and attention points  mentioned by external stakeholders. These findings are supported by secondary data retrieved  from a literature composed of ENISA reports, EU and international institutions materials, public  administration documentations and private organisation tools and internal policies.  The information was reported with the aim of capturing industry expectations regarding CVD  policies, exploring challenges around CVD policy development, and identifying shared  perspectives and trends, along with areas of disagreements. Subsequently, in-depth analysis  was conducted to provide a better contextual understanding of all components and actors  playing a role in the establishment and development of CVD policies and programmes. In this  sense, reported findings and information sources go beyond the EU ecosystem and include  international references (e.g. US policy initiatives).  Although the research and analysis has tried to focus on a variety of practical and concrete  aspects related to CVD policies, the following main high-level conclusions can be drawn from  the study:  • National CVD policies can be an important example for the industry. The  development of national CVD policies is an important encouragement for industry  organizations to set vulnerability management and security practices as a priority. In  addition, the alignment with existing international standards around CVD, can greatly  contribute to a harmonized approach among all stakeholders.  • The CVD ecosystem remains fragmented. This outcome had already been identified  and described in detail within the ENISA CVD study (2021). The target consultation  carried out in 2022 highlighted industry professionals’ perceptions regarding  heterogeneity of the CVD ecosystem, and a lack of legal certainty in EU Member  States legislative frameworks. There is still an important and mostly unanswered need  to strengthen harmonisation, alignment, coordination, and cooperation between  industry players and governments.  • Education and awareness should be prioritised. Despite the decades-old existence  of vulnerabilities and vulnerability management in cybersecurity, a ‘security-by-default’  product development approach favoured by education and training is still too rarely  observed among developers and product manufacturers. Examples still emerge of  professionals not getting a full understanding of the issues at stake or the potential  solutions available. Therefore, there should be a substantial increase of vulnerability-  DEVELOPING NATIONAL VULNERABILITY PROGRAMMES  | February 2023  36  related education and awareness embedded in all levels of any code development or  product manufacturing training courses.  • Legal, economic and technological challenges have been identified and brought  under the spotlight and there is a growing effort to address them. Some of the changes  needed to address the externalities of the vulnerability market require massive work.  Nonetheless, each player can contribute at their own pace, however it needs to be  noted that a legal mandate to address vulnerabilities very likely to come (e.g. with the  CRA). Concrete solutions focusing on well-defined issues with a potential to be scaled  up and expanded into larger initiatives over time will play an equally important role in  moving forward the status quo on vulnerability management.  • Promote ‘security and privacy by design’ ideologies. In many cases it far better to  be proactive and address security as early as possible in the lifecycle of new products.  Significant resources and investment efforts are needed to further promote a security-  by-design approach and mindset such as ‘SecDevOps74’ practices and simply  prioritising security in IT systems at all levels. Integrating security and privacy thinking  from the inception phases of any code development or product manufacturing will likely  have the most significant benefit for the EU in the long run.  74 SecDevOps is a management approach that links security and operations teams in an IT context.

    "abstract": "Based on the experiences and perspectives gathered from industry players and national governments, as well as on the documentation developed by multiple actors involved with national vulnerability initiatives and programmes, the EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ecosystem remains fragmented. Although interesting approaches and initiatives are taking place in some EU Member States, yet further steps can be done towards an integrated EU vision and action."

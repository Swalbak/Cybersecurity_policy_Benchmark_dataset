INTRODUCTION  The Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM)1 sector is an entire ecosystem of services,  operations and infrastructures comprised of a variety of actors and stakeholders. The  ecosystem brings about transformation in the industries as well as in the demands of citizens  who look for safer, cleaner, more sustainable, and easier transportation. CAM has the potential  to change the way society views transportation, benefit from digitalisation to connect vehicles  with their surroundings and with the drivers, as well as contribute to solving congestion,  reducing pollution, diminish road accidents, and improve access to mobility.  There are, therefore, two varying but complementing aspects in the ecosystem: connectivity and  automation. A connected vehicle relies on the technologies installed in cars, buses, other  vehicles and the infrastructure surrounding it, as well as people. A connected vehicle can also  wirelessly (e.g. 4g/5g and/or WIFI) exchange data and information with the vehicle manufacturer  and third-party service providers. The notion of V2X (i.e. vehicle-to-everything) therefore  includes2:   Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)   Vehicle-to-infrastructure and vice-versa (V2I and I2V)   Vehicle-to-mobile network (V2N) and infrastructure-to-mobile network (I2N)   Vehicle-to-devices (V2D)   Vehicle-to-persons (V2P)   Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)  The automated aspect concerns the vehicles, where safety-critical control functions are carried  out without driver input. Several years ago, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)  where only found in very few vehicles. Today, the mass market also includes, among others,  (adaptive) cruise control, cameras, self-parking, blind spot detection and vehicle emergency  braking. Drivers are quickly starting to rely on automation in various situations. There are five  levels of automation3 that range from driver assistance systems supporting the driver to the  vehicle assuming all driving functions, therefore all persons becoming passengers in the vehicle  without interaction with the car to drive it. Most manufacturers are currently aiming to reach  Level 2 and 3: Partly Automated Driving and Highly Automated Driving (incl. Tesla4, BMW5,  Mercedes-Benz6).  Cybersecurity is crucial in the evolution of the CAM ecosystem. The increasing connectivity and  automation of vehicles and surrounding infrastructure brings about novel cybersecurity  challenges, threats, and risks. The CAM ecosystem requires cybersecurity standards and  cybersecurity measures by the stakeholders that provide for a safe infrastructure and services  delivery. All stakeholders in CAM must ensure that data and technical structures have the  necessary protection, safety and security measures for protection of the systems. Furthermore,  cybersecurity is becoming more defined in this area through the adoption of both national and  international standards and regulations in Europe and throughout the world.  1 Connected and automated mobility in Europe.

These stakeholders have to  cooperate to achieve the various indexes of mobility and to arrive at the final goal of full degree  of automation and connectivity, and thus automated driving in a cyber secure, trustworthy and  safe manner. As part of the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems and Services (C-ITS)7,  the vehicle-to-everything (V2X)8 notion relies on various communication technologies. This V2X  communication can only be made possible through the cooperation of the whole industry, which  is critical for the success of CAM. Action areas for CAM therefore lie in cybersecurity,  innovation, infrastructure, legislation, interconnectivity, and data governance.  1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the CAM cybersecurity  ecosystem and more particularly to map the key stakeholders and relevant bodies and  organisations in the European Union, as well provide an overview of the critical services and  systems and infrastructures. It also complements the Recommendations for the Security of  Connected and Automated Mobility report of ENISA9, which depicts the key cybersecurity  challenges in the CAM sector according to stakeholders concerned. This report supports the  CAM area by proposing conclusions on the findings in order to draft the necessary baseline  cybersecurity measures and key issues to decision makers specific to the protection of security  and resilience of the CAM ecosystem at the EU level.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report comprises:   Associations   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Mobility Service Providers   National Authorities   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities (RA)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   Standardisation Bodies   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 And Tier 2 Suppliers  1.3 METHODOLOGY  Using a layered approach of desktop research and interviews, this report summarises insights  across a complex CAM cybersecurity ecosystem. The desktop research methods included a  survey and works of ENISA, official statistics, academic research, external studies and official  documents, white papers, legislation, policies, strategies and initiatives to identify challenges  and lessons learnt on cyber incidents against the CAM ecosystem. The interviews were  7 Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) refers to transport systems, where the cooperation between two or  more ITS sub-systems (personal, vehicle, roadside and central) enables and provides an ITS service that offers better  quality and an enhanced service level, compared to the same ITS service provided by only one of the ITS sub-systems.

The information and data included  in this report are therefore based on a six-step methodology as depicted in Figure 1 below.  Figure 1: Methodology  1.4 DOCUMENT STRUCTURE  In this document, the CAM ecosystem and insights involving stakeholder interactions, critical  services and infrastructures, standards, as well as security measures are described. The  insights gained from the survey, interviews, and desk research feed the conclusions of this  report. Conclusions are put forward in order to improve the level of security and resilience of the  CAM ecosystem in the European Union.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  7  2. CAM CYBERSECURITY  ECOSYSTEM  The connected and automated mobility industry relies on a wide ecosystem of actors covering  the different areas of the value chain from R&D and manufacturing, retailing and service  providing, operations, maintenance and management of infrastructures and fleets as well as all  the standardisation and regulatory bodies framing the sector. Considering the distribution of  activities and responsibilities over this ecosystem, interactions between actors are crucial for its  development and effective operations, including actors who are in direct competition with each  other from a business operational point of view. Relations between stakeholders are not only  contractual in a logic of client and supplier but go further with various type of collaborations  around technologies, practices and frameworks development and standardisation, and other  business continuity related dependencies.  2.1 STAKEHOLDERS  The CAM cybersecurity ecosystem encompasses multiple stakeholders, as depicted in Figure 2  below. This section further describes these stakeholders and their role within the ecosystem.  Figure 2: CAM ecosystem stakeholders  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  8  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)  In the automotive sector, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) “is the original producer  of a vehicle's components, and so OEM car parts are identical to the parts used in producing a  vehicle.”10 In other words, in the automotive industry, the term OEM refers to any company that  manufactures parts for use in vehicles, including hardware (e.g. brakes, electrical parts, exhaust  systems, glass) as well as software systems (e.g. vehicle onboard computer) and who is in  charge of the final assembly of the vehicle. For clarification, in many cases the hardware parts  for the vehicle could also be produced by Tier 1 and 2 suppliers, as described in the next  section.  With the emergence of CAM, OEMs have been at the forefront of innovation (along with tech  companies) by giving special focus to research and development (R&D) toward vehicles  connectivity and autonomous capabilities. OEMs have altered branding strategies and have set  important goals to achieve autonomous driving but also to develop new offers around shared  mobility and digital services. Nevertheless, the change in the automotive industry means that  the value and supply chains to produce a vehicle for the market have also altered. OEMs must  also face changes in the market value of their products brought about by CAM and new  business models associated, as a result of increased collaborations with other relevant CAM  stakeholders. Today, a typical vehicle is composed of mostly hardware and a smaller proportion  of software. With the further development of CAM, though hardware will remain important,  software and connected components will represent a higher share of a vehicle’s market value,  involving new partnerships and relations with actors mastering digital and software technologies  in order to bring the right skills and knowledge for vehicles development.11  Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers  A Tier 1 supplier focuses on providing systems and parts (braking, systems, gearboxes, ECUs,  exhaust systems, batteries, etc.) to OEMs which are their direct clients, and a Tier 2 supplier on  sub-components of the systems and parts provided by the Tier 1 (screwing, gears, filters, tubes,  electronical components, etc.) without a direct relationship to OEMs. In the same logic as Tier 1  suppliers are clients of Tier 2, the latter are supplied by Tier 3 and so on until Tier n, which  produce other sub-components until the supplier that provide raw or close-to-raw materials  (plastic and metal).  Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers thus encompass a large variety of components and materials, these  include network services, engineering services, testing solutions, embedded applications, on-  board units and systems, ITS systems, solutions, semiconductors, sensors, and a further array  of software and hardware. These suppliers play a large role in CAM and are an important  stakeholder of the hub depicted in Figure 2. Suppliers historically provided mechanical and  electronic elements but also took the corner of CAM by providing parts related to connectivity  (modem, infotainment systems, software, etc.) and autonomy (radar, lidar, algorithms, etc.) in  order to answer to the evolution of OEM needs.  Smart Infrastructures Operators  In the CAM ecosystem, the stakeholders within the smart infrastructure category are multi-  faceted. Smart Infrastructures comprise several operators from different domains of activity,  10 What Is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in the Automotive Sector? (2019). Investopedia.

Within the Smart Infrastructure, connected and automated vehicles interact with the whole  ecosystem (V2X), which in part is made possible by the interaction with the smart road and  urban infrastructure that are based on Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Big Data, and  Mobility on Demand (V2I, I2V, V2N and I2N). The interaction of a vehicle with its surroundings  and between infrastructures constituting the surrounding is crucial for the correct deployment of  CAM. Road infrastructure should interact with vehicles through physical and digital elements.  Today, road infrastructure is optimised for human intelligence and some roads and situations  (especially in cities) are not developed enough for automated machine intelligence.  Infrastructure today is not completely ready to accommodate V2I and I2V communication. The  stakeholders are a blend of public authorities and private companies, that need to cooperate  with the other stakeholders in the CAM ecosystem, namely OEMs, suppliers and 3rd party  service providers, to best understand the needs of future infrastructure.  Telecom companies  Telecom companies are a stakeholder within the CAM ecosystem as they ensure the  connectivity and data transfer stemming to and from vehicles and that of Smart Infrastructure  (V2N and I2N). There are new opportunities for telecom companies in CAM which may, for  instance, include the expansion of current (and installation) of fibre infrastructure or expanding  the wireless bandwidth of vehicular and infrastructural data which also needs to conform to  security expectations. Indeed, there are various layers to the CAM ecosystem in which a  telecom company may decide to expand.  Another important evolution for the near future is the emergence of 5G V2X communication  networks, which is much more sophisticated and offers higher bandwidth to enhance  connectivity compared to today’s 3G/4G networks. The European Commission’s 5G Action  Plan15 from 2016, set out to ensure that by 2025, “all urban areas and major terrestrial transport  paths have uninterrupted 5G coverage”. The Action Plan also calls to diminish fragmentation  among the Member states to ensure service continuity (i.e. aligned and coordinated 5G  infrastructure), which is crucial for connected vehicles, especially in the EU, where cross-border  mobility is an everyday phenomenon.  IT suppliers  IT suppliers provide secure software, hardware, as well as cloud functionalities. Alike to telecom  companies, reliable connectivity (stability) is an absolute necessity for CAM. IT suppliers also  cover the provision of emerging technologies such as Cloud computing platforms (Azure, AWS,  etc.), Software platforms for automotive connectivity and mobility (e.g. Waymo, Yandex, etc.), AI  (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT (Internet of Things) solutions to the CAM ecosystem.  Technology companies, especially tech giants, are also keen on joining the CAM ecosystem  and bringing their services to the fore. These companies, mostly the latter, are able to invest  12 Smart Infrastructure. ENISA.

Third-party services provider  Third-party services providers supply, for example, content, maps, traffic data, music player,  weather monitor, and mobile apps to vehicles. Satellite navigation providers are also included  under this stakeholder grouping, as it is a key element of automated vehicles within the CAM  ecosystem. In the European Commission’s open public consultation on CAM16, it was found that  the majority of end-users would be willing to share data with third-party service providers on, for  example, the state of roads, as well as data concerning the functioning of the vehicle  components. Third-party service providers are significant in the CAM ecosystem to complement  the services of, for example, OEMs.  Automotive aftermarket operators  Automotive aftermarket operators are aftermarket independent service providers who are  independent parts producers, parts distributors, independent repairers, publishers of technical  information, tool equipment manufacturers, roadside repairers, leasing companies, and  insurance companies, as defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/85817. These automotive aftermarket  operators, within the repair and maintenance activities, provide a range of traditional services  such as independent parts manufacturing/distribution, repair and maintenance activities as well  as a range of innovative services such as predictive maintenance, over-the-air repair and  maintenance/software updates, remote diagnostics, and digital mobility services. For all these  services, information exchange between all CAM stakeholders and aftermarket operators is  necessary, and in particular with vehicle manufacturers for product development and system  integration.  Associations  Associations, in general terms, are a group of people who work together in a single organisation  for a particular purpose.18 These purposes or goals differ depending on the type, size and scope  of the association. Just as the automotive sector includes different types of companies and auto  manufacturers, it does so associations as well. These associations can focus, among others, on  trade, manufacturers, industry, independent trade in spare parts, repairers, repair information  publishers, service providers for connected cars, and when expanding the scope to the CAM  ecosystem, it also includes technology and software.  In this study, associations had a different input into the CAM ecosystem and represented the  following aspects of CAM: parts manufacturing, IT security testing of C-ITS components, road  assessment, automated driving software solutions, representation of wholesalers and retailers,  and jointly promoting the interests of the members of the association to policy makers.  Associations are thus a key component of the CAM ecosystem, as their competences and  sometimes lobbying efforts bring about important change to the transportation world, at national,  EU, and international levels.  European institutions  The European institutions acting in the CAM ecosystem are primarily the European Commission  and Agencies. The European Commission aims to adopt various level policies and legislation in  order to lead the transformation of the ecosystem. ENISA, a European agency is also highly  active in cooperating with the CAM ecosystem in order to better understand how to advance  16 Available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/summary-report-open-public-consultation-connected-and- automated-mobility-cam  17 Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market  surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such  vehicles.

The European Parliament MEPs, in early 2019, also called  for safety and liability rules for driverless cars, together with a robust legislation form the  European Commission on access to in-vehicle data as this is a fundamental block for the  achievement of both autonomous and connected driving in a Single European Transport Area  and for competitive CAM services for end-users. A particularly important aspect in Europe is the  collaboration among Member States, which the Commission coordinates in its Strategy on  Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS)19. The Commission also stated that part of its  priorities is to “continue working on the regulatory environment, ecosystem-building, resource  efficiency and standardisation to facilitate the market introduction of increasingly efficient  cooperative, connected and automated vehicles.” The European Commission’s Joint Research  Centre (JRC) has set up the EU-wide security Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as a defining  feature of C-ITS and critical safety V2X. As will be further described in section 2.1.1 Stakeholder  interactions below, the stakeholders throughout the CAM ecosystem at times have mandatory  interactions with the institutions in order to successfully carry out EU actions that will harmonise  the industry.  For more information on the EU policy context, please refer to A Annex.  Standardisation bodies  Standardisation bodies, within the CAM ecosystem, are in charge of ensuring the long-term  safety, security, and interoperability of the industry. Standards have different objectives,  including providing standardised cybersecurity concepts, measures, solutions as well as  management, furthermore, standards also encompass processes of quality necessary to  homogenise conception and development practices through different frameworks. Standards  offer a common ground for technological development, especially if driven as a legislative  requirement. ETSI for example, a European Standards Organisation (ESO), is the recognised  regional standards body for telecommunications, broadcasting and other electronic  communications networks and services. ETSI’s ITS (Intelligent Transport System) committee is  paving the way for global standards for C-ITS, which are mainly vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-  to-roadside communication.  For more information about the current state of play of standards in the CAM ecosystem, please  refer to section 2.3.2 Standards.  Regulatory bodies  Regulatory bodies propose regulations and framework conditions to address the necessary  changes brought about by CAM, including, for instance ethical and liability and privacy issues,  cybersecurity, and safety. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)  adopted the cybersecurity regulation WP29 in June 2020, requiring all car manufacturers in the  European Union (and beyond) to secure connected vehicles against cyberattacks under this  new regulation set by the United Nations.20 At the European level, the European Commission is  in charge to transpose the texts defined by UNECE, which take into account the needs of all  CAM stakeholders. Given that the pace of technological development is faster than the  accompanying legislative process, regulatory bodies are in charge of creating a dynamic  structure for governance to develop efficient technical legislation. At a national level each  country may enforce some specific CAM regulation.  19 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions on A European strategy on Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems, a  milestone towards cooperative, connected and automated mobility. 30 November 2016.

Across the EU  Member States, governments have varying instances on development, testing, and deployment  of CAM, in which national competent authorities/road authorities play a large role. These  authorities may range from providing expertise for safety/security, to having an overview of a  specific city’s long-term goals, or even independent agencies that cooperate with both the public  and private sectors on matters related to transport and communications.  Users  Users are defined as drivers and passengers as well as pedestrians. The bringing about of CAM  shows how digitalisation affects more and more areas of society. There is a shift towards a  user-centred mobility paradigm. CAM is surrounded by new technologies and one of the most  important challenges to achieve by the ecosystem is to earn the trust and acceptability of the  users. Today, connected mobility is thriving and making users’ lives more comfortable through  V2V and V2I communication, including, for instance, live information on traffic flow, construction  sites, and accidents. Furthermore, vehicles are also connected to persons (V2P), by, for  example, directly connecting their smartphones to their cars and accessing apps and making  calls easily from their dashboards. For this aspect, the necessary trust lies in data protection  schemes. For automated mobility itself, users’ trust will have to go much further, in order to  accept that automated cars will make the correct and necessary decisions. Though there are  many facts to consider and research in order to ensure the correct deployment of CAM, it is  highly beneficial for the future of society. The key opportunities are safety, comfort, efficiency,  social inclusion, and accessibility.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  13  2.1.1 Stakeholder interactions  This section describes the main stakeholder interactions towards a secure CAM ecosystem  based on the primary data collected in this study. This study focuses on whether the interaction  among stakeholders are mandatory (i.e. based on a legal requirement such as national or EU  legislation21, this does not include contractual obligations) or voluntary. The figures in this  section show a summary of the nature of interaction between the stakeholders of the CAM  ecosystem, based on the primary data collected for this report, i.e. survey, interviews, and direct  feedback from the acknowledged stakeholders.  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)  Figure 3: Original Equipment Manufacturers’ interactions with other CAM stakeholders  OEMs have an established network and/or partnership with the whole CAM ecosystem. From  the survey and interviews, differing views were gathered on the nature (i.e. mandatory or  voluntary) of the collaboration between OEMs and other stakeholders.  An OEM mainly collaborates with National Competent Authority/Road Authority, European  institutions, Standardisation bodies, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and Associations related to  CAM, on a needs-basis. On the one hand, there is no mandatory collaboration necessary as the  industry is proactive in cooperating as the needs call for it. On the other hand, whenever the  interactions among stakeholders refer to compliance with legal requirements, such as data  privacy, security and cybersecurity OEMs interactions with other stakeholders become  mandatory, especially with stakeholders with whom OEMs do not have contractual  relationships.  The purpose of collaboration stemming from OEMs and other stakeholders mostly hold the  same values: technical standardisation, common watch (e.g. for innovation, threats), and  process/method standardisation, as well as compatibility/interoperability needs. For a National  Competent Authority/Road Authority, where collaboration is voluntary, technical standardisation  and common watch are the main purposes of collaboration. The OEMs interviewed had differing  views on the collaboration with European institutions where the nature is both voluntary and  mandatory, with the purposes of technical standardisation, process/method standardisation, and  common watch.  21 This does not include the contractual obligations that may arise from bilateral contracts between stakeholders  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  14  Collaboration with standardisation bodies is voluntary from OEMs, one also noting that this  cooperation is based on its voluntary contribution to the standards definition. The collaboration  with Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers is deemed as mandatory, for the purposes of technical  standardisation and process/method standardisation. In addition, collaboration with automotive  aftermarket operators is necessary at both mandatory and voluntary levels for commercial and  product processes, development and integration support including information sharing. OEMs  interact with Automotive aftermarket operators in both mandatory and voluntary manners to  ensure compliance with processes and products’ requirements. Finally, with associations of the  CAM ecosystem, the cooperation is voluntary for a common watch (e.g. for innovation, threats).  Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers  Figure 4: Tier-x suppliers’ interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Tier 1 and Tier 2 stakeholders collaborate with the whole ecosystem, namely, National  Competent Authority/Road Authority, European Institution, Standardisation body, Operator of  Intelligent Transport System (OITS), Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), fellow Tier 1 and  Tier 2 suppliers, Smart city operators (e.g. traffic operators), Associations related to CAM, and  automotive aftermarket operators.  Tier 1 and Tier 2 collaboration with National Competent Authority/Road Authority is always  voluntary, and are mostly based on incident reporting, but also include technical  standardisation, process/method standardisation, and common watch. The collaboration with  European Institutions is also voluntary, and mostly based on technical standardisation. Other  purposes include incident reporting, common watch, process/method standardisation, as well  as, for example, regulation making on access to vehicles data and exchanges on future  roadmaps of the regulatory landscape. Tiers 1 and 2 suppliers voluntarily cooperate with  standardisation bodies to contribute to the development standards (e.g. ISO/SAE/VDA) and  may also participate to working groups. They sometimes hold monthly meetings to discuss  general interest topics around cybersecurity.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  15  The main purposes of collaboration were thus found to be technical standardisation,  process/method standardisation, and also common watch. Only a minority of Tier 1 and Tier 2  suppliers collaborate with Operators of Intelligent Transport System (OITS), on a voluntary and  commercial basis, with the purposes of technical standardisation and process/method  standardisation. Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers interact with OEMs on both mandatory and voluntary  bases, and it is mostly based on commercial and product development support purposes as  OEMs are customers. Other reasons include technical standardisation and process/method  standardisation, common watch, and incident reporting. Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers may also  interact both mandatorily or voluntarily amongst each other, and their interaction is also often  commercial, in order to receive components. They also need to align on technical  standardisation and process/method standardisation. Smart city operators and Tier 1 and Tier 2  suppliers interact voluntarily to define technical standardisation and a common watch for  innovation or threats. Collaboration with automotive aftermarket operators is necessary at both  mandatory and voluntary levels for product development and integration support. Finally, with  Associations related to CAM, the purpose of collaboration is also mostly based on common  watch.  Automotive aftermarket operators  Figure 5: Automotive aftermarket operators' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Automotive aftermarket operators need to interact with OEMs and Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers for  information exchange regarding compatibility and interoperability for cybersecurity engineering.  In more detail, automotive aftermarket operators interact with OEMs for both mandatory and  voluntary reasons, more specifically for commercial and product process and development and  integration support including information sharing.  With Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, the mandatory and voluntary interaction is on the basis of  product development and integration support. This ensures that the automotive aftermarket  operators also have the capability to produce cybersecure products and services. Automotive  aftermarket operators also mandatorily interact with European institutions for common watch,  ensuring a faire level-playing field amongst relevant actors, and to keep legislations up to date.  For common watch and technical know-how, interactions with Associations, National Competent  Authorities/Road Authorities, and Standardisation bodies is necessary on a voluntary basis.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  16  Associations related to CAM  Figure 6: Associations' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Given Associations’ varying nature, this stakeholder group interacts with the almost the entirety  of the CAM ecosystem: National Competent Authority/Road Authority, European Institution,  Standardisation body, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers,  Smart city operators (e.g. traffic operators), Automotive aftermarket operators, and other  Associations related to CAM.  The frequency of collaboration with other stakeholder groups ranges from a needs-basis,  weekly or monthly basis. In fact, it depends on the core business of the association, and which  aspects of the ecosystem are targeted. For example, an association may organise meetings  with the industry to discuss solutions to the challenges at hand and define mutual interests. It  may also launch a project that necessitates interaction on a daily basis for only a certain given  period. For this latter reason, an association can, for instance, collaborate with National  Competent Authority/Road Authority, European institutions, OEMs, Automotive aftermarket  operators and Smart city operators. In general, associations listed the nature of their  collaboration with the stakeholders mentioned above as voluntary, for the main purposes of  technical standardisation and process/method standardisation.  European Institutions  Figure 7: European institutions' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  17  The responses received from a European-level body in the survey are not representative, for  that reason, the stakeholder interaction for this section is only explored from the receiving end  and the following complementary information from research.  The European Commission in particular, collaborates with the Member States and the industry  to achieve the EU’s ambitious vision for CAM within the Digital Single Market. The European  Commission therefore publishes policy initiatives, develops standards for the European level,  co-funds research and innovation projects, and adopts necessary legislation.22 Furthermore,  according to the NIS Directive23 the European institutions, such as ENISA, are involved in  receiving annual incident report from Road Authorities and ITSs.  For more information on the EU policy context, please refer to A Annex of this report.  National Competent Authority/Road Authority  Figure 8: National competent authorities'/Road authorities' interactions with other CAM  stakeholders  The National Competent Authorities/Road Authorities that replied to the ENISA survey represent  local and national level governments as well as cybersecurity. The information that we received  from this stakeholder group shows that their interactions with the stakeholders of the CAM  ecosystem differ, and so does the frequency.  The local level authority interacts with the central National Competent Authority/Road Authority  on a voluntary basis for the purposes of technical standardisation, process/method  standardisation, and common watch. They do not have further interactions in the CAM  ecosystem. Following, the central National Competent Authority/Road Authority collaborates  with the rest of the stakeholders in the CAM ecosystem. In fact, amongst each other, the  22 Connected and automated mobility in Europe. European Commission.

States of the European union have cybersecurity  agencies (such as ANSSI in France or BSI in Germany) who are in charge prevention, detection  and reaction activities over information security topics for government, business and society.  These cybersecurity agencies, in turn works closely, but voluntarily, with the competent Ministry  for process/method standardisation and common watch. Only the national authority interacts  with the European institutions, on a voluntary basis for the purposes of process/method  standardisation and common watch.  The interaction with Standardisation bodies happens on a voluntary basis stemming from both  the national authority and the cybersecurity agency. Though, the interaction does not happen on  a recurrent basis, the cybersecurity agencies are considered as experts and produce content for  the development of new standards, as well as contributes to technical standardisation.  The national authority’s intent for interaction is also technical standardisation, as well as  process/method standardisation. The national authority has a mandatory interaction with the  Operator of Intelligent Transport System (OITS) as it has a supervisory role of traffic  management (including cybersecurity), and also provides incident reporting and a common  watch. The cybersecurity agency and the national authority cooperate with OEMs and Tier 1  and Tier 2 suppliers as well as automotive aftermarket operators on a voluntary basis. The  former for technical standardisation, while the latter stakeholders for common watch. Smart city  operators (or traffic operators) are also a stakeholder group with which the cybersecurity agency  and national authority interact voluntarily. The former for process/method standardisation and  the latter for common watch. The national authority also cooperates with Associations related to  CAM voluntarily for technical standardisation and common watch, as well as with  communication network and cloud service providers.  Concerning Automotive aftermarket operators, the cooperation is based on common watch  purposes. The national authority’s competences are extensive, and it collaborates weekly with  some stakeholder groups.  Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)  Figure 9: Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Operators of Intelligent Transport System (OITS) interact with different stakeholders, depending  on the parameters which are among others national legal requirements and supply chain  requirements. It is possible for and OITS to have a mandatory interaction with European  institutions for common watch. OITS can also focus on voluntary cooperation with  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  19  standardisation bodies for technical standardisation and process/method standardisation, and  OITS can also interact with competent national IT security agencies on a voluntary basis.  Furthermore, OITS may sometimes cooperate with OEMs and the entirety of the CAM  ecosystem thanks to a country-wide platform and the willingness to contribute to producing an  industry standard. For an OITS, the voluntary interaction is based on common watch and  standardisation.  Standardisation body  Figure 10: Standardisation bodies' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  This standardization body interactions are all made on a voluntary basis, and as regards the  frequency of their collaboration; standardisation issues are discussed at least once a month with  the competent national agency and with European institutions. Therefore, the four stakeholders  that this standardisation body cooperates with are National Competent Authority/Road Authority,  European Institutions, Automotive aftermarket operators and other standardisation bodies on  technical standardisation and process/method standardisation as well as common watch with  the National Competent Authority/Road Authority.  Other  Various other stakeholders have also responded to the ENISA survey. These stakeholders  cover other aspects of the CAM ecosystem, and provide services such as analyses to the  European institutions, contribute to public consultations, act as a point of contact for law  enforcement bodies, take part in European-funded projects, carry out conformity assessments,  take part in the type approval certification process, or even offer trainings.  2.2 CRITICAL CAM SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES  The mainspring of the Connected and Automated Mobility ecosystem is to provide a wide range  of mobility services to users but also all services orbiting around mobility in order to propose a  smoother, end-to-end, intermodal experience. While CAM services will enhance users’ mobility,  enabling to make it greener, safer, smarter, and more inclusive, the connectivity of all vehicles,  infrastructures and devices of the ecosystem provides new capabilities to its stakeholders  through B2B services and legislative driven-measures that enable better management and  monitoring of the CAM assets. While CAM enables better practicality, comfort and safety for  long haul journeys on road and highway networks, its development is essential in order to fully  implement an operational Smart City model. As part of the transportation sector, CAM is subject  to great safety and continuity stakes for which cybersecurity plays a major role since it is  becoming a trigger targeted by malicious parties. In the CAM ecosystem, specifically in the field  of critical safety, it is essential for all stakeholders to cooperate, and building upon the common  standards, interoperability is imperative. Though interaction between stakeholders varies from  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  20  use-case to use-case, the obligation to cooperate will bring stronger involvement from EU  Member States, who through the NIS Directive and their responsibility for road safety control  play a bigger role than in other cybersecurity fields. The C-ITS Strategy focuses on services that  bring benefits on road safety, sustainability and automation. Hence, cybersecurity must be  considered as an essential part of CAM development.  In a landscape where some European cities have a very high population density and  transportation flows are tensed, CAM represents one of the solutions to answer transportation  problematics by transforming the mobility model. The CAM model is increasingly acknowledged  by the ecosystem which is pushing R&D and investments in the sector. New actors are rising to  provide disruptive services while existing forces in the ecosystem are transforming their  business model to adapt to the rapid changes in the way users consume mobility. This model  requires collaboration between CAM stakeholders from OEMs and public transport operators, to  Mobility as a Service start-ups, automotive aftermarket operators and authorities managing  public areas and infrastructures. All the capabilities provided by connectivity and autonomy are  enabled by different technological stacks interacting between each other that are owned and  managed by different stakeholders which illustrate why collaboration between stakeholders is  much required to make the CAM technological frame consistent, as explained in section 2.1.1  Stakeholder interactions. In all technological areas, cybersecurity is a crucial topic to be  addressed in order to ensure security for the infrastructures, the users and the ecosystem. In  the CAM area, the collaboration of stakeholders around the different technological stacks  requires to settle agreement about the cybersecurity model and governance enabling to share  responsibilities regarding risks coverage and ensure that none of the relevant stakeholders  become the weakest link for cybersecurity.  Implementing these technologies and connectivity to public network in mobility and the transport  sector introduces cyber threats that must be managed. Hence, the connected and autonomous  capabilities generate different types and levels of impacts for the stakeholders, users and  ecosystem that need to be assessed and covered. This study enabled to evaluate what are the  most important services and infrastructures following the stakeholders’ point of view.  2.2.1 CAM services  The CAM services were established according to primary data gathered from the stakeholders  through a survey, interviews, and direct feedback. The services are therefore represented  according to the input collected. These CAM services have therefore been categorised following  two criteria and are illustrated in Figure 11:  -  User services (drivers, passengers, pedestrians) and  -  B2B services (OEMs, suppliers, operators, tiers)  Some services can be relevant for both the users and CAM stakeholders.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  21  Figure 11: CAM services mapping  Following the input received from the survey and interviews, the most important services that  were pointed out are those enabling to access or interact with core mobility and driving functions  of connected and autonomous vehicles, mobility devices and road infrastructures that can  cause safety impacts for the users and the surrounding ecosystem:  User services  - Services related to the driving enhancement and core driving functions of vehicles and  mobility devices: These features enable to automatise all functions and actions  previously required to be performed by users in order to foster the autonomous ability of  vehicles and mobility devices. These abilities aim to transform the role of the user from a  driver perspective toward a passenger consuming mobility services model. In the same  fashion as for safety functions provided by ADAS, driving enhancement services rely on  a wide range of sensors and communications through different types of protocols and  networks in order to exchange information between the assets of the CAM ecosystem. In  addition, these services enable to automatise some functionalities such as EV charging  for example which can be managed remotely from the user’s smartphone or enabling the  vehicle to automatically pay for the electricity refill by interacting with the charging  infrastructures. The first concern raised by autonomous capabilities being safety,  cybersecurity is seen as a major stake to ensure these services are implemented  securely in order to enable their reliability and trustworthiness. As well, these services  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  22  are going to generate large amounts of personal data resulting from the use of these  services which also raises consistent privacy concern.  - Services related to the safety management of the users and surrounding ecosystem:  Those services known as Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), provide new  capabilities enabling to better prevent and avoid accidents as well as better assist in  case of accident in order to increase the users’ and the ecosystem’s safety. These  services enable actions from vehicles such as emergency braking or steering to avoid a  collision. They also allow vehicles and mobility devices to contact rescue services and  provide information about unusual events involving users’ safety. Safety being the first  concern of the transport sector, the connectivity and autonomous abilities are an  opportunity for the ecosystem to assist users and better anticipate impromptu events  thanks to V2X communications. However, since these functionalities carry safety  properties, they are subject to regulations such as the General Safety Regulation and  must cope with specific requirements. Also, the automation of safety features introduces  risks since they represent a critical point of failure for CAM assets.  B2B services  - Services related to road infrastructures management: In the CAM ecosystem, vehicles  and mobility devices are gaining new capabilities thanks to connectivity and automation,  and they are interacting with the surroundings infrastructures that provide information  and data enabling to broaden data sets available for computing and decision taking.  Road infrastructures are also increasingly connected and automated, enabling  generation of data about traffic flows and other information needed for management and  maintenance operations. It enables operators to perform analyses about traffic in order  to better adapt flows management, implement dynamic signalling with improved  automation and anticipation as well as optimising all operations related to cleaning,  maintenance or improvement. From a cybersecurity point of view, the ability to control  remotely signalling systems from a potential connection over a public network represent  an important threat. Hence there are important safety and operational impacts that would  result from the take-over of road signalling systems.  Common services  - Services related to vehicle and ecosystem interactions (V2X): As mentioned for the  previous safety and driving enhancement services, mobility is increasingly automated in  order to transform personal vehicles in mobility devices that are shared and autonomous.  The prerequisite for these capabilities is to ensure secure and efficient information and  data exchange between CAM assets. Since CAM assets (vehicles, mobility devices,  intelligent signalling systems, etc.) cannot only rely on sensors and cameras to produce  and analyse data, it is essential that assets exchange data with their surroundings about  their behaviour and environment in order to dispose of sufficient data to guarantee  correct analysis and understanding of situations and events. From a cybersecurity point  of view, integrity of such communication is critical. To ensure that the stakeholders align  on technologies and framework, the ITS Directive24 has been defined to provide a  framework for communications between intelligent transport systems. This Directive aims  to provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic  management and enable various users to be better informed and make safer, more  coordinated and ‘smarter’ use of transport networks.  - Services enabling remote interactions with CAM assets (vehicles, bikes, e-bikes, e-  scooters, etc.): Connectivity of CAM assets unlocked a range of services enabling users  and operators to interact with vehicles and mobility devices remotely from various types  24 Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment  of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.

These services enable to collect many types of  data generated by CAM assets about their location, performance, use history,  parameters and so on, which include personal data related to the users’ activity. In  addition to the data collection, these services can allow to perform remote actions such  as starting, unlocking, managing parameters and some functionalities like smart  charging, remote diagnostic and repair. In this case, cybersecurity risks can trigger  privacy and operational impacts for the users that remain high concerns in the transport  sector.  - Services enabling maintenance of connected and automated vehicles and assets: In the  transport sector, the maintenance of vehicles and infrastructures has always been a key  point in order to maintain the right level of safety and operability. For the past 30 years,  vehicles and infrastructures have increasingly integrated electronic components enabling  enhancement of their functions. Through data collection, these features enable  diagnostic and prognosis of CAM assets. Hence, with connectivity capabilities, it is now  possible to collect data in order to anticipate and plan maintenance and repairs of either  electronical or physical systems. In addition, it is also important to maintain a level-  playing field for all relevant CAM operators and to ensure that there is no market  foreclosure in the name of cybersecurity. Also, a big improvement brought by  connectivity is the ability to update systems’ firmware and software over the air in order  to perform maintenance of systems remotely but also improving or adding functionalities  to assets, making their lifecycle evolutive. The maintenance of CAM assets having a  direct impact on operability and safety for users and their ecosystem, hence integrity of  data used for diagnostic and prognostic must be strictly guaranteed. Considering over  the air updates, cybersecurity is also a main driver when developing and operating such  features. The upcoming UNECE Recommendation on Software Update Processes25  aims to provide a secure and standardised manner for over the air updates to take place,  ensuring that all stakeholders are certified. Since the functioning of assets will be driven  by firmware and software of electronical components, it is crucial that their integrity is  assured to avoid any malicious modification that could have severe impact.  Cybersecurity wise, the services stated above are very important because they directly involve  users and the surrounding ecosystem safety. Misuse or abuse of these services and functions  provide the attackers a direct access to core safety, driving, traffic management and signalling  functions of the CAM ecosystem.  In the CAM ecosystem the assets are interdependent between each other and can be managed  by fleet, which means potential take-over enables malicious actions at a large scale such as  neutralisation or hijacking of a fleet, blockage of road traffic, etc. Indeed, these types of services  are particularly targeted by attackers and some researchers have already proven the feasibility  of these attack scenarios at a large scale in different experimentations. Indeed, the services  below are considered as important by interviewed stakeholders:  User services  - Mobility as a Service (MaaS): Connected and autonomous capabilities are enabling to  develop a new model of mobility which is end-to-end, multimodal and based on the  sharing of vehicles and mobility devices. These services allow users to locate, access  and rent different types of vehicles and mobility devices such as bikes and e-scooters  that are made available in dedicated stations or in free-floating. There are several  business models where vehicles and devices can be rented to a user or to a company,  owned by multiple users and so on. Users access the services through terminals,  applications and platforms where they may have a recurrent subscription or perform one-  off purchases. These sharing and rental services are increasingly integrated within the  25 See more at: https://undocs.org/ECE/TRANS/WP.29/2020/80  https://undocs.org/ECE/TRANS/WP.29/2020/80  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  24  offers of public transport operators in order to cover the last kilometre and enhance the  mobility experience. Hence, they are not used only as a substitution to personal vehicles  or public transports but as a complementary mean. Those renting and sharing services  are supplemented with a stack of services providing users the information enabling them  to better optimise their journey and navigation with these mobility means. These services  enabling users to travel around carry an operational impact for them since they rely on  them for their journey which means principally safety and operational impacts, but there  is also consequent privacy impact since the operators of these services will collect and  store personal data about users and their trips. Financial impact is also to be considered  since user payment information will be stored by service providers and also attackers  may block devices or fleet in the aim to obtain a ransom.  - Infotainment services: For a long time, vehicles have been providing infotainment to  their passengers such as music and radio. Thanks to connectivity and autonomy, these  services have been evolving to represent one of the core values of a vehicle to its users,  which represents its quality and technological advancement. Different strategies have  been implemented by manufacturers for the development of their infotainment systems.  These strategies tend to evolve from in-house development of their operating systems  and applications to a model closer to the smartphone and PC industry where OS and  apps are provided by partners and/or 3rd parties. Vehicle services are becoming more  operational within the vehicle where CAM stakeholders like automotive aftermarket  operators need to have access to the user through the vehicle HMI as well as in-depth  access to vehicle data as close to the source as possible. Effective implementation of  rights and roles is of paramount importance to manage these access needs. Vehicles  now onboard various applications making it able to become the 5th screen of users and  participate in the multi-device interoperability scheme proposed by digital services  providers. In this case, the cybersecurity stakes are similar to those considered for  applications in order to avoid privacy, financial and operational impact for the users.  However, when considering the cybersecurity of vehicles, these services represent a  consequent entry door for malicious parties willing to gain access with services or  functions with a safety impact.  B2B services  - Fleet management services: The various business models emerging from Mobility as a  Service but also historic actors such as car renters require for the operators to manage  fleets of vehicles and mobility devices. Connectivity provides the opportunity to operators  to manage remotely their assets in order to optimise and facilitate their operations. In the  same way as a user would obtain data for one device, these services enable to monitor a  whole fleet, obtain localisation, collect data about use (distance covered or duration of  the rental), manage rental by unlocking, locking, monitor fuel or battery levels and so on.  These services enable to digitalise operators’ operations but also enable faster and  easier access to vehicles and mobility devices for users by making them independent  from a physical rental agency. From a cybersecurity point of view the main impacts will  affect stakeholders’ operations in case of misuse or attack on their fleet management  services.  In the CAM ecosystem, most services provided to users and between stakeholders rely on  various actors involved in physical devices and infrastructures operations but also digital assets  and back-ends. The delivery of mobility services as well as services to manage stakeholders’  operations or to enhance user experience impacts the transport industry reliability. These  impacts are, for example, traffic and passenger flow fluidity, which also impacts users’ privacy  since a large amount of personal data can be collected, stored and processed. Moreover, since  these services might be executed by the same OS or systems as services carrying safety  impacts, they could be used as an entry door to perform an attack that could harm users or their  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  25  direct environment. Therefore, cybersecurity should be considered an important part of the  ecosystem.  The CAM model, thanks to capabilities brought by connectivity of assets and IoT but also by the  digitalisation of user interactions through applications, enabled stakeholders to develop and  propose large sets of digital services gravitating around core mobility services. These services  have been stated as less important by the interviewed stakeholders:  User services  - Home management services: Since vehicles are becoming increasingly connected and  able to act as personal devices, CAM stakeholders are partnering with IoT and home  automation actors in order to integrate use-cases where vehicles and mobility devices  interact with home appliances in order to trigger automated action such as thermostat  management, energetical optimisation, and doors and shutters operation.  Common services  - Insurance management services: The new usages associated to CAM are transforming  the way users consume mobility services which means they also need to be  contractually covered by insurances answering the challenges brought by these new  use-cases. On one side, these new usages require an evolution of insurance offers to be  adapted to a model where assets are increasingly shared and autonomous, and on the  other side, connectivity capabilities enable to collect data about the use of asset that can  be processed as inputs to manage insurance contracts. The ability to capture, store and  analyse behavioural, mobility and data generated from the connected car, mobility  device or road infrastructure will be a key factor to enable insurance management in  CAM. This will serve as an enabler to build connected insurance products individually  tailored, going forward (e.g. pay as you drive insurance, traffic incident analysis). In this  model, insurance companies become a 3rd party consuming data produced by the CAM  ecosystem with relatively high privacy and financial impact for the end user, meaning  that confidentiality and integrity will be high stakes for the implementation of these  services.  - Advertising services: Connected and autonomous vehicles and mobility devices  increasingly integrate screen for infotainment but also interact with users through mobile  applications. CAM stakeholders provide various services to users and these interfaces  have started to be used as a display for advertising these services, make  recommendations to users or highlight potential points of interest over the users’ route.  - Services related to security systems: For vehicles and mobility devices for which theft  is a common issue, connectivity enabled to integrate functionalities improving assets  security against malicious acts and theft thanks to integrated video protection,  localisation and tracking, and hardened anti-theft systems.  2.2.2 CAM systems and infrastructures  In order to implement the various services of the CAM model, many technical stacks, depending  on different stakeholders, are implemented and interact among each other. These stacks  support the systems and infrastructures enabling interactions between the CAM stakeholders  and assets, but also storage and processing of data. These stacks go from Operational  Technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) and onboard system, to devices and back-ends  supporting digital assets but also infrastructures supporting specific communication networks  and cybersecurity is an essential part which flows through the whole ecosystem.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  26  Figure 12: CAM systems and infrastructures mapping  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  27  The fact that the delivery of CAM services relies on systems and infrastructures depending on  different stakeholders defines the complexity of the CAM technical ecosystem. Technologies  developed and used by a stakeholder might depend on the ones used on another stack but  could also require harmonisation between a group of stakeholders in order to ensure  interoperability. For example, regarding the communication between vehicles and other  infrastructures (V2X), the technological framework for communication between assets has been  formalised within the ITS Directive26 in order to ensure that all the stakeholders standardise the  technologies used to implement these communications. Availability of standards is critical to  develop future-proof, scalable and sustainable solutions and to push forward innovation in the  CAM area.  From a cybersecurity standpoint, the different systems and infrastructures do not carry the same  criticality. In the CAM ecosystem, cybersecurity requires a holistic approach in order to cover  risks, which means that each stakeholder at its level plays a role in the risk coverage. In some  cases, the cybersecurity approach must be coordinated between stakeholders in order to define  interfaces and perimeters of responsibility over systems and infrastructures protection.  Depending on the stakeholder activity, the systems and infrastructure under its sphere of  influence will differ, however, they might still have requirements regarding cybersecurity  measures and risk management over systems and infrastructures with which they have  interfaces. Additionally, interoperability is a leading factor for the functioning and development of  the CAM ecosystem, meaning to ensure proper level of cybersecurity is required to ensure  integrity and confidentiality of data flows between components and actors, as well as ensuring  the compatibility and secure operation of different products and services managed by different  CAM stakeholders.  A main point to address when securing CAM systems and infrastructures is the attack surface.  In order to perform an attack, malicious parties will need an entry point that will be the first step  to put in place the complete the attack path enabling to make the compromise successful. Then  all systems and infrastructures that are exposed on public networks, provide an applicative  interface or with a physical access to an interface or port will be considered as critical from a  cybersecurity point of view. Then the systems and assets that carry functionalities or services  that may generate a safety impact shall also be considered as critical since in the typical  adversary model, they will be defined as one of the main targets malicious parties will aim to  compromise, in addition to cyberattacks resulting in vehicle theft.  During the study, interviewees belonging to different stakeholder groups provided insights on  which categories of systems and infrastructures they consider as critical regarding  cybersecurity, and hence, consider that ensuring their protection is a priority for the ecosystem:  -  Tiers and road infrastructures  o Traffic management and signalling systems  o Road infrastructures systems  o Intelligent roadside systems  -  Interactions and interoperability  o V2X communication systems  o Data exchange and collaboration systems and platforms  o 3rd party services systems and platforms  All systems and infrastructures part of a CAM Cybersecurity Management System perimeter  -  Road vehicles & mobility devices  o Onboard cybersecurity systems  26 Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment  of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.

These challenges are:  1. Governance and cybersecurity integration into corporate activities.  Cybersecurity governance is an organisational and technical challenge for all  stakeholders. In the CAM ecosystem especially, digital technology and connectivity are  tangled with physical transportation. New skills are necessary within organisations,  with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. A cybersecurity team is needed to be  relied upon, to manage risks and address potential vulnerabilities.  2. Lack of top management support and cybersecurity prioritisation.  There are too few interactions between cybersecurity executives and corporate  executives, leading to insufficient financial support (e.g. for research & development,  awareness and training programmes, operational activities) to ensure that  cybersecurity is a key topic in the lifecycle of CAM products and services.  3. Technical complexity in the CAM ecosystem.  Given the large array of actors and their objectives in the CAM ecosystem, the  implementation and management of cybersecurity and risk management prove to be a  challenge. In addition, it is also a difficulty to find the correct liability measures for the  final product, as components stem from many parties, and retracing the fault can be  nearly impossible. In addition, due to the competitive nature of the automotive industry,  obtaining cybersecurity information for product development and integration is difficult  to achieve for certain SMEs CAM stakeholders.  4. Technical constraints for implementation of security into CAM.  In the CAM ecosystem, there is a large array of technological diversity, and the  securing of CAM products and services requires an assessment of a wide variety of  systems and technical assets in order to implement the necessary cybersecurity  measures to counter possible attacks. Cybersecurity needs to be addressed in the  early conception phases of a product or service to ensure that there are no gaps or  27 Upcoming, to receive a copy, please contact the authors.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  29  vulnerabilities. Due to the highly interdependent nature of the automotive domain, this  requires information sharing between different CAM stakeholders.  5. Fragmented regulatory environment.  In order to manage cybersecurity risks, there are a large number of standards and  regulations to comply with, especially given the mix of local and international  environments. In Europe, regulations tend to be harmonised by the Member States,  but there are also countries with specific and independent regulations. An organisation  may therefore be subject to different schemes of one product range. The current  regulatory framework does not include any test requirements or performance criteria  for cybersecurity evaluation/assessment.  6. Lack of expertise and skilled resources for CAM cybersecurity.  The lack of human resources with expertise in cybersecurity (e.g. software security,  network security, cryptography, embedded systems, operational technology, etc.) on  the market is a major obstacle that hinders the adoption of security measures specific  to the CAM products and solutions. Furthermore, companies and organisations face a  strong competition to recruit the desired profiles.  7. Lack of information sharing and coordination on security issues among the CAM  actors.  Considering data access and exchange within the ecosystem, trust between parties  and data governance is a key challenge to address in order to implement a secure,  competitive and lasting cybersecurity model  As discovered in the 2.1.1 Stakeholder interactions section of this document, the stakeholders  in the CAM ecosystem are intertwined. For that reason, so are the cybersecurity challenges that  they are facing, which are not standardised. The recommendations proposed by ENISA aim to  guide the CAM ecosystem stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement and  harmonisation of cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem in the European Union.  2.3.1 Cybersecurity measures  The section presents CAM oriented security measures along with their level of implementation  by the CAM stakeholders. The list of security measures (presented in Figure 13 and detailed in  B Annex) was established through the analysis of relevant documents and standards identified  during desk research. The analysis identified the most important cybersecurity aspects of the  CAM ecosystem and the resulting 33 security measures issued from the NIS Cooperation  Group28, were classified into five categories29: Governance; Risk & Ecosystem Management;  Detection & Reaction; Maintenance in Security Condition; IS/IT/OT security measures. The full  overview is presented in Figure 13.  28 The 33 cybersecurity measures are issued from the NIS Cooperation Group and are aligned with the NIS Directive.

For this reason, the security measures do not apply to all stakeholders, rather it depends on the  services and systems that they use. The survey respondents were asked to assess the level of  implementation of security measures between not implemented, partially implemented,  implemented, or implemented and controlled, as well as don’t know/no opinion. These answers  were also chosen by the stakeholders depending on the risk assessments that need to be  conducted, according to the perceived level of risk. Some organisations, such as the  aftermarket, were still in the process of evaluation standards and legislation  (drafting/implementation), for that reason, they may not have reached the required level of  implementation. Furthermore, as a general comment, it was pointed out that globally acceptable  testing processes that are objective and traceable are missing in the CAM ecosystem.  The below sub-categories present the five domains of CAM security measures. In this chapter,  a number of selected security measures are discovered in-depth. The data used in the analysis  below is indicative and is therefore meant to give only an insight on the answers of the  respondents of the survey.  The described measures are discussed because the answers received from the participants  showed relatively lower score compared to other security measures and need further  development.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  31  Governance  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 14: Survey answer about the Governance Analysis  Under the governance umbrella, two cybersecurity measures will be further discussed, due to  their low overall implementation:  -  Cybersecurity management system audit  -  Information system/product security indicators.  An operator regularly audits the cybersecurity management system it has implemented. As part  of their cybersecurity management systems, stakeholders should implement organisations and  processes to identify, among others, the threats vulnerabilities, and risks they are facing. Any  shortcomings may pose risks, and these may materialise and impact the areas in which the  organisation is active, for example, governance, data security, physical security, third-party  management. Though, this assessment is difficult to organise as it requires to cover many  business process, information systems and technologies, and requires an involvement of all  businesses and associated top management. This organisation should be audited regularly in  order to ensure its processes are relevant and efficient for risk management. The stakeholders  responding to the survey had mixed views given the difficulty to organise auditing, including  privacy issues that need to be considered, among others. OEMs’ level of implementation of  cybersecurity management system audit is implemented and sometimes also controlled. Tier 1  and Tier 2 suppliers, OITS, National Competent Authorities/Road Authorities, standardisation  bodies as well as associations have different practices among themselves, ranging throughout  the four levels of implementation.  As for information system/product security indicators, these are a challenge for all CAM  stakeholders within the ecosystem. ENISA, in 2018, published a report on Good practices for  identifying and assessing cybersecurity interdependencies particularly between Operators of  Essential Services (OES), Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and National Competent Authorities  (NCA).30 It provides a description of interdependencies, highlights risk assessment practices,  proposes a framework as well as defines good practices for assessing interdependencies. The  CAM ecosystem stakeholders mostly responded (not taking into account don’t know answers)  that information system/product security indicators are implemented and controlled, which is  especially true for Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in the CAM area, as well as OEMs. OITS and  30 Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs.

Retrieved from:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-on-interdependencies-between-oes-and-dsps  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-on-interdependencies-between-oes-and-dsps  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  32  National Competent Authorities/Road Authorities are on the other end of the spectrum, with  most answers of partially or not at all implemented for this specific security measure.  Ecosystem Management  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 15: Survey answer about the Ecosystem  The four following security measures related to the management of the CAM ecosystem will be  further discussed:  -  Information system/product security accreditation;  -  Communication with competent authorities and CSIRTs.  According to interviews conducted with the CAM stakeholders, the security measure related to  the security accreditation of information system and product is mainly implemented by Tier 1  and Tier 2 suppliers and OEMs, and the automotive aftermarket. Otherwise, in general,  operators do not necessarily accredit their product(s) prior to release. This can be explained by  the fact that security accreditation of products is not yet mandatory for connected mobility  related services in Europe. Additionally, it has to be acknowledged that cost to certify a product  is something that should be always taken on a risk-based approach, as not all products should  and can be certified.  The communication of stakeholders with the competent authorities and CSIRTs is part of the  ecosystem management framework. Nevertheless, there are not a lot of CSIRTs exist with  knowledge for CAM. The stakeholders are invited to set up a service enabling them to take  note, without undue delay, of the information sent by their competent national authority  concerning incidents, vulnerabilities, threats and relevant mapping (up-to-date inventory of CIS,  interconnections of CIS with third-party networks, etc.). The CAM stakeholders have confirmed  that security incidents are collected and treated, but the process of sending incidents and  potential threats to their national competent authority is not mandatory for connected mobility-  related services at this time. As a result, very few stakeholders have implemented this security  measure focusing on communication between operators and authorities. Moreover, many  stakeholders, apart from OEMs, do not have specific standards for their products.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  33  Detection & Reaction  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 16: Survey answer about the Detection and Reaction  The three following security measures related to the management of the CAM ecosystem will be  further discussed:  -  Logs correlation and analysis  -  Logging  As concerns logs correlation and analysis, an operator creates a system that mines the events  recorded by the logging system installed on each of the CIS/product in order to detect events  that affect CIS/product security. There are different types of logs (e.g. system, network,  technical, monitoring). For OITS, device behaviour is monitored with systematic processes  when measuring logs correlation and analysis. In the CAM ecosystem, the correlation and  analysis are tricky to set up as it can be on the vehicle, at the platform level, or even the  infrastructure level, which means employing different computational resources. In this case as  well, this security measure mostly revolves around OITS, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and OEMs,  where associations have not expressed an opinion or reported that they do not implement this  measure.  An operator, as part of the detection and reaction security measures, should also carry out  logging, which is setting up a logging system on each CIS/product in order to record security-  relevant events. An OITS for example, collects system logs for security, which are then cross  analysed from different sources to detect security incidents. This happens systematically on  servers, but yet to be installed on embedded devices due to feasibility, costs and system  capabilities. These challenges are common throughout the ecosystem as analysing the  collected (or logged) data necessitate resources, technical skills and awareness. In addition to  OITS, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and OEMs have also mostly implemented the logging security  measure.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  34  Maintenance  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 178: Survey answer about the Maintenance  The security maintenance procedure is the sole security measure under the maintenance  domain. It refers to an operator developing and implementing a procedure for security  maintenance in accordance with its ISSP. To this purpose, the procedure defines the conditions  enabling the minimum security level to be maintained for CIS/products resources.  In the EU, there is legislation covering the fair access to repair and maintenance information by  independent repairers, i.e. information that an OEM needs to be made available to automotive  aftermarket operators to repair a vehicle.31 However, at present, “there is no sector specific  approach on the protection of the vehicle against cyberattacks”, as stated in the legislation. The  large majority of all respondents do not know or have no opinion on this security measure (incl.  standardisation bodies, associations). Nevertheless, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers (to a smaller  extent OEMs and OITS too) have mostly responded with partially implemented and implemented  and controlled.  31 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee, the Committee of the Regions: On the road to automated mobility: An EU strategy for mobility of the future.

Figure 19: Survey answer about IS/IT/OT security measures  The following Information System (IS) / Information Technology (IT) / Operational Technology  (OT) security measures of the CAM ecosystem will be further discussed:  -  Industrial controlling systems  For industrial control systems (ICS), the operator takes the particular security requirements for  ICS into account. ICS include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems,  distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as skid-  mounted Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are often found in the industrial control sectors.  Control systems are important for critical infrastructures and are mutually dependable in the  CAM ecosystem. These systems, integrated with new IT capabilities, need to be highly secure  and tailored to the environment. Over half of the respondents do not know or have no opinion  about this particular security measure. Nevertheless, among the rest of the respondents,  especially Tier and Tier 2 suppliers, OEMs and OITS have partially implemented or even  implemented and control this measure.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  36  2.3.2 Standards  In the CAM ecosystem, developing technologies that are interoperable, safe and secure is a  main challenge. As it has been done in the automotive industry in the last decades, CAM  stakeholders are collaborating with various standardisation bodies in order to create standards  that help to homogenise technologies used in the different technological stacks of the  ecosystem, but also to standardise security measures, process and activities regarding  cybersecurity of the CAM assets’ lifecycle. These standards have different objectives:  -  Standardise conception & development practices trough frameworks;  -  Provide standardised processes for quality, cybersecurity and safety management;  -  Provide frameworks for interoperability of systems between stakeholders;  -  Provide standardised cybersecurity concepts, measures and solutions.  In the CAM industry, the most represented standardisation bodies are ISO (International  Organization for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunication Standard Institute),  IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association), and SAE  (Society of Automotive Engineers).  Figure 20: CAM standards mapping  ISO standards are very transversal and cover themes of general cybersecurity processes  (ISO/IEC 27k32) or quality management (ISO 900133), cybersecurity recommendations for IT  security (ISO/IEC 1540834 & ISO/IEC 1804535) that are applicable for all CAM stakeholders to  very specific development standards for automotive cybersecurity process (ISO/SAE 2143436),  automotive safety process and recommendations for on-board systems (ISO 2626237 &  32 See more at: https://iso27001security.com/html/iso27000.html  33 See more at: https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html  34 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws- regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408  35 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws- regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-18045  36 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  37 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html  https://iso27001security.com/html/iso27000.html https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-18045 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-18045 https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  37  2144838) which are more focused around OEMs, their supply chain, and other relevant CAM  stakeholder that interact with the vehicle. The currently in development standard on road  vehicles: software update engineering is also relevant for CAM stakeholders (ISO/AWI  2408939).  ETSI, especially the TC ITS40 committee, is focusing around standardisation of  telecommunications and indeed developing multiple standards intended to provide guidance  and frameworks for the implementation of secure communication between CAM assets such as  vehicles and road infrastructures (ETSI ITS-G541). More specifically, C-ITS, automotive radars,  and dedicated short-range communications are addressed related to ITS. ETSI standards about  telecommunications are also very important for interoperability purposes.  IEEE standards are generally focused on Intelligent Transport Systems and Automotive  communications (IEEE 802.11bd42) but also providing specific guidance for implementing  security measures when developing automotive software (IEEE-ISTO 610043) or in-vehicle  wireless access (IEEE 1609.244).  Within stakeholders’ groups such as the automotive industry, companies are collaborating in  order to standardise conception practices and provide frameworks about on-board systems,  software and intelligent mobility development. Regarding cybersecurity, AUTOSAR (Automotive  Open System Architecture) provides different frameworks relevant within CAM ecosystem such  as cryptography implementation (40245, 43846), secure on-board communications (65447) and  functional safety features (66448).  Depending on their activities, stakeholders are more or less involved with standardisation  bodies. While some standards are very focused for stakeholders intended to conceive and  develop CAM systems and infrastructures, standards providing general guidance about  cybersecurity processes are relevant for all stakeholders because they provide a generic  approach for risk management which enable the stakeholders to better identify and manage  risks over their products lifecycle and operations.  38 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70939.html  39 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/77796.html  40 See more at: https://www.etsi.org/technologies/automotive-intelligent-transport  41 See more at: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/302663/01.03.00_20/en_302663v010300a.pdf  42 See more at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723326  43 See more at: https://uptane.github.io/papers/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html  44 See more at: https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1609_2-2016.html  45 See more at: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4- 3/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoServiceManager.pdf  46 See more at: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4- 1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoAbstractionLibrary.pdf  47 See more at: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4- 3/AUTOSAR_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication.pdf  48 https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/19-11/AUTOSAR_EXP_FunctionalSafetyMeasures.pdf  https://www.iso.org/standard/70939.html https://www.iso.org/standard/77796.html https://www.etsi.org/technologies/automotive-intelligent-transport https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/302663/01.03.00_20/en_302663v010300a.pdf https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723326 https://uptane.github.io/papers/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1609_2-2016.html https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoServiceManager.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoServiceManager.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoAbstractionLibrary.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoAbstractionLibrary.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/19-11/AUTOSAR_EXP_FunctionalSafetyMeasures.pdf  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  38  3. CONCLUSIONS  Regarding current security measures and challenges encountered, stakeholders had mixed  views as cybersecurity maturity within CAM ecosystem is quite heterogeneous regarding the  diversity of actors involved in the ecosystem. This also results in the diversity of cybersecurity  regulations that may apply to the different types of stakeholders depending on their origin,  though, the regulatory frame regarding cybersecurity over CAM ecosystem remain light. When  being developed, this regulatory frame should specify what standards are preferred in order to  comply with requirements defined. This shall aim to specify what cybersecurity measures  should be considered the acceptable minimum for CAM actors in order to provide a certain level  of secure products and services.  A future CAM system would need to rely on suitable and robust security mechanisms.  Therefore, the cybersecurity challenges identified, as well as the proposed recommendations  have to be covered by CAM stakeholders. For now, it cannot be reliably forecasted whether this  is to be done mostly in the context of one overarching, maybe even mandatory framework, or if  these aspects will mostly be covered in more individual concepts tailored to specific  cybersecurity domains within the CAM ecosystem. In relation to type approval processes,  OEMs have a well-defined framework associated to Regulation (EU) 2018/85849, other  stakeholders nevertheless need to conform to existing and future type approval processes.  As of today, there is no global cybersecurity governance framework covering the whole CAM  ecosystem that propose an end to end model to cover cybersecurity risks. Hence, stakeholders  generally collaborate through standardisation bodies and associations in order to develop  homogenised cybersecurity frameworks and measures. Additionally, stakeholders collaborate  through their contractual relationship that enable to formalise responsibilities regarding  cybersecurity and risk management. However, these collaborations do not cover all aspects of  cybersecurity for CAM and some specific topics are not considered yet, especially in some  technical cybersecurity areas such as vulnerability disclosure, involvement of the national  CSIRTs and information sharing. The CAM industry and stakeholders should work together in  order to ensure technical terms are standardised and/or minimum requirements are agreed, to  ensure all stakeholder can set-up cybersecurity activities specific to CAM assets using common  methods and vocabulary.  49 Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market  surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such  vehicles.

These include policy and legal  initiatives, co-funding and/or launching research and innovation projects.  In 2016, the European Commission adopted the European Strategy on Cooperative Intelligent  Transport Systems (C-ITS).51 C-ITS refers to the group of technologies and applications that  allow data exchange through various wireless communication technologies. In this light, the  Strategy set out to deploy vehicles that communicate with each other (V2V) and with  infrastructure (V2I) on roads in the European Union. Further elements of the Strategy included,  among others, supporting various communication technologies, addressing security and data  protection issues, developing a legal framework, and ensuring cooperation among the Member  States. The EU also put in place a learning-by-doing approach, such as with the C-ROADS  platform, a joint initiative by the Member States and road operators, in order to test and  implement C-ITS services.52 The platform as well as projects are co-funded by the EU through  the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).  In 2016 as well, the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS  Directive)53 was adopted and entered into force in August. The Member States then transposed  the Directive into national law in May 2018. The NIS Directive is the first EU-wide legislation on  cybersecurity, providing the legal measures boosting the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  The Directive focuses on three parts: national capabilities, cross-border collaboration, and  national supervision of critical sectors. The transport sector includes rail, air, water, and road  and the Directive calls to identify the relevant road authorities and Operators of Intelligent  Transport Systems. ENISA continuously supports the implementation of the NIS Directive in the  road transport sector through, for example, the publication of reports on good practices for  cybersecurity of smart cars, collaborating with DG MOVE through the C-ITS Platform, and the  regular engagement with industrial stakeholders.  The two ENISA reports of good practices for cybersecurity of smart cars are as follows. ENISA,  in 2017, published a study on Cybersecurity and Resilience of Smart Cars54. The report  identifies good practices that ensure the security of smart cars against cyber threats, taking into  account that smart cars’ security should also guarantee safety. The three categories of good  practices identified were policy and standards, organisational measures, and security functions.  ENISA proposed recommendations for the different stakeholders in the smart car ecosystem,  comprising smart car manufacturers, tiers, aftermarket vendors, insurance companies, industry  50 As reported in 2018.

In 2019, ENISA then complemented the above-  mentioned report by broadening the scope to (semi-)autonomous cars and Vehicle-to-  Everything (V2X) communications. The published report on Good Practices for Security of  Smart Cars55 highlights the importance of cybersecurity for connected cars. The report identifies  the asset and threat taxonomy of connected and autonomous vehicles, the threats targeting the  smart cars ecosystem as well as the potential security measures, complemented by good  practices mitigating them.  In 2017 through 2018, after years of negotiation the European Parliament, Commission and  Council of Ministers agreed on the adoption of three Mobility Packages.56 These Mobility  Packages are a collection of three initiatives that aim to implement changes to EU road  transport rules. Mobility Package 1 covers various aspects of the industry, including social,  enforcement, technical, and regulatory issues. Mobility Package 2, also named Clean Mobility  Package, contains legislative proposals for the transport sector that aim for low and zero  emission vehicles and fight climate change. Finally, Mobility Package 3 encompasses legislative  proposals in the areas of safe, clean and connected mobility.  In 2018, the Commission published a Communication on the road to automated mobility: An EU  strategy for mobility of the future.57 Europe aims to become a world leader in the deployment of  connected and automated mobility, and also insists on bringing down road fatalities, reducing  harmful emission, and decreasing congestion. The final goal is full automation and safe  driverless mobility, with a timeline envisaged to achieve this by 2030, followed by the so-called  Vision Zero58: no road fatalities on European roads by 2050.  In 2019, the European Commission launched the EU-wide Cooperative, Connected, Automated  and Autonomous Mobility (CCAM) Single Platform, consisting of both private and public  stakeholders. The CCAM Single Platform is a joint directive of Directorate-General for Mobility  and Transport (DG MOVE), Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology (DG CNECT), Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship  and SMEs (DG GROW) and Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (DG RTD). The  platform advises and supports the Commission for open road testing, as well as coordinated  research, piloting, testing and deployment activities. Furthermore, there are six working groups  for the different facets of CCAM: WG1 Develop an EU agenda for testing; WG2 Coordination and  cooperation of R&I; WG3 Physical and digital road infrastructure; WG4 Road safety; WG5  Connectivity and digital infrastructure for CCAM; WG6 Cybersecurity and access to in-vehicle  data linked to CCAM.  55 Good Practices for Security of Smart Cars.

Governance  Security measures Description  Standards application  The operator refers to standards in its assessment of cybersecurity  risks and the mitigations, as well as when describing the process  employed.  Cybersecurity management  system  The operator has a Cyber Security Management System in place that  considers the whole lifecycle of the Critical Information System (CIS) /  product, particularly development, production and postproduction.  Cybersecurity management  system audit  The operator regularly audits its Cyber Security Management System.  Information system / product  security policy  The operator establishes, maintains up-to-date and implements an  information system security policy (ISSP) approved by senior  management, guaranteeing high level endorsement of the policy.  Information system / product  security indicators  For each CIS / product and according to a number of indicators and  assessment methods, the operator evaluates its compliance with its  ISSP. Indicators may relate to the risk management organisation’s  performance, the maintaining of resources in secure conditions, etc.  Human resource security  The established information system security policies set up a CIS /  product security awareness raising program for all staff and a security  training program for employees with CIS related responsibilities.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  44  Risk & Ecosystem management  Security measures Description  Information system / product  security risk analysis  The operator conducts and regularly updates a risk analysis,  identifying its Critical Information Systems (CIS) / products  underpinning the provision of the essential services and identifies the  main risks to these CIS.  Information system / product  security audit  The operator establishes and updates a policy and procedures for  performing information system and product security assessments and  audits of critical assets and CIS, taking into account the regularly  updated risks analysis.  Information system / product  security accreditation  The operator accredits the CIS / product prior to release.  Ecosystem relations / Suppliers  risk management  The operator establishes a policy towards its relations with its  ecosystem in order to mitigate the potential risks identified. This  includes suppliers in particular but is not limited to interfaces between  the CIS and third parties. In addition to risk identification, such a  policy should also include sharing of relevant interoperability and  compatibility related cybersecurity information for product  development and integration.  Ecosystem / Suppliers mapping  The operator establishes a mapping of its ecosystem and specifies  responsibilities sharing, including internal and external stakeholders,  including but not limited to suppliers, in particular those with access to  or managing operator’s critical assets / products.  Communication with competent  authorities and CSIRTs  The operator implements a service that enables it to take note,  without undue delay, of information sent out by its national competent  authority concerning incidents, vulnerabilities, threats and relevant  mappings (up-to-date inventory of CIS, interconnections of CIS with  third-party networks, etc.).  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  45  Detection & Reaction  Security measures Description  Crisis management  organisation  The operator defines in its ISSP the organisation for crisis management  in case of security incidents or cyber-attacks and the continuity of  organisation’s activities.  Crisis management process  The operator defines in its ISSP the processes for crisis management  which the crisis management organisation will implement in case of  security incidents or cyber-attacks and the continuity of an  organisation’s activities.  Information system / product  security incident detection  The operator sets up a security incident detection system for detection  of incidents or cyber-attacks that affect the functioning or the security of  its CIS / products, in accordance with its ISSP.  Information system / product  security incident response  The operator creates and keeps up-to-date and implements a  procedure for handling, response to and analyses of incidents that  affect the functioning or the security of its CIS, in accordance with its  ISSP.  Information system / product  security incident Report  The operator creates and keeps up-to-date and implements procedures  for incidents’ reporting.  Logging  The operator sets up a logging system on each CIS / product in order to  record security relevant events.  Logs correlation and analysis  The operator creates a log correlation and analysis system that mines  the events recorded by the logging system installed on each of the CIS /  product in order to detect events that affects CIS / product security.  Business continuity  management  In accordance with its ISSP, the operator defines objectives and  strategic guidelines regarding business continuity management, in case  of IT security incident.  Disaster recovery management  In accordance with its ISSP, the operator defines objectives and  strategic guidelines regarding disaster recovery management, in case  of a severe IT security incident.  Maintenance in security condition  Security measures Description  Security maintenance  procedure  The operator develops and implements a procedure for security  maintenance in accordance with its ISSP. To this purpose, the  procedure defines the conditions enabling the minimum-security level to  be maintained for CIS / products resources.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  46  IS/IT/OT security measures  Security measures Description  Information security  management  The relevant information security information about Critical Information  Systems (CIS) and products is managed by an information security  management system. The operator protects its sensitive documents and  files on dedicated file servers with adequate protection measures.  Cryptography  In its ISSP, the operator establishes and implements a policy and  procedures related to cryptography, in view of ensuring adequate and  effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity  and/or integrity of information in its CIS (use of standard, security controls  shall be implemented for storing cryptographic keys, etc.).  Access rights  Among the rules defined in its systems security policy, the operator grants  access rights to a user or an automated process only when that access is  strictly necessary for the user to carry out their mission or for the  automated process to carry out its technical operations based on the  principle of least access privilege.  Identification  For identification, the operator sets up unique accounts and supporting  authentication schemes for users or for automated processes that need to  access resources of its CIS. Unused or no longer needed accounts are to  be deactivated. A regular review process should be established.  Administration accounts  The operator sets up specific accounts for the administration, to be used  only for administrators that are carrying out administration operations  (installation, configuration, management, maintenance, etc.) on its CIS.  These accounts are kept on an up-to-date list.  Administration information  systems  Hardware and software resources used for administration purposes are  managed and configured by the operator, or, where appropriate, by the  service provider that the operator has authorised to carry out  administration operations.  System segregation  The operator segregates its systems in order to limit the propagation of IT  security incidents within its systems or subsystems.  Systems configuration  The operator only installs services and functionalities or connects  equipment which are essential for the functioning and the security of its  CIS.  Traffic filtering  The operator filters traffic flows circulating in its Critical Information  Systems (CIS). The operator therefore forbids traffic flows that are not  needed for the functioning of its systems and that are likely to facilitate an  attack.  Industrial control systems  The operator takes the particular security requirements for ICS (control  systems, SCADA systems, etc) into account.  Physical and environmental  security  The operator prevents unauthorised physical access, damage and  interference to the organisation’s information and information processing  facilities.

INTRODUCTION  The Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM)1 sector is an entire ecosystem of services,  operations and infrastructures comprised of a variety of actors and stakeholders. The  ecosystem brings about transformation in the industries as well as in the demands of citizens  who look for safer, cleaner, more sustainable, and easier transportation. CAM has the potential  to change the way society views transportation, benefit from digitalisation to connect vehicles  with their surroundings and with the drivers, as well as contribute to solving congestion,  reducing pollution, diminish road accidents, and improve access to mobility.  There are, therefore, two varying but complementing aspects in the ecosystem: connectivity and  automation. A connected vehicle relies on the technologies installed in cars, buses, other  vehicles and the infrastructure surrounding it, as well as people. A connected vehicle can also  wirelessly (e.g. 4g/5g and/or WIFI) exchange data and information with the vehicle manufacturer  and third-party service providers. The notion of V2X (i.e. vehicle-to-everything) therefore  includes2:   Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)   Vehicle-to-infrastructure and vice-versa (V2I and I2V)   Vehicle-to-mobile network (V2N) and infrastructure-to-mobile network (I2N)   Vehicle-to-devices (V2D)   Vehicle-to-persons (V2P)   Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)  The automated aspect concerns the vehicles, where safety-critical control functions are carried  out without driver input. Several years ago, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)  where only found in very few vehicles. Today, the mass market also includes, among others,  (adaptive) cruise control, cameras, self-parking, blind spot detection and vehicle emergency  braking. Drivers are quickly starting to rely on automation in various situations. There are five  levels of automation3 that range from driver assistance systems supporting the driver to the  vehicle assuming all driving functions, therefore all persons becoming passengers in the vehicle  without interaction with the car to drive it. Most manufacturers are currently aiming to reach  Level 2 and 3: Partly Automated Driving and Highly Automated Driving (incl. Tesla4, BMW5,  Mercedes-Benz6).  Cybersecurity is crucial in the evolution of the CAM ecosystem. The increasing connectivity and  automation of vehicles and surrounding infrastructure brings about novel cybersecurity  challenges, threats, and risks. The CAM ecosystem requires cybersecurity standards and  cybersecurity measures by the stakeholders that provide for a safe infrastructure and services  delivery. All stakeholders in CAM must ensure that data and technical structures have the  necessary protection, safety and security measures for protection of the systems. Furthermore,  cybersecurity is becoming more defined in this area through the adoption of both national and  international standards and regulations in Europe and throughout the world.  1 Connected and automated mobility in Europe.

These stakeholders have to  cooperate to achieve the various indexes of mobility and to arrive at the final goal of full degree  of automation and connectivity, and thus automated driving in a cyber secure, trustworthy and  safe manner. As part of the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems and Services (C-ITS)7,  the vehicle-to-everything (V2X)8 notion relies on various communication technologies. This V2X  communication can only be made possible through the cooperation of the whole industry, which  is critical for the success of CAM. Action areas for CAM therefore lie in cybersecurity,  innovation, infrastructure, legislation, interconnectivity, and data governance.  1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the CAM cybersecurity  ecosystem and more particularly to map the key stakeholders and relevant bodies and  organisations in the European Union, as well provide an overview of the critical services and  systems and infrastructures. It also complements the Recommendations for the Security of  Connected and Automated Mobility report of ENISA9, which depicts the key cybersecurity  challenges in the CAM sector according to stakeholders concerned. This report supports the  CAM area by proposing conclusions on the findings in order to draft the necessary baseline  cybersecurity measures and key issues to decision makers specific to the protection of security  and resilience of the CAM ecosystem at the EU level.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of this report comprises:   Associations   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Mobility Service Providers   National Authorities   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities (RA)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   Standardisation Bodies   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 And Tier 2 Suppliers  1.3 METHODOLOGY  Using a layered approach of desktop research and interviews, this report summarises insights  across a complex CAM cybersecurity ecosystem. The desktop research methods included a  survey and works of ENISA, official statistics, academic research, external studies and official  documents, white papers, legislation, policies, strategies and initiatives to identify challenges  and lessons learnt on cyber incidents against the CAM ecosystem. The interviews were  7 Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) refers to transport systems, where the cooperation between two or  more ITS sub-systems (personal, vehicle, roadside and central) enables and provides an ITS service that offers better  quality and an enhanced service level, compared to the same ITS service provided by only one of the ITS sub-systems.

The information and data included  in this report are therefore based on a six-step methodology as depicted in Figure 1 below.  Figure 1: Methodology  1.4 DOCUMENT STRUCTURE  In this document, the CAM ecosystem and insights involving stakeholder interactions, critical  services and infrastructures, standards, as well as security measures are described. The  insights gained from the survey, interviews, and desk research feed the conclusions of this  report. Conclusions are put forward in order to improve the level of security and resilience of the  CAM ecosystem in the European Union.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  7  2. CAM CYBERSECURITY  ECOSYSTEM  The connected and automated mobility industry relies on a wide ecosystem of actors covering  the different areas of the value chain from R&D and manufacturing, retailing and service  providing, operations, maintenance and management of infrastructures and fleets as well as all  the standardisation and regulatory bodies framing the sector. Considering the distribution of  activities and responsibilities over this ecosystem, interactions between actors are crucial for its  development and effective operations, including actors who are in direct competition with each  other from a business operational point of view. Relations between stakeholders are not only  contractual in a logic of client and supplier but go further with various type of collaborations  around technologies, practices and frameworks development and standardisation, and other  business continuity related dependencies.  2.1 STAKEHOLDERS  The CAM cybersecurity ecosystem encompasses multiple stakeholders, as depicted in Figure 2  below. This section further describes these stakeholders and their role within the ecosystem.  Figure 2: CAM ecosystem stakeholders  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  8  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)  In the automotive sector, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) “is the original producer  of a vehicle's components, and so OEM car parts are identical to the parts used in producing a  vehicle.”10 In other words, in the automotive industry, the term OEM refers to any company that  manufactures parts for use in vehicles, including hardware (e.g. brakes, electrical parts, exhaust  systems, glass) as well as software systems (e.g. vehicle onboard computer) and who is in  charge of the final assembly of the vehicle. For clarification, in many cases the hardware parts  for the vehicle could also be produced by Tier 1 and 2 suppliers, as described in the next  section.  With the emergence of CAM, OEMs have been at the forefront of innovation (along with tech  companies) by giving special focus to research and development (R&D) toward vehicles  connectivity and autonomous capabilities. OEMs have altered branding strategies and have set  important goals to achieve autonomous driving but also to develop new offers around shared  mobility and digital services. Nevertheless, the change in the automotive industry means that  the value and supply chains to produce a vehicle for the market have also altered. OEMs must  also face changes in the market value of their products brought about by CAM and new  business models associated, as a result of increased collaborations with other relevant CAM  stakeholders. Today, a typical vehicle is composed of mostly hardware and a smaller proportion  of software. With the further development of CAM, though hardware will remain important,  software and connected components will represent a higher share of a vehicle’s market value,  involving new partnerships and relations with actors mastering digital and software technologies  in order to bring the right skills and knowledge for vehicles development.11  Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers  A Tier 1 supplier focuses on providing systems and parts (braking, systems, gearboxes, ECUs,  exhaust systems, batteries, etc.) to OEMs which are their direct clients, and a Tier 2 supplier on  sub-components of the systems and parts provided by the Tier 1 (screwing, gears, filters, tubes,  electronical components, etc.) without a direct relationship to OEMs. In the same logic as Tier 1  suppliers are clients of Tier 2, the latter are supplied by Tier 3 and so on until Tier n, which  produce other sub-components until the supplier that provide raw or close-to-raw materials  (plastic and metal).  Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers thus encompass a large variety of components and materials, these  include network services, engineering services, testing solutions, embedded applications, on-  board units and systems, ITS systems, solutions, semiconductors, sensors, and a further array  of software and hardware. These suppliers play a large role in CAM and are an important  stakeholder of the hub depicted in Figure 2. Suppliers historically provided mechanical and  electronic elements but also took the corner of CAM by providing parts related to connectivity  (modem, infotainment systems, software, etc.) and autonomy (radar, lidar, algorithms, etc.) in  order to answer to the evolution of OEM needs.  Smart Infrastructures Operators  In the CAM ecosystem, the stakeholders within the smart infrastructure category are multi-  faceted. Smart Infrastructures comprise several operators from different domains of activity,  10 What Is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in the Automotive Sector? (2019). Investopedia.

Within the Smart Infrastructure, connected and automated vehicles interact with the whole  ecosystem (V2X), which in part is made possible by the interaction with the smart road and  urban infrastructure that are based on Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Big Data, and  Mobility on Demand (V2I, I2V, V2N and I2N). The interaction of a vehicle with its surroundings  and between infrastructures constituting the surrounding is crucial for the correct deployment of  CAM. Road infrastructure should interact with vehicles through physical and digital elements.  Today, road infrastructure is optimised for human intelligence and some roads and situations  (especially in cities) are not developed enough for automated machine intelligence.  Infrastructure today is not completely ready to accommodate V2I and I2V communication. The  stakeholders are a blend of public authorities and private companies, that need to cooperate  with the other stakeholders in the CAM ecosystem, namely OEMs, suppliers and 3rd party  service providers, to best understand the needs of future infrastructure.  Telecom companies  Telecom companies are a stakeholder within the CAM ecosystem as they ensure the  connectivity and data transfer stemming to and from vehicles and that of Smart Infrastructure  (V2N and I2N). There are new opportunities for telecom companies in CAM which may, for  instance, include the expansion of current (and installation) of fibre infrastructure or expanding  the wireless bandwidth of vehicular and infrastructural data which also needs to conform to  security expectations. Indeed, there are various layers to the CAM ecosystem in which a  telecom company may decide to expand.  Another important evolution for the near future is the emergence of 5G V2X communication  networks, which is much more sophisticated and offers higher bandwidth to enhance  connectivity compared to today’s 3G/4G networks. The European Commission’s 5G Action  Plan15 from 2016, set out to ensure that by 2025, “all urban areas and major terrestrial transport  paths have uninterrupted 5G coverage”. The Action Plan also calls to diminish fragmentation  among the Member states to ensure service continuity (i.e. aligned and coordinated 5G  infrastructure), which is crucial for connected vehicles, especially in the EU, where cross-border  mobility is an everyday phenomenon.  IT suppliers  IT suppliers provide secure software, hardware, as well as cloud functionalities. Alike to telecom  companies, reliable connectivity (stability) is an absolute necessity for CAM. IT suppliers also  cover the provision of emerging technologies such as Cloud computing platforms (Azure, AWS,  etc.), Software platforms for automotive connectivity and mobility (e.g. Waymo, Yandex, etc.), AI  (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT (Internet of Things) solutions to the CAM ecosystem.  Technology companies, especially tech giants, are also keen on joining the CAM ecosystem  and bringing their services to the fore. These companies, mostly the latter, are able to invest  12 Smart Infrastructure. ENISA.

Third-party services provider  Third-party services providers supply, for example, content, maps, traffic data, music player,  weather monitor, and mobile apps to vehicles. Satellite navigation providers are also included  under this stakeholder grouping, as it is a key element of automated vehicles within the CAM  ecosystem. In the European Commission’s open public consultation on CAM16, it was found that  the majority of end-users would be willing to share data with third-party service providers on, for  example, the state of roads, as well as data concerning the functioning of the vehicle  components. Third-party service providers are significant in the CAM ecosystem to complement  the services of, for example, OEMs.  Automotive aftermarket operators  Automotive aftermarket operators are aftermarket independent service providers who are  independent parts producers, parts distributors, independent repairers, publishers of technical  information, tool equipment manufacturers, roadside repairers, leasing companies, and  insurance companies, as defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/85817. These automotive aftermarket  operators, within the repair and maintenance activities, provide a range of traditional services  such as independent parts manufacturing/distribution, repair and maintenance activities as well  as a range of innovative services such as predictive maintenance, over-the-air repair and  maintenance/software updates, remote diagnostics, and digital mobility services. For all these  services, information exchange between all CAM stakeholders and aftermarket operators is  necessary, and in particular with vehicle manufacturers for product development and system  integration.  Associations  Associations, in general terms, are a group of people who work together in a single organisation  for a particular purpose.18 These purposes or goals differ depending on the type, size and scope  of the association. Just as the automotive sector includes different types of companies and auto  manufacturers, it does so associations as well. These associations can focus, among others, on  trade, manufacturers, industry, independent trade in spare parts, repairers, repair information  publishers, service providers for connected cars, and when expanding the scope to the CAM  ecosystem, it also includes technology and software.  In this study, associations had a different input into the CAM ecosystem and represented the  following aspects of CAM: parts manufacturing, IT security testing of C-ITS components, road  assessment, automated driving software solutions, representation of wholesalers and retailers,  and jointly promoting the interests of the members of the association to policy makers.  Associations are thus a key component of the CAM ecosystem, as their competences and  sometimes lobbying efforts bring about important change to the transportation world, at national,  EU, and international levels.  European institutions  The European institutions acting in the CAM ecosystem are primarily the European Commission  and Agencies. The European Commission aims to adopt various level policies and legislation in  order to lead the transformation of the ecosystem. ENISA, a European agency is also highly  active in cooperating with the CAM ecosystem in order to better understand how to advance  16 Available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/summary-report-open-public-consultation-connected-and- automated-mobility-cam  17 Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market  surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such  vehicles.

The European Parliament MEPs, in early 2019, also called  for safety and liability rules for driverless cars, together with a robust legislation form the  European Commission on access to in-vehicle data as this is a fundamental block for the  achievement of both autonomous and connected driving in a Single European Transport Area  and for competitive CAM services for end-users. A particularly important aspect in Europe is the  collaboration among Member States, which the Commission coordinates in its Strategy on  Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS)19. The Commission also stated that part of its  priorities is to “continue working on the regulatory environment, ecosystem-building, resource  efficiency and standardisation to facilitate the market introduction of increasingly efficient  cooperative, connected and automated vehicles.” The European Commission’s Joint Research  Centre (JRC) has set up the EU-wide security Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as a defining  feature of C-ITS and critical safety V2X. As will be further described in section 2.1.1 Stakeholder  interactions below, the stakeholders throughout the CAM ecosystem at times have mandatory  interactions with the institutions in order to successfully carry out EU actions that will harmonise  the industry.  For more information on the EU policy context, please refer to A Annex.  Standardisation bodies  Standardisation bodies, within the CAM ecosystem, are in charge of ensuring the long-term  safety, security, and interoperability of the industry. Standards have different objectives,  including providing standardised cybersecurity concepts, measures, solutions as well as  management, furthermore, standards also encompass processes of quality necessary to  homogenise conception and development practices through different frameworks. Standards  offer a common ground for technological development, especially if driven as a legislative  requirement. ETSI for example, a European Standards Organisation (ESO), is the recognised  regional standards body for telecommunications, broadcasting and other electronic  communications networks and services. ETSI’s ITS (Intelligent Transport System) committee is  paving the way for global standards for C-ITS, which are mainly vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-  to-roadside communication.  For more information about the current state of play of standards in the CAM ecosystem, please  refer to section 2.3.2 Standards.  Regulatory bodies  Regulatory bodies propose regulations and framework conditions to address the necessary  changes brought about by CAM, including, for instance ethical and liability and privacy issues,  cybersecurity, and safety. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)  adopted the cybersecurity regulation WP29 in June 2020, requiring all car manufacturers in the  European Union (and beyond) to secure connected vehicles against cyberattacks under this  new regulation set by the United Nations.20 At the European level, the European Commission is  in charge to transpose the texts defined by UNECE, which take into account the needs of all  CAM stakeholders. Given that the pace of technological development is faster than the  accompanying legislative process, regulatory bodies are in charge of creating a dynamic  structure for governance to develop efficient technical legislation. At a national level each  country may enforce some specific CAM regulation.  19 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions on A European strategy on Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems, a  milestone towards cooperative, connected and automated mobility. 30 November 2016.

Across the EU  Member States, governments have varying instances on development, testing, and deployment  of CAM, in which national competent authorities/road authorities play a large role. These  authorities may range from providing expertise for safety/security, to having an overview of a  specific city’s long-term goals, or even independent agencies that cooperate with both the public  and private sectors on matters related to transport and communications.  Users  Users are defined as drivers and passengers as well as pedestrians. The bringing about of CAM  shows how digitalisation affects more and more areas of society. There is a shift towards a  user-centred mobility paradigm. CAM is surrounded by new technologies and one of the most  important challenges to achieve by the ecosystem is to earn the trust and acceptability of the  users. Today, connected mobility is thriving and making users’ lives more comfortable through  V2V and V2I communication, including, for instance, live information on traffic flow, construction  sites, and accidents. Furthermore, vehicles are also connected to persons (V2P), by, for  example, directly connecting their smartphones to their cars and accessing apps and making  calls easily from their dashboards. For this aspect, the necessary trust lies in data protection  schemes. For automated mobility itself, users’ trust will have to go much further, in order to  accept that automated cars will make the correct and necessary decisions. Though there are  many facts to consider and research in order to ensure the correct deployment of CAM, it is  highly beneficial for the future of society. The key opportunities are safety, comfort, efficiency,  social inclusion, and accessibility.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  13  2.1.1 Stakeholder interactions  This section describes the main stakeholder interactions towards a secure CAM ecosystem  based on the primary data collected in this study. This study focuses on whether the interaction  among stakeholders are mandatory (i.e. based on a legal requirement such as national or EU  legislation21, this does not include contractual obligations) or voluntary. The figures in this  section show a summary of the nature of interaction between the stakeholders of the CAM  ecosystem, based on the primary data collected for this report, i.e. survey, interviews, and direct  feedback from the acknowledged stakeholders.  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)  Figure 3: Original Equipment Manufacturers’ interactions with other CAM stakeholders  OEMs have an established network and/or partnership with the whole CAM ecosystem. From  the survey and interviews, differing views were gathered on the nature (i.e. mandatory or  voluntary) of the collaboration between OEMs and other stakeholders.  An OEM mainly collaborates with National Competent Authority/Road Authority, European  institutions, Standardisation bodies, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and Associations related to  CAM, on a needs-basis. On the one hand, there is no mandatory collaboration necessary as the  industry is proactive in cooperating as the needs call for it. On the other hand, whenever the  interactions among stakeholders refer to compliance with legal requirements, such as data  privacy, security and cybersecurity OEMs interactions with other stakeholders become  mandatory, especially with stakeholders with whom OEMs do not have contractual  relationships.  The purpose of collaboration stemming from OEMs and other stakeholders mostly hold the  same values: technical standardisation, common watch (e.g. for innovation, threats), and  process/method standardisation, as well as compatibility/interoperability needs. For a National  Competent Authority/Road Authority, where collaboration is voluntary, technical standardisation  and common watch are the main purposes of collaboration. The OEMs interviewed had differing  views on the collaboration with European institutions where the nature is both voluntary and  mandatory, with the purposes of technical standardisation, process/method standardisation, and  common watch.  21 This does not include the contractual obligations that may arise from bilateral contracts between stakeholders  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  14  Collaboration with standardisation bodies is voluntary from OEMs, one also noting that this  cooperation is based on its voluntary contribution to the standards definition. The collaboration  with Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers is deemed as mandatory, for the purposes of technical  standardisation and process/method standardisation. In addition, collaboration with automotive  aftermarket operators is necessary at both mandatory and voluntary levels for commercial and  product processes, development and integration support including information sharing. OEMs  interact with Automotive aftermarket operators in both mandatory and voluntary manners to  ensure compliance with processes and products’ requirements. Finally, with associations of the  CAM ecosystem, the cooperation is voluntary for a common watch (e.g. for innovation, threats).  Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers  Figure 4: Tier-x suppliers’ interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Tier 1 and Tier 2 stakeholders collaborate with the whole ecosystem, namely, National  Competent Authority/Road Authority, European Institution, Standardisation body, Operator of  Intelligent Transport System (OITS), Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), fellow Tier 1 and  Tier 2 suppliers, Smart city operators (e.g. traffic operators), Associations related to CAM, and  automotive aftermarket operators.  Tier 1 and Tier 2 collaboration with National Competent Authority/Road Authority is always  voluntary, and are mostly based on incident reporting, but also include technical  standardisation, process/method standardisation, and common watch. The collaboration with  European Institutions is also voluntary, and mostly based on technical standardisation. Other  purposes include incident reporting, common watch, process/method standardisation, as well  as, for example, regulation making on access to vehicles data and exchanges on future  roadmaps of the regulatory landscape. Tiers 1 and 2 suppliers voluntarily cooperate with  standardisation bodies to contribute to the development standards (e.g. ISO/SAE/VDA) and  may also participate to working groups. They sometimes hold monthly meetings to discuss  general interest topics around cybersecurity.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  15  The main purposes of collaboration were thus found to be technical standardisation,  process/method standardisation, and also common watch. Only a minority of Tier 1 and Tier 2  suppliers collaborate with Operators of Intelligent Transport System (OITS), on a voluntary and  commercial basis, with the purposes of technical standardisation and process/method  standardisation. Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers interact with OEMs on both mandatory and voluntary  bases, and it is mostly based on commercial and product development support purposes as  OEMs are customers. Other reasons include technical standardisation and process/method  standardisation, common watch, and incident reporting. Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers may also  interact both mandatorily or voluntarily amongst each other, and their interaction is also often  commercial, in order to receive components. They also need to align on technical  standardisation and process/method standardisation. Smart city operators and Tier 1 and Tier 2  suppliers interact voluntarily to define technical standardisation and a common watch for  innovation or threats. Collaboration with automotive aftermarket operators is necessary at both  mandatory and voluntary levels for product development and integration support. Finally, with  Associations related to CAM, the purpose of collaboration is also mostly based on common  watch.  Automotive aftermarket operators  Figure 5: Automotive aftermarket operators' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Automotive aftermarket operators need to interact with OEMs and Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers for  information exchange regarding compatibility and interoperability for cybersecurity engineering.  In more detail, automotive aftermarket operators interact with OEMs for both mandatory and  voluntary reasons, more specifically for commercial and product process and development and  integration support including information sharing.  With Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, the mandatory and voluntary interaction is on the basis of  product development and integration support. This ensures that the automotive aftermarket  operators also have the capability to produce cybersecure products and services. Automotive  aftermarket operators also mandatorily interact with European institutions for common watch,  ensuring a faire level-playing field amongst relevant actors, and to keep legislations up to date.  For common watch and technical know-how, interactions with Associations, National Competent  Authorities/Road Authorities, and Standardisation bodies is necessary on a voluntary basis.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  16  Associations related to CAM  Figure 6: Associations' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Given Associations’ varying nature, this stakeholder group interacts with the almost the entirety  of the CAM ecosystem: National Competent Authority/Road Authority, European Institution,  Standardisation body, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers,  Smart city operators (e.g. traffic operators), Automotive aftermarket operators, and other  Associations related to CAM.  The frequency of collaboration with other stakeholder groups ranges from a needs-basis,  weekly or monthly basis. In fact, it depends on the core business of the association, and which  aspects of the ecosystem are targeted. For example, an association may organise meetings  with the industry to discuss solutions to the challenges at hand and define mutual interests. It  may also launch a project that necessitates interaction on a daily basis for only a certain given  period. For this latter reason, an association can, for instance, collaborate with National  Competent Authority/Road Authority, European institutions, OEMs, Automotive aftermarket  operators and Smart city operators. In general, associations listed the nature of their  collaboration with the stakeholders mentioned above as voluntary, for the main purposes of  technical standardisation and process/method standardisation.  European Institutions  Figure 7: European institutions' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  17  The responses received from a European-level body in the survey are not representative, for  that reason, the stakeholder interaction for this section is only explored from the receiving end  and the following complementary information from research.  The European Commission in particular, collaborates with the Member States and the industry  to achieve the EU’s ambitious vision for CAM within the Digital Single Market. The European  Commission therefore publishes policy initiatives, develops standards for the European level,  co-funds research and innovation projects, and adopts necessary legislation.22 Furthermore,  according to the NIS Directive23 the European institutions, such as ENISA, are involved in  receiving annual incident report from Road Authorities and ITSs.  For more information on the EU policy context, please refer to A Annex of this report.  National Competent Authority/Road Authority  Figure 8: National competent authorities'/Road authorities' interactions with other CAM  stakeholders  The National Competent Authorities/Road Authorities that replied to the ENISA survey represent  local and national level governments as well as cybersecurity. The information that we received  from this stakeholder group shows that their interactions with the stakeholders of the CAM  ecosystem differ, and so does the frequency.  The local level authority interacts with the central National Competent Authority/Road Authority  on a voluntary basis for the purposes of technical standardisation, process/method  standardisation, and common watch. They do not have further interactions in the CAM  ecosystem. Following, the central National Competent Authority/Road Authority collaborates  with the rest of the stakeholders in the CAM ecosystem.

States of the European union have cybersecurity  agencies (such as ANSSI in France or BSI in Germany) who are in charge prevention, detection  and reaction activities over information security topics for government, business and society.  These cybersecurity agencies, in turn works closely, but voluntarily, with the competent Ministry  for process/method standardisation and common watch. Only the national authority interacts  with the European institutions, on a voluntary basis for the purposes of process/method  standardisation and common watch.  The interaction with Standardisation bodies happens on a voluntary basis stemming from both  the national authority and the cybersecurity agency. Though, the interaction does not happen on  a recurrent basis, the cybersecurity agencies are considered as experts and produce content for  the development of new standards, as well as contributes to technical standardisation.  The national authority’s intent for interaction is also technical standardisation, as well as  process/method standardisation. The national authority has a mandatory interaction with the  Operator of Intelligent Transport System (OITS) as it has a supervisory role of traffic  management (including cybersecurity), and also provides incident reporting and a common  watch. The cybersecurity agency and the national authority cooperate with OEMs and Tier 1  and Tier 2 suppliers as well as automotive aftermarket operators on a voluntary basis. The  former for technical standardisation, while the latter stakeholders for common watch. Smart city  operators (or traffic operators) are also a stakeholder group with which the cybersecurity agency  and national authority interact voluntarily. The former for process/method standardisation and  the latter for common watch. The national authority also cooperates with Associations related to  CAM voluntarily for technical standardisation and common watch, as well as with  communication network and cloud service providers.  Concerning Automotive aftermarket operators, the cooperation is based on common watch  purposes. The national authority’s competences are extensive, and it collaborates weekly with  some stakeholder groups.  Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)  Figure 9: Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  Operators of Intelligent Transport System (OITS) interact with different stakeholders, depending  on the parameters which are among others national legal requirements and supply chain  requirements. It is possible for and OITS to have a mandatory interaction with European  institutions for common watch. OITS can also focus on voluntary cooperation with  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  19  standardisation bodies for technical standardisation and process/method standardisation, and  OITS can also interact with competent national IT security agencies on a voluntary basis.  Furthermore, OITS may sometimes cooperate with OEMs and the entirety of the CAM  ecosystem thanks to a country-wide platform and the willingness to contribute to producing an  industry standard. For an OITS, the voluntary interaction is based on common watch and  standardisation.  Standardisation body  Figure 10: Standardisation bodies' interactions with other CAM stakeholders  This standardization body interactions are all made on a voluntary basis, and as regards the  frequency of their collaboration; standardisation issues are discussed at least once a month with  the competent national agency and with European institutions. Therefore, the four stakeholders  that this standardisation body cooperates with are National Competent Authority/Road Authority,  European Institutions, Automotive aftermarket operators and other standardisation bodies on  technical standardisation and process/method standardisation as well as common watch with  the National Competent Authority/Road Authority.  Other  Various other stakeholders have also responded to the ENISA survey. These stakeholders  cover other aspects of the CAM ecosystem, and provide services such as analyses to the  European institutions, contribute to public consultations, act as a point of contact for law  enforcement bodies, take part in European-funded projects, carry out conformity assessments,  take part in the type approval certification process, or even offer trainings.  2.2 CRITICAL CAM SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES  The mainspring of the Connected and Automated Mobility ecosystem is to provide a wide range  of mobility services to users but also all services orbiting around mobility in order to propose a  smoother, end-to-end, intermodal experience. While CAM services will enhance users’ mobility,  enabling to make it greener, safer, smarter, and more inclusive, the connectivity of all vehicles,  infrastructures and devices of the ecosystem provides new capabilities to its stakeholders  through B2B services and legislative driven-measures that enable better management and  monitoring of the CAM assets. While CAM enables better practicality, comfort and safety for  long haul journeys on road and highway networks, its development is essential in order to fully  implement an operational Smart City model. As part of the transportation sector, CAM is subject  to great safety and continuity stakes for which cybersecurity plays a major role since it is  becoming a trigger targeted by malicious parties. In the CAM ecosystem, specifically in the field  of critical safety, it is essential for all stakeholders to cooperate, and building upon the common  standards, interoperability is imperative. Though interaction between stakeholders varies from  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  20  use-case to use-case, the obligation to cooperate will bring stronger involvement from EU  Member States, who through the NIS Directive and their responsibility for road safety control  play a bigger role than in other cybersecurity fields. The C-ITS Strategy focuses on services that  bring benefits on road safety, sustainability and automation. Hence, cybersecurity must be  considered as an essential part of CAM development.  In a landscape where some European cities have a very high population density and  transportation flows are tensed, CAM represents one of the solutions to answer transportation  problematics by transforming the mobility model. The CAM model is increasingly acknowledged  by the ecosystem which is pushing R&D and investments in the sector. New actors are rising to  provide disruptive services while existing forces in the ecosystem are transforming their  business model to adapt to the rapid changes in the way users consume mobility. This model  requires collaboration between CAM stakeholders from OEMs and public transport operators, to  Mobility as a Service start-ups, automotive aftermarket operators and authorities managing  public areas and infrastructures. All the capabilities provided by connectivity and autonomy are  enabled by different technological stacks interacting between each other that are owned and  managed by different stakeholders which illustrate why collaboration between stakeholders is  much required to make the CAM technological frame consistent, as explained in section 2.1.1  Stakeholder interactions. In all technological areas, cybersecurity is a crucial topic to be  addressed in order to ensure security for the infrastructures, the users and the ecosystem. In  the CAM area, the collaboration of stakeholders around the different technological stacks  requires to settle agreement about the cybersecurity model and governance enabling to share  responsibilities regarding risks coverage and ensure that none of the relevant stakeholders  become the weakest link for cybersecurity.  Implementing these technologies and connectivity to public network in mobility and the transport  sector introduces cyber threats that must be managed. Hence, the connected and autonomous  capabilities generate different types and levels of impacts for the stakeholders, users and  ecosystem that need to be assessed and covered. This study enabled to evaluate what are the  most important services and infrastructures following the stakeholders’ point of view.  2.2.1 CAM services  The CAM services were established according to primary data gathered from the stakeholders  through a survey, interviews, and direct feedback. The services are therefore represented  according to the input collected. These CAM services have therefore been categorised following  two criteria and are illustrated in Figure 11:  -  User services (drivers, passengers, pedestrians) and  -  B2B services (OEMs, suppliers, operators, tiers)  Some services can be relevant for both the users and CAM stakeholders.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  21  Figure 11: CAM services mapping  Following the input received from the survey and interviews, the most important services that  were pointed out are those enabling to access or interact with core mobility and driving functions  of connected and autonomous vehicles, mobility devices and road infrastructures that can  cause safety impacts for the users and the surrounding ecosystem:  User services  - Services related to the driving enhancement and core driving functions of vehicles and  mobility devices: These features enable to automatise all functions and actions  previously required to be performed by users in order to foster the autonomous ability of  vehicles and mobility devices. These abilities aim to transform the role of the user from a  driver perspective toward a passenger consuming mobility services model. In the same  fashion as for safety functions provided by ADAS, driving enhancement services rely on  a wide range of sensors and communications through different types of protocols and  networks in order to exchange information between the assets of the CAM ecosystem. In  addition, these services enable to automatise some functionalities such as EV charging  for example which can be managed remotely from the user’s smartphone or enabling the  vehicle to automatically pay for the electricity refill by interacting with the charging  infrastructures. The first concern raised by autonomous capabilities being safety,  cybersecurity is seen as a major stake to ensure these services are implemented  securely in order to enable their reliability and trustworthiness. As well, these services  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  22  are going to generate large amounts of personal data resulting from the use of these  services which also raises consistent privacy concern.  - Services related to the safety management of the users and surrounding ecosystem:  Those services known as Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), provide new  capabilities enabling to better prevent and avoid accidents as well as better assist in  case of accident in order to increase the users’ and the ecosystem’s safety. These  services enable actions from vehicles such as emergency braking or steering to avoid a  collision. They also allow vehicles and mobility devices to contact rescue services and  provide information about unusual events involving users’ safety. Safety being the first  concern of the transport sector, the connectivity and autonomous abilities are an  opportunity for the ecosystem to assist users and better anticipate impromptu events  thanks to V2X communications. However, since these functionalities carry safety  properties, they are subject to regulations such as the General Safety Regulation and  must cope with specific requirements. Also, the automation of safety features introduces  risks since they represent a critical point of failure for CAM assets.  B2B services  - Services related to road infrastructures management: In the CAM ecosystem, vehicles  and mobility devices are gaining new capabilities thanks to connectivity and automation,  and they are interacting with the surroundings infrastructures that provide information  and data enabling to broaden data sets available for computing and decision taking.  Road infrastructures are also increasingly connected and automated, enabling  generation of data about traffic flows and other information needed for management and  maintenance operations. It enables operators to perform analyses about traffic in order  to better adapt flows management, implement dynamic signalling with improved  automation and anticipation as well as optimising all operations related to cleaning,  maintenance or improvement. From a cybersecurity point of view, the ability to control  remotely signalling systems from a potential connection over a public network represent  an important threat. Hence there are important safety and operational impacts that would  result from the take-over of road signalling systems.  Common services  - Services related to vehicle and ecosystem interactions (V2X): As mentioned for the  previous safety and driving enhancement services, mobility is increasingly automated in  order to transform personal vehicles in mobility devices that are shared and autonomous.  The prerequisite for these capabilities is to ensure secure and efficient information and  data exchange between CAM assets. Since CAM assets (vehicles, mobility devices,  intelligent signalling systems, etc.) cannot only rely on sensors and cameras to produce  and analyse data, it is essential that assets exchange data with their surroundings about  their behaviour and environment in order to dispose of sufficient data to guarantee  correct analysis and understanding of situations and events. From a cybersecurity point  of view, integrity of such communication is critical. To ensure that the stakeholders align  on technologies and framework, the ITS Directive24 has been defined to provide a  framework for communications between intelligent transport systems. This Directive aims  to provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic  management and enable various users to be better informed and make safer, more  coordinated and ‘smarter’ use of transport networks.  - Services enabling remote interactions with CAM assets (vehicles, bikes, e-bikes, e-  scooters, etc.): Connectivity of CAM assets unlocked a range of services enabling users  and operators to interact with vehicles and mobility devices remotely from various types  24 Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment  of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.

These services enable to collect many types of  data generated by CAM assets about their location, performance, use history,  parameters and so on, which include personal data related to the users’ activity. In  addition to the data collection, these services can allow to perform remote actions such  as starting, unlocking, managing parameters and some functionalities like smart  charging, remote diagnostic and repair. In this case, cybersecurity risks can trigger  privacy and operational impacts for the users that remain high concerns in the transport  sector.  - Services enabling maintenance of connected and automated vehicles and assets: In the  transport sector, the maintenance of vehicles and infrastructures has always been a key  point in order to maintain the right level of safety and operability. For the past 30 years,  vehicles and infrastructures have increasingly integrated electronic components enabling  enhancement of their functions. Through data collection, these features enable  diagnostic and prognosis of CAM assets. Hence, with connectivity capabilities, it is now  possible to collect data in order to anticipate and plan maintenance and repairs of either  electronical or physical systems. In addition, it is also important to maintain a level-  playing field for all relevant CAM operators and to ensure that there is no market  foreclosure in the name of cybersecurity. Also, a big improvement brought by  connectivity is the ability to update systems’ firmware and software over the air in order  to perform maintenance of systems remotely but also improving or adding functionalities  to assets, making their lifecycle evolutive. The maintenance of CAM assets having a  direct impact on operability and safety for users and their ecosystem, hence integrity of  data used for diagnostic and prognostic must be strictly guaranteed. Considering over  the air updates, cybersecurity is also a main driver when developing and operating such  features. The upcoming UNECE Recommendation on Software Update Processes25  aims to provide a secure and standardised manner for over the air updates to take place,  ensuring that all stakeholders are certified. Since the functioning of assets will be driven  by firmware and software of electronical components, it is crucial that their integrity is  assured to avoid any malicious modification that could have severe impact.  Cybersecurity wise, the services stated above are very important because they directly involve  users and the surrounding ecosystem safety. Misuse or abuse of these services and functions  provide the attackers a direct access to core safety, driving, traffic management and signalling  functions of the CAM ecosystem.  In the CAM ecosystem the assets are interdependent between each other and can be managed  by fleet, which means potential take-over enables malicious actions at a large scale such as  neutralisation or hijacking of a fleet, blockage of road traffic, etc. Indeed, these types of services  are particularly targeted by attackers and some researchers have already proven the feasibility  of these attack scenarios at a large scale in different experimentations. Indeed, the services  below are considered as important by interviewed stakeholders:  User services  - Mobility as a Service (MaaS): Connected and autonomous capabilities are enabling to  develop a new model of mobility which is end-to-end, multimodal and based on the  sharing of vehicles and mobility devices. These services allow users to locate, access  and rent different types of vehicles and mobility devices such as bikes and e-scooters  that are made available in dedicated stations or in free-floating. There are several  business models where vehicles and devices can be rented to a user or to a company,  owned by multiple users and so on. Users access the services through terminals,  applications and platforms where they may have a recurrent subscription or perform one-  off purchases. These sharing and rental services are increasingly integrated within the  25 See more at: https://undocs.org/ECE/TRANS/WP.29/2020/80  https://undocs.org/ECE/TRANS/WP.29/2020/80  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  24  offers of public transport operators in order to cover the last kilometre and enhance the  mobility experience. Hence, they are not used only as a substitution to personal vehicles  or public transports but as a complementary mean. Those renting and sharing services  are supplemented with a stack of services providing users the information enabling them  to better optimise their journey and navigation with these mobility means. These services  enabling users to travel around carry an operational impact for them since they rely on  them for their journey which means principally safety and operational impacts, but there  is also consequent privacy impact since the operators of these services will collect and  store personal data about users and their trips. Financial impact is also to be considered  since user payment information will be stored by service providers and also attackers  may block devices or fleet in the aim to obtain a ransom.  - Infotainment services: For a long time, vehicles have been providing infotainment to  their passengers such as music and radio. Thanks to connectivity and autonomy, these  services have been evolving to represent one of the core values of a vehicle to its users,  which represents its quality and technological advancement. Different strategies have  been implemented by manufacturers for the development of their infotainment systems.  These strategies tend to evolve from in-house development of their operating systems  and applications to a model closer to the smartphone and PC industry where OS and  apps are provided by partners and/or 3rd parties. Vehicle services are becoming more  operational within the vehicle where CAM stakeholders like automotive aftermarket  operators need to have access to the user through the vehicle HMI as well as in-depth  access to vehicle data as close to the source as possible. Effective implementation of  rights and roles is of paramount importance to manage these access needs. Vehicles  now onboard various applications making it able to become the 5th screen of users and  participate in the multi-device interoperability scheme proposed by digital services  providers. In this case, the cybersecurity stakes are similar to those considered for  applications in order to avoid privacy, financial and operational impact for the users.  However, when considering the cybersecurity of vehicles, these services represent a  consequent entry door for malicious parties willing to gain access with services or  functions with a safety impact.  B2B services  - Fleet management services: The various business models emerging from Mobility as a  Service but also historic actors such as car renters require for the operators to manage  fleets of vehicles and mobility devices. Connectivity provides the opportunity to operators  to manage remotely their assets in order to optimise and facilitate their operations. In the  same way as a user would obtain data for one device, these services enable to monitor a  whole fleet, obtain localisation, collect data about use (distance covered or duration of  the rental), manage rental by unlocking, locking, monitor fuel or battery levels and so on.  These services enable to digitalise operators’ operations but also enable faster and  easier access to vehicles and mobility devices for users by making them independent  from a physical rental agency. From a cybersecurity point of view the main impacts will  affect stakeholders’ operations in case of misuse or attack on their fleet management  services.  In the CAM ecosystem, most services provided to users and between stakeholders rely on  various actors involved in physical devices and infrastructures operations but also digital assets  and back-ends. The delivery of mobility services as well as services to manage stakeholders’  operations or to enhance user experience impacts the transport industry reliability. These  impacts are, for example, traffic and passenger flow fluidity, which also impacts users’ privacy  since a large amount of personal data can be collected, stored and processed. Moreover, since  these services might be executed by the same OS or systems as services carrying safety  impacts, they could be used as an entry door to perform an attack that could harm users or their  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  25  direct environment. Therefore, cybersecurity should be considered an important part of the  ecosystem.  The CAM model, thanks to capabilities brought by connectivity of assets and IoT but also by the  digitalisation of user interactions through applications, enabled stakeholders to develop and  propose large sets of digital services gravitating around core mobility services. These services  have been stated as less important by the interviewed stakeholders:  User services  - Home management services: Since vehicles are becoming increasingly connected and  able to act as personal devices, CAM stakeholders are partnering with IoT and home  automation actors in order to integrate use-cases where vehicles and mobility devices  interact with home appliances in order to trigger automated action such as thermostat  management, energetical optimisation, and doors and shutters operation.  Common services  - Insurance management services: The new usages associated to CAM are transforming  the way users consume mobility services which means they also need to be  contractually covered by insurances answering the challenges brought by these new  use-cases. On one side, these new usages require an evolution of insurance offers to be  adapted to a model where assets are increasingly shared and autonomous, and on the  other side, connectivity capabilities enable to collect data about the use of asset that can  be processed as inputs to manage insurance contracts. The ability to capture, store and  analyse behavioural, mobility and data generated from the connected car, mobility  device or road infrastructure will be a key factor to enable insurance management in  CAM. This will serve as an enabler to build connected insurance products individually  tailored, going forward (e.g. pay as you drive insurance, traffic incident analysis). In this  model, insurance companies become a 3rd party consuming data produced by the CAM  ecosystem with relatively high privacy and financial impact for the end user, meaning  that confidentiality and integrity will be high stakes for the implementation of these  services.  - Advertising services: Connected and autonomous vehicles and mobility devices  increasingly integrate screen for infotainment but also interact with users through mobile  applications. CAM stakeholders provide various services to users and these interfaces  have started to be used as a display for advertising these services, make  recommendations to users or highlight potential points of interest over the users’ route.  - Services related to security systems: For vehicles and mobility devices for which theft  is a common issue, connectivity enabled to integrate functionalities improving assets  security against malicious acts and theft thanks to integrated video protection,  localisation and tracking, and hardened anti-theft systems.  2.2.2 CAM systems and infrastructures  In order to implement the various services of the CAM model, many technical stacks, depending  on different stakeholders, are implemented and interact among each other. These stacks  support the systems and infrastructures enabling interactions between the CAM stakeholders  and assets, but also storage and processing of data. These stacks go from Operational  Technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) and onboard system, to devices and back-ends  supporting digital assets but also infrastructures supporting specific communication networks  and cybersecurity is an essential part which flows through the whole ecosystem.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  26  Figure 12: CAM systems and infrastructures mapping  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  27  The fact that the delivery of CAM services relies on systems and infrastructures depending on  different stakeholders defines the complexity of the CAM technical ecosystem. Technologies  developed and used by a stakeholder might depend on the ones used on another stack but  could also require harmonisation between a group of stakeholders in order to ensure  interoperability. For example, regarding the communication between vehicles and other  infrastructures (V2X), the technological framework for communication between assets has been  formalised within the ITS Directive26 in order to ensure that all the stakeholders standardise the  technologies used to implement these communications. Availability of standards is critical to  develop future-proof, scalable and sustainable solutions and to push forward innovation in the  CAM area.  From a cybersecurity standpoint, the different systems and infrastructures do not carry the same  criticality. In the CAM ecosystem, cybersecurity requires a holistic approach in order to cover  risks, which means that each stakeholder at its level plays a role in the risk coverage. In some  cases, the cybersecurity approach must be coordinated between stakeholders in order to define  interfaces and perimeters of responsibility over systems and infrastructures protection.  Depending on the stakeholder activity, the systems and infrastructure under its sphere of  influence will differ, however, they might still have requirements regarding cybersecurity  measures and risk management over systems and infrastructures with which they have  interfaces. Additionally, interoperability is a leading factor for the functioning and development of  the CAM ecosystem, meaning to ensure proper level of cybersecurity is required to ensure  integrity and confidentiality of data flows between components and actors, as well as ensuring  the compatibility and secure operation of different products and services managed by different  CAM stakeholders.  A main point to address when securing CAM systems and infrastructures is the attack surface.  In order to perform an attack, malicious parties will need an entry point that will be the first step  to put in place the complete the attack path enabling to make the compromise successful. Then  all systems and infrastructures that are exposed on public networks, provide an applicative  interface or with a physical access to an interface or port will be considered as critical from a  cybersecurity point of view. Then the systems and assets that carry functionalities or services  that may generate a safety impact shall also be considered as critical since in the typical  adversary model, they will be defined as one of the main targets malicious parties will aim to  compromise, in addition to cyberattacks resulting in vehicle theft.  During the study, interviewees belonging to different stakeholder groups provided insights on  which categories of systems and infrastructures they consider as critical regarding  cybersecurity, and hence, consider that ensuring their protection is a priority for the ecosystem:  -  Tiers and road infrastructures  o Traffic management and signalling systems  o Road infrastructures systems  o Intelligent roadside systems  -  Interactions and interoperability  o V2X communication systems  o Data exchange and collaboration systems and platforms  o 3rd party services systems and platforms  All systems and infrastructures part of a CAM Cybersecurity Management System perimeter  -  Road vehicles & mobility devices  o Onboard cybersecurity systems  26 Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on the framework for the deployment  of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport.

These challenges are:  1. Governance and cybersecurity integration into corporate activities.  Cybersecurity governance is an organisational and technical challenge for all  stakeholders. In the CAM ecosystem especially, digital technology and connectivity are  tangled with physical transportation. New skills are necessary within organisations,  with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. A cybersecurity team is needed to be  relied upon, to manage risks and address potential vulnerabilities.  2. Lack of top management support and cybersecurity prioritisation.  There are too few interactions between cybersecurity executives and corporate  executives, leading to insufficient financial support (e.g. for research & development,  awareness and training programmes, operational activities) to ensure that  cybersecurity is a key topic in the lifecycle of CAM products and services.  3. Technical complexity in the CAM ecosystem.  Given the large array of actors and their objectives in the CAM ecosystem, the  implementation and management of cybersecurity and risk management prove to be a  challenge. In addition, it is also a difficulty to find the correct liability measures for the  final product, as components stem from many parties, and retracing the fault can be  nearly impossible. In addition, due to the competitive nature of the automotive industry,  obtaining cybersecurity information for product development and integration is difficult  to achieve for certain SMEs CAM stakeholders.  4. Technical constraints for implementation of security into CAM.  In the CAM ecosystem, there is a large array of technological diversity, and the  securing of CAM products and services requires an assessment of a wide variety of  systems and technical assets in order to implement the necessary cybersecurity  measures to counter possible attacks. Cybersecurity needs to be addressed in the  early conception phases of a product or service to ensure that there are no gaps or  27 Upcoming, to receive a copy, please contact the authors.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  29  vulnerabilities. Due to the highly interdependent nature of the automotive domain, this  requires information sharing between different CAM stakeholders.  5. Fragmented regulatory environment.  In order to manage cybersecurity risks, there are a large number of standards and  regulations to comply with, especially given the mix of local and international  environments. In Europe, regulations tend to be harmonised by the Member States,  but there are also countries with specific and independent regulations. An organisation  may therefore be subject to different schemes of one product range. The current  regulatory framework does not include any test requirements or performance criteria  for cybersecurity evaluation/assessment.  6. Lack of expertise and skilled resources for CAM cybersecurity.  The lack of human resources with expertise in cybersecurity (e.g. software security,  network security, cryptography, embedded systems, operational technology, etc.) on  the market is a major obstacle that hinders the adoption of security measures specific  to the CAM products and solutions. Furthermore, companies and organisations face a  strong competition to recruit the desired profiles.  7. Lack of information sharing and coordination on security issues among the CAM  actors.  Considering data access and exchange within the ecosystem, trust between parties  and data governance is a key challenge to address in order to implement a secure,  competitive and lasting cybersecurity model  As discovered in the 2.1.1 Stakeholder interactions section of this document, the stakeholders  in the CAM ecosystem are intertwined. For that reason, so are the cybersecurity challenges that  they are facing, which are not standardised. The recommendations proposed by ENISA aim to  guide the CAM ecosystem stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement and  harmonisation of cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem in the European Union.  2.3.1 Cybersecurity measures  The section presents CAM oriented security measures along with their level of implementation  by the CAM stakeholders. The list of security measures (presented in Figure 13 and detailed in  B Annex) was established through the analysis of relevant documents and standards identified  during desk research. The analysis identified the most important cybersecurity aspects of the  CAM ecosystem and the resulting 33 security measures issued from the NIS Cooperation  Group28, were classified into five categories29: Governance; Risk & Ecosystem Management;  Detection & Reaction; Maintenance in Security Condition; IS/IT/OT security measures. The full  overview is presented in Figure 13.  28 The 33 cybersecurity measures are issued from the NIS Cooperation Group and are aligned with the NIS Directive. See  more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  The NIS Cooperation Group is the leading body for implementing the NIS directive.

For this reason, the security measures do not apply to all stakeholders, rather it depends on the  services and systems that they use. The survey respondents were asked to assess the level of  implementation of security measures between not implemented, partially implemented,  implemented, or implemented and controlled, as well as don’t know/no opinion. These answers  were also chosen by the stakeholders depending on the risk assessments that need to be  conducted, according to the perceived level of risk. Some organisations, such as the  aftermarket, were still in the process of evaluation standards and legislation  (drafting/implementation), for that reason, they may not have reached the required level of  implementation. Furthermore, as a general comment, it was pointed out that globally acceptable  testing processes that are objective and traceable are missing in the CAM ecosystem.  The below sub-categories present the five domains of CAM security measures. In this chapter,  a number of selected security measures are discovered in-depth. The data used in the analysis  below is indicative and is therefore meant to give only an insight on the answers of the  respondents of the survey.  The described measures are discussed because the answers received from the participants  showed relatively lower score compared to other security measures and need further  development.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  31  Governance  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 14: Survey answer about the Governance Analysis  Under the governance umbrella, two cybersecurity measures will be further discussed, due to  their low overall implementation:  -  Cybersecurity management system audit  -  Information system/product security indicators.  An operator regularly audits the cybersecurity management system it has implemented. As part  of their cybersecurity management systems, stakeholders should implement organisations and  processes to identify, among others, the threats vulnerabilities, and risks they are facing. Any  shortcomings may pose risks, and these may materialise and impact the areas in which the  organisation is active, for example, governance, data security, physical security, third-party  management. Though, this assessment is difficult to organise as it requires to cover many  business process, information systems and technologies, and requires an involvement of all  businesses and associated top management. This organisation should be audited regularly in  order to ensure its processes are relevant and efficient for risk management. The stakeholders  responding to the survey had mixed views given the difficulty to organise auditing, including  privacy issues that need to be considered, among others. OEMs’ level of implementation of  cybersecurity management system audit is implemented and sometimes also controlled. Tier 1  and Tier 2 suppliers, OITS, National Competent Authorities/Road Authorities, standardisation  bodies as well as associations have different practices among themselves, ranging throughout  the four levels of implementation.  As for information system/product security indicators, these are a challenge for all CAM  stakeholders within the ecosystem. ENISA, in 2018, published a report on Good practices for  identifying and assessing cybersecurity interdependencies particularly between Operators of  Essential Services (OES), Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and National Competent Authorities  (NCA).30 It provides a description of interdependencies, highlights risk assessment practices,  proposes a framework as well as defines good practices for assessing interdependencies. The  CAM ecosystem stakeholders mostly responded (not taking into account don’t know answers)  that information system/product security indicators are implemented and controlled, which is  especially true for Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in the CAM area, as well as OEMs. OITS and  30 Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs.

Ecosystem Management  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 15: Survey answer about the Ecosystem  The four following security measures related to the management of the CAM ecosystem will be  further discussed:  -  Information system/product security accreditation;  -  Communication with competent authorities and CSIRTs.  According to interviews conducted with the CAM stakeholders, the security measure related to  the security accreditation of information system and product is mainly implemented by Tier 1  and Tier 2 suppliers and OEMs, and the automotive aftermarket. Otherwise, in general,  operators do not necessarily accredit their product(s) prior to release. This can be explained by  the fact that security accreditation of products is not yet mandatory for connected mobility  related services in Europe. Additionally, it has to be acknowledged that cost to certify a product  is something that should be always taken on a risk-based approach, as not all products should  and can be certified.  The communication of stakeholders with the competent authorities and CSIRTs is part of the  ecosystem management framework. Nevertheless, there are not a lot of CSIRTs exist with  knowledge for CAM. The stakeholders are invited to set up a service enabling them to take  note, without undue delay, of the information sent by their competent national authority  concerning incidents, vulnerabilities, threats and relevant mapping (up-to-date inventory of CIS,  interconnections of CIS with third-party networks, etc.). The CAM stakeholders have confirmed  that security incidents are collected and treated, but the process of sending incidents and  potential threats to their national competent authority is not mandatory for connected mobility-  related services at this time. As a result, very few stakeholders have implemented this security  measure focusing on communication between operators and authorities. Moreover, many  stakeholders, apart from OEMs, do not have specific standards for their products.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  33  Detection & Reaction  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 16: Survey answer about the Detection and Reaction  The three following security measures related to the management of the CAM ecosystem will be  further discussed:  -  Logs correlation and analysis  -  Logging  As concerns logs correlation and analysis, an operator creates a system that mines the events  recorded by the logging system installed on each of the CIS/product in order to detect events  that affect CIS/product security. There are different types of logs (e.g. system, network,  technical, monitoring). For OITS, device behaviour is monitored with systematic processes  when measuring logs correlation and analysis. In the CAM ecosystem, the correlation and  analysis are tricky to set up as it can be on the vehicle, at the platform level, or even the  infrastructure level, which means employing different computational resources. In this case as  well, this security measure mostly revolves around OITS, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and OEMs,  where associations have not expressed an opinion or reported that they do not implement this  measure.  An operator, as part of the detection and reaction security measures, should also carry out  logging, which is setting up a logging system on each CIS/product in order to record security-  relevant events. An OITS for example, collects system logs for security, which are then cross  analysed from different sources to detect security incidents. This happens systematically on  servers, but yet to be installed on embedded devices due to feasibility, costs and system  capabilities. These challenges are common throughout the ecosystem as analysing the  collected (or logged) data necessitate resources, technical skills and awareness. In addition to  OITS, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and OEMs have also mostly implemented the logging security  measure.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  34  Maintenance  The following graph represents the answers given by all stakeholders in the survey.  Figure 178: Survey answer about the Maintenance  The security maintenance procedure is the sole security measure under the maintenance  domain. It refers to an operator developing and implementing a procedure for security  maintenance in accordance with its ISSP. To this purpose, the procedure defines the conditions  enabling the minimum security level to be maintained for CIS/products resources.  In the EU, there is legislation covering the fair access to repair and maintenance information by  independent repairers, i.e. information that an OEM needs to be made available to automotive  aftermarket operators to repair a vehicle.31 However, at present, “there is no sector specific  approach on the protection of the vehicle against cyberattacks”, as stated in the legislation. The  large majority of all respondents do not know or have no opinion on this security measure (incl.  standardisation bodies, associations). Nevertheless, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers (to a smaller  extent OEMs and OITS too) have mostly responded with partially implemented and implemented  and controlled.  31 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee, the Committee of the Regions: On the road to automated mobility: An EU strategy for mobility of the future.

Figure 19: Survey answer about IS/IT/OT security measures  The following Information System (IS) / Information Technology (IT) / Operational Technology  (OT) security measures of the CAM ecosystem will be further discussed:  -  Industrial controlling systems  For industrial control systems (ICS), the operator takes the particular security requirements for  ICS into account. ICS include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems,  distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as skid-  mounted Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are often found in the industrial control sectors.  Control systems are important for critical infrastructures and are mutually dependable in the  CAM ecosystem. These systems, integrated with new IT capabilities, need to be highly secure  and tailored to the environment. Over half of the respondents do not know or have no opinion  about this particular security measure. Nevertheless, among the rest of the respondents,  especially Tier and Tier 2 suppliers, OEMs and OITS have partially implemented or even  implemented and control this measure.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  36  2.3.2 Standards  In the CAM ecosystem, developing technologies that are interoperable, safe and secure is a  main challenge. As it has been done in the automotive industry in the last decades, CAM  stakeholders are collaborating with various standardisation bodies in order to create standards  that help to homogenise technologies used in the different technological stacks of the  ecosystem, but also to standardise security measures, process and activities regarding  cybersecurity of the CAM assets’ lifecycle. These standards have different objectives:  -  Standardise conception & development practices trough frameworks;  -  Provide standardised processes for quality, cybersecurity and safety management;  -  Provide frameworks for interoperability of systems between stakeholders;  -  Provide standardised cybersecurity concepts, measures and solutions.  In the CAM industry, the most represented standardisation bodies are ISO (International  Organization for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunication Standard Institute),  IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association), and SAE  (Society of Automotive Engineers).  Figure 20: CAM standards mapping  ISO standards are very transversal and cover themes of general cybersecurity processes  (ISO/IEC 27k32) or quality management (ISO 900133), cybersecurity recommendations for IT  security (ISO/IEC 1540834 & ISO/IEC 1804535) that are applicable for all CAM stakeholders to  very specific development standards for automotive cybersecurity process (ISO/SAE 2143436),  automotive safety process and recommendations for on-board systems (ISO 2626237 &  32 See more at: https://iso27001security.com/html/iso27000.html  33 See more at: https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html  34 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws- regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408  35 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws- regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-18045  36 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  37 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html  https://iso27001security.com/html/iso27000.html https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-18045 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-18045 https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  37  2144838) which are more focused around OEMs, their supply chain, and other relevant CAM  stakeholder that interact with the vehicle. The currently in development standard on road  vehicles: software update engineering is also relevant for CAM stakeholders (ISO/AWI  2408939).  ETSI, especially the TC ITS40 committee, is focusing around standardisation of  telecommunications and indeed developing multiple standards intended to provide guidance  and frameworks for the implementation of secure communication between CAM assets such as  vehicles and road infrastructures (ETSI ITS-G541). More specifically, C-ITS, automotive radars,  and dedicated short-range communications are addressed related to ITS. ETSI standards about  telecommunications are also very important for interoperability purposes.  IEEE standards are generally focused on Intelligent Transport Systems and Automotive  communications (IEEE 802.11bd42) but also providing specific guidance for implementing  security measures when developing automotive software (IEEE-ISTO 610043) or in-vehicle  wireless access (IEEE 1609.244).  Within stakeholders’ groups such as the automotive industry, companies are collaborating in  order to standardise conception practices and provide frameworks about on-board systems,  software and intelligent mobility development. Regarding cybersecurity, AUTOSAR (Automotive  Open System Architecture) provides different frameworks relevant within CAM ecosystem such  as cryptography implementation (40245, 43846), secure on-board communications (65447) and  functional safety features (66448).  Depending on their activities, stakeholders are more or less involved with standardisation  bodies. While some standards are very focused for stakeholders intended to conceive and  develop CAM systems and infrastructures, standards providing general guidance about  cybersecurity processes are relevant for all stakeholders because they provide a generic  approach for risk management which enable the stakeholders to better identify and manage  risks over their products lifecycle and operations.  38 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70939.html  39 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/77796.html  40 See more at: https://www.etsi.org/technologies/automotive-intelligent-transport  41 See more at: https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/302663/01.03.00_20/en_302663v010300a.pdf  42 See more at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723326  43 See more at: https://uptane.github.io/papers/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html  44 See more at: https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1609_2-2016.html  45 See more at: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4- 3/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoServiceManager.pdf  46 See more at: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4- 1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoAbstractionLibrary.pdf  47 See more at: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4- 3/AUTOSAR_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication.pdf  48 https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/19-11/AUTOSAR_EXP_FunctionalSafetyMeasures.pdf  https://www.iso.org/standard/70939.html https://www.iso.org/standard/77796.html https://www.etsi.org/technologies/automotive-intelligent-transport https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302600_302699/302663/01.03.00_20/en_302663v010300a.pdf https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723326 https://uptane.github.io/papers/ieee-isto-6100.1.0.0.uptane-standard.html https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1609_2-2016.html https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoServiceManager.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoServiceManager.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoAbstractionLibrary.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CryptoAbstractionLibrary.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-3/AUTOSAR_SWS_SecureOnboardCommunication.pdf https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/19-11/AUTOSAR_EXP_FunctionalSafetyMeasures.pdf  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  38  3. CONCLUSIONS  Regarding current security measures and challenges encountered, stakeholders had mixed  views as cybersecurity maturity within CAM ecosystem is quite heterogeneous regarding the  diversity of actors involved in the ecosystem. This also results in the diversity of cybersecurity  regulations that may apply to the different types of stakeholders depending on their origin,  though, the regulatory frame regarding cybersecurity over CAM ecosystem remain light. When  being developed, this regulatory frame should specify what standards are preferred in order to  comply with requirements defined. This shall aim to specify what cybersecurity measures  should be considered the acceptable minimum for CAM actors in order to provide a certain level  of secure products and services.  A future CAM system would need to rely on suitable and robust security mechanisms.  Therefore, the cybersecurity challenges identified, as well as the proposed recommendations  have to be covered by CAM stakeholders. For now, it cannot be reliably forecasted whether this  is to be done mostly in the context of one overarching, maybe even mandatory framework, or if  these aspects will mostly be covered in more individual concepts tailored to specific  cybersecurity domains within the CAM ecosystem. In relation to type approval processes,  OEMs have a well-defined framework associated to Regulation (EU) 2018/85849, other  stakeholders nevertheless need to conform to existing and future type approval processes.  As of today, there is no global cybersecurity governance framework covering the whole CAM  ecosystem that propose an end to end model to cover cybersecurity risks. Hence, stakeholders  generally collaborate through standardisation bodies and associations in order to develop  homogenised cybersecurity frameworks and measures. Additionally, stakeholders collaborate  through their contractual relationship that enable to formalise responsibilities regarding  cybersecurity and risk management. However, these collaborations do not cover all aspects of  cybersecurity for CAM and some specific topics are not considered yet, especially in some  technical cybersecurity areas such as vulnerability disclosure, involvement of the national  CSIRTs and information sharing. The CAM industry and stakeholders should work together in  order to ensure technical terms are standardised and/or minimum requirements are agreed, to  ensure all stakeholder can set-up cybersecurity activities specific to CAM assets using common  methods and vocabulary.  49 Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market  surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such  vehicles.

These include policy and legal  initiatives, co-funding and/or launching research and innovation projects.  In 2016, the European Commission adopted the European Strategy on Cooperative Intelligent  Transport Systems (C-ITS).51 C-ITS refers to the group of technologies and applications that  allow data exchange through various wireless communication technologies. In this light, the  Strategy set out to deploy vehicles that communicate with each other (V2V) and with  infrastructure (V2I) on roads in the European Union. Further elements of the Strategy included,  among others, supporting various communication technologies, addressing security and data  protection issues, developing a legal framework, and ensuring cooperation among the Member  States. The EU also put in place a learning-by-doing approach, such as with the C-ROADS  platform, a joint initiative by the Member States and road operators, in order to test and  implement C-ITS services.52 The platform as well as projects are co-funded by the EU through  the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).  In 2016 as well, the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS  Directive)53 was adopted and entered into force in August. The Member States then transposed  the Directive into national law in May 2018. The NIS Directive is the first EU-wide legislation on  cybersecurity, providing the legal measures boosting the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  The Directive focuses on three parts: national capabilities, cross-border collaboration, and  national supervision of critical sectors. The transport sector includes rail, air, water, and road  and the Directive calls to identify the relevant road authorities and Operators of Intelligent  Transport Systems. ENISA continuously supports the implementation of the NIS Directive in the  road transport sector through, for example, the publication of reports on good practices for  cybersecurity of smart cars, collaborating with DG MOVE through the C-ITS Platform, and the  regular engagement with industrial stakeholders.  The two ENISA reports of good practices for cybersecurity of smart cars are as follows. ENISA,  in 2017, published a study on Cybersecurity and Resilience of Smart Cars54. The report  identifies good practices that ensure the security of smart cars against cyber threats, taking into  account that smart cars’ security should also guarantee safety. The three categories of good  practices identified were policy and standards, organisational measures, and security functions.  ENISA proposed recommendations for the different stakeholders in the smart car ecosystem,  comprising smart car manufacturers, tiers, aftermarket vendors, insurance companies, industry  50 As reported in 2018.

In 2019, ENISA then complemented the above-  mentioned report by broadening the scope to (semi-)autonomous cars and Vehicle-to-  Everything (V2X) communications. The published report on Good Practices for Security of  Smart Cars55 highlights the importance of cybersecurity for connected cars. The report identifies  the asset and threat taxonomy of connected and autonomous vehicles, the threats targeting the  smart cars ecosystem as well as the potential security measures, complemented by good  practices mitigating them.  In 2017 through 2018, after years of negotiation the European Parliament, Commission and  Council of Ministers agreed on the adoption of three Mobility Packages.56 These Mobility  Packages are a collection of three initiatives that aim to implement changes to EU road  transport rules. Mobility Package 1 covers various aspects of the industry, including social,  enforcement, technical, and regulatory issues. Mobility Package 2, also named Clean Mobility  Package, contains legislative proposals for the transport sector that aim for low and zero  emission vehicles and fight climate change. Finally, Mobility Package 3 encompasses legislative  proposals in the areas of safe, clean and connected mobility.  In 2018, the Commission published a Communication on the road to automated mobility: An EU  strategy for mobility of the future.57 Europe aims to become a world leader in the deployment of  connected and automated mobility, and also insists on bringing down road fatalities, reducing  harmful emission, and decreasing congestion. The final goal is full automation and safe  driverless mobility, with a timeline envisaged to achieve this by 2030, followed by the so-called  Vision Zero58: no road fatalities on European roads by 2050.  In 2019, the European Commission launched the EU-wide Cooperative, Connected, Automated  and Autonomous Mobility (CCAM) Single Platform, consisting of both private and public  stakeholders. The CCAM Single Platform is a joint directive of Directorate-General for Mobility  and Transport (DG MOVE), Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology (DG CNECT), Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship  and SMEs (DG GROW) and Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (DG RTD). The  platform advises and supports the Commission for open road testing, as well as coordinated  research, piloting, testing and deployment activities. Furthermore, there are six working groups  for the different facets of CCAM: WG1 Develop an EU agenda for testing; WG2 Coordination and  cooperation of R&I; WG3 Physical and digital road infrastructure; WG4 Road safety; WG5  Connectivity and digital infrastructure for CCAM; WG6 Cybersecurity and access to in-vehicle  data linked to CCAM.  55 Good Practices for Security of Smart Cars.

Governance  Security measures Description  Standards application  The operator refers to standards in its assessment of cybersecurity  risks and the mitigations, as well as when describing the process  employed.  Cybersecurity management  system  The operator has a Cyber Security Management System in place that  considers the whole lifecycle of the Critical Information System (CIS) /  product, particularly development, production and postproduction.  Cybersecurity management  system audit  The operator regularly audits its Cyber Security Management System.  Information system / product  security policy  The operator establishes, maintains up-to-date and implements an  information system security policy (ISSP) approved by senior  management, guaranteeing high level endorsement of the policy.  Information system / product  security indicators  For each CIS / product and according to a number of indicators and  assessment methods, the operator evaluates its compliance with its  ISSP. Indicators may relate to the risk management organisation’s  performance, the maintaining of resources in secure conditions, etc.  Human resource security  The established information system security policies set up a CIS /  product security awareness raising program for all staff and a security  training program for employees with CIS related responsibilities.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  44  Risk & Ecosystem management  Security measures Description  Information system / product  security risk analysis  The operator conducts and regularly updates a risk analysis,  identifying its Critical Information Systems (CIS) / products  underpinning the provision of the essential services and identifies the  main risks to these CIS.  Information system / product  security audit  The operator establishes and updates a policy and procedures for  performing information system and product security assessments and  audits of critical assets and CIS, taking into account the regularly  updated risks analysis.  Information system / product  security accreditation  The operator accredits the CIS / product prior to release.  Ecosystem relations / Suppliers  risk management  The operator establishes a policy towards its relations with its  ecosystem in order to mitigate the potential risks identified. This  includes suppliers in particular but is not limited to interfaces between  the CIS and third parties. In addition to risk identification, such a  policy should also include sharing of relevant interoperability and  compatibility related cybersecurity information for product  development and integration.  Ecosystem / Suppliers mapping  The operator establishes a mapping of its ecosystem and specifies  responsibilities sharing, including internal and external stakeholders,  including but not limited to suppliers, in particular those with access to  or managing operator’s critical assets / products.  Communication with competent  authorities and CSIRTs  The operator implements a service that enables it to take note,  without undue delay, of information sent out by its national competent  authority concerning incidents, vulnerabilities, threats and relevant  mappings (up-to-date inventory of CIS, interconnections of CIS with  third-party networks, etc.).  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  45  Detection & Reaction  Security measures Description  Crisis management  organisation  The operator defines in its ISSP the organisation for crisis management  in case of security incidents or cyber-attacks and the continuity of  organisation’s activities.  Crisis management process  The operator defines in its ISSP the processes for crisis management  which the crisis management organisation will implement in case of  security incidents or cyber-attacks and the continuity of an  organisation’s activities.  Information system / product  security incident detection  The operator sets up a security incident detection system for detection  of incidents or cyber-attacks that affect the functioning or the security of  its CIS / products, in accordance with its ISSP.  Information system / product  security incident response  The operator creates and keeps up-to-date and implements a  procedure for handling, response to and analyses of incidents that  affect the functioning or the security of its CIS, in accordance with its  ISSP.  Information system / product  security incident Report  The operator creates and keeps up-to-date and implements procedures  for incidents’ reporting.  Logging  The operator sets up a logging system on each CIS / product in order to  record security relevant events.  Logs correlation and analysis  The operator creates a log correlation and analysis system that mines  the events recorded by the logging system installed on each of the CIS /  product in order to detect events that affects CIS / product security.  Business continuity  management  In accordance with its ISSP, the operator defines objectives and  strategic guidelines regarding business continuity management, in case  of IT security incident.  Disaster recovery management  In accordance with its ISSP, the operator defines objectives and  strategic guidelines regarding disaster recovery management, in case  of a severe IT security incident.  Maintenance in security condition  Security measures Description  Security maintenance  procedure  The operator develops and implements a procedure for security  maintenance in accordance with its ISSP. To this purpose, the  procedure defines the conditions enabling the minimum-security level to  be maintained for CIS / products resources.  CYBERSECURITY STOCKTAKING IN THE CAM  November 2020  46  IS/IT/OT security measures  Security measures Description  Information security  management  The relevant information security information about Critical Information  Systems (CIS) and products is managed by an information security  management system. The operator protects its sensitive documents and  files on dedicated file servers with adequate protection measures.  Cryptography  In its ISSP, the operator establishes and implements a policy and  procedures related to cryptography, in view of ensuring adequate and  effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity  and/or integrity of information in its CIS (use of standard, security controls  shall be implemented for storing cryptographic keys, etc.).  Access rights  Among the rules defined in its systems security policy, the operator grants  access rights to a user or an automated process only when that access is  strictly necessary for the user to carry out their mission or for the  automated process to carry out its technical operations based on the  principle of least access privilege.  Identification  For identification, the operator sets up unique accounts and supporting  authentication schemes for users or for automated processes that need to  access resources of its CIS. Unused or no longer needed accounts are to  be deactivated. A regular review process should be established.  Administration accounts  The operator sets up specific accounts for the administration, to be used  only for administrators that are carrying out administration operations  (installation, configuration, management, maintenance, etc.) on its CIS.  These accounts are kept on an up-to-date list.  Administration information  systems  Hardware and software resources used for administration purposes are  managed and configured by the operator, or, where appropriate, by the  service provider that the operator has authorised to carry out  administration operations.  System segregation  The operator segregates its systems in order to limit the propagation of IT  security incidents within its systems or subsystems.  Systems configuration  The operator only installs services and functionalities or connects  equipment which are essential for the functioning and the security of its  CIS.  Traffic filtering  The operator filters traffic flows circulating in its Critical Information  Systems (CIS). The operator therefore forbids traffic flows that are not  needed for the functioning of its systems and that are likely to facilitate an  attack.  Industrial control systems  The operator takes the particular security requirements for ICS (control  systems, SCADA systems, etc) into account.  Physical and environmental  security  The operator prevents unauthorised physical access, damage and  interference to the organisation’s information and information processing  facilities.

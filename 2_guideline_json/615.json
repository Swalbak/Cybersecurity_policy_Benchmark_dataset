Despite the spill-overs  and direct attacks, by-and-large the EU has been able to deal with the cyber threats posed  by the Russian aggression through the resilience of its Member States and across Europe,  as well as forging support and cooperation with Ukraine and other allies and partners.  Within this context, ENISA’s challenge is both to keep pace and set the pace in supporting  the Union in achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. This Single  Programming Document (SPD) for the years 2023-2025 represents another step in  bringing this about.  Firstly, it puts emphasis on strengthening the resilience of Member States and EU  institutions, bodies and agencies. In 2023, approximately half of ENISA’s operational  resources, both budget and human resources, will be dedicated to enhancing operational  cooperation and building capacity. Together with the one-off support of up to 15 million  EUR, which the European Commission allocated to ENISA in Autumn 2022, the Agency  will be able to massively scale up and expand its ex-ante and ex-post services to Member  States in 2023.  Secondly, building on the outcomes of strategic discussions within its Management Board  throughout 2022, the Agency has developed service packages in key areas of its mandate.  They integrate ENISA’s various outputs across different activities, help the agency to  prioritise its actions, build and make use of internal synergies, and ensure that adequate  resources are reserved across the Agency in a transparent manner.  Thirdly, through this work-programme ENISA will endeavour to help Member States to  prepare for the transposition of the reviewed NIS Directive, as well as to prepare the  ground for the roll-out and implementation of the EU cybersecurity certification schemes.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 7  Finally, recognising the growing need to bring together the EU's activities and resources  across the cybersecurity communities, this SPD establishes a new activity in the area  of research and innovation to structure the Agency’s cooperation and collaboration with  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and its emerging networks.  All those areas also accentuate the resource constraints under which the Agency now  operates. The foreseen budget increase for the 2023 work programme has been fully  absorbed by the increase in staff expenditure and inflation. Due to a shortfall of over  3 million EUR, the Agency has had to reduce the scope of some of its operational activities,  limiting the number of exercises and training it rolls-out or postponing its actions in  countering ransomware.  Such reductions mean drawbacks in certain areas and might become a real obstacle if  new tasks should be added to the Agency without a parallel increase in its resources. Thus,  though ENISA welcomes the pioneering set of cybersecurity initiatives being put forward in  2022 and relishes the different and varied roles they imply for the Agency, it needs to have  the right level of human and financial resourcing to match those aims and ambitions.  The EU has been mastering cybersecurity initiatives and structures not least through  a unique general consensus across parties and across Member States as its prime driving  force. This consensus should now also include the resourcing of the Agency. This would give  the Union the ability it needs to steer cybersecurity developments in the years to come.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  8  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cybersecurity policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the  Union’s infrastructure and services and keep our  society and citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be  an agile, environmentally and socially responsible  organisation focused on people.  MISSION STATEMENT  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 9  STRATEGY  CYBERSECURITY POLICY  Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital  transformation and the need for it permeates  all sectors, therefore it needs to be considered  across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives.  Cybersecurity must not be restricted to a specialist  community of technical cybersecurity experts.  Cybersecurity must therefore be embedded across all  domains of EU policies. Avoiding fragmentation and  the need for a coherent approach while taking into  account the specificities of each sector is essential.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  The benefits of the European digital economy and  society can only be fully attained under the premise  of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders.  All layers of society can be impacted and the Union  needs to be ready to respond to massive (large-scale  and cross-border) cyber-attacks and cyber crisis.  Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted  the need for effective cooperation between Member  States and the EU institutions for faster response and  proper coordination of efforts at all levels (strategic,  operational, technical and communications).  CAPACITY BUILDING  The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals,  organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly. The  needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest in building  competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels,  from the non-expert to the highly skilled professional.  The investments should focus not only on increasing  the cybersecurity skillset in the Member States but  also on making sure that the different operational  communities possess the appropriate capacity to deal  with the cyber threat landscape.  TRUSTED SOLUTION  Digital products and services bring benefits as well  as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of  digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the  goal to strike a balance between societal, market,  economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral  entity acting in a transparent manner will increase  customer trust on digital solutions and the wider  digital environment.  10  FORESIGHT  Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or  close to mainstream adoption, would benefit from  the use of foresight methods. Through a structured  process enabling dialogue among stakeholders,  decision- and policy-makers would be able to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU  resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions  to address emerging challenges.  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 11  KNOWLEDGE  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is  information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives,  to work in a constantly moving environment – in  terms of digital developments as well as with  regard to actors – to face the challenges of our  time, a continuous process of collecting, organising,  summarising, analysing, communicating, and  maintaining cybersecurity information and knowledge  is clearly needed. All phases are essential to ensure  that information and knowledge is shared and  expanded within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem  I  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 13  The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine  dominates today’s EU security agenda and threatens  global stability and security. ENISA has stepped up its  coordination and preparedness and contributed to the  EU’s shared situational awareness by providing regular  situational reports on cyber activity. There has also been  intensified coordination and exchange of information  with cybersecurity networks, such as the Cyber Crises  Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) consisting of  national cybersecurity crisis management authorities,  and numerous sectorial communities supported by  ENISA. In addition, constant efforts have ensured that  channels of communication between the political,  operational and technical levels, as well enhanced  cooperation with the Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRT) Network were realised.  Preparedness in the area of cybersecurity is more  essential than ever, given the increased exposure of  Europe to an accumulation of threats due to the war.  Efforts to step up preparedness included a number  of actions such as exercises, guidance, legislative  measures, increasing resilience in critical sectors and  work with partners. During the French Presidency  of the Council of the European Union, the European  External Action Service (EEAS) and ENISA together  organised a scenario-based exercise in early 2022,  called EU CyCLES (Cyber Crisis Linking Exercise on  Solidarity), with the aim of raising awareness at the  political level and strengthening cooperation between  the operational and political levels should a large- scale cyberattack take place.  ENISA cybersecurity support action  While the implementation of a new 'Emergency  Response Fund for Cybersecurity' is under  assessment and may require further deliberations,  DG CONNECT allocated EUR 15 million to support  Member States in the short term in view of the  immediate and elevated threat of malicious  cyber activities due to the ongoing Russian war  of aggression against Ukraine. The EU needs  to respond to these threats and be prepared  to respond to cyberattacks.  This short-term support aims to complement and  not duplicate efforts by Member States and those at  Union level to increase the level of protection and  resilience to cyber threats, by providing ENISA with  additional means to support preparedness (ex-ante),  and response (ex-post) to large-scale cybersecurity  incidents. As such, regular tasks in the work  programmes under activities 3, 4 and 5 have been  expanded to continue this support well into 2023.  Service catalogue  In 2022 the Agency introduced the concept of  a service catalogue to allow management to focus  efforts and resources in a highly structured and more  efficient manner for attaining specific objectives. The  ENISA service catalogues are organised into individual  service packages. A service package is a collection of  SECTION I  GENERAL CONTEXT  14  cybersecurity products and services that span across  a number of activities and contribute to the objectives  of a discrete service package. A service package is  a means of centralising all services that are important  to the stakeholders that use it.  The agency has identified five discrete service  packages that make up ENISA’s service catalogue:  NIS directive (NIS);  Training and exercises (TREX);  Situational Awareness (SITAW);  Certification (CERTI);  Cybersecurity index (INDEX).  The multi-annual work programme in section 2  outlines in greater detail the activities that lead and  contribute to the service catalogue including the  required resources both in terms of budget and  human resources.  ENISA’s annual Threat Landscape (ETL) for 2022  marks the 10th iteration of this flagship report and  will be published in October 2022. ETL 2022 looked  at threats across the EU and the world in the period  starting July 2021 and finishing in July 2022.  The major highlights include an increase in  threats against availability and the persistence of  ransomware as one of the prime threats, despite  ongoing efforts to tackle it. Threats against availability  increased significantly, targeting the provisioning  of services (telecommunications and energy in  particular) and the major motivation behind relevant  incidents that involve disruption of service.  When it comes to ransomware, a dedicated threat  landscape was published in July 2022 noting the  importance of this threat. Approximately 10 terabytes  of data are stolen each month by ransomware threat  actors and 58.2% of the data stolen includes employees'  personal data. While at least 47 distinct threat actors  who use ransomware were identified, for 94.2% of  incidents we do not know whether the company paid  the ransom or not. It is estimated however that 62.12%  of companies either came to an agreement with the  attackers or found another solution. In most cases the  affected organisations are unaware of how threat actors  managed to gain initial access.  The latter two findings highlight issues in incident  reporting; when it comes to ransomware incidents  only the tip of the iceberg is reported.  In 2022, a notable increase in the activities of state- sponsored and proxy threat actors was observed,  attributed to the volatile geopolitical environment  and the war in Ukraine in particular. It is important to  highlight the inclusion of an analysis of the vulnerability  landscape and the impact and motivation per sector  that were part of the ETL for the first time in 2022.  ENISA continues to constantly monitor the  cybersecurity threat landscape using an open and  transparent methodology that was made available  to the public in June 2022. This initiative aims  to promote transparency in ENISA’s work, build  confidence and support capacity building across MSs.  It is in the context of such challenges that ENISA  is exploring ways to improve the reporting of  incidents. The revised Network and Information  Security Directive (NIS2) is expected to change the  way cybersecurity incidents are notified. The new  provisions will aim to support a better mapping and  understanding of the relevant incidents.  NIS Investments 2022  The 3rd ENISA NIS Investments study is scheduled  for publication in November 2022 and offers  additional insights into the cybersecurity budgets  of Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital  Service Providers (DSP) and how the NIS Directive has  influenced this budget. The annual stock-taking of  this data now allows for historical traceability and the  identification of trends.  A typical OES or DSP in the EU earmarks 6.7% of  its IT investments for information security, while  the average value is 7.2%. When analysing this  normalised data set with historically available data,  a decrease of one percentage point is observed in  comparison to the median IS vs IT spending in 2020.  However, the historical analysis has to be done while  keeping in mind the slight differences in the samples  between the years of study and the differences in  the macro environment, such as the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic in the cost-optimisation practices  of OESs and DSPs.  The survey data also indicates that a typical OES or  DSP in the EU spends EUR 50,000 on cyber threat  intelligence, while the average spend amounts to  EUR 399,000. The disparity between the median and  average values indicates that most organisations do  not earmark vast budgets for CTI, while some (larger)  organisations — specifically within the banking  and energy sectors — do invest significantly in CTI.  Cybersecurity investment strategies of 69% of the  OESs and DSPs in the EU were mostly influenced by  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 15  SECTION I. General context  the threat landscape, closely followed (66%) by their  obligations under the NIS Directive.  LEGISLATIVE MEASURES DESIGNED  TO STRENGTHEN THE RESPONSE  TO THE THREAT LANDSCAPE  The adoption and implementation of policy  frameworks is one key response area where the  EU is making a difference. Indeed, the policies and  initiatives being put in place in the coming years  are determining how the EU faces the cybersecurity  challenges of today and tomorrow. Within this  picture, ENISA will determine and adapt its support in  particular in the following areas.  NIS2 Directive  In May 2022 political agreement was reached  between the European Parliament and EU  Member States on measures for a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2  Directive) proposed by the Commission in  December 2020.  The NIS2 proposal consolidates, reinforces  and extends the existing approach under NIS1,  consolidating cybersecurity provisions from  other legal provisions (EECC/telecoms and eIDAS/ trust) under NIS2, strengthening for example  incident reporting provisions and extending the  scope, including cloud and data centres under  critical services, and adding additional sectors,  such as space (important for securing satellite  communications, a vital infrastructure in remote  rural areas, but also as a fail over in times of  a natural disaster or military conflict).  NIS2 underlines the special role of telecoms as  a highly mature sector, a conduit for cyberattacks  and a possible filter or shield, protecting less  mature and harder to protect sectors such as  healthcare. In addition the ambitions of NIS2 need  to be supported with better incident reporting to  create a better situational picture, with vulnerability  disclosure policies and an EU vulnerability database,  with supply chain security and other coordinated  Union-wide cybersecurity risk assessments, by  expanding the scope in terms of sectors covered,  and by creating the right culture and environment  for essential and important entities to share  cybersecurity relevant information such as cyber  threats, vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise,  tactics, techniques and procedures, cybersecurity  alerts and configuration tools.  The transposition of NIS2 into national laws and the  implementation phase lie ahead. As such ENISA is  developing its service and expertise for this with the  introduction of a service catalogue based on existing  NIS1 expertise that are reflected in this draft single  programming document (SPD).  ENISA is already invested in activities linked to  the development and implementation of the NIS  Directive, with its resilience, cooperation and  capacity-building work, and will be building up its own  capacities to support the outcome of the proposal  in the coming years, using existing resources and  building on these wherever necessary.  Joint Cyber Unit  The EU cybersecurity eco-system does not yet have  a common space to work together across different  communities and fields which allow existing networks  to tap their full potential. The 2020 EU Cybersecurity  Strategy outlined the need for a Joint Cyber Unit (JCU).  The strategy identified the main problems to which  the JCU would contribute solutions, its objectives and  the steps needed to achieve them. It builds on the  work started with the Recommendation (4520 (2021))  for a coordinated response to incidents and crises –  the so called Blueprint - in 2017.  ENISA will contribute to the next steps following the  EC Recommendation (4520 (2021) on 'building the  Joint Cyber Unit') and Council Conclusions (20 October  2021 (ST 13048 2021) on ‘exploring the potential of  the Joint Cyber Unit initiative – complementing the EU  Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Cybersecurity  Incidents and Crises’), with a view to contributing to  the further development of an EU crisis management  framework along the lines and according to the roles  defined in the on-going discussions amongst Member  States and EU operational actors.  Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)  In her State of the Union 2021 address, President von  der Leyen underlined that the EU should strive to  become a leader in cybersecurity, announcing in that  context a new European Cyber Resilience Act. The  act would add in particular to the existing baseline  cybersecurity framework of the NIS Directive (and  upcoming NIS2 framework) and the Cybersecurity Act.  The Act establishes common European cybersecurity  requirements for products with digital elements that  are placed on the internal market by introducing  essential requirements for such products as well as  16  imposing obligations on manufacturers, importers  and distributors. Products with digital elements create  opportunities for EU economies and societies. However,  they also lead to new challenges – when everything is  connected, a cybersecurity incident can affect an entire  system, disrupting economic and social activities.  The CRA aims to address market needs and protect  consumers from insecure products by introducing  common cybersecurity rules for manufacturers,  importers and distributors of tangible and  intangible products with digital elements. The CRA  proposal was published on the 15 September 2022.  The CRA will apply to all products connected directly  or indirectly to another device or network. Open- source software and products and services covered  by other existing rules, such as medical devices,  aviation and cars, are explicitly excluded.  ENISA has provided expert opinion and is working  towards collecting evidence to support an impact  assessment through its Cybersecurity Policy  Observatory (CSPO) and will also provide support in  later stages (post-impact assessment) by contributing  to elements of the legislative proposal such as risk  categorisation and security requirements.  Implementation of the EU cybersecurity  certification framework  ENISA is playing a central role in supporting the  implementation of the European cybersecurity  certification framework by preparing and  maintaining the candidate schemes. In this task  ENISA is supported by area experts and operates in  collaboration with public authorities in the Member  States. It is expected that the draft candidate  cybersecurity certifications schemes proposed by  ENISA will be adopted as Commission implementing  Regulations. The adopted schemes will allow for the  assessment of the conformity of digital products,  services and processes in the Digital Single Market  under those schemes, which can contribute to  increasing the level of customer trust in digital  solutions in the Union.  Currently, ENISA has prepared a candidate scheme  for the EU Common Criteria European candidate  cybersecurity certification scheme (EUCC) which  has been transposed into an EU Implementing Act  by the Commission for its final adoption. In 2022,  the candidate scheme on Cloud Services (EUCS)  will be submitted to the ECCG for its opinion.  Furthermore, an ad hoc working group has started  work preparing a candidate certification scheme  for 5G networks (EU5G), with a first phase to  characterise the possibility of reusing existing  schemes, and to identify related gaps to be  covered by a relevant EU scheme.  Finalising the candidate schemes for specialised product  categories under the EU Common Criteria (EUCC)  scheme and for cloud services is just the first step and  it will likely bring about benefits in terms of recognition  and trust across government services, business and  citizens during the time period 2023-2025.  In relation to the digital identity framework, ENISA  will support and continue the development of  a certification strategy matching the expectations of  Article 6a of the Regulation which requires Member  States to issue a European Digital Identity Wallet  under a notified eID scheme to common technical  standards following compulsory assessment of  compliance and voluntary certification within the  European cybersecurity certification framework, as  established by the Cybersecurity Act. This strategy  shall make the best reuse of existing schemes  under development and shall also identify potential  new certification means for schemes that would  contribute to the certification of a wallet.  ENISA will also support the development of means of  certification that would allow compliance with certain  requirements of Article 18 of the NIS2 directive to be  demonstrated, as the regulatory provisions of Member  States may require entities to use particular ICT  products, services and processes, either developed by  an essential or important entity or procured from third  parties that are certified under European cybersecurity  certification schemes adopted pursuant to Article 49 of  Regulation (EU) 2019/881.  Where applicable, certification means for CRA related  products, such as Protection Profiles, any additional  certification tool or scheme. Such certification  elements supporting the CRA, as well as other  certification elements supporting other legislations  should be consolidated into the first public version  of the Union Rolling Work Programme, that the EC  foresees being published in Q4 2022.  Research & Innovation  The EU is expanding its support and investment in the  wealth of expertise and experience in cybersecurity  research, technological and industrial development  that exists in the EU by prioritising its efforts to  support research and innovation, in particular through  a common agenda implemented by the European  Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and the  Network of National Coordination Centres (NCC).  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 17  SECTION I. General context  Therefore, a new activity has been included in the  2023 work programme dedicated to research and  innovation under Article 11 of the CSA. This new activity  will consolidate ENISA's processes for identifying  cybersecurity research needs and funding priorities  and ensure that resources are managed efficiently for  delivering stakeholder expectations in this area.  ENISA, with the support from the community, will  continue mapping ongoing activities to identify and  prioritise areas where more research, development  and implementation is needed to improve  Europe's knowledge, resilience and response to  current and emerging cyber threats. These research  and innovation needs and funding priorities will  constitute ENISA's advice and contribution to the  EU's strategic research and innovation agenda.  The European Digital Identity  Framework  Digital identity and trust services are crucial for  the EU digital market, because they allow citizens  and businesses to carry out transactions online in  a safe and trusted way. In 2020 the Commission  reviewed the Electronic Identification and Trust  Services (eIDAS) Regulation and identified factors  hindering the adoption of mechanisms for electronic  identification. In June 2021 the Commission  made a proposal for a revised eIDAS Regulation  establishing a European Digital Identity framework  and a European Digital Wallet, to be available for  all EU citizens, on a voluntary basis and that will  be usable for online transactions with government  entities, but also with businesses.  In the 2023-2025 period, ENISA will support Member  States and the Commission with the development  of the European Digital Identity Framework and the  European Digital Identity Wallets, as set out in proposal  for a revised eIDAS regulation in addition to promoting  the exchange of good practises and capacity building  for relevant stakeholders. The revised eIDAS regulation  also expands the list of qualified trust services with  distributed ledgers and electronic archiving and the  management of remote devices for the creation of  electronic signatures and seals.  The NIS2 proposal for a revised NIS Directive  foresees that the security obligations laid down in  this Directive should be considered complementary  to the requirements imposed on trust service  1 Proposal for a Regulation (EU) 2021/ 206 of 21 April 2021 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence  (artificial intelligence act) and amending certain union legislative acts. 2 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review.  providers under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (eIDAS  Regulation). When this proposal is adopted, ENISA will  support Member States and the Commission with this  transition, to ensure that the trust service providers  and the national authorities can benefit from the  ecosystem of the NIS Directive.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  With the EU’s AI agenda advancing rapidly following  the European Commission's proposal on AI1 and the  Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 20212, the  EU is addressing the major technological, ethical,  legal and socio-economic challenges to put AI at the  service of European citizens and the economy, for  instance by considering linking high-risk AI systems  to mandatory trustworthiness requirements. One  of these challenges is understanding the interplay  between cybersecurity and AI and how this can  affect availability, safety or the resilience of future AI  services and applications.  Building on ENISA’s efforts towards securing AI and  machine learning, the Agency can continue its open  dialogue with EU institutions in support of legislative  initiatives reaching into 2023-2025. For this, ENISA  will systematically monitor existing initiatives from  Member States in this area and continue supporting  the Commission and Member States by providing  guidelines to good security practices.  Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)  In June 2022, the Council presidency and the  European Parliament reached a political agreement  on the regulation of digital operational resilience for  the financial sector. The regulation aims to ensure  that all participants in the financial system are subject  to a common set of standards to mitigate ICT risks for  their operations and have the necessary safeguards  in place to mitigate cyberattacks and other risks.  The proposed legislation will require firms to  ensure that they can withstand all types of ICT- related disruptions and threats. ENISA is actively  supporting the mapping of cyber legislative  initiatives in the finance sector and works closely  with the European Commission and relevant EU  Bodies on the cybersecurity aspects of DORA  including crisis management, incident reporting  and information sharing.  18  Network Code on Cybersecurity  The Network Code on Cybersecurity aims to set sector  specific rules for the cybersecurity of cross-border  electricity flows across EU member states. It includes  rules on cyber risk assessment, common minimum  requirements, cybersecurity certification of products  and services, monitoring, reporting and crisis  management. It is part of the Commission's request  to European Network of Transmission System  Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) pursuant to  Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and ENISA has been actively  involved in defining approaches to risk assessment,  common minimum cybersecurity requirements and  appropriate technical and organisational measures.  The code contains many references to and foresees  new leading and supporting tasks for ENISA amongst  others, facilitation of an Early Warning System,  supporting Agency for the Cooperation of Energy  Regulators (ACER) in monitoring the implementation  of the code and supporting (ENTSO) and the  European Distribution System Operators (DSO) entity  with organising sector specific exercises.  Once-only technical system (OOTS)  Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/17243, the  Commission adopted implementing Regulation  C(2022)5628 which sets out technical and operational  specifications of the technical system for the  cross-border automated exchange of evidence  and application of the 'once-only' principle. ENISA  supports the efforts of the Commission and Member  States on cybersecurity aspects of the deployment  of the system, including risk management and  the identification of appropriate technical and  organisational measures to mitigate identified threats  Chips Act  On 8 February 2022, the European Commission  proposed a comprehensive set of measures for  strengthening the EU’s semiconductor ecosystem,  the European Chips Act4. In this package, the  Commission has adopted a Communication,  3 Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 October 2018 establishing a single digital gateway  to provide access to information, to procedures and to assistance and problem-solving services and amending Regulation (EU)  No 1024/2012 http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1724/oj http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1724/oj. 4 COM(2022) 45.

Commission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox to address semiconductor shortages and an EU mechanism  for monitoring the semiconductor ecosystem. 08/02/2022. 5 Cybersecurity – uniform rules for EU institutions, bodies and agencies (europa.eu).  6 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information security in the institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies of the Union | European Commission (europa.eu).  outlining the rationale and the overall strategy,  a proposal for a Regulation for adoption by co- legislators, a proposal for amendments to a Council  Regulation establishing the Key digital technologies  (KDT Joint Undertaking, and a Recommendation to  Member States promoting actions for monitoring and  mitigating disruptions in the semiconductor supply  chain. Supply chain cybersecurity is an important  cross-cutting issue for stakeholders.  Cybersecurity and information security  for EU institutions, bodies and agencies  In March 2022, the European Commission  proposed a new regulation5 with rules to increase  cybersecurity in all EU institutions, by making  it easier to share information on cyber threats  and improving the efficiency of action to prevent  and respond to cyber threats. This is expected to  reduce the risk of incidents that cause material or  reputational damage to EUIBAs. The proposal calls  for increased cooperation with relevant bodies and  stakeholders in the EU, via CERT-EU and ENISA. In  addition, it is proposed that ENISA will receive on  a monthly basis a summary report from CERT-EU on  significant cyber threats, significant vulnerabilities  and significant incidents.  A proposed regulation6 on information security  in the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies  of the Union was also put forward earlier in 2022  to create a minimum set of information security  rules and standards for all EU institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies to ensure an enhanced and  consistent protection against evolving threats to their  information. These new rules will provide a stable  ground for a secure exchange of information across  EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and with  the Member States, based on standardised practices  and measures to protect information flows.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 19  SECTION I. General context  FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  Memorandum of Understanding  with the European Data Protection  Supervisor (EDPS)  ENISA has a long working relationship with the EDPS  in the areas of privacy and data protection. Over the  years, the two entities have been collaborating on  promoting practical recommendations on technical  cybersecurity aspects in the implementation of the  GDPR and engaging relevant communities through the  co-location of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) and the  Internet Privacy Engineering Network (IPEN) workshops.  In order to strengthen further this collaboration,  the two entities have initiated a discussion on  signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on  establishing strategic cooperation in areas of common  interest. As part of the strategic plan, EDPS and ENISA  will consider designing, developing and delivering  capacity building and awareness raising activities in  areas such as cybersecurity aspects of personal data  protection and contribute jointly to similar activities  organised by other EU or national bodies.  Trusted network of vendors and suppliers  ENISA has initiated the development of a trusted  network of vendors and suppliers for information  exchange and cyber situational awareness with the  aim of contributing to a cooperative response at the  level of the Union and Member States. The focus will  be on building trusted bilateral partnerships about  threat and situational awareness and information  sharing on cyber events, to be followed by a request  for information in response (initiated by ENISA  or by the other party) and collaboration on cyber  information exchange projects.  For decades, Europe has taken steps to improve digital  security and trust through policies and initiatives. The  Management Board of ENISA adopted a new strategy  for the Agency in June 2020, which builds on the  CSA and outlines how the Agency will strive to meet  expectations of the cybersecurity ecosystem in the  long term, in a manner that is open, innovative and  agile as well as being socially and environmentally  responsible. The strategy sets out a vision of a trusted  and cybersecure Europe in which all citizens and  organisations of Europe not only benefit but are also  key components in the effort to secure Europe. Most  importantly, the new ENISA strategy outlines seven  strategic objectives that are derived from the CSA and  set the expected long-term goals for the Agency.  20  II  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 2121  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025    Europe has for decades taken steps to improve  digital security and trust through policies and  initiatives.

ENISA works with  communities, respecting their competencies and  expertise, and fosters synergies and trust to best  achieve its mission.  Excellence. ENISA aims for state-of-the-art  expertise in its work, upholds the highest  quality standards of operation and evaluates its  performance to strive for continuous improvement  through innovation and foresight.   Integrity/ethics. ENISA upholds ethical principles  and relevant EU rules and obligations in its services  and working environment ensuring fairness and  inclusiveness.   Respect. ENISA respects fundamental European  rights and values covering all its services and  working environment, as well as the expectations of  its stakeholders.   Responsibility. ENISA assumes responsibility thus  ensuring integration of the social and environmental  dimensions into practices and procedures.  Transparency. ENISA adopts procedures, structures  and processes that are open, factual and independent,  thus limiting bias, ambiguity, fraud and obscurity.    The corporate objective of sound resource and risk  management is derived from requirements in Art  4(1) of the CSA that sets an objective for the Agency  to 'be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue  of its independence, the scientific and technical  quality of the advice and assistance it delivers, the  Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management   Activity 11  Art 4(1)  •  Maximise quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens   •  Building lasting credibility and trust   1.

In addition, the  inspiration for this corporate objective stems from  the values of Excellence and Transparency derived  from ENISA's strategy and the principle of Efficiency  set out in MB decision 2020/5 on the principles  to be applied for organising ENISA. This aims for  ENISA to uphold the highest quality of standards,  strive for continuous improvement and enhance the  organisation’s performance.      The corporate objective of building an agile  organisation focused on people is derived from  requirements in Art 3(4) of the CSA which obliges the  Agency to 'develop its own resources, including /…/  human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform  the tasks assigned to it under this Regulation'. In  addition, the inspiration for this corporate objective  stems from the values of Responsibility and Respect  derived from ENISA's strategy and the principle of  Competences set out in MB decision 2020/5 on the  principles to be applied for organising ENISA. This  aims for ENISA to respect fundamental European  rights and values in its working environment, assume  responsibility for the social and environmental  dimensions of its procedures and to develop its staff  competences, expertise and talent.   Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management   Activity 11  Art 4(1)  •  Maximise quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens   •  Building lasting credibility and trust   1.

Acknowledging ENISA’s exceptional  operational mandate, the Commission and the  Budgetary Authority have continued to support  ENISA’s annual budget and requests for posts,  including allocating additional posts to the Agency  through the NIS2 directive, transferring additional  posts for seconded national experts to strengthen  the domain of operational cooperation and through  a one-off transfer of up to 15 million EUR in 2022  for supporting the Agency’s ability to provide  Member States with ex-ante and ex-post services in  response to the heightened threat level caused by  the Russian war in Ukraine.   The Agency has also, under the guidance of its  Management Board, elaborated comprehensive  service catalogues around its key tasks. Those service  catalogues cover the Agency’s services in support  of the implementation of the revised NIS directive,  certification, operational cooperation (in particular  creating services to strengthen situational awareness  at the Union level), capacity building (training  and exercises) and knowledge and information  management. The service catalogues have enabled  the Agency to better match its outputs to the needs  and priorities of the beneficiaries, create internal and  external synergies thus increasing efficiency but also  estimating the resources needed to cover the full  catalogue of services. Those necessary resources have  been mapped under each activity within the current  SPD, and they show that current resources represent  over EUR 3 million less than ENISA’s projected needs.   In terms of its human resources, the number of  Establishment Plan posts has grown from 59 to 82  posts during the period 2019–2022, that is by 39% as  a result of the new tasks that were foreseen under  the new Cybersecurity Act which came into force in  2019. An additional five posts (three TAs and two  CAs) have been authorised under 2022 for new  tasks under the NIS2 Directive. The number of all  authorised posts including TAs, CAs and SNEs grew  following a similar trend, that is by 33%, during the  period 2019-2022.  Table 1a. Evolution of authorised posts  and fulfilment  2019 2020 2021 202210  Number of  posts in the  Establishment  Plan   59  69  76  82   Per cent  fulfilment of the  establishment  plan on the 31st  of December   76%  80%  80%  94%   Total number of  authorised posts  (TAs, CAs, SNEs)   95  111  118  126   Per cent  fulfilment of the  total authorised  posts (TAs, CAs,  SNEs) on the 31st  of December   77 %  77 %  90 %  94 %   As an Agency, ENISA has historically struggled to  meet its needs for human resources and to take  steps to ensure timely and rapid fulfilment of its  Establishment Plan. The gap between available posts  and plan fulfilment is evidenced in the table above.  Historically, this has hampered the Agency in making  use of its potential capabilities in the most efficient  manner, resulting in a smaller real capacity of the  Agency in terms of its human resources.   In order to change this, the Agency embarked on  some human resources management novelties  such as a large-scale call for expressions of interest  for temporary agents (TAs) and contract agents  (CAs) in 2020, with the aim of creating sufficiently  diverse and broad reserve shortlists of candidates  with more transversal competences and skills that  could be used to recruit staff and thus fill the gaps  in the current establishment plan, as well as serve  as a pool of candidates for the establishment plan  on a multiannual basis. In 2021 the Agency also  embarked in an extensive reorganisation of the  management of its human resources, creating  a Strategic Workforce Planning framework11 which  10 3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive; projection on 31.12.2022 depends on successful conclusions of ongoing selection  process Q3-Q4 2022.  11  Strategic workforce planning also enables the Agency to take corrective actions if and when necessary to achieve the aims set out in Article  3(3) of the MB decision MB/2020/9, which foresees that the Executive Director will ensure that 'the average number of staff members assigned  to the Executive Directors Office (EDO) and Corporate Support Services (CSS) [offices and services supporting the functioning of the Agency]  shall not exceed the average number of staff members assigned to units [executing the objectives and tasks of the Agency]'.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 2929  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  prompts the organisation to analyse its human  resource needs ahead on a multiannual basis for  the Single Programming Document, and to plan and  review the allocation and development of human  resources between different activities as well as to  prepare new recruitment calls well in advance of the  enactment of the applicable annual Establishment  Plan. Under this framework, the Agency has reviewed  and restructured its human resources both in  direct operational areas and in administrative and  corporate areas.    In the course of the 2021 Strategic Workforce  Review, the Agency, along with other measures,  reallocated altogether four posts from EDO and  CSS, to be able to meet the threshold foreseen  in Article 3(3) of MB/2020/9. This resulted in the  termination of one contract, and the prolongation  of two contracts was put under review. The posts  were allocated to the operational units of the Policy  Development & Implementation Unit (PDI), Capacity  Building Unit (CBU) and Market, Certification and  Standardisation Unit (MCS).   In the course of the 2022 Strategic Workforce Review,  the Agency, along with other measures, reallocated  altogether three posts from EDO and CSS in order  to be able to meet the threshold foreseen in Article  3(3) of MB/2020/9. This resulted in a termination of  two contracts and a cancellation of one recruitment  procedure. The posts are now allocated to the  operational units of the Policy Development &  Implementation Unit (PDI), Capacity Building Unit  (CBU) and Operational Cooperation Unit (OCU), to be  fulfilled through ongoing recruitment calls.   The original impact that the conclusions of the 2021  and 2022 Strategic Workforce Review were supposed  to bring are summarised in the table 1b.   Though these exercises aimed at fulfilling and  supporting the resourcing of operational activities,  the Agency’s tight budgetary resources left limited  space for manoeuvring and the delivering of existing  services in corporate and administrative units as due  to budget limitations the possibilities of externalising  service provision could not have been implemented.  2.2.2. Outlook for the years 2023–2025   ENISA shall commit to develop and adopt its  corporate strategy (including HR strategy) which is  expected to present a vision for a modern, flexible  and values-driven planning of all its resources in the  service of an organisation that ensures its staff deliver  outstanding results for all stakeholders across the  EU. The strategy aims to put ‘people’ and ‘services’ at  its heart and steer all of ENISA actions so as to create  the right conditions for delivering on key priorities  while attracting, developing and retaining high calibre  talent. While modernising and uplifting its employer  branding, ENISA processes, policies and tools will be  reviewed with the perspective and vision of giving  to our staff more flexibility as to when and how they  work, building an even more inclusive workplace,  and providing a sustainable work environment and  solutions. The cornerstone of this transformation,  in line with the provisions of CSA article 3(4), is its  human capabilities; thus ENISA shall re-adjust its HR  processes, included within the Strategic Workforce  Planning framework, to be more competency driven.    To do so, ENISA has embarked on a revision of its  competency framework by defining competencies,  technical and behavioural, as well as those next- generation competencies that would enable ENISA to  meet its future challenges. This would enable ENISA  to make staff development a key area of professional  growth, as well as empowering the Agency to adopt  frameworks for enhancing career development  opportunities. All HR processes will be reviewed  and adjusted to reflect modern, competency driven  practices and the best practices in the market, with  the aim of attracting, retaining and developing highly  skilled staff.    Table 1b. Monitoring the workforce under operational and support units.  Operational units Supporting offices and services  Established  staff  (TAs & CAs) Average  Established  staff  (TAs & CAs) Average  Allocated posts as of 01.01.2021  48  12  38  19   Allocation as of 01.10. 2021  67  16.75  40  20   Allocated posts as of  01.08.2022  71  17.75  35.5  17.75   Current staff in house at 01.08.2022 60  15  32.5  16.25   3030  In 2022, ENISA has already taken steps to shift from  a traditional headcount methodology to strategic  workforce planning. This will enable a forward  looking, proactive, flexible and integrated approach in  anticipating and addressing staffing gaps in order to  build an agile workforce and allocate resources where  priorities lie. To do so, ENISA is revamping its decision  to carry out a strategic review of its workforce with  the aim of consolidating ‘hard’ workforce data with  ‘soft’ competency aspects, in order to adopt a new  staffing strategy aligned with organisational priorities.    While continuing to monitor staff allocation between  operational and administrative units to ensure that  the thresholds of MB decision MB/2020/9 are met,  ENISA will aim to identify the level of its in-house  resources in terms of numbers of staff and their skills  and competences, review its job evaluation and job  framework, and generally redesign its staffing policy  while determining future workforce needs not only  based on workload indicators and workforce plans  but also investments in competency and shortages to  address gaps in skills. This is of particular importance,  considering the rapidly changing and competitive  ‘niche’ market of cybersecurity, in order to maintain  ENISA’s added value in the EU cyber eco-system.   Besides that, in order to ‘build an agile workforce’,  traditional ways of working will continue to be  adjusted and the Agency will continue operating  in its matrix format. The working environment will  need to be reviewed as well so as to accommodate  the flexibility that has arrived as a result of the  new way of working following COVID, including by  enabling staff to telework outside of their place of  assignment. Agility and flexibility were at the core of  ENISA's modus operandi in the last few years and the  Agency shall also support dynamic ways of working  within the next programming period.    Currently ENISA is still waiting for the final adoption  of the NIS2 directive where ENISA is tasked with  additional action areas. While these action areas  are covered by ENISA’s general tasks in accordance  with its mandate, they would be supported by five  supplementary fulltime equivalents (FTEs) (three TAs  and two CAs) with a corresponding budget of around  EUR 610,000 a year. This is an integral part of the  NIS2 and is currently managed as a reserve that the  Agency can draw on following the completion of the  adoption process. It is expected that NIS2 directive  will be adopted in Q4 2022. The indicated posts have  been included in the general workforce planning as  part of the approved human resources under the EU  general budget 2023.   Besides that, a letter of intent between DG CONNECT  and ENISA on the provision of support to Member  States to further mitigate the risks of large-scale  cybersecurity incidents in the short term through  a new 'Emergency Response Fund for Cybersecurity'  was signed in July 2022. This covers the short-term  phase of the pilot with an amount of 15 million euros  provided by DG CONNECT. Here, DG CONNECT  provides ENISA with the necessary financial resources  that will allow the Agency to reinforce its catalogue  of services and enhance the support provided to  Member States; it does not grant any additional posts  for the implementation of activities under this one off  injection. For this initial phase ENISA has capitalised  on its expertise and has implemented an innovative  cross-unit approach to fulfil the purposes of the funds  with which it has been entrusted. These are more  than double its budget for 2022, while this comes  on top of already existing defined priorities by all  entities. While in the short term ENISA demonstrated  the agility and flexibility required to perform, so if  such new tasks become permanent, ENISA should be  entrusted with additional resources.    Altogether, the financial resources required based on  administrative needs and to face upcoming operational  challenges exceed by far the allocated EU financial  envelope. Given the inflationary context, administrative  costs for the buildings as well as staff costs, these  expenses are expected to increase dramatically over  the coming years. This would unfortunately result in  a reduced budget available for operations. Therefore,  ENISA must prioritise and select the most impactful  output and suppress or reduce the scope of certain  projects to meet these budgetary constraints if no  additional resources are allocated to ENISA in the  short and/or medium term. The total shortfall that the  Agency has identified amounts to over 3 million euro.     The human resource requirements forecasted in the  current draft of the SPD are well above those foreseen  by the current establishment plan. While ENISA remains  committed to the continuous improvement of its  administrative and operational efficiency, it will continue  to closely monitor, assess and optimise its structures,  services, processes, activities and resource allocation.  ENISA faces a constant increase in its workload and  while it will still seek for further gains in efficiency across  the organisation, these gains will only compensate for  minor workload increases and temporary absences of  staff. However, the MFF 2021-2027 foresees no increase  in the agency’s establishment plan and thus imposes  further constraints for its human resources. Unless  further resources are allocated, ENISA would need to  prioritise and limit the scope of its services within its  existing tasks as well as within new tasks in order to  fulfil its operational mandate.    ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 3131  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  2.3. RESOURCE PROGRAMMING  FOR THE YEARS 2023–2025   2.3.1. Financial Resources   In order for the Agency to manage its financial and  human resources more efficiently and to be able to  manage its operations extending over a number of  budget years while respecting budget annularity and  reducing the administrative workload, it will further  examine and apply differentiated appropriations in  its overall budget management. As this is a standard  operating procedure of the institutions, the Agency,  in order to manage its upcoming growth and increase  its operational efficiency, will make structural efforts  in this direction.   In 2021 the financial structure of the title 3 budget  was revised to match the activities of the Single  Programming Document in accordance with the  CSA. This budget structure aims to implement  activity based budgeting and cost based reporting  thus allowing ENISA to make budgetary decisions  based on specific activity budgetary drivers and  their importance to the Agency’s activities.    To strengthen budget management, the  Agency established the Budget Management  Committee (BMC) in 2021 to ensure the coherent  planning, implementation and follow-up of  the Agency’s budget. The mandate of the BMC  encompasses the entire lifecycle of the budget,  including assisting in setting the overall framework  and guiding the development, roll-out and  implementation as well as follow-up and analysis of  the budget. The committee gives recommendations  to the Executive Director (ED) on the execution  of the budget including the steps, which should  be taken in order to ensure proper planning and  implementation of the annual budget of the Agency,  and give feedback on the utilisation and budget  implementation of the relevant units and managers.   The introduction of the BMC and activity based  budgeting have allowed enhanced monitoring  of financial planning, leading to a more efficient  execution of the budget. Concretely, a higher  budgetary execution rate and fewer budgetary  transfers were expected as a result of this, as  evidenced in 2021. The budgetary execution rate in  2021 increased to 99.51% of the budget vs 97.35%  in 2020 and there were five internal transfers by ED  decision versus seven in 2020 and ten in 2019.    Based on the lessons learned from 2021 the Agency  has extended this efficiency to title 1 and title 2  by merging the budget lines of these titles in the  proposed 2023 budget structure. By reducing the  number of budget lines from 30 to 11 for title  1 and 2, the Agency will be able to reduce the  number of ED decisions required to transfer funds  between budget lines thus reducing administrative  burden and enhance the quality of the monitoring  and reporting of the budget. The budget lines  consolidated were those budget lines with less  500,000 EUR within the same type or category of  expenditure in title 1 and 2. This would also allow  the agency to apply a more agile and flexible way of  managing its funds and services. The consolidated  budget lines are reflected in the statement of  estimates submitted and adopted alongside the  draft SPD 2023-2025.    In light of the current economic and political  environment and due to the increase in cybersecurity  requirements, the financial resources allocated to ENISA  are insufficient to meet these challenges. An annex will  be included in the draft single programming document  2024-2026 detailing the assessed impact due to a lack of  resources on the Agency’s planned activities.    The total EU contribution to ENISA over the period  from 2023 to 2025, as well as for the full period of the  new multiannual financial framework 2021–2027, is  planned to remain stable, with a slight annual increase  of circa 2% to reflect inflation (see table 2).    In 2023 ENISA’s revenue is composed of 97.2% from  the EU's contribution and 2.8% from the European  Economic Area (EEA) country contribution (Table 1  in Annex III). In absolute terms, the EU and EEA  contribution for 2023 is estimated respectively to  reach EUR 24.5 million and EUR 0.7 million.   The general allocation of funds across titles is  expected to remain stable over the period 2023- 2025. Expenditure in 2023 is expected to amount  to EUR 25.2 million, of which EUR 12.7 million in  Title 1 covers all staff-related costs (50%), EUR 3.5  million in Title 2 covers main items such as building  related expenditure and ICT expenses (14%) and  EUR 9.0 million in Title 3 covers all core operating  expenditure (36%). Total expenditure includes the  reserve budget of EUR 610,000 expected to be  allocated to cover additional staff (3 TAs and 2 CAs)  to manage part of the activities linked to the NIS2  directive to be adopted in Q4 2022.   3232  2.3.2. Human Resources   In its budget proposal for the Single Programming  Document (SPD) 2023-2025, the Agency asks for  an extra four SNE posts (introduced gradually 2+2  over the two years to 2024). The four additional  SNE posts requested would be justified both by  the Agency’s current activity areas, particularly the  operational needs stemming from Article 7 of the CSA  as well as by those extra activities and requirements,  as foreseen especially in the initial phases laid out  in the Commission’s Recommendation on the Joint  Cyber Unit (JCU) of 23 June 2021.    Engaging further with SNEs is a cost-effective solution  of mutual benefit that on the one hand supports  the Agency to fulfil its mandate and on the other  hand adds the most value for Member States as it  strengthens the trust-bound relationship between  Member States and ENISA as well as facilitates  smooth knowledge-sharing and service delivery from  ENISA to the Member States.   The collective knowledge acquired from the  perspective of the Member States through such posts  will be crucial for the success of these tasks. In fact,  by importing unique expertise and knowledge into  the Agency through SNE posts rather than having to  outsource certain tasks or create any dependencies  on other external staff, ENISA is catering for the  increasing activities which require close cooperation  with Member States as part of its mandate. Higher  SNE turnovers will in turn be of direct benefit for all  Member States and offer a rich experience to SNEs  following their posting.   In 2021 the Agency’s request for two additional SNEs  for 2022 did not materialise. The Agency therefore  has taken the decision to reallocate two SNE posts  internally that were earmarked for other operational  units and will transfer them to the Operational  Cooperation Unit in 2022 specifically for tasks related  to Article 7 of the CSA.    This decision to transfer posts from other operational  units will have consequences in terms of those  units’ capacity to carry out their tasks. Therefore,  the Agency will need to seek alternative ways to  compensate for this decision in order to fulfil its  mandate and tasks. Such measures include the re- allocation of further resources from administrative  and corporate areas to the operational units and  specifically to the Operational Cooperation Unit,  inevitably leading to gaps across corporate and  administrative functions of the Agency that will need  to be covered by externalising these tasks to external  service providers. This affect is further compounded  by fewer than required graded posts stemming  from the NIS2 proposal (3 AD posts) which were  authorised by the draft EU general budget for 2022.  While acknowledging the budgetary principles, the  geopolitical location of ENISA acts as a negative driver  in attracting high calibre talents, particularly in such  a niche market. This results in the agency creating  reserve lists with reduced geographical diversity.   The reallocation of posts within ENISA will be done by  following the established strategic workforce planning  framework. Annual strategic workforce reviews  will be conducted during the period from 2023 to  2025 in order to develop and maintain current staff  competencies to fulfil the Agency’s operational needs  and achieve the balance of internal resource allocation  between operational and corporate support units. As  indicated in Table 1b under Section 2.1, the current  allocation of posts between operational and corporate  support units is balanced. ENISA will thus continue its  best efforts to ensure that current in-house staff to be  reported on 31 December 2022 will also be balanced,  keeping the same trend throughout the coming period  from 2023 to 2025. For this, ENISA aims to put an  emphasis on the development of staff competences,  including by gradually rolling out multisource  feedback tools which enable staff members to actively  address their development areas, expertise and skills  in line with the needs of the Agency.   Table 2   2022 2023 2024 2025  Total appropriations for ENISA  (thousand EUR)  24,208   25,183  25,322  25,733   Source:   (*) Draft Union annual budget for the financial year 2023 COM (2022) 400   (**) Fiche no. 68 – MFF 2021-2027 dated 08/06/2020, per cent of EFTA funds as per COM (2022) 400 and an additional  amount of EUR 610,000 has been added subject to the approval of the NIS2 Directive   ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 3333  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  A summary of the expected evolution of human  resources is outlined below, while detailed data is  available in Annex IV.   In order to meet the expected targets ENISA, within its  HR strategy (as part of its overall corporate strategy),  will set targets for the establishment of a reserve list of  sufficient scope and length. Optimum retention target  of <10% departures during the year is being considered  as a KPI for the coming period of 2023 to 2025.    2.4. STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING  GAINS IN EFFICIENCY    ENISA remains committed to the continuous  improvement of its operational and administrative  efficiency. It aims to ensure that it acts in the right way  and exhausts gains in efficiency before reinforcing  areas of work with extra resources. As part of its  upcoming corporate strategy, the Agency aims to  further improve ENISA’s organisational efficiency and  flexibility to meet operational needs. To this end, as  part of its HR strategy, the Agency aims to address  and include an efficiency strategy component, with  specific initiatives and a cross-unit perspective. Such  initiatives should be seen as a holistic package and  cover different pillars such as activity and resources  or service categorisation, capitalisation on shared  services, strategic workforce planning, business and  service optimisation among a few.   Strategic Workforce Planning   In 2022, ENISA took steps to shift from a traditional  headcount methodology to strategic workforce  planning. This will enable a forward looking, proactive,  flexible and integrated approach in anticipating and  addressing gaps in staffing in order to build an agile  workforce and allocate resources where priorities lie.  To do so, ENISA is revamping its decision to review  its strategic workforce, with the aim of consolidating  ‘hard’ workforce data with ‘soft’ competency aspects,  in order to adopt a new staffing strategy aligned with  organisational priorities.    While continuing to monitor staff allocation between  its operational and corporate units to ensure the  thresholds of MB decision MB/2020/9 are met,  ENISA would aim to identify the level of its in-house  resources in terms of numbers of staff and their skills  and competences, review its job evaluation and job  framework, and generally redesign its staffing policy  while determining future workforce needs not only  based on workload indicators and workforce plans  but also investments in competency and shortages  to address the gaps in skills and expertise. This is  of particular importance, considering the rapidly  changing competitive ‘niche’ market of cybersecurity,  in order to maintain ENISA’s added value in the EU  cyber ecosystem.   Table 3   202212 202313 202414 202515  Number of posts in the Establishment Plan  82  82  82  82   Per cent of expected fulfilment of the  establishment plan on 31 December 94% 95% or  higher 95% or higher 95% or higher   94%  95% or  higher  95% or  higher  95% or  higher  Total number of authorised posts (TAs, CAs, SNEs)  and expected (2024 & 2025) 126 128 130 132   126  128 130 132  Per cent of expected fulfilment of the total  authorised posts (TAs, CAs, SNEs) on 31  December 94% 95% 95% 95%   94% 95% 95% 95%  12 Forecast data will be finalised in November 2022 and 3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive; projection on 31.12.2022  depends on successful conclusions of ongoing selection process Q3-Q4 2022. 13  3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive. 14  3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive. 15  3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive.  3434  This strategy will be based on the multi-annual  planning of human resource needs and will be activity  driven. Gains in efficiency through the introduction  of new tools, business process reviews or better  organisation of the workload will be exhausted first  before supplementing an area of work with extra  resources. With the priority given to operational work,  ENISA will ensure that its workforce is flexible and  multi-skilled and can be redeployed swiftly to meet  increasing or changing organisational needs. Emphasis  will be placed on competencies and demonstrated  transferrable skills and competencies that are needed  in order to meet operational priorities. At the same  time, ENISA will invest in the skills and experience of  its current workforce and will endeavour to retain and  develop its solid performers with the right skills and  competencies. To do so, ENISA will introduce modern  HR practices to support the development of talent.     Business process review and service  optimisation   ENISA also intends to assess and analyse the  sustainability of existing processes, to explore  alternative models for providing indirect support  and propose actions to ensure operational efficiency  without compromising the activities of its operational  units. Within the context of its coming strategy, the  overall operating business model of the support units  would continue to be reviewed in order to ensure that  the MB 2020/09 thresholds and requirements are met.   Digitalisation of services, self-service functionalities  and service optimisation will also be the core of the  future way of working and ENISA's corporate strategy  to build an agile workforce. ENISA will continue to  review and explore possibilities to reengineer its  processes, with a view to optimising service quality  and cost-effectiveness, for instance by:    exploring and piloting changes in service levels  and modalities, to improve added-value and  cost-efficiency, such as shifting from owned to  leased solutions, from manual entries to centrally  managed solutions;   identifying activities and services that may be  downsized and discontinued if needed;    continuously streamlining and automating  administrative workflows to improve staff  productivity, by removing redundant steps and  capitalising on new technologies such as making  use of DIGIT services and tools,    reviewing ICT infrastructure and related  technologies to reduce duplication of components  and optimise maintenance and capital  replacements such as for storage or move towards  cloud-based solutions.   Capitalising on shared services    In line with the call for agencies to promote the use of  shared services, ENISA will continue to seek efficiency  gains through initiatives such as:   sharing services with other agencies and/or the  Commission, including e.g. interagency and inter- institutional procurements, common services  with CEDEFOP and the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre (ECCC) and the use of the  Commission's ICT solutions such as those for  human and financial resources management;    contributing to further promoting shared services  among agencies through different networks,  particularly in the areas of procurement, HR, ICT  and risk and performance management, data  protection, information security, accounting etc;   contributing to the improvement and piloting of IT  services with DG HR, DIGIT and Frontex in the area  of HR and financial management.   ENISA has already started its journey towards gains  in efficiency and intends in the forthcoming period to  connect the separate actions under a corporate plan  in order to meet the challenges of the future.    The Agency continues to implement its work  programme by systematic use of its statutory bodies  (NLO Network, ENISA Advisory Group), as well as other  statutory groups. ENISA is involved in the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG as set out  in the CSA Art. 22, NISD Cooperation Group and  its work-streams, expert groups created under the  Union law) and its own ad hoc expert groups, where  appropriate, to avoid duplication of effort, build  synergies and peer-review the scope and direction of  actions undertaken to implement outputs as well as  validate the results. In this way the Agency will fulfil  its obligation as outlined in Article 3(3) of the CSA to  avoid duplication of the activities of Member States  and taking into consideration the existing expertise  of Member States. Hence, all activities enlisted under  section 3.1. and 3.2. in this SPD contain an indication  of how specific deliverables and other actions  undertaken to fulfil the outputs will be validated and  peer-reviewed or consulted in accordance with the  legal framework in the area of certification.   ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 3535  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  Since 2021, the framework for structured cooperation  with CERT-EU has been formalised with the drafting  of an annual cooperation plan to utilise synergies and  avoid duplication of activities in executing its task in  the field of operational cooperation (Art 7 of the CSA).  The Agency’s local office in Brussels (established in  2021) should further enable the Agency to further  create synergies with other EU Institutions, agencies  and bodies within and beyond these activities. The  Agency is also pursuing cooperation with relevant  Union bodies and will begin to create synergies with  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre and  Network so as to fulfil its tasks in the field of research  and innovation (Article 11 of the CSA) as well as in  administration, namely, accounting, data protection  and information security.    In its corporate functions, ENISA further seeks to  rationalise its internal processes to improve its  overall efficiency and to benchmark its activities  with the best practices implemented by other EU  institutions and agencies. The Agency is continuing  and further expanding the sharing of services among  other EU agencies. A number of collaborations and  agreements are currently in place with the European  Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and in  2021 the Agency signed a cooperation plan with  the European Union Agency for the Operational  Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of  Freedom, Security and Justice (EU-LISA). In addition  ENISA and the European Centre for the Development  of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) are strengthening  their cooperation to streamline procurement to  share financial services, increase gains in efficiency in  human resources, explore IT solutions together and to  support each other in the area of data protection. The  aim is to share knowledge and use human resources  between the two agencies in the most efficient  manner to deliver better value for EU citizens.   Most of ENISA's administrative tasks are supported  by EU Tools such as accruals-based accounting  (ABAC), Sysper for human resource management  and for missions and document approvals and  registry. In 2022, preparatory work to migrate to the  Advanced Record System (ARES) was initiated and  ENISA is engaged in preparatory work to use both the  Missions Integrated Processing System (MIPS) and  procurement management processes (PPMT) in the  course of 2023.    In 2022 the Agency embarked on supporting the EU  Agencies network in relation to the implementation  of cybersecurity requirements proposed in the draft  regulation on common binding rules on cybersecurity  for EUIBAs, namely though a concept of shared  services on the management of cybersecurity risk  (virtual CISO concept)   36  III  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 37  This is the main body of the Work Programme  describing, in terms of its operational and corporate  activities, what the Agency aims to deliver in the year  2023 towards achieving its strategy and the expected  results. Ten operational activities and two corporate  activities in total have been identified to support the  implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2023.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in chapter two of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  STAKEHOLDERS AND ENGAGEMENT LEVEL  The management of stakeholders is instrumental  to the proper functioning and implementation of  ENISA’ work programme. On 29 March 2022 the  Management Team adopted ENISA’s Stakeholders  Strategy. This Strategy lays down the main principles  and approach to the engagement of stakeholders  at the Agency-wide level. The implementation  of the Stakeholders Strategy is linked with the  implementation of the Single Programming  Document (SPD) through its activities.  Each activity includes a list of stakeholders and the  expected or planned level of engagement for each  stakeholder. The level of engagement refers to the  degree of the their interest and influence in the  activity for stakeholders who are classified as either  partners or involve/engage. Stakeholders classified  as 'Partners' refers to those with high influence and  high interest, usually business owners and others  with significant decision-making authority. They  are typically easy to identify and to engage with  actively. Stakeholders classified as involve/engage  have high influence but lower interest. These are  typically stakeholders with significant decision-making  authority but lacking in availability or the interest to  be actively engaged.  KPIS AND METRICS  In 2020 the Agency developed and introduced  a new set of key performance indicators and  related metrics for measuring the performance of  the activities. These metrics are inscribed in the  Single Programming Document for each activity and  are made up of both quantitative and qualitative  metrics. Quantitative metrics are those that measure  a specific number through a certain formulae.  Qualitative metrics are those that are more of  a subjective opinion based on information received;  however even these are quantified in order to be  interpreted and measured.  The KPIs for activities and associated metrics are  expected to transition in due time with metrics  stemming from the development of the cybersecurity  index, that is currently being piloted. The initial  introduction of the cybersecurity index metrics  to the KPIs for activities are expected in the 2024  work programme. In addition the Agency will take  measures to better explain and align the metrics with  EU policies and by extension the strategic objectives,  activity objectives and individual output objectives.  SECTION III  WORK PROGRAMME 2023  38  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and legislative initiatives on matters related to cybersecurity and on the basis of the 2020  EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into consideration  (including encryption).  The activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel or emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. ENISA will support the EC and MSs on new  policy initiatives16 through evidence-based inputs into the process of policy development. ENISA, in coordination  with the EC and Member States will also conduct policy scouting to support them in identifying potential areas  for policy development based on technological, societal and economic trends as well as in developing monitoring  capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to provide advice on the effectiveness of existing  Union policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in the area.  This activity also contributes to the service package INDEX by providing data used in the cybersecurity index  (Activity 8), by providing input that can be used for future certification schemes (CERTI service package ) and by  providing findings and recommendations for the service packages offered to critical NIS sectors (Activity 2).  The added value of this activity is to support decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at the  technological, societal and economic market levels which might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see  also Activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, the activity will  provide an up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and  sectors, but also by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this  activity is Article 5 of the CSA.  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policy (existing and new)  •  Ensure that EU policy makers are regularly informed about the effectiveness of the existing frameworks, and  EU policy makers and stakeholders are provided with timely and tailor-made policy recommendations on  future cybersecurity challenges and opportunities  16 Policy initiatives such as the forthcoming Cyber Resilience Act and initiatives on Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum computing,  blockchain, big data, data spaces, digital resilience and response to current and future crises  Objectives  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 39  SECTION III. Work Programme 2023  Stakeholders and levels of engagement18  17 in accordance with Art 20(4) of CSA 18 Stakeholders and levels of engagement stem from the implementation of the ENISA stakeholder strategy  Outputs  1.1.  Assist and advise the EC and Member States  in reviewing the effectiveness of current  cybersecurity policy frameworks  1.2  Assist and advise the EC and MS on new  policy developments, as well as carrying out  preparatory work  1.3  Support policy monitoring of existing  and emerging policy areas and maintain  a catalogue of all relevant cybersecurity  legislations and policies at the EU level  Partners  DG Connect, NIS Cooperation Group, National  Competent Authorities, other formally established  groups, European Commission Directorate  General’s Office and Agencies – depending on  policy area (e.g. DG GROW, European Insurance  and Occupational Pensions Authority)  Involve / Engage  ENISA National Liaison Officers, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and  industry associations or representatives.

Actions  include establishing synergies with and between the various national cybersecurity communities (including the  civilian, law enforcement, cyber diplomacy and cyber defence) and EU actors notably CERT-EU with a view to  exchanging know-how, best practices, providing advice and issuing guidance.  In addition, inline with NIS2 requirements ENISA will continue to support Member States in the CSIRTs Network  in respect of operational cooperation. Moreover with the formal establishement of the EU CyCLONe (Cyber Crisis  Liason Organization Network) in NISD2, ENISA will support tthe coordination of cyber crises by advising and  assisting both networks.  Under this activity ENISA is supporting operational communities through helping to develop and maintain  secure and highly available networks and IT platforms and communication channels to ensure, in particular, the  maintenance, deployment and uptake of the MeliCERTes platform32. Furthemore, in view of the implementation  of the NIS2 Directive, this activity supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure by designated CSIRTs in the  CSIRTs Network and the implementation of a European vulnerability database.  In view of the EC Recommendation 4520 (2021) and Council Conclusions of the 20 October 2021 (ST 13048 2021)  on ‘exploring the potential of the Joint Cyber Unit initiative – complementing the EU Coordinated Response to  Large-Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises’, ENISA will engage in exploring the potential of the JCU, along the  lines and the roles defined according to ongoing discussions amongst MSs and relevant EU institutions, bodies  and agencies. In addition, this activity implements the ENISA Cybersecurity Support Action33.  This activity underpins the Situational Awareness service package and contributes to INDEX and NIS service packages.  The legal basis for this activity is Article 7 of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Enhance and improve incident response capabilities across the Union  •  Enable effective European cybersecurity crisis management by continuously improving the cyber crisis  management framework  •  Ensure coordination in cybersecurity crisis management among relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies  (e.g. CERT-EU, European External Action Service (EEAS), European Union Agency for Law Enforcement  Cooperation (EUROPOL)  •  Improve maturity and capacities of operational communities (CSIRTs Network, EU CyCLONe)  •  Contribute to preparedness, shared situational awareness and coordinated response and recovery  to large-scale cyber incidents and crises across different communities (e.g. by providing Ex-ante services)  32 This is especially relevant for the year 2023 and onwards because the support contract procured by the Commission finishes  by the end of 2022. 33 the Agency will prepare where possible for the future Emergency Response Fund, providing that ENISA will be asked to support  it and without pre-empting the outcome of the legislative process.

ACTIVITY 11: Performance and risk  management  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to achieve the requirements set out in Art 4(1) of the CSA that sets an objective for the Agency  to: 'be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of  the advice and assistance it delivers, the information it provides, the transparency of its operating procedures,  the methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out its tasks'. This objective requires an efficient  performance and risk management framework, and the development of single administrative practices. It also  includes building an internal capacity for contribution, e.g. via shared services, to the EU Agencies network and in  key areas of the Agency’s expertise (e.g. cybersecurity risk management).  Under this activity ENISA will confinue to enhance the key objectives of the renewed organisation, as described  in the MB decision No MB/2020/5, including the need to address the gaps in the Agency’s quality assessment  framework, enhance proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks. In terms of resource  management the budget management committee ensures the Agency adheres to sound financial management.  The legal basis for this activity is Art 4(1) and Art 32 of the CSA, the latter of which focuses strongly on sound  financial management principles with a view to maximising value to stakeholders.  Objectives  •  Increased effectiveness and efficiency in achieving Agency objectives  •  Compliant with legal and financial frameworks in the performance of the Agency (build a culture of compliance)  •  Protect the Agency’s assets and reputation, while reducing risks  •  Full climate neutrality of all operations by 2030  Results  •  Maximise quality and value provided to  stakeholders and citizens  •  Building lasting credibility and trust  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Sound resource and risk management  72  Stakeholders and levels of engagement  Outputs  11.1  Maintain the framework for performance  management including through single  administrative practices across the Agency  11.2  Develop and implement annual  communications strategy  11.3  Develop and implement risk management  plans including cybersecurity risk assessment  for IT systems, including focus on quality  management framework and business  processes as well as relevant policies  11.4  Maintain and monitor the implementation  of Agency wide processes for  IT management and develop processes  for budgetary management  11.5  Manage and provide secretariats for statutory  bodies (EB, MB, NLO and AG)  11.6  Obtain and maintain the EU Eco-Management  and Audit Scheme (EMAS) certificate through  continuous overview of the impact of CO2  on all operations of the Agency in line with  the applicable legal framework and publish  a statement on the environment  Partners  Members of statutory bodies such  as Management Board, Advisory Group  and National Liaison Officers  Involve / Engage  All ENISA stakeholders  Validation  •  Management Team  •  Chairs of statutory bodies (Output 10.5)  •  Budget Management Committee  •  IT Management Committee  •  Intellectual Property Rights Management  Committee  •  Staff Committee  •  ENISA Ethics Committee  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 73  SECTION III. Work Programme 2023  Key performance indicators  Organisational performance culture Trust in ENISA brand  Unit of  measurement  Frequency Data  source  Results  2021  Target  2023  11.1.

The actions which will be pursued under this activity will focus on making sure that the Agency’s HR resources fit  the needs and objectives of ENISA, by attracting, retaining and developing talent and building ENISA’s reputation  as an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can evolve personally and professionaly, where staff  are kept engaged, motivated and have a sense of belonging. Emphasis will be placed on the development of  competency and ways to make ENISA an ‘employer of choice’ in order to support ENISA’s objectives This activity  will seek to build an attractive workspace by establishing an effective framework enabling teleworking outside the  place of assignment, developing and maintaining excellent working conditions (premises, layout of office space)  and implementing modern user-centric IT and teleconferencing tools delivering state-of-the-art corporate services  and supporting ENISA's business owners and stakeholders in line with the Agency’s objectives.  ENISA will strive to maximise the efficiency of its resources by maintaining its focus on developing a flexible,  highly-skilled and fit-for-purpose workforce through strategic workforce planning in order to ensure the effective  functioning of the Agency and to maintain high quality services in the administrative and operational areas.  ENISA will further improve the support given to it in strategic planning and resource management, leading to  a constant optimisation of resources under short- and long-range time-frames. This will enable ENISA to enhance  its capabilities in future-readiness and continue its path towards an agile, knowledge-based and matrix way of  working. The Agency will continue to look into flexible (50/50) working arrangements to better balance work  requirements in a pragmatic manner.  In parallel, ENISA will continue to enhance its secure operational environment to the highest level, and strive  for excellence in its infrastructure services based on best practices and frameworks. It will also explore cloud- enabled services that are fit for purpose and provide services in accordance with recognised standards. Besides  that, ENISA will strive to promote and foster eco-system solutions, explore opportunities for shared services  with other EU agencies, leverage standard technologies where possible and support flexible ways of working.  As ENISA aspires to become a trusted partner it will continue to provide customer-focused multi-disciplinary  teams that demonstrate a customer centric, can-do and agile attitude.

The allocation was done  by following the direct budget and FTEs as indicated  for each activity with indirect budgets being assigned  in accordance with causal relationships.  The following assumptions are used in the simplified  ABB methodology  The budget allocation of each activity includes  the direct and indirect budget attributed to  each activity.  Direct budget is the cost estimate of each of  the 10 operational activities as indicated under  Section 3.1 of the SPD 2023-2025 (carried out  under Articles 5-12) in terms of goods and services  to be procured.  Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries  and allowances, buildings, IT, equipment and  miscellaneous operating costs, attributable to  each activity. The indirect budget is allocated  to activities based on various drivers. The main  driver for the allocation of costs was the number  of foreseen direct FTEs for each operational  activity in 2023.  In order to estimate the full costs of operational  activities, both corporate activities (Act 11-12)  shall be distributed accordingly to all operational  activities based on the respective drivers.

Another reason  that may be cited is the need for stability during the start up phase of the Agency as staff from the hosting member state (Greece) is less  prone to resign (resulting in reduced turnover) which, in combination with the relatively young age of the Agency compared to others, still  has its original impact, the relatively better academic profile of Greek candidates for lower level posts; the relatively smaller payroll cost  for staff that is relatively better qualified than the average and costing less if expatriation allowance is considered, as well as the general  predisposition to accept a lower level position to remain in the home country.  Most represented nationality 2016 31.12.2022  Number % Number %  Greek 27 (out of 68) 39.7 38 (out of 96) 39.6  Looking back to 2021, it has been noted that positive measures to improve the diversity of nationalities, which  took in 2020 and 2021, have borne fruit. This can be attributed to the continuation of broad outreach campaigns  on popular media across the European Union, closer consideration of the spread of nationalities in relation to  the competencies requested, and specific provisions in the vacancy notices9.

ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 103  ANNEX Evaluations  ANNEX 9  EVALUATIONS  Ex-ante and ex-poste evaluations were issued in 2021 and there is a need for an  evaluation to be reconsidered during 2023  104  ANNEX 10  STRATEGY FOR  ORGANISATIONAL  MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  As adopted by the Management Board10, the Agency’s strategy for effective internal  control is based on international practices (COSO Framework’s international Standards),  as well the relevant internal control framework of the European Commission.  The Control Environment is the set of standards governing conduct, processes and  structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal controls across ENISA. The  Management Team sets the tone at the top with respect to the importance of internal  control, including expected standards of conduct.  Risk assessment is the Agency’s dynamic and iterative process for identifying and  assessing risks which could affect the achievement of objectives, and for determining  how such risks should be managed.  Control activities ensure the mitigation of risks related to the achievement of policy,  operational and internal control objectives. They are performed at all levels of the  organisation, at various stages of business processes and across the technology  environment. They may be preventive or detective and encompass a range of manual  and automated activities as well as segregation of duties.  Information is necessary for the Agency to carry out internal control and to support  the achievement of its objectives. In this respect it is necessary to consider external  and internal communication. External communication provides the specific Agency  stakeholders and, globally, EU citizens with information on ENISA’s policies, objectives,  actions and achievements. Internal communication provides ENISA staff with the  information required to support the achievement of objectives and the awareness for  day-to-day controls.  Continuous and specific assessments are used to ascertain whether each of the five  components of internal control is present and functioning. Continuous assessments, built  into business processes at different levels of the organisation, provide timely information  on any deficiencies. Findings are assessed and deficiencies are communicated and  corrected in a timely manner, with serious matters reported as appropriate.  10  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management- board-decisions/MB%20Decision%202019-12%20on%20internal%20controls%20framework.pdf  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 105  ANNEX Strategy for organisational management and internal control systems  The Common Approach on EU Decentralised Agencies foresees that EU agencies should  be more active concerning fraud prevention and that the related communication forms  an essential part of its success. In 2021 ENISA adopted an anti-fraud strategy 11 as  recommended by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).  Following relevant guidance and best practices developed within the EU Agencies  network, in 2022 ENISA initiated a thorough review of its internal control framework  and overall strategy. The review aims to consolidate input from different sources  and integrate the results of various risk assessments within a single internal control  assessment process. The revised ENISA’s internal control framework will be put in place  in 2023, together with a comprehensive methodology for the assessment of enterprise  risk across the Agency,  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management- board-decisions/mb-decision-2021-5-on-anti-fraud-strategy.  106  ANNEX 11  PLAN FOR GRANT,  CONTRIBUTION  OR SERVICE-LEVEL  AGREEMENTS  ENISA does not receive any form of grant, contributions or service level agreements that  generate additional revenue.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 107  ANNEX Strategy for cooperation with third countries and/or international organisations  ANNEX 12  STRATEGY FOR  COOPERATION WITH  THIRD COUNTRIES  AND/OR INTERNATIONAL  ORGANISATIONS  The international strategy foresees a continuation of the strong focus on the EU and EU  actors, while also allowing increased flexibility to engage with international partners in  line with the strategic objectives outlined in the ENISA Strategy for a Trusted and Cyber  Secure Europe of July 2020. The Agency’s international strategy 12 was adopted by the  MB during its November 2021 meeting and the actions for international strategy are  addressed under output 9.3 in activity 9.  12  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-international-strategy.  108  ANNEX 13  ANNUAL COOPERATION  PLAN 2023  This document is the provisional draft of 2023 Annual  Cooperation Plan (ACP2023) between ENISA, the EU  Agency for Cybersecurity, and CERT-EU, the CERT of  the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as foreseen  in the co-signed Memorandum of Understanding.  The ACP is expected to be endorsed by the CERT EU  steering board during the course of 2023 Q1.  The plan aims to cover the cooperation activities  planned for 2023.  The plan proposed in this document includes  references to the activities included in the ENISA Work  Program 2023 which is submitted to the Management  Board for approval (MB).  Similarly, and in continuation of ACP2022, the proposed  plan identifies actions on the following areas:  1.  Capacity building as referred to in Articles 6.c and  6.i of the Cyber Security Act (CSA)  2.  Operational cooperation as referred to in Article 7  of the CSA  3.  The area of long-term strategic analyses of cyber  threats as foreseen in Article 9.b of the CSA.  13 As referred to in Articles 6.c and 6.i of the CSA. 14 https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=60922 15 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 (Blueprint).  CAPACITY BUILDING  Capacity building13 covers assistance to relevant  public bodies to improve capabilities to respond to  cyber threats and incidents, including the provision of  cybersecurity trainings and exercises.  Focus points of capacity building for the structured  cooperation plan for 2023 remain Maturity, Training  and Exercises. In particular, and following the  findings from the European Court of Auditors in the  Special Report 05/202214, ENISA and CERT-EU plan to  increase cooperation on training and exercise with  the aim to increase the level of preparedness and  response of EUIBAs.  Maturity  Maturity assessments are useful means to identify  current abilities and also existing gaps that require  reinforcement of an organisation’s capabilities and  guide its efforts to improve its overall cybersecurity  posture by achieving higher maturity levels over time.  In 2022, drawing on ENISA, CERT-EU’s and other  CSIRTs Network and EUIBA stakeholders' experience  and expertise, ENISA has performed maturity- related development targeting the EUIBAs actors  of the Blueprint15 to assess their EU-level crisis  management capabilities. This work resulted in  a new maturity framework to perform a maturity  assessment for EUIBAs.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 109  ANNEX Annual Cooperation Plan 2023  In 2023, following the European Commission’s  proposal for Regulation on measures for a common  high level of cybersecurity it is expected for EUIBAs  to start its adoption. This will initiate a CERT-EU led  project in which a maturity assessment methodology  will be developed for the EUIBAs.  The plan for 2023 will focus on continuing existing  initiatives, in particular:    EUIBAs Cyber Hygiene: CERT-EU will  carry on the activities of finalising the  proposal for a cybersecurity Regulation16,  in close cooperation with the European  Commission’s DIGIT.S directorate, and develop  a cybersecurity maturity assessment methodology  for all EUIBAs.    CSIRTs Maturity: ENISA will promote the new  maturity framework among EUIBAs to implement  ENISA Maturity Framework for their EU cyber crisis  management capabilities. ENISA will foster the  application of the maturity framework to relevant  subjects to help identify current abilities and gaps.  CERT-EU and ENISA will maintain close contacts  throughout the process to ensure their maturity- related activities feed each other in the most efficient  way, avoiding duplication and misalignment.  Training & Exercises  CERT-EU and ENISA have been successfully  cooperating on training and exercises for many  years. In particular, 2022 saw the execution of  ENISA’s flagship exercise, Cyber Europe 2022, where  CERT-EU and ENISA cooperated on its setup and  exercise roll-out.  16 The proposal has been finalised and the European Commission published it on 22 March 2022. See https://ec.europa.eu/ commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1866 for more information.  This close cooperation will continue in 2023 by  combining CERT-EU’s and ENISA’s strengths to lay the  basis for developing a relevant, cost-efficient training  portfolio that supports cybersecurity capacity building  but also operational cooperation. The ambition of  the cooperation is for ENISA to be able to provide  state-of-the-art training portfolio that will be offered  both to MSs and EUIBAs and to keep it up to date and  relevant through its close collaboration with CERT-EU  and its other key stakeholders.  Working methods already established in 2022 will  continue throughout 2023 (e.g. CERT-EU collaborating  with ENISA in the CSIRTs Network Working Group on  Trainings and other similar fora).  The focus of 2023 will be to keep sustaining yearly  ongoing activities (i.e. cyber exercise regularly  organised by ENISA or in collaboration with ENISA)  as well as finalising activities started in 2022. In the  context of providing a common strong portfolio  to a wider target audience, ENISA will work with  CERT-EU in order to provide access to a self-paced  online learning platform that provides a variety  of high-quality training tracks adapted to specific  target audiences.  In particular:    Custom Technical Courses: building on the  activity in 2022, ENISA will work with CERT-EU  and the CSIRTs Network Training WG to enhance  training programs based on audience knowledge  level (e.g. elementary vs. advanced).    Self-paced online learning platform: based on  the experience gained via pilots, ENISA will offer  the platform also to EUBIAs and will leverage  the special relationship CERT-EU has with their  Objective Task Deliverable Lead Work  Program 2023  1.

Furthermore the option to  have custom trainings developed on demand will  be explored.    Technical, Specialised Workshops for CERT- EU constituents: CERT-EU will further develop  technical, specialised workshops, leveraging,  where relevant, the experience and working  practice of ENISA.    Regular ENISA Cyber Security Exercises:  this is an ongoing activity led by ENISA, which  materialises in several types of exercises involving  different stakeholders. Through the structured  cooperation, CERT-EU will be involved not only  as participant in relevant exercises but also as  a valuable planner for selected exercises (e.g.  Cyber Europe). In this context CERT-EU’s familiarity  with the EU Agencies and their expertise with  actual and relevant threats is very valuable.    Joint Cyber Security Exercise: When relevant  and in reference to the structured operational  cooperation, both parties will join efforts to  participate in exercises under the capacity of  planners and training audience. In addition,  common operational activities, e.g. Joint Rapid  Reports, will be evaluated through these  occasions.  ENISA will be collaborating closely  with CERT-EU in order to find the most relevant  17 EU-JCAR implements a legal obligation under Article 7(6) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) and it has been drafted by  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions and bodies (CERT-EU)  and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) with contribution from European Commission DG CONNECT Cyber Coordination Task Force  as well as of the European External Action Service.  topics for these exercises (based on real threats  and attacks observed by CERT-EU), using the long  experience on running complex exercises with  various stakeholders at the highest standards.  In 2023 the lessons learned from the pilot  execution in 2022 will be applied and this will  result in an improved experience.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  Cyber Crisis Management Coordination  and Common Situational Awareness  2022 has been a special year for Operational  Cooperation pillars within the ENISA and CERT-EU  Structured Cooperation (SC). Building on the SC, the  two organisations teamed up to provide a continuous  situational picture of cyber threats, related to the UA- RU conflict. In order to respond more effectively and  share a common situation picture, ENISA and CERT- EU take part in a special task force (Interinstitutional  Task Force) organised by the European Commission  and European External Action Service.  In addition,2022 saw the launch of the Joint  Cyber Assessment Report (EU JCAR)17 as well the  establishment of the Joint Rapid Report (JRR) services.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 111  As part of the efforts of further development of  the procedures for EU and EUIBAs Cyber Crisis  Management coordination, ENISA and CERT-EU  will further align actions on developing Standard  Operating Procedures (SOP) with particular focus on  procedures to be adopted within the Interinstitutional  Task Force and further build-on and improving  Common Situational Awareness.  The target for 2023 is to further expand on the  cooperation activities started with the ACP2022.  In particular    EUIBAs SOP for the Cyber Crisis Management  stakeholders: ENISA and CERT-EU will focus  on finalising the EUIBAs SOP document and  seek adoption within the Inter-institutional  Task Force. EUIBAs SOP to be tested through  exercise and in synergies with EU Cyber Crisis  Management exercises.    Security Incident Response – Continuous  Improvement: CERT-EU will leverage the  aforementioned work in SOPs, lessons learnt in  significant incidents and the proceedings on the  information exchange domain with ENISA and the  other Blueprint stakeholders to review and update  its Technical SOPs – Security Incident Response  (SIR) process.  18  Cyber security events or incidents significantly affecting or potentially significantly affecting EU Member States, critical sectors within  the meaning of the NISD or ICT technologies, services, platforms or ICT infrastructures widely applied and used across the internal market. 19 Delivery of services is expected in December 2022.    Common situational awareness: With the 2022  activities both organisations have worked towards  the establishment of a mechanism for information  exchange at EU level, as well set the stage for  joint reports to raise awareness on significant  cyber security events18. Within the 2023 activity  ENISA and CERT-EU will further operationalize  the mechanism, seeking additional opportunity  for joint reports and assessments, as well using  exercises to enhance the production of situational  awareness deliverables.  The Joint Rapid Report (JRR) service will be continue  and further improved. EU-JCAR service is planned to  be operational in 2023.  MUTUAL ASSISTANCE  As stated in Article 7 of the Cybersecurity act, ENISA  shall assist, at the request of one or more Member  States, in assessing incidents having a significant or  substantial impact within the meaning of Directive  (EU) 2016/1148 through the provision of expertise,  in facilitating the technical handling of such incidents  and in providing support in relation to ex-post  technical inquiries regarding such incidents.

The 2023 proposed plan aligns and build-on the work  done in 2022, and focuses on further enhancing  and operationalizing the cyber security assistance  mechanism. In particular:    Cyber Security Assistance Mechanism: ENISA  will build-on the mechanism to deliver on the  Cyber Security Support Action program. Due to  this, the focus on the assistance mechanism will  be primarily set on expanding it and pilot the use  of EU and EUIBAs resources as service fulfilment.    Operational capability to assist EUIBAs:  CERT-EU will continue managing the pool  of EUIBA experts and further enhance its  operational capability.  KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION  SHARING  Knowledge and information are a horizontal activity  that nurtures and sustains the previous two pillars as  well as getting input from these.  20 Letter of intent between DG CONNECT and ENISA on the provision of support to Member States to further mitigate the risks of large  scale cybersecurity incidents in the short term - Ares(2022)5946722 21 Cybersecurity Support Action program. 22  ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges and ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group  on Cyber Threat Landscapes.  As outlined in Article 9.b of the CSA, ENISA performs  long-term strategic analyses of cyber threats and  incidents in order to identify emerging trends and  help prevent incidents. One of the activities in this  field is the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) which  provides an overview of threats, together with current  and emerging trends. It is based on publicly available  or voluntarily shared information data and provides  an independent view on observed threats, threat  agents and threat trends. CERT-EU is an important  and structural contributor to the ETL and related  activities and will remain so through 2023.  ENISA is leading long-term strategic analyses also  through maintaining and collaborating with a working  group of experts on foresight for emerging and future  cybersecurity challenges and cyber threat landscape22.  In 2023 CERT-EU, through the inclusion as an observer  in these ENISA working groups, will contribute, review  and validate the findings and generally enhance  the outputs created from those groups. Those  activities refer to Activity 8 - Knowledge on emerging  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities of ENISA  Work Program 2023.

Despite the spill-overs  and direct attacks, by-and-large the EU has been able to deal with the cyber threats posed  by the Russian aggression through the resilience of its Member States and across Europe,  as well as forging support and cooperation with Ukraine and other allies and partners.  Within this context, ENISA’s challenge is both to keep pace and set the pace in supporting  the Union in achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. This Single  Programming Document (SPD) for the years 2023-2025 represents another step in  bringing this about.  Firstly, it puts emphasis on strengthening the resilience of Member States and EU  institutions, bodies and agencies. In 2023, approximately half of ENISA’s operational  resources, both budget and human resources, will be dedicated to enhancing operational  cooperation and building capacity. Together with the one-off support of up to 15 million  EUR, which the European Commission allocated to ENISA in Autumn 2022, the Agency  will be able to massively scale up and expand its ex-ante and ex-post services to Member  States in 2023.  Secondly, building on the outcomes of strategic discussions within its Management Board  throughout 2022, the Agency has developed service packages in key areas of its mandate.  They integrate ENISA’s various outputs across different activities, help the agency to  prioritise its actions, build and make use of internal synergies, and ensure that adequate  resources are reserved across the Agency in a transparent manner.  Thirdly, through this work-programme ENISA will endeavour to help Member States to  prepare for the transposition of the reviewed NIS Directive, as well as to prepare the  ground for the roll-out and implementation of the EU cybersecurity certification schemes.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 7  Finally, recognising the growing need to bring together the EU's activities and resources  across the cybersecurity communities, this SPD establishes a new activity in the area  of research and innovation to structure the Agency’s cooperation and collaboration with  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and its emerging networks.  All those areas also accentuate the resource constraints under which the Agency now  operates. The foreseen budget increase for the 2023 work programme has been fully  absorbed by the increase in staff expenditure and inflation. Due to a shortfall of over  3 million EUR, the Agency has had to reduce the scope of some of its operational activities,  limiting the number of exercises and training it rolls-out or postponing its actions in  countering ransomware.  Such reductions mean drawbacks in certain areas and might become a real obstacle if  new tasks should be added to the Agency without a parallel increase in its resources. Thus,  though ENISA welcomes the pioneering set of cybersecurity initiatives being put forward in  2022 and relishes the different and varied roles they imply for the Agency, it needs to have  the right level of human and financial resourcing to match those aims and ambitions.  The EU has been mastering cybersecurity initiatives and structures not least through  a unique general consensus across parties and across Member States as its prime driving  force. This consensus should now also include the resourcing of the Agency. This would give  the Union the ability it needs to steer cybersecurity developments in the years to come.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  8  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cybersecurity policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the  Union’s infrastructure and services and keep our  society and citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be  an agile, environmentally and socially responsible  organisation focused on people.  MISSION STATEMENT  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 9  STRATEGY  CYBERSECURITY POLICY  Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital  transformation and the need for it permeates  all sectors, therefore it needs to be considered  across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives.  Cybersecurity must not be restricted to a specialist  community of technical cybersecurity experts.  Cybersecurity must therefore be embedded across all  domains of EU policies. Avoiding fragmentation and  the need for a coherent approach while taking into  account the specificities of each sector is essential.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  The benefits of the European digital economy and  society can only be fully attained under the premise  of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders.  All layers of society can be impacted and the Union  needs to be ready to respond to massive (large-scale  and cross-border) cyber-attacks and cyber crisis.  Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted  the need for effective cooperation between Member  States and the EU institutions for faster response and  proper coordination of efforts at all levels (strategic,  operational, technical and communications).  CAPACITY BUILDING  The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals,  organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly. The  needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences  exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest in building  competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels,  from the non-expert to the highly skilled professional.  The investments should focus not only on increasing  the cybersecurity skillset in the Member States but  also on making sure that the different operational  communities possess the appropriate capacity to deal  with the cyber threat landscape.  TRUSTED SOLUTION  Digital products and services bring benefits as well  as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of  digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the  goal to strike a balance between societal, market,  economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral  entity acting in a transparent manner will increase  customer trust on digital solutions and the wider  digital environment.  10  FORESIGHT  Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or  close to mainstream adoption, would benefit from  the use of foresight methods. Through a structured  process enabling dialogue among stakeholders,  decision- and policy-makers would be able to define  early mitigation strategies that improve the EU  resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions  to address emerging challenges.  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 11  KNOWLEDGE  The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is  information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives,  to work in a constantly moving environment – in  terms of digital developments as well as with  regard to actors – to face the challenges of our  time, a continuous process of collecting, organising,  summarising, analysing, communicating, and  maintaining cybersecurity information and knowledge  is clearly needed. All phases are essential to ensure  that information and knowledge is shared and  expanded within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem  I  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 13  The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine  dominates today’s EU security agenda and threatens  global stability and security. ENISA has stepped up its  coordination and preparedness and contributed to the  EU’s shared situational awareness by providing regular  situational reports on cyber activity. There has also been  intensified coordination and exchange of information  with cybersecurity networks, such as the Cyber Crises  Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) consisting of  national cybersecurity crisis management authorities,  and numerous sectorial communities supported by  ENISA. In addition, constant efforts have ensured that  channels of communication between the political,  operational and technical levels, as well enhanced  cooperation with the Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRT) Network were realised.  Preparedness in the area of cybersecurity is more  essential than ever, given the increased exposure of  Europe to an accumulation of threats due to the war.  Efforts to step up preparedness included a number  of actions such as exercises, guidance, legislative  measures, increasing resilience in critical sectors and  work with partners. During the French Presidency  of the Council of the European Union, the European  External Action Service (EEAS) and ENISA together  organised a scenario-based exercise in early 2022,  called EU CyCLES (Cyber Crisis Linking Exercise on  Solidarity), with the aim of raising awareness at the  political level and strengthening cooperation between  the operational and political levels should a large- scale cyberattack take place.  ENISA cybersecurity support action  While the implementation of a new 'Emergency  Response Fund for Cybersecurity' is under  assessment and may require further deliberations,  DG CONNECT allocated EUR 15 million to support  Member States in the short term in view of the  immediate and elevated threat of malicious  cyber activities due to the ongoing Russian war  of aggression against Ukraine. The EU needs  to respond to these threats and be prepared  to respond to cyberattacks.  This short-term support aims to complement and  not duplicate efforts by Member States and those at  Union level to increase the level of protection and  resilience to cyber threats, by providing ENISA with  additional means to support preparedness (ex-ante),  and response (ex-post) to large-scale cybersecurity  incidents. As such, regular tasks in the work  programmes under activities 3, 4 and 5 have been  expanded to continue this support well into 2023.  Service catalogue  In 2022 the Agency introduced the concept of  a service catalogue to allow management to focus  efforts and resources in a highly structured and more  efficient manner for attaining specific objectives. The  ENISA service catalogues are organised into individual  service packages. A service package is a collection of  SECTION I  GENERAL CONTEXT  14  cybersecurity products and services that span across  a number of activities and contribute to the objectives  of a discrete service package. A service package is  a means of centralising all services that are important  to the stakeholders that use it.  The agency has identified five discrete service  packages that make up ENISA’s service catalogue:  NIS directive (NIS);  Training and exercises (TREX);  Situational Awareness (SITAW);  Certification (CERTI);  Cybersecurity index (INDEX).  The multi-annual work programme in section 2  outlines in greater detail the activities that lead and  contribute to the service catalogue including the  required resources both in terms of budget and  human resources.  ENISA’s annual Threat Landscape (ETL) for 2022  marks the 10th iteration of this flagship report and  will be published in October 2022. ETL 2022 looked  at threats across the EU and the world in the period  starting July 2021 and finishing in July 2022.  The major highlights include an increase in  threats against availability and the persistence of  ransomware as one of the prime threats, despite  ongoing efforts to tackle it. Threats against availability  increased significantly, targeting the provisioning  of services (telecommunications and energy in  particular) and the major motivation behind relevant  incidents that involve disruption of service.  When it comes to ransomware, a dedicated threat  landscape was published in July 2022 noting the  importance of this threat. Approximately 10 terabytes  of data are stolen each month by ransomware threat  actors and 58.2% of the data stolen includes employees'  personal data. While at least 47 distinct threat actors  who use ransomware were identified, for 94.2% of  incidents we do not know whether the company paid  the ransom or not. It is estimated however that 62.12%  of companies either came to an agreement with the  attackers or found another solution. In most cases the  affected organisations are unaware of how threat actors  managed to gain initial access.  The latter two findings highlight issues in incident  reporting; when it comes to ransomware incidents  only the tip of the iceberg is reported.  In 2022, a notable increase in the activities of state- sponsored and proxy threat actors was observed,  attributed to the volatile geopolitical environment  and the war in Ukraine in particular. It is important to  highlight the inclusion of an analysis of the vulnerability  landscape and the impact and motivation per sector  that were part of the ETL for the first time in 2022.  ENISA continues to constantly monitor the  cybersecurity threat landscape using an open and  transparent methodology that was made available  to the public in June 2022. This initiative aims  to promote transparency in ENISA’s work, build  confidence and support capacity building across MSs.  It is in the context of such challenges that ENISA  is exploring ways to improve the reporting of  incidents. The revised Network and Information  Security Directive (NIS2) is expected to change the  way cybersecurity incidents are notified. The new  provisions will aim to support a better mapping and  understanding of the relevant incidents.  NIS Investments 2022  The 3rd ENISA NIS Investments study is scheduled  for publication in November 2022 and offers  additional insights into the cybersecurity budgets  of Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital  Service Providers (DSP) and how the NIS Directive has  influenced this budget. The annual stock-taking of  this data now allows for historical traceability and the  identification of trends.  A typical OES or DSP in the EU earmarks 6.7% of  its IT investments for information security, while  the average value is 7.2%. When analysing this  normalised data set with historically available data,  a decrease of one percentage point is observed in  comparison to the median IS vs IT spending in 2020.  However, the historical analysis has to be done while  keeping in mind the slight differences in the samples  between the years of study and the differences in  the macro environment, such as the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic in the cost-optimisation practices  of OESs and DSPs.  The survey data also indicates that a typical OES or  DSP in the EU spends EUR 50,000 on cyber threat  intelligence, while the average spend amounts to  EUR 399,000. The disparity between the median and  average values indicates that most organisations do  not earmark vast budgets for CTI, while some (larger)  organisations — specifically within the banking  and energy sectors — do invest significantly in CTI.  Cybersecurity investment strategies of 69% of the  OESs and DSPs in the EU were mostly influenced by  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 15  SECTION I. General context  the threat landscape, closely followed (66%) by their  obligations under the NIS Directive.  LEGISLATIVE MEASURES DESIGNED  TO STRENGTHEN THE RESPONSE  TO THE THREAT LANDSCAPE  The adoption and implementation of policy  frameworks is one key response area where the  EU is making a difference. Indeed, the policies and  initiatives being put in place in the coming years  are determining how the EU faces the cybersecurity  challenges of today and tomorrow. Within this  picture, ENISA will determine and adapt its support in  particular in the following areas.  NIS2 Directive  In May 2022 political agreement was reached  between the European Parliament and EU  Member States on measures for a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2  Directive) proposed by the Commission in  December 2020.  The NIS2 proposal consolidates, reinforces  and extends the existing approach under NIS1,  consolidating cybersecurity provisions from  other legal provisions (EECC/telecoms and eIDAS/ trust) under NIS2, strengthening for example  incident reporting provisions and extending the  scope, including cloud and data centres under  critical services, and adding additional sectors,  such as space (important for securing satellite  communications, a vital infrastructure in remote  rural areas, but also as a fail over in times of  a natural disaster or military conflict).  NIS2 underlines the special role of telecoms as  a highly mature sector, a conduit for cyberattacks  and a possible filter or shield, protecting less  mature and harder to protect sectors such as  healthcare. In addition the ambitions of NIS2 need  to be supported with better incident reporting to  create a better situational picture, with vulnerability  disclosure policies and an EU vulnerability database,  with supply chain security and other coordinated  Union-wide cybersecurity risk assessments, by  expanding the scope in terms of sectors covered,  and by creating the right culture and environment  for essential and important entities to share  cybersecurity relevant information such as cyber  threats, vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise,  tactics, techniques and procedures, cybersecurity  alerts and configuration tools.  The transposition of NIS2 into national laws and the  implementation phase lie ahead. As such ENISA is  developing its service and expertise for this with the  introduction of a service catalogue based on existing  NIS1 expertise that are reflected in this draft single  programming document (SPD).  ENISA is already invested in activities linked to  the development and implementation of the NIS  Directive, with its resilience, cooperation and  capacity-building work, and will be building up its own  capacities to support the outcome of the proposal  in the coming years, using existing resources and  building on these wherever necessary.  Joint Cyber Unit  The EU cybersecurity eco-system does not yet have  a common space to work together across different  communities and fields which allow existing networks  to tap their full potential. The 2020 EU Cybersecurity  Strategy outlined the need for a Joint Cyber Unit (JCU).  The strategy identified the main problems to which  the JCU would contribute solutions, its objectives and  the steps needed to achieve them. It builds on the  work started with the Recommendation (4520 (2021))  for a coordinated response to incidents and crises –  the so called Blueprint - in 2017.  ENISA will contribute to the next steps following the  EC Recommendation (4520 (2021) on 'building the  Joint Cyber Unit') and Council Conclusions (20 October  2021 (ST 13048 2021) on ‘exploring the potential of  the Joint Cyber Unit initiative – complementing the EU  Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Cybersecurity  Incidents and Crises’), with a view to contributing to  the further development of an EU crisis management  framework along the lines and according to the roles  defined in the on-going discussions amongst Member  States and EU operational actors.  Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)  In her State of the Union 2021 address, President von  der Leyen underlined that the EU should strive to  become a leader in cybersecurity, announcing in that  context a new European Cyber Resilience Act. The  act would add in particular to the existing baseline  cybersecurity framework of the NIS Directive (and  upcoming NIS2 framework) and the Cybersecurity Act.  The Act establishes common European cybersecurity  requirements for products with digital elements that  are placed on the internal market by introducing  essential requirements for such products as well as  16  imposing obligations on manufacturers, importers  and distributors. Products with digital elements create  opportunities for EU economies and societies. However,  they also lead to new challenges – when everything is  connected, a cybersecurity incident can affect an entire  system, disrupting economic and social activities.  The CRA aims to address market needs and protect  consumers from insecure products by introducing  common cybersecurity rules for manufacturers,  importers and distributors of tangible and  intangible products with digital elements. The CRA  proposal was published on the 15 September 2022.  The CRA will apply to all products connected directly  or indirectly to another device or network. Open- source software and products and services covered  by other existing rules, such as medical devices,  aviation and cars, are explicitly excluded.  ENISA has provided expert opinion and is working  towards collecting evidence to support an impact  assessment through its Cybersecurity Policy  Observatory (CSPO) and will also provide support in  later stages (post-impact assessment) by contributing  to elements of the legislative proposal such as risk  categorisation and security requirements.  Implementation of the EU cybersecurity  certification framework  ENISA is playing a central role in supporting the  implementation of the European cybersecurity  certification framework by preparing and  maintaining the candidate schemes. In this task  ENISA is supported by area experts and operates in  collaboration with public authorities in the Member  States. It is expected that the draft candidate  cybersecurity certifications schemes proposed by  ENISA will be adopted as Commission implementing  Regulations. The adopted schemes will allow for the  assessment of the conformity of digital products,  services and processes in the Digital Single Market  under those schemes, which can contribute to  increasing the level of customer trust in digital  solutions in the Union.  Currently, ENISA has prepared a candidate scheme  for the EU Common Criteria European candidate  cybersecurity certification scheme (EUCC) which  has been transposed into an EU Implementing Act  by the Commission for its final adoption. In 2022,  the candidate scheme on Cloud Services (EUCS)  will be submitted to the ECCG for its opinion.  Furthermore, an ad hoc working group has started  work preparing a candidate certification scheme  for 5G networks (EU5G), with a first phase to  characterise the possibility of reusing existing  schemes, and to identify related gaps to be  covered by a relevant EU scheme.  Finalising the candidate schemes for specialised product  categories under the EU Common Criteria (EUCC)  scheme and for cloud services is just the first step and  it will likely bring about benefits in terms of recognition  and trust across government services, business and  citizens during the time period 2023-2025.  In relation to the digital identity framework, ENISA  will support and continue the development of  a certification strategy matching the expectations of  Article 6a of the Regulation which requires Member  States to issue a European Digital Identity Wallet  under a notified eID scheme to common technical  standards following compulsory assessment of  compliance and voluntary certification within the  European cybersecurity certification framework, as  established by the Cybersecurity Act. This strategy  shall make the best reuse of existing schemes  under development and shall also identify potential  new certification means for schemes that would  contribute to the certification of a wallet.  ENISA will also support the development of means of  certification that would allow compliance with certain  requirements of Article 18 of the NIS2 directive to be  demonstrated, as the regulatory provisions of Member  States may require entities to use particular ICT  products, services and processes, either developed by  an essential or important entity or procured from third  parties that are certified under European cybersecurity  certification schemes adopted pursuant to Article 49 of  Regulation (EU) 2019/881.  Where applicable, certification means for CRA related  products, such as Protection Profiles, any additional  certification tool or scheme. Such certification  elements supporting the CRA, as well as other  certification elements supporting other legislations  should be consolidated into the first public version  of the Union Rolling Work Programme, that the EC  foresees being published in Q4 2022.  Research & Innovation  The EU is expanding its support and investment in the  wealth of expertise and experience in cybersecurity  research, technological and industrial development  that exists in the EU by prioritising its efforts to  support research and innovation, in particular through  a common agenda implemented by the European  Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) and the  Network of National Coordination Centres (NCC).  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 17  SECTION I. General context  Therefore, a new activity has been included in the  2023 work programme dedicated to research and  innovation under Article 11 of the CSA. This new activity  will consolidate ENISA's processes for identifying  cybersecurity research needs and funding priorities  and ensure that resources are managed efficiently for  delivering stakeholder expectations in this area.  ENISA, with the support from the community, will  continue mapping ongoing activities to identify and  prioritise areas where more research, development  and implementation is needed to improve  Europe's knowledge, resilience and response to  current and emerging cyber threats. These research  and innovation needs and funding priorities will  constitute ENISA's advice and contribution to the  EU's strategic research and innovation agenda.  The European Digital Identity  Framework  Digital identity and trust services are crucial for  the EU digital market, because they allow citizens  and businesses to carry out transactions online in  a safe and trusted way. In 2020 the Commission  reviewed the Electronic Identification and Trust  Services (eIDAS) Regulation and identified factors  hindering the adoption of mechanisms for electronic  identification. In June 2021 the Commission  made a proposal for a revised eIDAS Regulation  establishing a European Digital Identity framework  and a European Digital Wallet, to be available for  all EU citizens, on a voluntary basis and that will  be usable for online transactions with government  entities, but also with businesses.  In the 2023-2025 period, ENISA will support Member  States and the Commission with the development  of the European Digital Identity Framework and the  European Digital Identity Wallets, as set out in proposal  for a revised eIDAS regulation in addition to promoting  the exchange of good practises and capacity building  for relevant stakeholders. The revised eIDAS regulation  also expands the list of qualified trust services with  distributed ledgers and electronic archiving and the  management of remote devices for the creation of  electronic signatures and seals.  The NIS2 proposal for a revised NIS Directive  foresees that the security obligations laid down in  this Directive should be considered complementary  to the requirements imposed on trust service  1 Proposal for a Regulation (EU) 2021/ 206 of 21 April 2021 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence  (artificial intelligence act) and amending certain union legislative acts. 2 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review.  providers under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (eIDAS  Regulation). When this proposal is adopted, ENISA will  support Member States and the Commission with this  transition, to ensure that the trust service providers  and the national authorities can benefit from the  ecosystem of the NIS Directive.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  With the EU’s AI agenda advancing rapidly following  the European Commission's proposal on AI1 and the  Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 20212, the  EU is addressing the major technological, ethical,  legal and socio-economic challenges to put AI at the  service of European citizens and the economy, for  instance by considering linking high-risk AI systems  to mandatory trustworthiness requirements. One  of these challenges is understanding the interplay  between cybersecurity and AI and how this can  affect availability, safety or the resilience of future AI  services and applications.  Building on ENISA’s efforts towards securing AI and  machine learning, the Agency can continue its open  dialogue with EU institutions in support of legislative  initiatives reaching into 2023-2025. For this, ENISA  will systematically monitor existing initiatives from  Member States in this area and continue supporting  the Commission and Member States by providing  guidelines to good security practices.  Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)  In June 2022, the Council presidency and the  European Parliament reached a political agreement  on the regulation of digital operational resilience for  the financial sector. The regulation aims to ensure  that all participants in the financial system are subject  to a common set of standards to mitigate ICT risks for  their operations and have the necessary safeguards  in place to mitigate cyberattacks and other risks.  The proposed legislation will require firms to  ensure that they can withstand all types of ICT- related disruptions and threats. ENISA is actively  supporting the mapping of cyber legislative  initiatives in the finance sector and works closely  with the European Commission and relevant EU  Bodies on the cybersecurity aspects of DORA  including crisis management, incident reporting  and information sharing.  18  Network Code on Cybersecurity  The Network Code on Cybersecurity aims to set sector  specific rules for the cybersecurity of cross-border  electricity flows across EU member states. It includes  rules on cyber risk assessment, common minimum  requirements, cybersecurity certification of products  and services, monitoring, reporting and crisis  management. It is part of the Commission's request  to European Network of Transmission System  Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) pursuant to  Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and ENISA has been actively  involved in defining approaches to risk assessment,  common minimum cybersecurity requirements and  appropriate technical and organisational measures.  The code contains many references to and foresees  new leading and supporting tasks for ENISA amongst  others, facilitation of an Early Warning System,  supporting Agency for the Cooperation of Energy  Regulators (ACER) in monitoring the implementation  of the code and supporting (ENTSO) and the  European Distribution System Operators (DSO) entity  with organising sector specific exercises.  Once-only technical system (OOTS)  Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/17243, the  Commission adopted implementing Regulation  C(2022)5628 which sets out technical and operational  specifications of the technical system for the  cross-border automated exchange of evidence  and application of the 'once-only' principle. ENISA  supports the efforts of the Commission and Member  States on cybersecurity aspects of the deployment  of the system, including risk management and  the identification of appropriate technical and  organisational measures to mitigate identified threats  Chips Act  On 8 February 2022, the European Commission  proposed a comprehensive set of measures for  strengthening the EU’s semiconductor ecosystem,  the European Chips Act4. In this package, the  Commission has adopted a Communication,  3 Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 October 2018 establishing a single digital gateway  to provide access to information, to procedures and to assistance and problem-solving services and amending Regulation (EU)  No 1024/2012 http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1724/oj http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2018/1724/oj. 4 COM(2022) 45.

Commission Recommendation on a common Union toolbox to address semiconductor shortages and an EU mechanism  for monitoring the semiconductor ecosystem. 08/02/2022. 5 Cybersecurity – uniform rules for EU institutions, bodies and agencies (europa.eu).  6 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information security in the institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies of the Union | European Commission (europa.eu).  outlining the rationale and the overall strategy,  a proposal for a Regulation for adoption by co- legislators, a proposal for amendments to a Council  Regulation establishing the Key digital technologies  (KDT Joint Undertaking, and a Recommendation to  Member States promoting actions for monitoring and  mitigating disruptions in the semiconductor supply  chain. Supply chain cybersecurity is an important  cross-cutting issue for stakeholders.  Cybersecurity and information security  for EU institutions, bodies and agencies  In March 2022, the European Commission  proposed a new regulation5 with rules to increase  cybersecurity in all EU institutions, by making  it easier to share information on cyber threats  and improving the efficiency of action to prevent  and respond to cyber threats. This is expected to  reduce the risk of incidents that cause material or  reputational damage to EUIBAs. The proposal calls  for increased cooperation with relevant bodies and  stakeholders in the EU, via CERT-EU and ENISA. In  addition, it is proposed that ENISA will receive on  a monthly basis a summary report from CERT-EU on  significant cyber threats, significant vulnerabilities  and significant incidents.  A proposed regulation6 on information security  in the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies  of the Union was also put forward earlier in 2022  to create a minimum set of information security  rules and standards for all EU institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies to ensure an enhanced and  consistent protection against evolving threats to their  information. These new rules will provide a stable  ground for a secure exchange of information across  EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and with  the Member States, based on standardised practices  and measures to protect information flows.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 19  SECTION I. General context  FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  Memorandum of Understanding  with the European Data Protection  Supervisor (EDPS)  ENISA has a long working relationship with the EDPS  in the areas of privacy and data protection. Over the  years, the two entities have been collaborating on  promoting practical recommendations on technical  cybersecurity aspects in the implementation of the  GDPR and engaging relevant communities through the  co-location of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) and the  Internet Privacy Engineering Network (IPEN) workshops.  In order to strengthen further this collaboration,  the two entities have initiated a discussion on  signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on  establishing strategic cooperation in areas of common  interest. As part of the strategic plan, EDPS and ENISA  will consider designing, developing and delivering  capacity building and awareness raising activities in  areas such as cybersecurity aspects of personal data  protection and contribute jointly to similar activities  organised by other EU or national bodies.  Trusted network of vendors and suppliers  ENISA has initiated the development of a trusted  network of vendors and suppliers for information  exchange and cyber situational awareness with the  aim of contributing to a cooperative response at the  level of the Union and Member States. The focus will  be on building trusted bilateral partnerships about  threat and situational awareness and information  sharing on cyber events, to be followed by a request  for information in response (initiated by ENISA  or by the other party) and collaboration on cyber  information exchange projects.  For decades, Europe has taken steps to improve digital  security and trust through policies and initiatives. The  Management Board of ENISA adopted a new strategy  for the Agency in June 2020, which builds on the  CSA and outlines how the Agency will strive to meet  expectations of the cybersecurity ecosystem in the  long term, in a manner that is open, innovative and  agile as well as being socially and environmentally  responsible. The strategy sets out a vision of a trusted  and cybersecure Europe in which all citizens and  organisations of Europe not only benefit but are also  key components in the effort to secure Europe. Most  importantly, the new ENISA strategy outlines seven  strategic objectives that are derived from the CSA and  set the expected long-term goals for the Agency.  20  II  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 2121  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025    Europe has for decades taken steps to improve  digital security and trust through policies and  initiatives. The Management Board of ENISA adopted  a new strategy for the Agency in June 2020, which  builds on the Cybersecurity Act (CSA), and outlines  how the Agency will strive to meet the expectations  of the cybersecurity ecosystem in a medium to  long-term perspective, in a manner that is open,  innovative, agile as well as being socially and  environmentally responsible.

ENISA works with  communities, respecting their competencies and  expertise, and fosters synergies and trust to best  achieve its mission.  Excellence. ENISA aims for state-of-the-art  expertise in its work, upholds the highest  quality standards of operation and evaluates its  performance to strive for continuous improvement  through innovation and foresight.   Integrity/ethics. ENISA upholds ethical principles  and relevant EU rules and obligations in its services  and working environment ensuring fairness and  inclusiveness.   Respect. ENISA respects fundamental European  rights and values covering all its services and  working environment, as well as the expectations of  its stakeholders.   Responsibility. ENISA assumes responsibility thus  ensuring integration of the social and environmental  dimensions into practices and procedures.  Transparency. ENISA adopts procedures, structures  and processes that are open, factual and independent,  thus limiting bias, ambiguity, fraud and obscurity.    The corporate objective of sound resource and risk  management is derived from requirements in Art  4(1) of the CSA that sets an objective for the Agency  to 'be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue  of its independence, the scientific and technical  quality of the advice and assistance it delivers, the  Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management   Activity 11  Art 4(1)  •  Maximise quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens   •  Building lasting credibility and trust   1.

In addition, the  inspiration for this corporate objective stems from  the values of Excellence and Transparency derived  from ENISA's strategy and the principle of Efficiency  set out in MB decision 2020/5 on the principles  to be applied for organising ENISA. This aims for  ENISA to uphold the highest quality of standards,  strive for continuous improvement and enhance the  organisation’s performance.      The corporate objective of building an agile  organisation focused on people is derived from  requirements in Art 3(4) of the CSA which obliges the  Agency to 'develop its own resources, including /…/  human capabilities and skills, necessary to perform  the tasks assigned to it under this Regulation'. In  addition, the inspiration for this corporate objective  stems from the values of Responsibility and Respect  derived from ENISA's strategy and the principle of  Competences set out in MB decision 2020/5 on the  principles to be applied for organising ENISA. This  aims for ENISA to respect fundamental European  rights and values in its working environment, assume  responsibility for the social and environmental  dimensions of its procedures and to develop its staff  competences, expertise and talent.   Corporate objective Actions to  achieve  objective  Article of  the CSA  Expected results Key performance indicator Metrics  Sound resource and risk  management   Activity 11  Art 4(1)  •  Maximise quality and value provided to stakeholders  and citizens   •  Building lasting credibility and trust   1.

Acknowledging ENISA’s exceptional  operational mandate, the Commission and the  Budgetary Authority have continued to support  ENISA’s annual budget and requests for posts,  including allocating additional posts to the Agency  through the NIS2 directive, transferring additional  posts for seconded national experts to strengthen  the domain of operational cooperation and through  a one-off transfer of up to 15 million EUR in 2022  for supporting the Agency’s ability to provide  Member States with ex-ante and ex-post services in  response to the heightened threat level caused by  the Russian war in Ukraine.   The Agency has also, under the guidance of its  Management Board, elaborated comprehensive  service catalogues around its key tasks. Those service  catalogues cover the Agency’s services in support  of the implementation of the revised NIS directive,  certification, operational cooperation (in particular  creating services to strengthen situational awareness  at the Union level), capacity building (training  and exercises) and knowledge and information  management. The service catalogues have enabled  the Agency to better match its outputs to the needs  and priorities of the beneficiaries, create internal and  external synergies thus increasing efficiency but also  estimating the resources needed to cover the full  catalogue of services. Those necessary resources have  been mapped under each activity within the current  SPD, and they show that current resources represent  over EUR 3 million less than ENISA’s projected needs.   In terms of its human resources, the number of  Establishment Plan posts has grown from 59 to 82  posts during the period 2019–2022, that is by 39% as  a result of the new tasks that were foreseen under  the new Cybersecurity Act which came into force in  2019. An additional five posts (three TAs and two  CAs) have been authorised under 2022 for new  tasks under the NIS2 Directive. The number of all  authorised posts including TAs, CAs and SNEs grew  following a similar trend, that is by 33%, during the  period 2019-2022.  Table 1a. Evolution of authorised posts  and fulfilment  2019 2020 2021 202210  Number of  posts in the  Establishment  Plan   59  69  76  82   Per cent  fulfilment of the  establishment  plan on the 31st  of December   76%  80%  80%  94%   Total number of  authorised posts  (TAs, CAs, SNEs)   95  111  118  126   Per cent  fulfilment of the  total authorised  posts (TAs, CAs,  SNEs) on the 31st  of December   77 %  77 %  90 %  94 %   As an Agency, ENISA has historically struggled to  meet its needs for human resources and to take  steps to ensure timely and rapid fulfilment of its  Establishment Plan. The gap between available posts  and plan fulfilment is evidenced in the table above.  Historically, this has hampered the Agency in making  use of its potential capabilities in the most efficient  manner, resulting in a smaller real capacity of the  Agency in terms of its human resources.   In order to change this, the Agency embarked on  some human resources management novelties  such as a large-scale call for expressions of interest  for temporary agents (TAs) and contract agents  (CAs) in 2020, with the aim of creating sufficiently  diverse and broad reserve shortlists of candidates  with more transversal competences and skills that  could be used to recruit staff and thus fill the gaps  in the current establishment plan, as well as serve  as a pool of candidates for the establishment plan  on a multiannual basis. In 2021 the Agency also  embarked in an extensive reorganisation of the  management of its human resources, creating  a Strategic Workforce Planning framework11 which  10 3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive; projection on 31.12.2022 depends on successful conclusions of ongoing selection  process Q3-Q4 2022.  11  Strategic workforce planning also enables the Agency to take corrective actions if and when necessary to achieve the aims set out in Article  3(3) of the MB decision MB/2020/9, which foresees that the Executive Director will ensure that 'the average number of staff members assigned  to the Executive Directors Office (EDO) and Corporate Support Services (CSS) [offices and services supporting the functioning of the Agency]  shall not exceed the average number of staff members assigned to units [executing the objectives and tasks of the Agency]'.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 2929  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  prompts the organisation to analyse its human  resource needs ahead on a multiannual basis for  the Single Programming Document, and to plan and  review the allocation and development of human  resources between different activities as well as to  prepare new recruitment calls well in advance of the  enactment of the applicable annual Establishment  Plan. Under this framework, the Agency has reviewed  and restructured its human resources both in  direct operational areas and in administrative and  corporate areas.    In the course of the 2021 Strategic Workforce  Review, the Agency, along with other measures,  reallocated altogether four posts from EDO and  CSS, to be able to meet the threshold foreseen  in Article 3(3) of MB/2020/9. This resulted in the  termination of one contract, and the prolongation  of two contracts was put under review. The posts  were allocated to the operational units of the Policy  Development & Implementation Unit (PDI), Capacity  Building Unit (CBU) and Market, Certification and  Standardisation Unit (MCS).   In the course of the 2022 Strategic Workforce Review,  the Agency, along with other measures, reallocated  altogether three posts from EDO and CSS in order  to be able to meet the threshold foreseen in Article  3(3) of MB/2020/9. This resulted in a termination of  two contracts and a cancellation of one recruitment  procedure. The posts are now allocated to the  operational units of the Policy Development &  Implementation Unit (PDI), Capacity Building Unit  (CBU) and Operational Cooperation Unit (OCU), to be  fulfilled through ongoing recruitment calls.   The original impact that the conclusions of the 2021  and 2022 Strategic Workforce Review were supposed  to bring are summarised in the table 1b.   Though these exercises aimed at fulfilling and  supporting the resourcing of operational activities,  the Agency’s tight budgetary resources left limited  space for manoeuvring and the delivering of existing  services in corporate and administrative units as due  to budget limitations the possibilities of externalising  service provision could not have been implemented.  2.2.2. Outlook for the years 2023–2025   ENISA shall commit to develop and adopt its  corporate strategy (including HR strategy) which is  expected to present a vision for a modern, flexible  and values-driven planning of all its resources in the  service of an organisation that ensures its staff deliver  outstanding results for all stakeholders across the  EU. The strategy aims to put ‘people’ and ‘services’ at  its heart and steer all of ENISA actions so as to create  the right conditions for delivering on key priorities  while attracting, developing and retaining high calibre  talent. While modernising and uplifting its employer  branding, ENISA processes, policies and tools will be  reviewed with the perspective and vision of giving  to our staff more flexibility as to when and how they  work, building an even more inclusive workplace,  and providing a sustainable work environment and  solutions. The cornerstone of this transformation,  in line with the provisions of CSA article 3(4), is its  human capabilities; thus ENISA shall re-adjust its HR  processes, included within the Strategic Workforce  Planning framework, to be more competency driven.    To do so, ENISA has embarked on a revision of its  competency framework by defining competencies,  technical and behavioural, as well as those next- generation competencies that would enable ENISA to  meet its future challenges. This would enable ENISA  to make staff development a key area of professional  growth, as well as empowering the Agency to adopt  frameworks for enhancing career development  opportunities. All HR processes will be reviewed  and adjusted to reflect modern, competency driven  practices and the best practices in the market, with  the aim of attracting, retaining and developing highly  skilled staff.    Table 1b. Monitoring the workforce under operational and support units.  Operational units Supporting offices and services  Established  staff  (TAs & CAs) Average  Established  staff  (TAs & CAs) Average  Allocated posts as of 01.01.2021  48  12  38  19   Allocation as of 01.10. 2021  67  16.75  40  20   Allocated posts as of  01.08.2022  71  17.75  35.5  17.75   Current staff in house at 01.08.2022 60  15  32.5  16.25   3030  In 2022, ENISA has already taken steps to shift from  a traditional headcount methodology to strategic  workforce planning. This will enable a forward  looking, proactive, flexible and integrated approach in  anticipating and addressing staffing gaps in order to  build an agile workforce and allocate resources where  priorities lie. To do so, ENISA is revamping its decision  to carry out a strategic review of its workforce with  the aim of consolidating ‘hard’ workforce data with  ‘soft’ competency aspects, in order to adopt a new  staffing strategy aligned with organisational priorities.    While continuing to monitor staff allocation between  operational and administrative units to ensure that  the thresholds of MB decision MB/2020/9 are met,  ENISA will aim to identify the level of its in-house  resources in terms of numbers of staff and their skills  and competences, review its job evaluation and job  framework, and generally redesign its staffing policy  while determining future workforce needs not only  based on workload indicators and workforce plans  but also investments in competency and shortages to  address gaps in skills. This is of particular importance,  considering the rapidly changing and competitive  ‘niche’ market of cybersecurity, in order to maintain  ENISA’s added value in the EU cyber eco-system.   Besides that, in order to ‘build an agile workforce’,  traditional ways of working will continue to be  adjusted and the Agency will continue operating  in its matrix format. The working environment will  need to be reviewed as well so as to accommodate  the flexibility that has arrived as a result of the  new way of working following COVID, including by  enabling staff to telework outside of their place of  assignment. Agility and flexibility were at the core of  ENISA's modus operandi in the last few years and the  Agency shall also support dynamic ways of working  within the next programming period.    Currently ENISA is still waiting for the final adoption  of the NIS2 directive where ENISA is tasked with  additional action areas. While these action areas  are covered by ENISA’s general tasks in accordance  with its mandate, they would be supported by five  supplementary fulltime equivalents (FTEs) (three TAs  and two CAs) with a corresponding budget of around  EUR 610,000 a year. This is an integral part of the  NIS2 and is currently managed as a reserve that the  Agency can draw on following the completion of the  adoption process. It is expected that NIS2 directive  will be adopted in Q4 2022. The indicated posts have  been included in the general workforce planning as  part of the approved human resources under the EU  general budget 2023.   Besides that, a letter of intent between DG CONNECT  and ENISA on the provision of support to Member  States to further mitigate the risks of large-scale  cybersecurity incidents in the short term through  a new 'Emergency Response Fund for Cybersecurity'  was signed in July 2022. This covers the short-term  phase of the pilot with an amount of 15 million euros  provided by DG CONNECT. Here, DG CONNECT  provides ENISA with the necessary financial resources  that will allow the Agency to reinforce its catalogue  of services and enhance the support provided to  Member States; it does not grant any additional posts  for the implementation of activities under this one off  injection. For this initial phase ENISA has capitalised  on its expertise and has implemented an innovative  cross-unit approach to fulfil the purposes of the funds  with which it has been entrusted. These are more  than double its budget for 2022, while this comes  on top of already existing defined priorities by all  entities. While in the short term ENISA demonstrated  the agility and flexibility required to perform, so if  such new tasks become permanent, ENISA should be  entrusted with additional resources.    Altogether, the financial resources required based on  administrative needs and to face upcoming operational  challenges exceed by far the allocated EU financial  envelope. Given the inflationary context, administrative  costs for the buildings as well as staff costs, these  expenses are expected to increase dramatically over  the coming years. This would unfortunately result in  a reduced budget available for operations. Therefore,  ENISA must prioritise and select the most impactful  output and suppress or reduce the scope of certain  projects to meet these budgetary constraints if no  additional resources are allocated to ENISA in the  short and/or medium term. The total shortfall that the  Agency has identified amounts to over 3 million euro.     The human resource requirements forecasted in the  current draft of the SPD are well above those foreseen  by the current establishment plan. While ENISA remains  committed to the continuous improvement of its  administrative and operational efficiency, it will continue  to closely monitor, assess and optimise its structures,  services, processes, activities and resource allocation.  ENISA faces a constant increase in its workload and  while it will still seek for further gains in efficiency across  the organisation, these gains will only compensate for  minor workload increases and temporary absences of  staff. However, the MFF 2021-2027 foresees no increase  in the agency’s establishment plan and thus imposes  further constraints for its human resources. Unless  further resources are allocated, ENISA would need to  prioritise and limit the scope of its services within its  existing tasks as well as within new tasks in order to  fulfil its operational mandate.    ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 3131  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  2.3. RESOURCE PROGRAMMING  FOR THE YEARS 2023–2025   2.3.1. Financial Resources   In order for the Agency to manage its financial and  human resources more efficiently and to be able to  manage its operations extending over a number of  budget years while respecting budget annularity and  reducing the administrative workload, it will further  examine and apply differentiated appropriations in  its overall budget management. As this is a standard  operating procedure of the institutions, the Agency,  in order to manage its upcoming growth and increase  its operational efficiency, will make structural efforts  in this direction.   In 2021 the financial structure of the title 3 budget  was revised to match the activities of the Single  Programming Document in accordance with the  CSA. This budget structure aims to implement  activity based budgeting and cost based reporting  thus allowing ENISA to make budgetary decisions  based on specific activity budgetary drivers and  their importance to the Agency’s activities.    To strengthen budget management, the  Agency established the Budget Management  Committee (BMC) in 2021 to ensure the coherent  planning, implementation and follow-up of  the Agency’s budget. The mandate of the BMC  encompasses the entire lifecycle of the budget,  including assisting in setting the overall framework  and guiding the development, roll-out and  implementation as well as follow-up and analysis of  the budget. The committee gives recommendations  to the Executive Director (ED) on the execution  of the budget including the steps, which should  be taken in order to ensure proper planning and  implementation of the annual budget of the Agency,  and give feedback on the utilisation and budget  implementation of the relevant units and managers.   The introduction of the BMC and activity based  budgeting have allowed enhanced monitoring  of financial planning, leading to a more efficient  execution of the budget. Concretely, a higher  budgetary execution rate and fewer budgetary  transfers were expected as a result of this, as  evidenced in 2021. The budgetary execution rate in  2021 increased to 99.51% of the budget vs 97.35%  in 2020 and there were five internal transfers by ED  decision versus seven in 2020 and ten in 2019.    Based on the lessons learned from 2021 the Agency  has extended this efficiency to title 1 and title 2  by merging the budget lines of these titles in the  proposed 2023 budget structure. By reducing the  number of budget lines from 30 to 11 for title  1 and 2, the Agency will be able to reduce the  number of ED decisions required to transfer funds  between budget lines thus reducing administrative  burden and enhance the quality of the monitoring  and reporting of the budget. The budget lines  consolidated were those budget lines with less  500,000 EUR within the same type or category of  expenditure in title 1 and 2. This would also allow  the agency to apply a more agile and flexible way of  managing its funds and services. The consolidated  budget lines are reflected in the statement of  estimates submitted and adopted alongside the  draft SPD 2023-2025.    In light of the current economic and political  environment and due to the increase in cybersecurity  requirements, the financial resources allocated to ENISA  are insufficient to meet these challenges. An annex will  be included in the draft single programming document  2024-2026 detailing the assessed impact due to a lack of  resources on the Agency’s planned activities.    The total EU contribution to ENISA over the period  from 2023 to 2025, as well as for the full period of the  new multiannual financial framework 2021–2027, is  planned to remain stable, with a slight annual increase  of circa 2% to reflect inflation (see table 2).    In 2023 ENISA’s revenue is composed of 97.2% from  the EU's contribution and 2.8% from the European  Economic Area (EEA) country contribution (Table 1  in Annex III). In absolute terms, the EU and EEA  contribution for 2023 is estimated respectively to  reach EUR 24.5 million and EUR 0.7 million.   The general allocation of funds across titles is  expected to remain stable over the period 2023- 2025. Expenditure in 2023 is expected to amount  to EUR 25.2 million, of which EUR 12.7 million in  Title 1 covers all staff-related costs (50%), EUR 3.5  million in Title 2 covers main items such as building  related expenditure and ICT expenses (14%) and  EUR 9.0 million in Title 3 covers all core operating  expenditure (36%). Total expenditure includes the  reserve budget of EUR 610,000 expected to be  allocated to cover additional staff (3 TAs and 2 CAs)  to manage part of the activities linked to the NIS2  directive to be adopted in Q4 2022.   3232  2.3.2. Human Resources   In its budget proposal for the Single Programming  Document (SPD) 2023-2025, the Agency asks for  an extra four SNE posts (introduced gradually 2+2  over the two years to 2024). The four additional  SNE posts requested would be justified both by  the Agency’s current activity areas, particularly the  operational needs stemming from Article 7 of the CSA  as well as by those extra activities and requirements,  as foreseen especially in the initial phases laid out  in the Commission’s Recommendation on the Joint  Cyber Unit (JCU) of 23 June 2021.    Engaging further with SNEs is a cost-effective solution  of mutual benefit that on the one hand supports  the Agency to fulfil its mandate and on the other  hand adds the most value for Member States as it  strengthens the trust-bound relationship between  Member States and ENISA as well as facilitates  smooth knowledge-sharing and service delivery from  ENISA to the Member States.   The collective knowledge acquired from the  perspective of the Member States through such posts  will be crucial for the success of these tasks. In fact,  by importing unique expertise and knowledge into  the Agency through SNE posts rather than having to  outsource certain tasks or create any dependencies  on other external staff, ENISA is catering for the  increasing activities which require close cooperation  with Member States as part of its mandate. Higher  SNE turnovers will in turn be of direct benefit for all  Member States and offer a rich experience to SNEs  following their posting.   In 2021 the Agency’s request for two additional SNEs  for 2022 did not materialise. The Agency therefore  has taken the decision to reallocate two SNE posts  internally that were earmarked for other operational  units and will transfer them to the Operational  Cooperation Unit in 2022 specifically for tasks related  to Article 7 of the CSA.    This decision to transfer posts from other operational  units will have consequences in terms of those  units’ capacity to carry out their tasks. Therefore,  the Agency will need to seek alternative ways to  compensate for this decision in order to fulfil its  mandate and tasks. Such measures include the re- allocation of further resources from administrative  and corporate areas to the operational units and  specifically to the Operational Cooperation Unit,  inevitably leading to gaps across corporate and  administrative functions of the Agency that will need  to be covered by externalising these tasks to external  service providers. This affect is further compounded  by fewer than required graded posts stemming  from the NIS2 proposal (3 AD posts) which were  authorised by the draft EU general budget for 2022.  While acknowledging the budgetary principles, the  geopolitical location of ENISA acts as a negative driver  in attracting high calibre talents, particularly in such  a niche market. This results in the agency creating  reserve lists with reduced geographical diversity.   The reallocation of posts within ENISA will be done by  following the established strategic workforce planning  framework. Annual strategic workforce reviews  will be conducted during the period from 2023 to  2025 in order to develop and maintain current staff  competencies to fulfil the Agency’s operational needs  and achieve the balance of internal resource allocation  between operational and corporate support units. As  indicated in Table 1b under Section 2.1, the current  allocation of posts between operational and corporate  support units is balanced. ENISA will thus continue its  best efforts to ensure that current in-house staff to be  reported on 31 December 2022 will also be balanced,  keeping the same trend throughout the coming period  from 2023 to 2025. For this, ENISA aims to put an  emphasis on the development of staff competences,  including by gradually rolling out multisource  feedback tools which enable staff members to actively  address their development areas, expertise and skills  in line with the needs of the Agency.   Table 2   2022 2023 2024 2025  Total appropriations for ENISA  (thousand EUR)  24,208   25,183  25,322  25,733   Source:   (*) Draft Union annual budget for the financial year 2023 COM (2022) 400   (**) Fiche no. 68 – MFF 2021-2027 dated 08/06/2020, per cent of EFTA funds as per COM (2022) 400 and an additional  amount of EUR 610,000 has been added subject to the approval of the NIS2 Directive   ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 3333  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  A summary of the expected evolution of human  resources is outlined below, while detailed data is  available in Annex IV.   In order to meet the expected targets ENISA, within its  HR strategy (as part of its overall corporate strategy),  will set targets for the establishment of a reserve list of  sufficient scope and length. Optimum retention target  of <10% departures during the year is being considered  as a KPI for the coming period of 2023 to 2025.    2.4. STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING  GAINS IN EFFICIENCY    ENISA remains committed to the continuous  improvement of its operational and administrative  efficiency. It aims to ensure that it acts in the right way  and exhausts gains in efficiency before reinforcing  areas of work with extra resources. As part of its  upcoming corporate strategy, the Agency aims to  further improve ENISA’s organisational efficiency and  flexibility to meet operational needs. To this end, as  part of its HR strategy, the Agency aims to address  and include an efficiency strategy component, with  specific initiatives and a cross-unit perspective. Such  initiatives should be seen as a holistic package and  cover different pillars such as activity and resources  or service categorisation, capitalisation on shared  services, strategic workforce planning, business and  service optimisation among a few.   Strategic Workforce Planning   In 2022, ENISA took steps to shift from a traditional  headcount methodology to strategic workforce  planning. This will enable a forward looking, proactive,  flexible and integrated approach in anticipating and  addressing gaps in staffing in order to build an agile  workforce and allocate resources where priorities lie.  To do so, ENISA is revamping its decision to review  its strategic workforce, with the aim of consolidating  ‘hard’ workforce data with ‘soft’ competency aspects,  in order to adopt a new staffing strategy aligned with  organisational priorities.    While continuing to monitor staff allocation between  its operational and corporate units to ensure the  thresholds of MB decision MB/2020/9 are met,  ENISA would aim to identify the level of its in-house  resources in terms of numbers of staff and their skills  and competences, review its job evaluation and job  framework, and generally redesign its staffing policy  while determining future workforce needs not only  based on workload indicators and workforce plans  but also investments in competency and shortages  to address the gaps in skills and expertise. This is  of particular importance, considering the rapidly  changing competitive ‘niche’ market of cybersecurity,  in order to maintain ENISA’s added value in the EU  cyber ecosystem.   Table 3   202212 202313 202414 202515  Number of posts in the Establishment Plan  82  82  82  82   Per cent of expected fulfilment of the  establishment plan on 31 December 94% 95% or  higher 95% or higher 95% or higher   94%  95% or  higher  95% or  higher  95% or  higher  Total number of authorised posts (TAs, CAs, SNEs)  and expected (2024 & 2025) 126 128 130 132   126  128 130 132  Per cent of expected fulfilment of the total  authorised posts (TAs, CAs, SNEs) on 31  December 94% 95% 95% 95%   94% 95% 95% 95%  12 Forecast data will be finalised in November 2022 and 3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive; projection on 31.12.2022  depends on successful conclusions of ongoing selection process Q3-Q4 2022. 13  3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive. 14  3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive. 15  3 TA posts and 2 CA posts from NIS2 directive.  3434  This strategy will be based on the multi-annual  planning of human resource needs and will be activity  driven. Gains in efficiency through the introduction  of new tools, business process reviews or better  organisation of the workload will be exhausted first  before supplementing an area of work with extra  resources. With the priority given to operational work,  ENISA will ensure that its workforce is flexible and  multi-skilled and can be redeployed swiftly to meet  increasing or changing organisational needs. Emphasis  will be placed on competencies and demonstrated  transferrable skills and competencies that are needed  in order to meet operational priorities. At the same  time, ENISA will invest in the skills and experience of  its current workforce and will endeavour to retain and  develop its solid performers with the right skills and  competencies. To do so, ENISA will introduce modern  HR practices to support the development of talent.     Business process review and service  optimisation   ENISA also intends to assess and analyse the  sustainability of existing processes, to explore  alternative models for providing indirect support  and propose actions to ensure operational efficiency  without compromising the activities of its operational  units. Within the context of its coming strategy, the  overall operating business model of the support units  would continue to be reviewed in order to ensure that  the MB 2020/09 thresholds and requirements are met.   Digitalisation of services, self-service functionalities  and service optimisation will also be the core of the  future way of working and ENISA's corporate strategy  to build an agile workforce. ENISA will continue to  review and explore possibilities to reengineer its  processes, with a view to optimising service quality  and cost-effectiveness, for instance by:    exploring and piloting changes in service levels  and modalities, to improve added-value and  cost-efficiency, such as shifting from owned to  leased solutions, from manual entries to centrally  managed solutions;   identifying activities and services that may be  downsized and discontinued if needed;    continuously streamlining and automating  administrative workflows to improve staff  productivity, by removing redundant steps and  capitalising on new technologies such as making  use of DIGIT services and tools,    reviewing ICT infrastructure and related  technologies to reduce duplication of components  and optimise maintenance and capital  replacements such as for storage or move towards  cloud-based solutions.   Capitalising on shared services    In line with the call for agencies to promote the use of  shared services, ENISA will continue to seek efficiency  gains through initiatives such as:   sharing services with other agencies and/or the  Commission, including e.g. interagency and inter- institutional procurements, common services  with CEDEFOP and the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre (ECCC) and the use of the  Commission's ICT solutions such as those for  human and financial resources management;    contributing to further promoting shared services  among agencies through different networks,  particularly in the areas of procurement, HR, ICT  and risk and performance management, data  protection, information security, accounting etc;   contributing to the improvement and piloting of IT  services with DG HR, DIGIT and Frontex in the area  of HR and financial management.   ENISA has already started its journey towards gains  in efficiency and intends in the forthcoming period to  connect the separate actions under a corporate plan  in order to meet the challenges of the future.    The Agency continues to implement its work  programme by systematic use of its statutory bodies  (NLO Network, ENISA Advisory Group), as well as other  statutory groups. ENISA is involved in the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG as set out  in the CSA Art. 22, NISD Cooperation Group and  its work-streams, expert groups created under the  Union law) and its own ad hoc expert groups, where  appropriate, to avoid duplication of effort, build  synergies and peer-review the scope and direction of  actions undertaken to implement outputs as well as  validate the results. In this way the Agency will fulfil  its obligation as outlined in Article 3(3) of the CSA to  avoid duplication of the activities of Member States  and taking into consideration the existing expertise  of Member States. Hence, all activities enlisted under  section 3.1. and 3.2. in this SPD contain an indication  of how specific deliverables and other actions  undertaken to fulfil the outputs will be validated and  peer-reviewed or consulted in accordance with the  legal framework in the area of certification.   ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 3535  SECTION II. Multi-annual programming 2023 – 2025  Since 2021, the framework for structured cooperation  with CERT-EU has been formalised with the drafting  of an annual cooperation plan to utilise synergies and  avoid duplication of activities in executing its task in  the field of operational cooperation (Art 7 of the CSA).  The Agency’s local office in Brussels (established in  2021) should further enable the Agency to further  create synergies with other EU Institutions, agencies  and bodies within and beyond these activities. The  Agency is also pursuing cooperation with relevant  Union bodies and will begin to create synergies with  the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre and  Network so as to fulfil its tasks in the field of research  and innovation (Article 11 of the CSA) as well as in  administration, namely, accounting, data protection  and information security.    In its corporate functions, ENISA further seeks to  rationalise its internal processes to improve its  overall efficiency and to benchmark its activities  with the best practices implemented by other EU  institutions and agencies. The Agency is continuing  and further expanding the sharing of services among  other EU agencies. A number of collaborations and  agreements are currently in place with the European  Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and in  2021 the Agency signed a cooperation plan with  the European Union Agency for the Operational  Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of  Freedom, Security and Justice (EU-LISA). In addition  ENISA and the European Centre for the Development  of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) are strengthening  their cooperation to streamline procurement to  share financial services, increase gains in efficiency in  human resources, explore IT solutions together and to  support each other in the area of data protection. The  aim is to share knowledge and use human resources  between the two agencies in the most efficient  manner to deliver better value for EU citizens.   Most of ENISA's administrative tasks are supported  by EU Tools such as accruals-based accounting  (ABAC), Sysper for human resource management  and for missions and document approvals and  registry. In 2022, preparatory work to migrate to the  Advanced Record System (ARES) was initiated and  ENISA is engaged in preparatory work to use both the  Missions Integrated Processing System (MIPS) and  procurement management processes (PPMT) in the  course of 2023.    In 2022 the Agency embarked on supporting the EU  Agencies network in relation to the implementation  of cybersecurity requirements proposed in the draft  regulation on common binding rules on cybersecurity  for EUIBAs, namely though a concept of shared  services on the management of cybersecurity risk  (virtual CISO concept)   36  III  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 37  This is the main body of the Work Programme  describing, in terms of its operational and corporate  activities, what the Agency aims to deliver in the year  2023 towards achieving its strategy and the expected  results. Ten operational activities and two corporate  activities in total have been identified to support the  implementation of ENISA’s mandate in 2023.  The activities of the work programme seek to mirror  and align with the tasks set out in chapter two of the  CSA, demonstrating concretely not only the specific  objectives, results and outputs expected for each task  but also the resources assigned.  STAKEHOLDERS AND ENGAGEMENT LEVEL  The management of stakeholders is instrumental  to the proper functioning and implementation of  ENISA’ work programme. On 29 March 2022 the  Management Team adopted ENISA’s Stakeholders  Strategy. This Strategy lays down the main principles  and approach to the engagement of stakeholders  at the Agency-wide level. The implementation  of the Stakeholders Strategy is linked with the  implementation of the Single Programming  Document (SPD) through its activities.  Each activity includes a list of stakeholders and the  expected or planned level of engagement for each  stakeholder. The level of engagement refers to the  degree of the their interest and influence in the  activity for stakeholders who are classified as either  partners or involve/engage. Stakeholders classified  as 'Partners' refers to those with high influence and  high interest, usually business owners and others  with significant decision-making authority. They  are typically easy to identify and to engage with  actively. Stakeholders classified as involve/engage  have high influence but lower interest. These are  typically stakeholders with significant decision-making  authority but lacking in availability or the interest to  be actively engaged.  KPIS AND METRICS  In 2020 the Agency developed and introduced  a new set of key performance indicators and  related metrics for measuring the performance of  the activities. These metrics are inscribed in the  Single Programming Document for each activity and  are made up of both quantitative and qualitative  metrics. Quantitative metrics are those that measure  a specific number through a certain formulae.  Qualitative metrics are those that are more of  a subjective opinion based on information received;  however even these are quantified in order to be  interpreted and measured.  The KPIs for activities and associated metrics are  expected to transition in due time with metrics  stemming from the development of the cybersecurity  index, that is currently being piloted. The initial  introduction of the cybersecurity index metrics  to the KPIs for activities are expected in the 2024  work programme. In addition the Agency will take  measures to better explain and align the metrics with  EU policies and by extension the strategic objectives,  activity objectives and individual output objectives.  SECTION III  WORK PROGRAMME 2023  38  3.1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  ACTIVITY 1: Providing assistance in policy  development  Overview of activity  This activity delivers assistance and advice to the EU and Member States in developing cybersecurity policy and  sector-specific policy and legislative initiatives on matters related to cybersecurity and on the basis of the 2020  EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Aspects such as privacy and personal data protection are taken into consideration  (including encryption).  The activity seeks to bolster policy initiatives on novel or emerging technology areas by providing technical, fact- driven and tailor-made cybersecurity advice and recommendations. ENISA will support the EC and MSs on new  policy initiatives16 through evidence-based inputs into the process of policy development. ENISA, in coordination  with the EC and Member States will also conduct policy scouting to support them in identifying potential areas  for policy development based on technological, societal and economic trends as well as in developing monitoring  capabilities and tools to regularly and consistently be able to provide advice on the effectiveness of existing  Union policy and law in accordance with the EU’s institutional competencies in the area.  This activity also contributes to the service package INDEX by providing data used in the cybersecurity index  (Activity 8), by providing input that can be used for future certification schemes (CERTI service package ) and by  providing findings and recommendations for the service packages offered to critical NIS sectors (Activity 2).  The added value of this activity is to support decision-makers in a timely manner on developments at the  technological, societal and economic market levels which might affect the cybersecurity policy framework (see  also Activity 8). Given the cross-cutting nature of cybersecurity across the policy landscape, the activity will  provide an up-to-date risk-based analysis of cybersecurity not only in the areas of critical infrastructure and  sectors, but also by providing advice across the field in an integrated and holistic manner. The legal basis for this  activity is Article 5 of the CSA.  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policy (existing and new)  •  Ensure that EU policy makers are regularly informed about the effectiveness of the existing frameworks, and  EU policy makers and stakeholders are provided with timely and tailor-made policy recommendations on  future cybersecurity challenges and opportunities  16 Policy initiatives such as the forthcoming Cyber Resilience Act and initiatives on Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum computing,  blockchain, big data, data spaces, digital resilience and response to current and future crises  Objectives  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 39  SECTION III. Work Programme 2023  Stakeholders and levels of engagement18  17 in accordance with Art 20(4) of CSA 18 Stakeholders and levels of engagement stem from the implementation of the ENISA stakeholder strategy  Outputs  1.1.  Assist and advise the EC and Member States  in reviewing the effectiveness of current  cybersecurity policy frameworks  1.2  Assist and advise the EC and MS on new  policy developments, as well as carrying out  preparatory work  1.3  Support policy monitoring of existing  and emerging policy areas and maintain  a catalogue of all relevant cybersecurity  legislations and policies at the EU level  Partners  DG Connect, NIS Cooperation Group, National  Competent Authorities, other formally established  groups, European Commission Directorate  General’s Office and Agencies – depending on  policy area (e.g. DG GROW, European Insurance  and Occupational Pensions Authority)  Involve / Engage  ENISA National Liaison Officers, operators of  essential services, digital service providers and  industry associations or representatives.

Actions  include establishing synergies with and between the various national cybersecurity communities (including the  civilian, law enforcement, cyber diplomacy and cyber defence) and EU actors notably CERT-EU with a view to  exchanging know-how, best practices, providing advice and issuing guidance.  In addition, inline with NIS2 requirements ENISA will continue to support Member States in the CSIRTs Network  in respect of operational cooperation. Moreover with the formal establishement of the EU CyCLONe (Cyber Crisis  Liason Organization Network) in NISD2, ENISA will support tthe coordination of cyber crises by advising and  assisting both networks.  Under this activity ENISA is supporting operational communities through helping to develop and maintain  secure and highly available networks and IT platforms and communication channels to ensure, in particular, the  maintenance, deployment and uptake of the MeliCERTes platform32. Furthemore, in view of the implementation  of the NIS2 Directive, this activity supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure by designated CSIRTs in the  CSIRTs Network and the implementation of a European vulnerability database.  In view of the EC Recommendation 4520 (2021) and Council Conclusions of the 20 October 2021 (ST 13048 2021)  on ‘exploring the potential of the Joint Cyber Unit initiative – complementing the EU Coordinated Response to  Large-Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises’, ENISA will engage in exploring the potential of the JCU, along the  lines and the roles defined according to ongoing discussions amongst MSs and relevant EU institutions, bodies  and agencies. In addition, this activity implements the ENISA Cybersecurity Support Action33.  This activity underpins the Situational Awareness service package and contributes to INDEX and NIS service packages.  The legal basis for this activity is Article 7 of the CSA.  Objectives  •  Enhance and improve incident response capabilities across the Union  •  Enable effective European cybersecurity crisis management by continuously improving the cyber crisis  management framework  •  Ensure coordination in cybersecurity crisis management among relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies  (e.g. CERT-EU, European External Action Service (EEAS), European Union Agency for Law Enforcement  Cooperation (EUROPOL)  •  Improve maturity and capacities of operational communities (CSIRTs Network, EU CyCLONe)  •  Contribute to preparedness, shared situational awareness and coordinated response and recovery  to large-scale cyber incidents and crises across different communities (e.g. by providing Ex-ante services)  32 This is especially relevant for the year 2023 and onwards because the support contract procured by the Commission finishes  by the end of 2022. 33 the Agency will prepare where possible for the future Emergency Response Fund, providing that ENISA will be asked to support  it and without pre-empting the outcome of the legislative process.

ACTIVITY 11: Performance and risk  management  Overview of activity  This activity seeks to achieve the requirements set out in Art 4(1) of the CSA that sets an objective for the Agency  to: 'be a centre of expertise on cybersecurity by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of  the advice and assistance it delivers, the information it provides, the transparency of its operating procedures,  the methods of operation, and its diligence in carrying out its tasks'. This objective requires an efficient  performance and risk management framework, and the development of single administrative practices. It also  includes building an internal capacity for contribution, e.g. via shared services, to the EU Agencies network and in  key areas of the Agency’s expertise (e.g. cybersecurity risk management).  Under this activity ENISA will confinue to enhance the key objectives of the renewed organisation, as described  in the MB decision No MB/2020/5, including the need to address the gaps in the Agency’s quality assessment  framework, enhance proper and functioning internal controls and compliance checks. In terms of resource  management the budget management committee ensures the Agency adheres to sound financial management.  The legal basis for this activity is Art 4(1) and Art 32 of the CSA, the latter of which focuses strongly on sound  financial management principles with a view to maximising value to stakeholders.  Objectives  •  Increased effectiveness and efficiency in achieving Agency objectives  •  Compliant with legal and financial frameworks in the performance of the Agency (build a culture of compliance)  •  Protect the Agency’s assets and reputation, while reducing risks  •  Full climate neutrality of all operations by 2030  Results  •  Maximise quality and value provided to  stakeholders and citizens  •  Building lasting credibility and trust  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Sound resource and risk management  72  Stakeholders and levels of engagement  Outputs  11.1  Maintain the framework for performance  management including through single  administrative practices across the Agency  11.2  Develop and implement annual  communications strategy  11.3  Develop and implement risk management  plans including cybersecurity risk assessment  for IT systems, including focus on quality  management framework and business  processes as well as relevant policies  11.4  Maintain and monitor the implementation  of Agency wide processes for  IT management and develop processes  for budgetary management  11.5  Manage and provide secretariats for statutory  bodies (EB, MB, NLO and AG)  11.6  Obtain and maintain the EU Eco-Management  and Audit Scheme (EMAS) certificate through  continuous overview of the impact of CO2  on all operations of the Agency in line with  the applicable legal framework and publish  a statement on the environment  Partners  Members of statutory bodies such  as Management Board, Advisory Group  and National Liaison Officers  Involve / Engage  All ENISA stakeholders  Validation  •  Management Team  •  Chairs of statutory bodies (Output 10.5)  •  Budget Management Committee  •  IT Management Committee  •  Intellectual Property Rights Management  Committee  •  Staff Committee  •  ENISA Ethics Committee  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 73  SECTION III. Work Programme 2023  Key performance indicators  Organisational performance culture Trust in ENISA brand  Unit of  measurement  Frequency Data  source  Results  2021  Target  2023  11.1.

The actions which will be pursued under this activity will focus on making sure that the Agency’s HR resources fit  the needs and objectives of ENISA, by attracting, retaining and developing talent and building ENISA’s reputation  as an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can evolve personally and professionaly, where staff  are kept engaged, motivated and have a sense of belonging. Emphasis will be placed on the development of  competency and ways to make ENISA an ‘employer of choice’ in order to support ENISA’s objectives This activity  will seek to build an attractive workspace by establishing an effective framework enabling teleworking outside the  place of assignment, developing and maintaining excellent working conditions (premises, layout of office space)  and implementing modern user-centric IT and teleconferencing tools delivering state-of-the-art corporate services  and supporting ENISA's business owners and stakeholders in line with the Agency’s objectives.  ENISA will strive to maximise the efficiency of its resources by maintaining its focus on developing a flexible,  highly-skilled and fit-for-purpose workforce through strategic workforce planning in order to ensure the effective  functioning of the Agency and to maintain high quality services in the administrative and operational areas.  ENISA will further improve the support given to it in strategic planning and resource management, leading to  a constant optimisation of resources under short- and long-range time-frames. This will enable ENISA to enhance  its capabilities in future-readiness and continue its path towards an agile, knowledge-based and matrix way of  working. The Agency will continue to look into flexible (50/50) working arrangements to better balance work  requirements in a pragmatic manner.  In parallel, ENISA will continue to enhance its secure operational environment to the highest level, and strive  for excellence in its infrastructure services based on best practices and frameworks. It will also explore cloud- enabled services that are fit for purpose and provide services in accordance with recognised standards. Besides  that, ENISA will strive to promote and foster eco-system solutions, explore opportunities for shared services  with other EU agencies, leverage standard technologies where possible and support flexible ways of working.  As ENISA aspires to become a trusted partner it will continue to provide customer-focused multi-disciplinary  teams that demonstrate a customer centric, can-do and agile attitude.

The allocation was done  by following the direct budget and FTEs as indicated  for each activity with indirect budgets being assigned  in accordance with causal relationships.  The following assumptions are used in the simplified  ABB methodology  The budget allocation of each activity includes  the direct and indirect budget attributed to  each activity.  Direct budget is the cost estimate of each of  the 10 operational activities as indicated under  Section 3.1 of the SPD 2023-2025 (carried out  under Articles 5-12) in terms of goods and services  to be procured.  Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries  and allowances, buildings, IT, equipment and  miscellaneous operating costs, attributable to  each activity. The indirect budget is allocated  to activities based on various drivers. The main  driver for the allocation of costs was the number  of foreseen direct FTEs for each operational  activity in 2023.  In order to estimate the full costs of operational  activities, both corporate activities (Act 11-12)  shall be distributed accordingly to all operational  activities based on the respective drivers.

Another reason  that may be cited is the need for stability during the start up phase of the Agency as staff from the hosting member state (Greece) is less  prone to resign (resulting in reduced turnover) which, in combination with the relatively young age of the Agency compared to others, still  has its original impact, the relatively better academic profile of Greek candidates for lower level posts; the relatively smaller payroll cost  for staff that is relatively better qualified than the average and costing less if expatriation allowance is considered, as well as the general  predisposition to accept a lower level position to remain in the home country.  Most represented nationality 2016 31.12.2022  Number % Number %  Greek 27 (out of 68) 39.7 38 (out of 96) 39.6  Looking back to 2021, it has been noted that positive measures to improve the diversity of nationalities, which  took in 2020 and 2021, have borne fruit. This can be attributed to the continuation of broad outreach campaigns  on popular media across the European Union, closer consideration of the spread of nationalities in relation to  the competencies requested, and specific provisions in the vacancy notices9.

The first stage of implementing the Brussels Office, which entailed the setting up and  furnishing of the ENISA workspace was completed in April 2022 and, since then, the office  has been operational. The office is being used on a daily basis by Brussels based staff,  which is a significant benefit for the Operational Cooperation Unit as they are able to  communicate easily with the CERT EU Team situated on the same floor. The objective of  the second implementation phase, which is currently ongoing, is to obtain accreditation  for the secure room, which will enable the agency to handle EU Classified Information  (EUCI) in its Brussels premises. The second phase of implementation is likely to continue  into Q2 2023.

ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 103  ANNEX Evaluations  ANNEX 9  EVALUATIONS  Ex-ante and ex-poste evaluations were issued in 2021 and there is a need for an  evaluation to be reconsidered during 2023  104  ANNEX 10  STRATEGY FOR  ORGANISATIONAL  MANAGEMENT  AND INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  As adopted by the Management Board10, the Agency’s strategy for effective internal  control is based on international practices (COSO Framework’s international Standards),  as well the relevant internal control framework of the European Commission.  The Control Environment is the set of standards governing conduct, processes and  structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal controls across ENISA. The  Management Team sets the tone at the top with respect to the importance of internal  control, including expected standards of conduct.  Risk assessment is the Agency’s dynamic and iterative process for identifying and  assessing risks which could affect the achievement of objectives, and for determining  how such risks should be managed.  Control activities ensure the mitigation of risks related to the achievement of policy,  operational and internal control objectives. They are performed at all levels of the  organisation, at various stages of business processes and across the technology  environment. They may be preventive or detective and encompass a range of manual  and automated activities as well as segregation of duties.  Information is necessary for the Agency to carry out internal control and to support  the achievement of its objectives. In this respect it is necessary to consider external  and internal communication. External communication provides the specific Agency  stakeholders and, globally, EU citizens with information on ENISA’s policies, objectives,  actions and achievements. Internal communication provides ENISA staff with the  information required to support the achievement of objectives and the awareness for  day-to-day controls.  Continuous and specific assessments are used to ascertain whether each of the five  components of internal control is present and functioning. Continuous assessments, built  into business processes at different levels of the organisation, provide timely information  on any deficiencies. Findings are assessed and deficiencies are communicated and  corrected in a timely manner, with serious matters reported as appropriate.  10  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management- board-decisions/MB%20Decision%202019-12%20on%20internal%20controls%20framework.pdf  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 105  ANNEX Strategy for organisational management and internal control systems  The Common Approach on EU Decentralised Agencies foresees that EU agencies should  be more active concerning fraud prevention and that the related communication forms  an essential part of its success. In 2021 ENISA adopted an anti-fraud strategy 11 as  recommended by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).  Following relevant guidance and best practices developed within the EU Agencies  network, in 2022 ENISA initiated a thorough review of its internal control framework  and overall strategy. The review aims to consolidate input from different sources  and integrate the results of various risk assessments within a single internal control  assessment process.

The Agency’s international strategy 12 was adopted by the  MB during its November 2021 meeting and the actions for international strategy are  addressed under output 9.3 in activity 9.  12  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-international-strategy.  108  ANNEX 13  ANNUAL COOPERATION  PLAN 2023  This document is the provisional draft of 2023 Annual  Cooperation Plan (ACP2023) between ENISA, the EU  Agency for Cybersecurity, and CERT-EU, the CERT of  the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as foreseen  in the co-signed Memorandum of Understanding.  The ACP is expected to be endorsed by the CERT EU  steering board during the course of 2023 Q1.  The plan aims to cover the cooperation activities  planned for 2023.  The plan proposed in this document includes  references to the activities included in the ENISA Work  Program 2023 which is submitted to the Management  Board for approval (MB).  Similarly, and in continuation of ACP2022, the proposed  plan identifies actions on the following areas:  1.  Capacity building as referred to in Articles 6.c and  6.i of the Cyber Security Act (CSA)  2.  Operational cooperation as referred to in Article 7  of the CSA  3.  The area of long-term strategic analyses of cyber  threats as foreseen in Article 9.b of the CSA.  13 As referred to in Articles 6.c and 6.i of the CSA. 14 https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=60922 15 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 (Blueprint).  CAPACITY BUILDING  Capacity building13 covers assistance to relevant  public bodies to improve capabilities to respond to  cyber threats and incidents, including the provision of  cybersecurity trainings and exercises.  Focus points of capacity building for the structured  cooperation plan for 2023 remain Maturity, Training  and Exercises. In particular, and following the  findings from the European Court of Auditors in the  Special Report 05/202214, ENISA and CERT-EU plan to  increase cooperation on training and exercise with  the aim to increase the level of preparedness and  response of EUIBAs.  Maturity  Maturity assessments are useful means to identify  current abilities and also existing gaps that require  reinforcement of an organisation’s capabilities and  guide its efforts to improve its overall cybersecurity  posture by achieving higher maturity levels over time.  In 2022, drawing on ENISA, CERT-EU’s and other  CSIRTs Network and EUIBA stakeholders' experience  and expertise, ENISA has performed maturity- related development targeting the EUIBAs actors  of the Blueprint15 to assess their EU-level crisis  management capabilities. This work resulted in  a new maturity framework to perform a maturity  assessment for EUIBAs.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 109  ANNEX Annual Cooperation Plan 2023  In 2023, following the European Commission’s  proposal for Regulation on measures for a common  high level of cybersecurity it is expected for EUIBAs  to start its adoption. This will initiate a CERT-EU led  project in which a maturity assessment methodology  will be developed for the EUIBAs.  The plan for 2023 will focus on continuing existing  initiatives, in particular:    EUIBAs Cyber Hygiene: CERT-EU will  carry on the activities of finalising the  proposal for a cybersecurity Regulation16,  in close cooperation with the European  Commission’s DIGIT.S directorate, and develop  a cybersecurity maturity assessment methodology  for all EUIBAs.    CSIRTs Maturity: ENISA will promote the new  maturity framework among EUIBAs to implement  ENISA Maturity Framework for their EU cyber crisis  management capabilities. ENISA will foster the  application of the maturity framework to relevant  subjects to help identify current abilities and gaps.  CERT-EU and ENISA will maintain close contacts  throughout the process to ensure their maturity- related activities feed each other in the most efficient  way, avoiding duplication and misalignment.  Training & Exercises  CERT-EU and ENISA have been successfully  cooperating on training and exercises for many  years. In particular, 2022 saw the execution of  ENISA’s flagship exercise, Cyber Europe 2022, where  CERT-EU and ENISA cooperated on its setup and  exercise roll-out.  16 The proposal has been finalised and the European Commission published it on 22 March 2022. See https://ec.europa.eu/ commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1866 for more information.  This close cooperation will continue in 2023 by  combining CERT-EU’s and ENISA’s strengths to lay the  basis for developing a relevant, cost-efficient training  portfolio that supports cybersecurity capacity building  but also operational cooperation. The ambition of  the cooperation is for ENISA to be able to provide  state-of-the-art training portfolio that will be offered  both to MSs and EUIBAs and to keep it up to date and  relevant through its close collaboration with CERT-EU  and its other key stakeholders.  Working methods already established in 2022 will  continue throughout 2023 (e.g. CERT-EU collaborating  with ENISA in the CSIRTs Network Working Group on  Trainings and other similar fora).  The focus of 2023 will be to keep sustaining yearly  ongoing activities (i.e. cyber exercise regularly  organised by ENISA or in collaboration with ENISA)  as well as finalising activities started in 2022. In the  context of providing a common strong portfolio  to a wider target audience, ENISA will work with  CERT-EU in order to provide access to a self-paced  online learning platform that provides a variety  of high-quality training tracks adapted to specific  target audiences.  In particular:    Custom Technical Courses: building on the  activity in 2022, ENISA will work with CERT-EU  and the CSIRTs Network Training WG to enhance  training programs based on audience knowledge  level (e.g. elementary vs. advanced).    Self-paced online learning platform: based on  the experience gained via pilots, ENISA will offer  the platform also to EUBIAs and will leverage  the special relationship CERT-EU has with their  Objective Task Deliverable Lead Work  Program 2023  1.

Furthermore the option to  have custom trainings developed on demand will  be explored.    Technical, Specialised Workshops for CERT- EU constituents: CERT-EU will further develop  technical, specialised workshops, leveraging,  where relevant, the experience and working  practice of ENISA.    Regular ENISA Cyber Security Exercises:  this is an ongoing activity led by ENISA, which  materialises in several types of exercises involving  different stakeholders. Through the structured  cooperation, CERT-EU will be involved not only  as participant in relevant exercises but also as  a valuable planner for selected exercises (e.g.  Cyber Europe). In this context CERT-EU’s familiarity  with the EU Agencies and their expertise with  actual and relevant threats is very valuable.    Joint Cyber Security Exercise: When relevant  and in reference to the structured operational  cooperation, both parties will join efforts to  participate in exercises under the capacity of  planners and training audience. In addition,  common operational activities, e.g. Joint Rapid  Reports, will be evaluated through these  occasions.  ENISA will be collaborating closely  with CERT-EU in order to find the most relevant  17 EU-JCAR implements a legal obligation under Article 7(6) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) and it has been drafted by  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions and bodies (CERT-EU)  and the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) with contribution from European Commission DG CONNECT Cyber Coordination Task Force  as well as of the European External Action Service.  topics for these exercises (based on real threats  and attacks observed by CERT-EU), using the long  experience on running complex exercises with  various stakeholders at the highest standards.  In 2023 the lessons learned from the pilot  execution in 2022 will be applied and this will  result in an improved experience.  OPERATIONAL COOPERATION  Cyber Crisis Management Coordination  and Common Situational Awareness  2022 has been a special year for Operational  Cooperation pillars within the ENISA and CERT-EU  Structured Cooperation (SC). Building on the SC, the  two organisations teamed up to provide a continuous  situational picture of cyber threats, related to the UA- RU conflict. In order to respond more effectively and  share a common situation picture, ENISA and CERT- EU take part in a special task force (Interinstitutional  Task Force) organised by the European Commission  and European External Action Service.  In addition,2022 saw the launch of the Joint  Cyber Assessment Report (EU JCAR)17 as well the  establishment of the Joint Rapid Report (JRR) services.  ADOPTED SINGLE PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2023–2025 111  As part of the efforts of further development of  the procedures for EU and EUIBAs Cyber Crisis  Management coordination, ENISA and CERT-EU  will further align actions on developing Standard  Operating Procedures (SOP) with particular focus on  procedures to be adopted within the Interinstitutional  Task Force and further build-on and improving  Common Situational Awareness.  The target for 2023 is to further expand on the  cooperation activities started with the ACP2022.  In particular    EUIBAs SOP for the Cyber Crisis Management  stakeholders: ENISA and CERT-EU will focus  on finalising the EUIBAs SOP document and  seek adoption within the Inter-institutional  Task Force. EUIBAs SOP to be tested through  exercise and in synergies with EU Cyber Crisis  Management exercises.    Security Incident Response – Continuous  Improvement: CERT-EU will leverage the  aforementioned work in SOPs, lessons learnt in  significant incidents and the proceedings on the  information exchange domain with ENISA and the  other Blueprint stakeholders to review and update  its Technical SOPs – Security Incident Response  (SIR) process.  18  Cyber security events or incidents significantly affecting or potentially significantly affecting EU Member States, critical sectors within  the meaning of the NISD or ICT technologies, services, platforms or ICT infrastructures widely applied and used across the internal market. 19 Delivery of services is expected in December 2022.    Common situational awareness: With the 2022  activities both organisations have worked towards  the establishment of a mechanism for information  exchange at EU level, as well set the stage for  joint reports to raise awareness on significant  cyber security events18. Within the 2023 activity  ENISA and CERT-EU will further operationalize  the mechanism, seeking additional opportunity  for joint reports and assessments, as well using  exercises to enhance the production of situational  awareness deliverables.  The Joint Rapid Report (JRR) service will be continue  and further improved. EU-JCAR service is planned to  be operational in 2023.  MUTUAL ASSISTANCE  As stated in Article 7 of the Cybersecurity act, ENISA  shall assist, at the request of one or more Member  States, in assessing incidents having a significant or  substantial impact within the meaning of Directive  (EU) 2016/1148 through the provision of expertise,  in facilitating the technical handling of such incidents  and in providing support in relation to ex-post  technical inquiries regarding such incidents.  In 2022 ENISA has further refined the mechanism  and delivered its first assistance to a requiring  party19. Additionally, EC’s DG CONNECT has  Objective Task Deliverable Lead Work Program 2023  1.

The 2023 proposed plan aligns and build-on the work  done in 2022, and focuses on further enhancing  and operationalizing the cyber security assistance  mechanism. In particular:    Cyber Security Assistance Mechanism: ENISA  will build-on the mechanism to deliver on the  Cyber Security Support Action program. Due to  this, the focus on the assistance mechanism will  be primarily set on expanding it and pilot the use  of EU and EUIBAs resources as service fulfilment.    Operational capability to assist EUIBAs:  CERT-EU will continue managing the pool  of EUIBA experts and further enhance its  operational capability.  KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION  SHARING  Knowledge and information are a horizontal activity  that nurtures and sustains the previous two pillars as  well as getting input from these.  20 Letter of intent between DG CONNECT and ENISA on the provision of support to Member States to further mitigate the risks of large  scale cybersecurity incidents in the short term - Ares(2022)5946722 21 Cybersecurity Support Action program. 22  ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges and ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group  on Cyber Threat Landscapes.  As outlined in Article 9.b of the CSA, ENISA performs  long-term strategic analyses of cyber threats and  incidents in order to identify emerging trends and  help prevent incidents. One of the activities in this  field is the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) which  provides an overview of threats, together with current  and emerging trends. It is based on publicly available  or voluntarily shared information data and provides  an independent view on observed threats, threat  agents and threat trends. CERT-EU is an important  and structural contributor to the ETL and related  activities and will remain so through 2023.  ENISA is leading long-term strategic analyses also  through maintaining and collaborating with a working  group of experts on foresight for emerging and future  cybersecurity challenges and cyber threat landscape22.  In 2023 CERT-EU, through the inclusion as an observer  in these ENISA working groups, will contribute, review  and validate the findings and generally enhance  the outputs created from those groups. Those  activities refer to Activity 8 - Knowledge on emerging  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities of ENISA  Work Program 2023.

The Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) states that ‘ENISA shall facilitate the  establishment and take-up of European and international standards for risk management and  for the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes’. (Article 8.5)  This analysis is intended to contribute to the achievement of this goal. It is based on a compiled,  comprehensive inventory of standards in the area of cybersecurity risk management and  methodologies related to standards. This publication provides guidance to EU Institutions,  bodies and agencies on the availability of standards and methodologies relevant to the  management of cybersecurity risk and outlines possible gaps in these domains, enabling the  relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies to initiate activities to close these gaps in order to  further implement the cybersecurity policies stemming from the legislation.  Furthermore, this publication can also be used by organisations as a library of risk management  standards and methodologies for their endeavour to implement risk management within their  organisation or in their developments of cybersecurity certification schemes.  Standards are developed and defined through a process of sharing knowledge and building  consensus among technical experts nominated by interested parties and other stakeholders.  When it comes to developing and establishing standards, a large variety of players exist.  Naturally, there is competition between these players but they also cooperate in many  instances, in particular when there is a common interest.  Standards are voluntary which means that there is no automatic legal obligation to apply them.  However, laws and regulations may refer to standards and even make compliance with them  compulsory. This document aims also at providing a brief introduction to the main players when  it comes to standards in the area of risk management, introducing the main characteristics of  the different document types published by these players, and introducing the inventory of Risk  Management Standards presented in the Annex A.  To help this targeted audience in understanding the risk management process and its  associated standards, this document is structured in chapters that cover the relevant areas.  Based on the analysis provided in section 5 and making a distinction between risk management  standards and risk management methodologies, we propose in section 6 a series of  recommendations on the use of risk management standards for various groups of stakeholders  – EU decision makers, European SDOs, and ENISA itself.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT  The purpose of this document is to provide a coherent overview of published standards that  address aspects of risk management and subsequently list methodologies and tools that can  be used to conform with or implement these standards.  This publication will provide guidance to EU institutions, bodies and agencies on the  availability of standards and methodologies relevant to risk management and outline possible  gaps in this domain, enabling the relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies to initiate  activities to close these gaps.  Furthermore, this publication can also be used by organisations as a library of risk  management standards and methodologies for their endeavour to implement risk  management within their organisations or develop cybersecurity certification schemes for ICT  products, services and processes.  The list of applicable risk management standards and the associated gap analysis provided in  this document will be some key inputs in providing content and support in a relevant  cybersecurity policy area related to risk management as described in the Cybersecurity Act,  Article 8, point 5:  “ENISA shall facilitate the establishment and take-up of European and international standards  for risk management and for the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes”.  This document also targets critical sectors as defined in the Annex II of the NIS Directive1:  Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial market infrastructures, the Health sector, Drinking  water supply and distribution, and Digital Infrastructure.  1.2 EU LEGAL REQUIREMENTS  European institutions, bodies and agencies have released several publications – including  regulations and directives – concerning the concept of risk management.  These publications are not limited to the classical domain of ICT but also cover transversal or  sectorial domains (e.g. maritime, automotive, space, energy, healthcare) with their underlying  information security and cybersecurity.  The concept of risk related to the security of ICT infrastructure was initially defined in the first  cyber security legislation: The NIS directive - The Network Information Security Directive -  Directive 2016/1148.  The directive has placed several legal obligations on ICT security and has also provided a clear  definition of how risk is defined in in the context of this directive.  Article 4 (definitions) point (9): ‘risk’ means any reasonably identifiable circumstance or  event having a potential adverse effect on the security of network and information  systems.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a  high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.  Risk Management  is all about  identifying and  protecting the  valuable assets of  an organisation.  Risk management  procedures are  fundamental  processes to  prepare  organisations for a  future  cybersecurity  attack, to evaluate  products and  services for their  resistance to  potential attacks  before placing  them on the  market, and to  prevent supply  chain fraud.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  6  The NIS directive can be considered as the origin of any EU requirement regarding risk  management within the ICT domain.  The table here below provides the references on risk management included in the NIS directive.  Table 1: References on risk management in the NIS directive  Article  Point Text  Recital Point 4 ‘Building upon the significant progress within the European Forum  of Member States in fostering discussions and exchanges on  good policy practices, including the development of principles for  European cyber-crisis cooperation, a Cooperation Group,  composed of representatives of Member States, the Commission,  and the European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security (‘ENISA’), should be established to support and facilitate  strategic cooperation between the Member States regarding the  security of network and information systems. For that group to be  effective and inclusive, it is essential that all Member States have  minimum capabilities and a strategy ensuring a high level of  security of network and information systems in their territory. In  addition, security and notification requirements should apply to  operators of essential services and to digital service  providers to promote a culture of risk management and  ensure that the most serious incidents are reported.’  Recital  Point 44 ‘Responsibilities in ensuring the security of network and  information systems lie, to a great extent, with operators of  essential services and digital service providers. A culture of risk  management, involving risk assessment and the  implementation of security measures appropriate to the risks  faced, should be promoted and developed through  appropriate regulatory requirements and voluntary industry  practices. Establishing a trustworthy level playing field is also  essential to the effective functioning of the Cooperation Group  and the CSIRTs network, to ensure effective cooperation from all  Member States.’  Recital Point 46 ‘Risk-management measures include measures to identify  any risks of incidents, to prevent, detect and handle  incidents and to mitigate their impact. The security of network  and information systems comprises the security of stored,  transmitted and processed data.’  Article 7 7,f ‘Each Member State shall adopt a national strategy on the  security of network and information systems defining the strategic  objectives and appropriate policy and regulatory measures with a  view to achieving and maintaining a high level of security of  network and information systems and covering at least the  sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in  Annex III. The national strategy on the security of network and  information systems shall address, in particular, the following  issues:  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  7  7, f) a risk assessment plan to identify risks.’  Regarding the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, the crucial EU legal  requirements are presented in the Cybersecurity Act Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2019/881  (CSA regulation).  Table 2: References on risk management in the CSA  CSA items Cybersecurity Act Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2019/881  Risk management  as a tool for  cybersecurity  vulnerability  management and  remediation  Recital point (11) Modern ICT products and systems often integrate and rely on one or  more third-party technologies and components such as software modules, libraries, or  application programming interfaces. This reliance, which is referred to as a ‘dependency’,  could pose additional cybersecurity risks as vulnerabilities found in third-party components  could also affect the security of the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. In  many cases, identifying and documenting such dependencies enables end users of  ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes to improve their cybersecurity risk  management activities by improving, for example, users’ cybersecurity vulnerability  management and remediation procedures.  Importance of  European and  international risk  management  standards and  methods  Recital (49) Efficient cybersecurity policies should be based on well-developed risk  assessment methods, in both the public and private sectors. Risk assessment methods  are used at different levels, with no common practice regarding how to apply them  efficiently. Promoting and developing best practices for risk assessment and for  interoperable risk management solutions in public-sector and private-sector organisations  will increase the level of cybersecurity in the Union. To that end, ENISA should support  cooperation between stakeholders at Union level and facilitate their efforts relating  to the establishment and take-up of European and international standards for risk  management and for the measurable security of electronic products, systems,  networks and services which, together with software, comprise the network and  information systems.  Creating the link  between the ICT  risk management  from the NIS  directive and the  CSA regulation  Article 5: Development and implementation of Union policy and law  ENISA shall contribute to the development and implementation of Union policy and law, by:  (2) assisting Member States to implement the Union policy and law regarding cybersecurity  consistently, in particular in relation to Directive (EU) 2016/1148, including by means  of issuing opinions, guidelines, providing advice and best practices on topics such  as risk management, incident reporting and information sharing, as well as by facilitating  the exchange of best practices between competent authorities in that regard.

ENISA shall facilitate the establishment and take-up of European and  international standards for risk management and for the security of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes.  The next table provides a non-exhaustive list of existing EU legislative acts (transversal or  sectorial) where the concept of risk or risk management for information security or cybersecurity  aspects is included:  Table 3: non-exhaustive list of existing EU legislation texts containing risk management  CSA Cybersecurity Act Regulation- Regulation (EU) 2019/881  NIS Network Information Security Directive - Directive 2016/1148  eIDAS Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions -  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  8  Regulation (EU) No 910/2014  GDPR General Data Protection Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2016/679  PSD2 Directive on payment services in the internal market – Directive (EU) 2015/2366  AML Anti-Money Laundering Directive - Directive (EU) 2015/849  RED Radio Equipment Directive- Directive 2014/53/EU (RED)  In Annex B an example of how ICT risk and risk management are addressed in the existing  eIDAS regulation (Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions –  Regulation (EU) No 910/2014) is presented.

SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS  2.1 SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS  The Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) states that ‘ENISA shall facilitate the  establishment and take-up of European and international standards for risk management  and for the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes’. (Article 8 no. 5)  This analysis is intended to contribute to the achievement of this goal. It is based on a compiled  and comprehensive inventory of standards (Annex A) in the area of cybersecurity risk  management and methodologies related to standards. Special attention is given to the analysis  of gaps and overlaps of the available standards.  The analysis aims to identify practical ways to apply these standards by different stakeholders,  compiling guidelines and good practices.  2.2 NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDERS IN RELATION TO RISK MANAGEMENT  More and more organisations understand that cybersecurity and information security risks have  to be managed because corresponding threats can have substantial consequences to the  organisation or even threaten its existence.  As stated in the introduction, this publication shall provide guidance to EU institutions, bodies  and agencies, as well as to various organisations, to be used as a library of risk management  standards and methodologies for their endeavour to implement risk management processes.  Many of these stakeholders are looking for advice on which standards or methodologies are  suitable for their organisation. Small companies are often overwhelmed by what is offered in the  market and find choosing suitable methods difficult. This paper also presents methodologies for  small companies (e.g. OCTAVE-S). When implemented, risk management approaches are  influenced by the sector in which the organisation does its business. There are sector-specific  risk management standards and methodologies that take into account the related specifics.  2.3 DEFINITIONS  2.3.1 Risk management  Risk  There are two slightly different definitions within documents published by the ISO and the IEC  that are relevant for risk management. These are listed for comparison in the following table.  Table 6: Comparison of risk definitions in ISO standards and directives  Effect of uncertainty on objectives Effect on uncertainty  [SOURCE: ISO 31000:2018]  [SOURCE: ISO/IEC 27000:2018]  [SOURCE:  ISO Directives, Part 1, Annex SL,  Appendix 2]  Note 1: an effect is a deviation from the  expected. Certain organisations consider  positive deviations in addition to negative  Note 1 to entry: an effect is a deviation from  the expected — positive or negative.  Note 2 to entry: uncertainty is the state, even  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  11  deviations in the risk context.  Note 2: risk is usually expressed in terms of  risk sources, potential events, their  consequences and their likelihood.  Note 3: uncertainty is the state, even partial,  of deficiency of information related to  understanding or knowledge of an event, its  consequence, or likelihood.  Note 4: objectives are not only but often are  related to business, organisation or projects.  Another level of objectives is presented in  section 3.1.  partial, of deficiency of information related to  understanding or knowledge of an event, its  consequence, or likelihood.  Note 3 to entry: risk is often characterised by  reference to potential events (as defined in  ISO Guide 73) and consequences (as  defined in ISO Guide 73) or a combination of  these.  Note 4 to entry: risk is often expressed in  terms of a combination of the consequences  of an event (including changes in  circumstances) and the associated likelihood  (as defined in ISO Guide 73) of occurrence.  As stated in the comparison table above, there are slightly diverging definitions of risk within the  ISO domain. These definitions diverge depending on whether a risk is connected to a defined  objective (ISO 31000) or not. In the context of a management system standard, such as ISO/IEC  27001, risks can arise regardless of whether objectives have been set in advance.  ISO/IEC 27000:2018 contains the definition of ISO 31000:2018 because the ISO 31000 definition  is referenced in ISO/IEC 27005.  For ISO/IEC 27001, the definition of Annex SL is relevant, as ISO/IEC 27001 has to follow the  text of the ISO Directives.  For example, the sector-specific standard ISO/SAE 21434:2021 follows the definition on the right- hand side of the table, that risk is the ‘effect on uncertainty on road vehicle cybersecurity’.  In Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (‘NIS Directive’) there is a different definition of risk. Article 4 states  that risk is ‘any reasonably identifiable circumstance or event having a potential adverse effect on  the security of network and information systems’. Compared with the definitions given by ISO  standards and directives the focus here is on the threat component in relation to the  source of  risk not to the effect. Cf.

[SOURCE: ISO Guide 73:2009]  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  12  Note: risk treatment can be carried out using different options, e.g. avoiding the risk or changing  the likelihood (of events or consequences).  2.3.2 Standards and methodologies  What is a standard?  A standard is a document generally established by consensus and approved by a recognised  body that provides rules or guidance on the design, use or performance of materials, products,  technologies, processes, services, systems or persons.  Standards can be developed by national, regional and international standards developing  organisations2 (e.g. ISO, IEC, CEN, ETSI, DIN).They can also be developed by consortia of  businesses to address a specific marketplace need or by government departments to support  regulations. Not every standard is called a ‘standard’. For example, another common name used  is Technical Specification. In this case, as a rule, a qualified majority may also be sufficient for  the adoption of the document.  A more extensive description of standard developing organisations and their deliverables is  provided in chapter number 4.1. of this document (section 4.1.1.)  What is a methodology?  A methodology is a set of principles and methods (at least one) adhering to good practices used  to perform a particular activity. It’s a coherent and logical scheme that guides the choices users  of the methodology make.  What is the relation between standards and methodologies?  Some methodologies are (published as) standards and some standards include methodologies.  Option 1: Methodology is used to achieve conformance to a standard (with reference in part or in  whole to a certain standard and its requirements).  Option 2: Methodology is given as a standard and can be used to achieve conformance to a  standard and its requirements.  Option 3: Methodology is a set of good practices but not related to any standard and not used to  achieve conformance.  2 Abbreviation: SDO  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  13  A methodology clarifies how certain issues should be handled. The methodology is often defined  through test-specifications related to a standard. If a methodology is given as a standard the same  is true. Moreover there are also many standards which focus on what to do and not how to do  (mainly requirements standards).  Table 7: Examples of methodologies, which are published as standards  ISO 13053-1:2011 Quantitative methods in process improvement — Six Sigma — Part 1:  DMAIC methodology  ISO/IEC  18045:2008  Information technology — Security techniques — Methodology for IT  security evaluation  ETSI TS 102 165- 1:2017  CYBER —  Methods and protocols —  Part 1: Method and pro forma  for Threat, Vulnerability, Risk Analysis (TVRA)  2.3.3 Risk management vocabulary  The vocabulary of risk management is often different between standards and methodologies. It  can be observed that the definitions of terms used in well-known ISO standards and guides (Table  8) are quite similar while there are clear differences in other standards (e.g. in Table 9). ISO  definitions are compact while others are more extensive. The definition of risk acceptance is  missing in NIST and BSI Germany.  Table 8: Examples of risk management terms in ISO standards and guides  Term ISO 31000  (2018)  ISO/IEC DIS  27005 (2021)  ISO Guide 73  (2009)  risk management coordinated activities  to direct and control  an organisation with  regard to risk  --- coordinated activities  to direct and control  an organisation with  regard to risk  risk assessment overall process of  risk identification, risk  analysis and risk  evaluation  overall process of  risk identification,  risk analysis and  risk evaluation  overall process of  risk identification,  risk analysis and risk  evaluation  risk acceptance  retaining the risk by  informed decision  informed decision to  take a particular risk  informed decision to  take a particular risk  Table 9: Examples of risk management terms in some other standards  Term NIST SP 800-39  (2011)  BSI Germany Standard 200-3  risk  management  process that requires  organisations to:  (i) frame risk;  (ii) assess risk;  (iii) respond to risk; and  (iv) monitor risk.  consists of the following steps: risk  assessment; risk evaluation;  determination of safeguards for treating  risks; comparison between the costs of  every safeguard and the damage to be  expected and decision in favour of or  against the implementation of the  safeguard; examination of the residual  risks: definition of handling options;  comparison with opportunities;  monitoring of the risks and adjustment  of the safeguards or handling options  during live operation.

Risk management consists of the following steps:  1. Identification of threats  In this phase the various threats or threat models are identified according to different methods.  For example, the assets to be protected are listed according to the risk management policy and  the relevant potential threats are listed. Threat identification can also be done according to other  methods such as the identification of vulnerabilities or threat models. Standards can provide a  checklist to help with identifying different assets, threats or vulnerabilities consistent with  particular regulations (for example NIS or GDPR).  2. Evaluation of threats  The different threats are evaluated according to different sources. For example, cyber threat  intelligence (CTI) can be used or standards on the ontology and terminology of threats.  Standards can provide guidance on threat selection according to the security profile selected.  3. Evaluation of risk  The risk evaluation process is key to defining how to use the scale of threats, impacts, likelihood  and occurrence parameters in order to prioritise different threats. Here, standards are of strong  interest.  4. Mitigation of risk  Risk mitigation is the answer you will put in place in order to handle the risks identified. Risk management standards  like ISO/IEC 27005 or EN 303 645 are helpful examples.  5. Evaluation and assessment of risk controls  In this last step we will evaluate implemented security controls, check their efficiency and  assess the mitigation of security risk.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  15  2.4.2 ICT Products certification  A well-known framework for evaluating and certifying ICT products, which also became an  international standard is Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation3. EN  ISO/IEC 15408 establishes the concepts, principles and techniques for IT security evaluation.  The standard consists of three parts: the EN ISO/IEC 15408-1:20204 that introduces the general  concepts and model, the EN ISO/IEC 15408-2:20201 that includes the security functional  components and the EN ISO/IEC 15408-3:20201 that describes the security assurance  components.  ISO/IEC 18045:20201 is a companion standard for the ISO/IEC 15408 family and provides a  methodology to help an IT security evaluator to conduct a CC evaluation by defining the minimal  actions to be performed.  The IT Security of ICT products is concerned with the protection of assets. Assets according to  EN ISO/IEC 15408-1:2020 include the integrity of the contents of a database, the availability of  an electronic workflow, the authenticity of requests received by a webserver. The information of  many assets is stored, processed and transmitted by ICT products to meet the requirements  specified by the owner of the information.  Due to the CC security concept the information owner who wishes to minimise the risk to an  asset is exposed by imposing countermeasures. The selection of countermeasures depends on  the threats identified for the asset, consideration of the likelihood of the threat being realised  and the impact on the asset when a threat is realised. CC distinguishes between IT  countermeasures and non-IT countermeasures.  An example of a sector-specific standard for risk management of assets is EN ISO 14971:2019  Medical devices — Application of risk management to medical devices.  To become a CC evaluation body it is necessary to conform to the requirements written in EN  ISO/IEC 17025:2017. ISO/IEC 17000-series (17000:2020, 17020:2012, 17021:2015,  17024:2012, 17025:2017 and 17067:2013) is an international set of standards that mainly  provides from general concepts and principles for Conformity Assessment (CA) to guidelines,  good practices and requirements for bodies serving as certification authorities.  2.4.3 Management system certification  There are several international standards defining requirements for the certification of  management systems. The list includes:  • ISO 28000:2009: Specification for security management systems for the supply chain;  3 Common Criteria is abbreviated to CC.  4 A new edition is available as DIS.  An ICT product means an element or a group of elements of a network or information  system.  Definition from EU Cybersecurity Act  An ICT service means a service consisting fully or mainly in the transmission, storing,  retrieving or processing of information by means of network and information systems.  An ICT process means a set of activities performed to design, develop, deliver or maintain an  ICT product or ICT service.  Definition from EU Cybersecurity Act  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  16  • ISO 45001:2018 Occupational health and safety management systems; requirements  with guidance for use;  • EN ISO 50001:2018 which specifies requirements for establishing, implementing,  maintaining and improving an energy management system (EnMS);  • ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 Information technology — Service management — Part 1:  Service management system requirements;  • EN ISO/IEC 27001: 2017 Information technology - Security techniques - Information  security management systems5 – Requirements.  If an organisation intends to certify an ICT service or an ICT process or a group of these (called  ‘entity’ as of now), then it is suitable to define this entity as the scope of its management system.  On this basis, ICT services or ICT processes can be certified by assessing their conformity to  the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000 or EN ISO/IEC 27001.  When an organisation intends to achieve conformance with the requirements of a management  system standard such as EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017, the requirements addressing risk  management can be found in these clauses:  • 6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities  • 8.2 Information security risk assessment  • 8.3 Information security risk mitigation.  Whereas sub-clause 6.1.1 addresses high-level risks such as management system risks and  strategic risks, the sub-clauses 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 specify requirements regarding the management  of risk for the security of operational information.  ISO/IEC 27005 (Information security risk management) offers closely aligned support for  implementing the requirements for risk management in entities within the scope of the ISMS.  Furthermore, among others, the following standards are helpful:  • ISO 31000 – Risk management guidelines (general perspective)  • BSI 7799-3 –  Guidelines for information security risk management  • NIST SP 800-39 –  Managing Information Security Risk  • BSI Germany Standard 200-3 - Risk analysis based on IT-Grundschutz  Examples of sector-specific standards for risk management in the context of a management  system are:  • BS 31111:2018 Cyber risk and resilience: Guidance for the governing body and  executive management services (also useful for ICT product certification);  • ISO/FDIS 23314-2 Ships and marine technology — Ballast water management  systems (BWMS) — Part 2: Risk assessment and risk reduction of BWMS using  electrolytic methods;  • ASTM F3449-2 Standard Guide for Inclusion of Cyber Risks into Maritime Safety  Management Systems and services in Accordance with IMO Resolution MSC.428(98)- Cyber Risks and Challenges.  Conformance to ISO/IEC 27001 can be confirmed by certification bodies, which are accredited  in conformity with the families of standards ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006.  5 abbreviation: ISMS  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  17  3. BASELINE ANALYSIS  3.1 OBJECTIVES OF RISK MANAGEMENT  The main objective of risk management within an organisation is to determine possible  uncertainties or threats, to protect against resulting consequences and to permit the  achievement of business objectives.  The objectives of risk management can be derived from the overall objectives of the  organisation, its business and legal obligations.  These objectives must be clearly defined at the beginning of the risk management process.  These objectives must also be measurable in order to be able to verify their achievements. The  use of KPIs (key performance indicators) is recommended. The objectives must be related to  the assets of the entity that are to be protected against risks and their consequences.  These objectives are determined during the establishment of the context of a risk management  process (see Clause 3.3. Risk management process).  3.2 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  The risk management process is the individual way in which an organisation addresses the  concept of risk and the relevant types of risk within itself. The risk management process is a  fundamental part of any organisation and has to be integrated into all relevant (business)  processes and activities, and if necessary – based on the type and nature of the business of the  organisation – on several layers.  If an organisation wants to achieve conformance with a management system standard (type A)  based on the ISO Directives, Annex SL, Appendix 2, the risk management process is one of the  fundamental and essential processes within the organisation within the scope of the  management system. Nevertheless, ISO 31000:2018 does not give guidance on a risk  management system but describes a risk management framework. EN ISO/IEC 27001:2018 is a  management system standard based on the Harmonised Framework and requires a risk  management process in clauses 6.1, 8.2 and 8.3.  Risk management may address individual types of risks, such as enterprise risk, market risk,  credit risk, operational risk, project risk, development risk, supply chain risk, infrastructure risk,  component risks or several of the risk types listed or all of them. This list is not exhaustive and  depending on the type of business an organisation has, additional types of risks may exist and  be of relevance.  In the context of this document which addresses cybersecurity and information security, these  types of risks have to be assessed in conjunction with the three properties of information  security – confidentiality, integrity and availability. For example, what consequences may arise  for market risk from a loss of integrity, or what consequences may arise for supply chain risk  from a loss of confidentiality, and so on?.  In the context of this document, the elements of the risk management process contained in ISO  31000:2018 will be applied to describe a possible implementation of a risk management  process within an organisation. Independent of the organisation’s actual implementation of its  risk management process, all activities outlined in ISO 31000:2018 will be more or less present,  independently of whether such a risk management process is integrated into an organisation  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  18  seeking conformance with EN ISO/IEC 27001:2018 or any other ISO management system  standard.  Scope, Context, Criteria  When establishing risk management within an organisation, the fundamental decisions  regarding the risk management process itself are made during the determination of the scope,  the context and the criteria.  Based on the scope of the risk management, different sub-processes using several risk  assessment methodologies may be applied within an organisation.  The scope may be derived from:  • the relevant internal and external interested parties;  • its level of application (strategic, operational, programme, project, supply-chain,  product development, software development);  • its inclusion into a formal management system;  • its relationships to other organisations, entities, activities, projects, processes;  • its objectives;  • the available resources (personnel, software tools, etc.)6.  6This list is not exhaustive.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  19  Risk management addressing information security or cybersecurity may also involve different  application domains:  • critical infrastructure (health, electricity, communication etc.);  • sensitive data;  • supply chain.  When it comes to the context, this may depend on:  • the interested parties (external and internal),  • the objectives and activities of the organisation,  • the purpose of the risk management,  • the integration into an existing risk management framework or management system.  During the determination of the criteria in this early stage of establishing risk management, the  organisation, based on the previous results of determining the scope and the context, also  determines:  • the type of risk it is managing,  • the risk assessment methodology to apply,  • the criteria for evaluation the risks,  • the criteria for accepting risk.  Thereafter, the risk criteria as determined have significant consequences on the subsequent  activities of a risk management process, such as risk assessment and risk mitigation.  Risk assessment  Risk assessment is most commonly composed of threats identification, threats evaluation, risk  analysis and risk evaluation (see Figure 1).  Depending on the decisions taken during the scope, context and criteria activities, different  methodologies may be implemented for different types of risks and for different layers.  Threats identification is the activity of finding and describing threats systematically and should  consider the following factors:  • sources of risk,  • causes and events,  • threats and vulnerabilities,  • emerging risks and threats,  • nature and value of assets,  • consequences and impact on processes and assets7.  During risk analysis, the factors listed above are used to comprehend the nature and the level of  a threat or risk based on factors such as:  • the likelihood of an event, threat or risk;  • the magnitude of consequences triggered by an event, threat or risk;  • the complexity including possible links, dependencies and cascading effects;  7This list is not exhaustive.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  20  • the effectiveness of existing controls;  • time-related factors such as volatility or the period under consideration.  The results of the risk analysis provide the input to the risk evaluation in which the results from  the risk analysis are compared to the previously established risk criteria including the criteria for  the acceptance of risk. These results may be calculated based on criteria for consequence and  likelihood, or by using other means such a heat maps or tables.  Risk treatment  Risk treatment (as defined in, among others, ISO 31000) is the activity of selecting an adequate  option for treating risks that are above a previously defined acceptable risk level.  These options are:  • avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to  the risk;  • taking or increasing the risk in order to pursue an opportunity;  • mitigating the source of the risk;  • changing the likelihood;  • changing the impacts and consequences;  • sharing the risk (e.g. through contracts, buying insurance);  • retaining the risk through an informed decision.8  The selected risk treatment option must be approved by the risk owner and documented. Based  on this decision, a risk treatment plan shall be formulated and approved by the risk owner, and  implemented according to the project plan included in the risk treatment plan.  A risk treatment plan and the newly introduced controls may result in new risks or threats that  need to be addressed separately.  The other elements of Figure 1 (Communication and Consultation, Recording and Reporting,  Monitoring and Review) are, in the context of this document, considered not to be part of the  risk management process but rather established parts of a management system based on an  ISO management system standard and are therefore not covered in this document.  Note: risk treatment that deals with negative consequences is sometimes referred to as risk  mitigation’.  3.3 USE OF STANDARDS IN RISK MANAGEMENT  When integrating the concept of risk management into its organisation, an entity is looking for  appropriate approaches that are adequate for their business and the scope and the objective of  their risk management efforts.  Organisations may decide that they need an overall enterprise risk management to address all  types of risks (such as operational risk, market risks, supply chain risks, project risks or strategic  risks) or just a specific type of risk (see examples of risks previously stated).  For these different scopes and objects, and specific to the organisations’ main business  activities, different risk assessment and treatment models may be used.  8This list is from ISO 31000: 2018, Clause 6.5.2  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  21  Thus, organisations may wish to learn from other organisations in their field of business and try  to establish approaches to best practices that seem to fit them and others in their discipline or  field of activities.  Based on this goal, it is common to find that risk assessment or risk treatment models for  specific sectors or businesses are developed by sector associations or interest groups. Many  times, these sector or discipline-specific models evolve into international standards by  forwarding their results to the technical committee of an international or European  standardisation organisation.  Being considered as a standard by an international community of experts and thereby gaining  wider attention and improvement, enables additional organisations to find adequate solutions to  fulfil their needs regarding the assessment and treatment of risks.  Such standards can provide generic guidance on terminology, principles, process models and  treatment options (e.g. ISO 31000) as well as detailed descriptions of risk assessment models  (e.g. ISO/IEC 31010, ISO/IEC 27005).  Applying these different standards at different levels of an organisation can enhance the  reproducibility of results, enable the comparison of different organisations and support the  evaluation of the processes involved and their results within an organisation. Applying the same  standard within a discipline or sector also provides the ability to benchmark one organisation  against another or against an average for a sector or an entire discipline.  Standards, in principle, also enable organisations to estimate and compare the suitability, the  effectiveness, the efficiency and the coverage of individual models and methods for a specific  sector or discipline of a business and thereby support organisations in choosing an adequate  standard for integration into their organisation.  Not only standards that especially address and describe risk assessment and risk treatment  methods are important for the integration of the concept of risk management into an  organisation. Widely accepted management system standards, such as ISO 9001 (Quality  management system), ISO 14001 (Environmental management system) and ISO/IEC 27001  (Information security management system), have the concept of risk awareness integrated in  their requirements and thus mandate the concept of risk management should an organisation  claim conformance to these management system standards.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  22  4. STANDARDS AND  METHODOLOGIES  4.1 RISK ASSESSMENT STANDARDS  Standards are developed and defined through a process of sharing knowledge and building  consensus among technical experts nominated by interested parties and other stakeholders.  When it comes to developing and establishing standards, there is a large variety of players.  Naturally, there is competition between these players but they also cooperate in many  instances, in particular when there is a common interest.  Standards are voluntary which means that there is no automatic legal obligation to apply them.  However, laws and regulations may refer to standards and even make compliance with them  compulsory.  The following sections:  • provide a brief introduction to the main players when it comes to standards in the area  of risk management;  • introduce the main characteristics of the different document types published by these  players;  • introduce the inventory of risk management standards as presented in Annex A of this  document.  4.1.1 European SDOs (ESOs) and European Standards  European Standards (ENs) are documents that have been ratified by one of the three European  Standardisation Organisations (ESOs), CEN, CENELEC or ETSI, and are recognised as  competent in the area of voluntary technical standardisation in accordance with EU Regulation  1025/2012.  • CEN, the European Committee for Standardization, reflects the economic and social  interests of 34 CEN Member countries channelled through their national  standardisation organisations and provides a platform for the development of  European standards and other technical documents in relation to a wide range of fields  and sectors including air and space, consumer products, defence and security, energy,  health and safety, ICT, machinery, services, smart living, and transport.  • CENELEC is the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation and is  responsible for standardisation in the electro-technical engineering field.  • ETSI addresses the ICT domain with particular focus on the communications aspects  for connected devices and the networks that connect them.  A European Standard (EN) ‘carries with it the obligation to be implemented at national level by  being given the status of a national standard and by the withdrawal of any conflicting national  standard’. Therefore, a European Standard (EN) automatically becomes a national standard in  each of the 34 CEN-CENELEC member countries.  ESO deliverables also include the following.  • CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement (CWA): a CWA is a CEN-CENELEC  agreement, developed by a workshop, which reflects the agreement of identified  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  23  individuals and organisations responsible for its contents. A CWA does not have the  status of a European Standard and CEN-CENELEC national members are not obliged  to withdraw national standards in conflict with a CWA.  • ETSI Standard (ETSI ES) and ETSI Guide (ETSI EG) are ETSI deliverables adopted  after weighted voting by ETSI members.  • An ETSI Technical Specification (ETSI TS) and an ETSI Technical Report (ETSI TR)  are ETSI deliverables adopted by the responsible Technical Body.  Within the three European SDOs, CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 13 ‘Cybersecurity  and Data Protection’ (CEN-CLC JTC 13) has published several standards in the area of risk  management (see Annex A), most of them having been adopted from SC 27 publications.  ENISA maintains a strong liaison with JTC 13 and maintains regular contact.  4.1.2 International SDOs and Standards  An International Standard (IS) is a document that has been developed through the consensus of  experts from many countries and has been approved and published by one of the globally  recognised international SDOs:  ISO: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent  international organisation, with a membership of 165 national standards bodies, that  develops voluntary, consensus-based international standards. Within ISO, TC 292  provides a family of standards in the area of risk management (e.g. ISO 31000) while  most cybersecurity related activities take place within subcommittee SC 27 of Joint  (with IEC) Technical Committee 1 (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27). ENISA liaises with SC 27  and maintains regular contact.  • IEC: the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) develops international  standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies.  • ITU (the International Telecommunication Union): has a Study Group SG17 – Security  where areas of cybersecurity are discussed. Currently this SDO is relatively less  advanced in the field of cybersecurity and thus can be considered as a secondary  priority.  Deliverables also include:  • Technical Specifications: a Technical Specification (TS) developed by an international  SDO addresses work still under technical development, or where it is believed that it  will eventually be transformed and republished as an International Standard.  • Technical Reports: a Technical Report (TR) is more informal than an IS or TS; it may,  for example, include data from an informative report or information on the perceived  ‘state of the art’.  4.1.3 National standardisation bodies and specialised agencies  National standardisation bodies and specialised agencies in the EU are also directly  represented in the ESOs and, in many instances, their national publications eventually become  European Norms or International Standards. However, the inventory established in Annex A of  this document refers to several risk management standards available solely from national  standardisation bodies and specialised agencies. Examples of such bodies include the  following.  • BSI: the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany is a national cyber  security authority, promoting IT security in Germany and also developing cybersecurity  standards and guidelines. BSI standards and technical reports are available at no cost  from www.bsi.bund.de.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  24  • NIST: the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is part of the US  Department of Commerce. Its Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is one of six  research laboratories within NIST. ITL has seven divisions including the Applied  Cybersecurity Division (ACD) and the Computer Security Division (CSD), both  developing cybersecurity standards and guidelines. CSD publications include the Risk  Management Framework NIST SP 800-37. NIST standards and guidelines are  available at no cost from www.nist.gov.  • ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’information), the French  National Cybersecurity Agency has been involved in risk management methodology  and processes. In particular ANSSI has been promoting the EBIOS risk manager  methodology.  4.1.4 Industrial bodies  Industrial bodies and fora are not considered formally as SDOs; however, they offer de-facto  standards in certain areas including risk management. Where applicable, the output of industrial  bodies is included in the inventory established in Annex A of this document.  As an example, OASIS began as a consortium of vendors and users and today is a large non- profit standards organisation advancing projects for, among others, cybersecurity, blockchain,  IoT, emergency management, and cloud computing. OASIS often submits specifications  produced by its TCs to other standards bodies (e.g. ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU-T, ETSI) for additional  ratification.  In particular, the OASIS TC Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for  Cyber Security aims to create standards that implement the course of action playbook model for  cybersecurity operations.  A second example is the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Standards Association  (IEEE SA), an entity within IEEE that develops global standards in a broad range of areas. As  with OASIS, some IEEE specifications are submitted to ‘official’ SDOs for additional ratification,  such as IEEE/ISO/IEC 16085:2020 - Systems and software engineering - Life cycle processes -  Risk management.  Important work in the area of risk management is also undertaken by GSMA,  4.1.5 The Risk Management Standards Inventory  Annex A of this document provides an inventory of almost fifty identified standards which relate  to risk management. The documents are characterised by:  • document source, e.g. national standard, European standard, international standard;  • document type, e.g. standard, technical specification, technical report;  • document scope, e.g. risk management vocabulary and guides, risk management  requirements, risk management evaluation methodology.  The inventory also provides information about applicable technical domains, document history,  and relevancy to EU legislation.  The following standards in the inventory are considered most relevant for risk management in  the context of information and cybersecurity and are thus labelled ‘Risk management’ in column  E (document scope) of the table.  • ISO/IEC 27005 – Information security risk management  This document was developed using ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 and provides general  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  25  guidelines for information security risk management in an organisation without  promoting any specific risk management method.  • ISO 31000 – Risk management guidelines  This document was developed by ISO TC 292 and provides principles, a framework  and a process for managing risk from a general perspective. The Australian and New  Zealand version AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 is identical to and reproduced from ISO  31000:2009.  • BSI 7799-3 – Guidelines for information security risk management.  • NIST SP 800-39 – Managing Information Security Risk  This document developed by NIST provides guidance for an integrated, organisation- wide programme for managing information security risk to organisational operations.  • BSI Germany Standard 200-3 – Risk analysis based on IT-Grundschutz  This methodology developed by the German Federal Office for Information Security  demonstrates how the threats listed in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues can be used to  carry out a simplified analysis of risks for information processing.  4.1.6 Risk management methodologies and tools  The main goal of risk management is (in general) to protect ICT products (software, hardware,  systems, components, services) and business assets, and minimise costs in cases of failures.  Thus it represents a core duty for successful business or IT management. Hence, risk  management describes a key activity for security within organisations and it is essentially based  on the experience and knowledge of methods of best practice and the tools that can be used.  These methods consist of an estimation of the risk situation based on the business process  models and the infrastructure within the organisation. In this context, these models support the  identification of potential risks and the development of appropriate protective measures. The  major focus lies on companies and the identification, analysis and evaluation of threats to their  respective corporate values.  The outcome of a risk analysis is in most cases a list of risks or threats to a system, together  with the corresponding probabilities. International standards in the field of risk management are  used to support the identification of these risks or threats as well as to assess their respective  probabilities. These standards (see Annex A) range from general considerations and guidelines  for risk management processes to specific guidelines for the IT sector (all the way to highly  specific frameworks as, for example, in the maritime sector. Most of these standards specify  framework conditions for the process of risk management but rarely go into detail on specific  methods for the analysis or assessment of risk. This is one reason differences in the  assessment of risk often arise within specific areas of application, making a direct comparison of  the results difficult.  In practice, choosing the right method and the right tool for the analysis and evaluation of risk  proves to be complicated. In recent years, a number of concepts, algorithms and tools have  evolved from research, which have been especially designed to protect the ICT infrastructure  and related systems. Since their historical background is settled in a business context, in these  methods a quantitative risk assessment is usually performed based on monetary costs (e.g.  EBIOS method and the aforementioned ISO / IEC 27005:2013 standard). In this context, most  of the methods and tools just use the commonly known rule of thumb ‘risk = probability x  potential damage’. Depending on the applied method, the terms and scales for the assessment  of the probabilities as well as the potential damage are predefined (such as in the NIST policy or  in the Mehari method).  In order to structure the process of risk assessment, various attempts have been made to use a  Bayesian approach for determining threat probabilities. For example the OCTAVE method is  based on subjectively estimated probabilities and thus can be understood as an apriori  distribution with regards to the Bayesian approach. The OCTAVE method uses UML as a  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  26  modelling language and represents a comprehensive collection of tools and best practice  methods for risk management. The ‘BowTie’ is a traditional widely used qualitative risk analysis  method. The CORAS method allows the integration of several different risk assessment  processes, whereas the identification of the probability of an attack is not done automatically but  apriori to any risk assessment.  Contrary to the aforementioned general and IT-specific guidelines for risk management, security  and risk management in various sectors emphasise different aspects in the RM methods. For  example, the maritime sector traditionally lays a big emphasis on physical and object security. In  particular, the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code define a set of  measures to enhance the security of port facilities and ships. It is only this year that IMO  published RM guidelines for the cyber assets of ships.  A sole focus on physical security is not sufficient any more in any sector due to the digitalisation  and security of the cyber-physical systems becoming equally important. Thus RM need to cover  all aspects. In this section we will present the main RM methodologies in terms of their main  characteristics, usability, resources needed, standards applies and implementation aspects  (supported by tools).  As explained in section 2.3, there are three options for the risk management analysis of  methodologies.  Option 1: Methodology is used to achieve conformance to a standard (referencing in part  or in whole to a certain standard and its requirements).  Expression des Besoins et Identification des Objectifs de Sécurité (EBIOS) Risk Manager  EBIOS Risk Manager is an information security risk management method, created under the  French General Secretariat of National Defence, consistent with ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC  27005, and enables the risk management requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 to be met.  • It allows to:  o establish the context (objectives, scope, critical and supporting assets on  which they are based, etc.) and deal with standard and accidental risks by  assessing compliance with the rules to which organisations have committed  themselves;  o assess targeted and sophisticated risks:   by studying and reconciling the points of view of the attacker  (sources of risk) and the defender (feared events, sources of risk  and their intended objectives);   by successive refinements (strategic scenarios studying the possible  attack paths of the sources of risk through the ecosystem of  stakeholders, and operational scenarios studying in detail the attack  chains that allow them to be implemented in practice);   estimating their severity and likelihood;  o deal with them in a proportionate manner, allowing the various components of  the risks identified to be dealt with as the studies are carried out and  completing the coverage of the risks in a coherent manner through an action  plan;  o accept the residual risks through a decision informed by the previous steps;  o communicate risks, as it is participatory and involves several stakeholders  (management, business, IT, security, legal, communication, etc.), and provide  intelligible results to the recipients of the studies;  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  27  o monitor and review risks as a principle of continuous improvement, by  identifying the risks to be monitored and by providing for the conditions for  updating the studies.  • More than a method, it is a methodology used as a toolbox whose terminology,  techniques, sequence, knowledge bases and manner of presenting the results will be  adjusted according to the object of the study (an entire organisation, a specific system,  a technical component, etc.) and its context.  Method for the Harmonised Analysis of Risk (MAGERIT)  Magerit is an open methodology for risk analysis and management developed by the Spanish  Higher Council for Electronic Government and offered as a framework and guide to the public  administration. It is the answer to the increasing dependency of public and private organisations  on information technologies to fulfil their mission and reach their business objectives.  Magerit users undertake the responsibility running the risk analysis process via workshops and  interviews, with specific representatives of the organisation participating only in specific phases  of the assessment process. It is compliant with  ISO/IEC 27005, covers all the requirements  defined by the ISO/IEC 27001, and conforms with the code of implementation of an ISMS  specified by ISO/IEC 27002:2005.  Option 2: Methodology is given as a standard and can be used to achieve conformance  to a standard and its requirements.  NIST 800-30 Methodology  NIST 800-30 is a free guide that provides a foundation for the development of an effective risk  management programme, containing both the definitions and the practical guidance necessary  for assessing and mitigating risks identified within IT systems. The ultimate goal is to help  mostly large scale organisations (such as governmental agencies and large companies) to  better manage risks associated with IT-related missions.  The method is compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001.  Option 3: Methodology is a set of good practices but not related to any standard and not  used to achieve conformance.  Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) Method  OCTAVE is a free of charge approach to evaluations of information security risk that is  comprehensive, systematic, context-driven, and self-directed. The approach is embodied in a  set of criteria that define the essential elements of an asset-driven evaluation of an information  security risk.  CCTA Risk Assessment and Management Methodology (CRAMM)  CRAMM is a method that an analyst or group of analysts may use to evaluate the security and  risk level of an organisation by analysing and combining the diverse knowledge distributed in  the local corporate environment. The computational method and technique that has been  adopted by CRAMM for the correlation and the determination of the results is quite primitive and  is based on a qualitative approach. CRAMM complies with the rules and obligations imposed by  the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.  IT-Grundschutz  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  28  IT-Grundschutz has been developed by the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany.  IT-Grundschutz provides a configuration for the establishment of an integrated and effective IT  security management. The method, before starting the risk analysis, involves a basic security  check to verify the security measures that have been implemented. Risk assessment identifies  the threats which have not been avoided by the measures, such as residual threats.  These threats can be eliminated by additional security measures. In this way, risk will be  reduced to an acceptable level. IT-Grundschutz adopts a qualitative risk analysis approach that  is associated with a primitive computational technique for the analysis and correlation of the  assessment information. The method is compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 as it addresses the  defined requirements as well as being suitable for the implementation of the ISMS process  described in ISO/IEC 27002.  MEHARI  MEHARI is a free of charge qualitative risk analysis and management method developed by  CLUSIF (Club for the Security of Information in France/Club de la Sécurité de l'Information  Français). MEHARI provides a consistent methodology, with appropriate knowledge bases such  as manuals and guides that describe the different modules (stakes, risks, vulnerabilities) that  has been designed to assist people involved in security management (CISOs, risk managers,  auditors, CIOs), in their various tasks and actions. The methodology is suitable for the  implementation of the ISMS process described by ISO/IEC 27001.  Information Security Assessment and Monitoring Method (ISAMM)  ISAMM is a quantitative type of risk management methodology that can be applied by various  organisations such as governmental agencies, large companies and small and medium size  enterprises. ISAMM is compliant with ISO/IEC 27002 and provides maximal support of the  ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS standard. It is also supported by a freeware tool.  4.2 OTHER SYSTEMS AND TOOLS SUPPORTING RM  Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder (BCEB) is a self-assessment tool to help  organisations better understand the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management efforts  and identity opportunities for improvement in the context of their overall performance.  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for  publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. It is a list of publicly disclosed  computer security flaws with a CVE ID number assigned by a CVE numbering authority (CNA).  There are about 100 CNAs, representing major ICT vendors, security companies and research  organisations. MITRE also issues CVEs directly. A single complex ICT product, such as an  operating system, can accumulate many CVEs.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for communicating the  characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS is well suited as a standard  measurement system for industries, organisations and governments that need accurate and  consistent vulnerability severity scores.  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a synthesis of interoperable specifications  derived from community ideas. This site contains information about both existing SCAP  specifications and emerging specifications relevant to NIST's security automation agenda.  OWASP threat modelling tool is an open source tool that works to identify, communicate and  understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value. Threat  modelling can be applied to a wide range of things, including software, applications, systems,  networks, distributed systems, things in the Internet of things, business processes, etc.  https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  29  Factors Analysis in Information Risk (FAIR Privacy) is a quantitative privacy risk framework  based on FAIR (Factors Analysis in Information Risk). FAIR Privacy examines personal privacy  risks (to individuals), not organisational risks. Included in this tool is a PowerPoint deck  illustrating the components of FAIR Privacy and an example based on the US Census. In  addition, an Excel spreadsheet provides a powerful risk calculator using Monte Carlo simulation.  SRAQ Online Risk Calculator adopts a technical approach to RA; it covers four areas:  identification of threats; development of  system diagrams; recommendation of controls; creation  of risk treatment plan.  Vulnerability registers and databases underpin the success of risk assessment which relies on  these registers and databases and on the formats, metrics and procedures used in these registers  and databases. They play an important role in the assessment and management of risk since  they provide a unique identifier for each vulnerability, a structured and machine-readable format  for the information and, typically, a number of references to fixes and patches. There are global  registers such as MITRE CVE, NVD and CNNVD as well as national and commercial registries  but no EU registry.  Sector specific prototypes for RM tools have been developed in various EC H2020 projects.  These include the following.  CYSM emphasises the protection of port facilities, based on the provision of a dynamic risk  management methodology for ports’ CII considering their physical-cyber nature. It implements  ISO 27001, ISO27005 and ISPS. The CYSM RA tool is based on a set of interactive and  collaborative technologies.  MEDUSA focuses on the protection of the port supply chain. It defines a methodological  approach to the identification of the multi-order dependencies of security incidents and risks,  within the scope of multi-sector cross-border scenarios. It is reflected in the provision of support  for ISO28000. MEDUSA is based on a set of visualisation tools and techniques to model and  simulate the supply chain scenarios of ports.  MITIGATE enhances CYSM and Medusa towards protecting port facilities within the scope of  interacting supply chains. MITIGATE adopts an evidence-driven maritime supply chain risk  assessment model in order to capture and deal with cascading effects risks, threats and  vulnerabilities, associated with the ICT-based maritime supply chain. It implements ISO 27001,  ISO27005 and IOS28000 and incorporates a set of ICT technologies, including semantic web  technologies (for ontology management, context management and profiling), cloud computing  and BigData and crowd-sourcing technologies (i.e. in order to collect and analyse open  information from public resources)  Cyberwatching Cyber Risk Temperature Tool is a tool developed for SMEs so they can  easily identify threats and estimate their risks.  RESISTO implements an innovative decision support system to protect communication  infrastructures from combined cyber-physical threats exploiting the Software De-fined Security  model on a suite of state-of-the-art cyber-physical security components (Blockchain, Machine  Learning, IoT security, Airborne threat detection, holistic audio-video analytics) and services.  FINSEC is a tool box that can be used by the financial sector. It implements an RA methodology  based on the enhancement and integration of various existing tools for anomaly detection, AI  CCTV analytics, risk assessment engines, collaborative analysis and management of risk.  There are global registers such as MITRE CVE, NVD, CNNVD. Many MSs have their own  registries (national and regional) that are not connected or interoperable as has been realised  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  30  through an on-going study by ENISA on ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Policies and Vulnerability  Databases’. Moreover, there is no EU registry that all EU vendors can use to report new  vulnerabilities. The national and regional registries are neither interoperable nor connected.  4.3 PRACTICAL USE OF STANDARDS AND METHODOLOGIES  Risk management standards and methodologies can be used for several purposes in an entity:  • Setting up or reinforcing a management process for the digital risk within an  organisation,  • Assessing and treating the risks relating to a digital project, in particular with the aim of  a security accreditation,  • Defining the level of security to be achieved for a product or service according to its  particular uses and the risks to be countered, from the perspective of certification or  accreditation for example.  Before going on to the different steps of a practical implementation, it is important to understand  the two main actors of the ICR possible risks, threat agent and the asset  1) The flow from threat agent to exposure of the asset  This diagram illustrates the various steps and causal relationship between the threat agent and  the exposure of the asset, which is commonly known as a ‘cyberattack’. The risk management  and the associated methodology and tools are a set of requirements to be followed to estimate  the level of risk that an entity is facing.  2) The threat agents can have different aspects and levels, depending on the value of the  targeted assets.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  31  It is interesting to see the evaluation of bank branches in the 1980s. The bank offices had  several security functions that people had to go through before being able to enter the office.  The asset to protected was the physical money. The banks performed risk analysis and realised  that the only asset to be protected was the physical money and so they removed it from the  hands of the employees. Now you can enter in any bank without going through any security  functions as the physical money is managed by the ATM and bank employees don’t have  access to it.  This example illustrates why it is important to first identify the assets that are to be protected. If  there is no asset then there is no risk.  The necessary steps to be conducted by any entity when starting its risk analysis can be  summarised as below):  • Item 1: Identification of the critical assets (data, material, place, people);  • Item 2: Identification of the threats of these critical assets;  • Item 3: Definition of the occurrence and the importance of this threats to calculate a rate of risk;  • item 4: Decision on risk mitigation (reduce, accept, transfer);  • Item 5: Planification of business continuity plan and business resumption plan;  • Item 6: Definition of the IT cartography or the product usage environment.  In order to perform these six steps, the practical use of the ISO/IEC 27005 Risk Management  Standard associated with the EBIOS RM assessment methodology can be applied. As the  EBIOS Risk Management Assessment methodology9 is based on the ISO/IEC 27005 and fully  compliant, the entity does not have to know the ISO/IEC 27005 standard to perform its Risk  mitigation analysis.  The EBIOS RM methodology adopts an iterative approach that revolves around five workshops.  9 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2019/11/anssi-guide-ebios_risk_manager-en-v1.0.pdf - all subsequent images that relate  to EBIOS RM are derived from this document, published by ANSSI  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2019/11/anssi-guide-ebios_risk_manager-en-v1.0.pdf  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  32  Figure 1 — An iterative approach in five workshops - Source ANSSI  WORKSHOP 1  Scope and  security  baseline  The first workshop aims to identify the studied object, the participants in the workshops  and the timeframe. During this workshop, you will list the missions, business assets and  supporting assets related to the studied object. You identify the feared events associated  with the business assets and assess the severity of their impacts. You also define the  security baseline.  WORKSHOP 2  Risk origins  In the second workshop, you identify and characterise the risk origins (RO) and their  high-level targets, called target objectives (TO). The RO/TO pairs deemed the most  relevant are selected at the end of this workshop. The results are formalised in a  mapping of the risk origins.  WORKSHOP 3  Strategic  scenarios  In workshop 3, you will get a clear view of the ecosystem and stablish a mapping of the  digital threat of the latter with respect to the studied object. This will allow you to  construct high-level scenarios, called strategic scenarios.  They represent the attack paths that a risk origin is likely to take to reach its target. These  scenarios are designed at the scale of the ecosystem and the business assets of the  studied object. They are assessed in terms of severity.  At the end of this workshop, you can already define the security measures on the  ecosystem.  WORKSHOP 4  Operational  scenarios  The purpose of workshop 4 is to construct technical scenarios that include the methods  of attack that are likely to be used by the risk origins to carry out the strategic scenarios.  This workshop adopts an approach similar to the one in the preceding workshop but  focuses on critical supporting assets. You then assess the level of likelihood of the  operational scenarios obtained.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  33  NOTE:  1) Workshops 3 and 4 are naturally applied during successive iterations.  2) Workshops 2, 3 and 4 make it possible to assess the risks, which constitute the last  stage of the digital risk management pyramid. They use the security baseline according  to different attack paths, which are relevant with regards to the threats considered and in  a limited number in order to facilitate the analysis.  WORKSHOP 5  Risk mitigation  The last workshop consists in creating a summary of all of the risks studied in order to  define a risk mitigation strategy. The latter is then broken down into security measures  written into a continuous improvement plan. During this workshop, you establish a  summary of the residual risks and define the framework for monitoring risks.  This series of five iterative workshops is summarised here below:  Figure 2: Link between the various workshop – source EBIOS RM - ANSSI  To support and implement this methodology you can use a simple table file. Some software  editors also provide dedicated software that is available in Software as a Service mode or local  mode.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  34  5. RESULTS OF THE  ANALYSIS  This section analyses the gaps and overlaps between the risk management standards  determined in section 4.1.5.  When analysing the documents discussed earlier, the distinction between risk management  standards and risk management methodologies becomes quite obvious. The relevant standards  are:  • ISO/IEC 27005 – Information security risk management,  • ISO 31000 – Risk management guidelines,  • BSI 7799-3 – Guidelines for information security risk management,  • NIST SP 800-39 – Managing information security risk,  • BSI Germany Standard 200-3 – Risk analysis based on IT-Grundschutz.  Their analysis in this section is performed from various perspectives:  • concepts, terms and definitions,  • risk criteria,  • areas of application,  • ICT,  • level of application,  • European vs international technical specifications,  • EU legislation vs standards.  Concepts, terms and definitions  All the identified risk management standards have influenced each other over the years. The  concepts, terms and definitions related to risk management outlined in ISO 31000 have been  incorporated in all of these other documents in more or less the same way.  Slight deviations exist depending whether the risk management standards analysed are more  related to or in support of management system standards based on ISO Directives or those  based on a risk management framework according to ISO 31000. This difference becomes  quite obvious when reading the diverging definitions of risk, but this distinction has no real-life  implications and can be viewed as a rather academic issue.  The risk management methodologies and tools do diverge to a much greater extend from each  other. This can mostly be attributed to the fact that these methodologies and tools have been  developed by different entities addressing different audiences and their needs. Not every  methodology or tool is universally applicable to any type or size of organisation and its scope.  In the ENISA report Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessments 2021 an overview of  terms is provided, along with an interpretation of the meaning of each term according to the  normative references found in ISO/IEC 270xx. In addition, how these definitions should be  understood and used in the context of the specification of security and assurance is explained.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  35  Risk Criteria  All risk management standards recommend the determination of risk criteria, although no  recommendation or requirement regarding the criteria themselves or the necessary levels or  threshold values are stated. According to the risk management standards, this remains a task  for the organisation implementing risk management.  The risk management methodologies and tools may have outlined these risk criteria – including  the levels and threshold values – within their content. Depending on the audience for a  methodology or tool, these criteria can be defined exactly for the specific area of application,  such as a specific business sector.  The various RA methodologies adopt different measurement and scales so as a result risk  levels estimates cannot be compared. These differences lead to selecting and implementing  different controls (some of them costlier that others) to mitigate the same risks. This problem  affects certification efforts as well. CVSS3.0 is being used broadly for scoring the severity of  vulnerabilities; however, it has not been adopted by all stakeholders.  Areas of application  All the risk management standards that have been identified can be applied by any organisation  in any business sector as these standards provide guidance on the framework for risk  management.  The situation is similar for organisations implementing risk management in the context of a  management system when seeking conformance to a management system standard.  Some methodologies and tools may be applicable only to a specific business sector. Others  also address ICT-risk from a cross-sector perspective.  The transversal standards intend to cover a large set of domains by being as generic and  reusable as possible. This is the case of standards developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 (ISO/IEC  27000 family, ISO/IEC 15408/18045) or by CEN CENELEC EN 17640 FITCEM or ETSI EN 303  645. Despite this fact it appears that for specific domains (automotive, aeronautics and space,  energy, sustainable industry, supply chain etc.), these standards are not sufficient and must be  supplemented with additional security requirements, and evaluation and assessment methods.  This can be due to specific features, regulations, user requirements or technology constraints.  ICT  There are many standards on ICT security (e.g. ISO/IEC 11770-3:2021) that provide accurate  technical information to ensure the security of ICT mechanisms and also several sector-specific  standards due to ISO /IEC 27002 Code of Practice for information security controls, e.g.  ISO/IEC 27011. They support managing ICT security risks by offering appropriate technology  and related mechanisms but they are not risk management standards.  ETSI TS T02 165-1 (2017) is a technical specification which defines a method for analysing the  risks of information and communications technology (ICT) systems using the threat, vulnerability  and risk analysis (TVRA) methodology. Primarily, this is a guidance for analysing threats  applicable to and vulnerabilities identified in a target of evaluation considered within the  Common Criteria evaluation methodology (ISO/IEC 15408 family). But there is no equivalent  standard considering ICT systems in a more general context.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  36  There are several sector-specific standards due to ISO /IEC 27002 Code of Practice for  information security controls, e.g. ISO/IEC 27011 (Code of practice for Information security  controls based on ISO/IEC 27002 for telecommunications organisations) and ISO/IEC 27017  (Code of practice for information security controls based on ISO/IEC 27002 for cloud services).  There are some standards applying risk management to technology, e.g. ISO 14971 (Medical  devices — Application of risk management to medical devices) and ISO 17666 (Space systems  — Risk management). But there is a gap due to the absence of a standard applying risk  management to ICT devices, ICT services and ICT processes to support the assessment and  treatment of corresponding risks.  The following results can be observed in several organisations:  1. Lack of coordination and alignment between the divisions responsible for business risk  management or information security management and ICT staff regarding risk  management;  2. Lack of conformity with regard to risk management language and the application of risk  management between the divisions responsible for business risk management or  information security management and ICT staff.  Level of application  As risk management standards only provide guidance on the framework, these standards can  be used by the whole of a legal entity10 from the perspective of its business, its services or  products, or be limited to its IT-operation only.  Depending on the audience and the intended use of a methodology or tool, similar  organisational levels can be addressed. Some tools cover all aspects of a management system  – such as management system risks, strategic risk and operational risks – others only address  operational risk for ICT-operations.  European vs international technical specifications  Out of the five risk management standards as determined, two are published by ISO, whereas  three standards are published by individual countries. None of these publications have any legal  basis throughout the European Union.  The situation poses similar problems regarding methodologies and tools.  Section 4.1.5 has identified ISO 31000 Risk Management Guidelines and ISO/IEC 27005  Information Security Risk Management as being the most relevant risk management standards  in the international domain, providing basic principles and generic guidelines. Unlike many other  international cybersecurity standards which have been adopted as European Norms, such  adoption has not happened in these two cases; however ISO 31000 was, for example, adopted  as a regional standard for Australia and New Zealand.  EU legislation versus standards  The EU’s NIS directive uses its own definition of risk which is not aligned with any of the other  definitions. For example, The definition of ‘risk’ is not uniform between the NIS directive and  ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27005. This issue may be rather academic but it can also create  some difficulties in bridging the regulatory context and the standardisation context.  10 From the perspective of management system standards, the organisation is always related to the scope of the  management system – and its risk management –  and the distinction between ‘legal organisation’ and ‘IT-operation’ is  incorrect.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  37  The risk-based approach is promoted in most of the recent efforts on digital legislation. As an  example, the IA Act defines four levels of risk: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and  minimal risk. To classify these four levels, an agreed quotation methodology should be  developed and, as of today, no standard is available nor is one in preparation.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  38  6. RECOMMENDATIONS  Basing on the analysis provided in section 5, we propose the following recommendations on the  use of risk management standards for various groups of stakeholders.  6.1 EU POLICY MAKERS  Recommendation 1:  EU policy makers should use risk management standards that have already been adopted in  future regulatory publications.  Note: This requires the successful implementation of recommendation 8.  Recommendation 2:  EU policy makers should make particular risk assessment methodologies or tools mandatory for  specific sectors, where and when necessary.  Recommendation 3:  When no risk management standard or risk assessment methodology or tool is appropriate for a  specific sector, EU policy makers should issue a request for standardisation to ESOs to cover  this need.  As an example – a European standard for a methodology for the assessment of ICT security is  missing. Such a European standard would allow a coherent approach to be made to comply  with the risk management obligation set out in different existing and upcoming cybersecurity  pieces of legislation. This methodology should be based on the ISO/IEC 27005 Information  security risk management and ISO/IEC ISO.IEC 31000 – Risk management guidelines.  Recommendation 4:  In the context of the Cybersecurity Act, one of the crucial actions should consist in verifying  whether European standards to apply risk management to ICT devices, ICT services and ICT  processes, which aim to support the assessment and treatment of corresponding risks, actually  exist. Otherwise, the EU Policy makers should issue a request for standardisation to ESOs to  cover this need.  Recommendation 5:  Cybersecurity education and practical skills need to be aligned and embedded in all educational  stages (from early childhood to lifelong learning) and during the whole professional life. All  educational enterprises in the MSs and all EU citizens from all sectors (e.g. health, government,  transport, finance, defence) need to have the opportunity to practice in national or clustered EU  cyber ranges to assess their skills. Risk management, based on the recognised standards, should  become one of the main topics of these activities.  Recommendation 6:  An ad hoc working group should be set up (preferably by ENISA) to determine some criteria to  define the levels of risks mentioned in European legislation (e.g. Artificial Intelligence Act). This  ad hoc working group should provide the necessary risk tools to compute the estimation of the  risk and to classify the results accordingly to the levels identified.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  39  6.2 EUROPEAN SDOS  Recommendation 7:  As identified earlier, security concepts (units of knowledge consisting of unique characteristics),  terms (verbal designations of the concepts), definitions (unique descriptive statements of the  concepts that identify them uniquely) and relations between concepts in different risk assessment  standards deviate among themselves as used by various SDOs. Further interpretation efforts are  needed for all risk assessment and risk management standards that appear in this document.  The SDOs are encouraged to use unified concepts, terms and definitions.  The concept approach, developed by the ISO Technical Committee TC37 Language and  Terminology, can be adopted where one term corresponds to one concept and only one concept  corresponds to one term.  Recommendation 8:  There is no existing European standard for a methodology to assess ICT security available at  the European level, creating some issues in referencing applicable standards in EU legislation.  As described in chapter 4.2 there are several methodologies with different approaches.  Efforts should be undertaken to address these gaps.  Recommendation 9:  ESOs should adopt ISO/IEC 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005 as European Norms.  The benefits of such regional adoption in the case of European Norms include the facts that:  • harmonisation within Europe makes it easier to comply with European rules and  regulations (stand-still on national work on the same topic);  • documents can be targeted at European needs;  • consensus building within Europe is easier than in the global context.  The potential adoption of ISO/IEC 31000 and/or ISO/IEC 27005 as European standards will  help to harmonise European approaches to risk management.  Recommendation 10:  ETSI should harmonise its TS 102 165-1 with ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005 to develop a  standard covering risk management for ICT systems which is applicable to systems in a  Common Criteria context as well as in risk management (asset-based approach) within the  scope of an ISMS.  6.3 ENISA  Recommendation 11:  ENISA should publish, on a regular basis, an overview of endorsed risk management standards  covering different domains and sectors.  Recommendation 12:  ENISA should publish an overview of endorsed methodologies and tools covering different  domains and sectors.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  40  Recommendation 13:  ENISA should encourage and support different disciplines and sectors to develop or advance  work regarding their assessment of sector-discipline-specific risk and methodologies and tools  for treating risk, in order to increase cooperation between stakeholders.  Recommendation 14:  ENISA should continue to work in close support with ESOs in fulfilling potential EU requests for  standardisation related to the management of risk.  Recommendation 15:  ENISA should establish a mechanism for assisting EU institutions, bodies and agencies, EU  Member States and private organisations regarding various aspects of risk management.

RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  50  CACAO Security Playbooks Version  1.0  CACAO-Security- Playbooks-v1.0 Other Methodology OASIS  To defend against threat actors and their tactics,  organisations need to identify, create,  document, and test detection, investigation,  prevention, mitigation and remediation steps.  These steps, when grouped together form a  cyber security playbook that can be used to  protect organisational systems, networks, data  and users.  This specification defines the schema and  taxonomy for collaborative automated courses  of action for operations (CACAO) and security  playbooks and how these playbooks can be  created, documented and shared in a structured  and standardised way across organisational  boundaries and technological solutions. It  defines the following classes of objects:  playbooks (section 4), workflow steps (section  5), commands (section 6), targets (section 7),  extensions (section 8), and data markings  (section 9).  CSAF Common Vulnerability  Reporting Framework (CVRF)  Version 1.2.  CVRF-v1.2 Other guidelines, methodology,  data specification OASIS  A standard language supporting creation,  update, and interoperable exchange of security  advisories as structured information on  products, vulnerabilities and the status of  impact and remediation among interested  parties. The term Security Advisory is used to  describe any notification of security issues in  products of and by providers.  The focus is on the security aspect impacting (or  not impacting) specific combinations of  products, platforms, and versions. Information  on the presence or absence of work-arounds is  also considered part of the security issue.  It addresses security advisories from anyone  providing a product, i.e. developers or  maintainers of information system products or  services. This includes all authoritative product  vendors, product security incident response  teams (PSIRTs), and product resellers and  distributors, including authoritative vendor  partners.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  51  Open Command and Control  (OpenC2) Language Specification  Version 1.0  OpenC2-Lang-v1.0 Other Methodology, data  specification OASIS  A concise and extensible language to enable  machine-to-machine communications for  purposes of the command and control of cyber  defence components, subsystems and/or  systems in a manner that is agnostic of the  underlying products, technologies and transport  mechanisms.  OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables  command and control of cyber defence systems  and components, typically using a request- response paradigm. OpenC2 allows the  application producing the commands to  discover the set of capabilities supported by the  managed devices. These capabilities permit the  managing application to adjust its behaviour to  take advantage of the features exposed by the  managed device. The capability definitions can  be easily extended in a non-centralised manner,  allowing standard and non-standard capabilities  to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.  Open Command and Control  (OpenC2) Profile for Stateless  Packet Filtering Version 1.0  OpenC2-SLPF-v1.0 Other Methodology OASIS  Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a  concise, extensible language enabling command  and control of cyber defence components.  Stateless packet filtering is a cyber defence  mechanism that denies or allows traffic based  on static properties of the traffic, such as  address, port, protocol, etc. This profile defines  the actions, targets, specifiers and options that  are consistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2  Language Specification in the context of  stateless packet filtering (SLPF). An actuator  profile for OpenC2 that specifies the set of  actions, targets, specifiers and command  arguments integrates SLPF functionality with the  Open Command and Control (OpenC2)  Command set.  Specification for Transfer of OpenC2  Messages via HTTPS Version 1.0  OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0 Other Methodology OASIS  Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a  concise, extensible language enabling command  and control of cyber defence components.  Stateless packet filtering is a cyber defence  mechanism that denies or allows traffic based  on static properties of the traffic, such as  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  52  address, port, protocol, etc. This document  specifies the use of hypertext transfer protocol  (HTTP) over transport layer security (TLS) as a  transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages. The  specification provides guidance to the OpenC2  implementation community when using HTTPS  for OpenC2 message transport. It includes  guidance for the selection of TLS versions and  options suitable for use with OpenC2.  Static Analysis Results Interchange  Format (SARIF) Version 2.1  SARIF-v2.1.0 Other Methodology, data  specification OASIS  SARIF is included because of its potential  relevance to risk assessment. Software  developers use a variety of analysis tools to  assess program qualities such as correctness,  security, vulnerability, performance, compliance  with contractual or legal requirements, etc.  SARIF defines a standard format for the output  of static analysis tools to enable aggregation,  analysis, and sharing of results. The standard  defines a format for the output of static analysis  tools, in order to capture the range of data  produced by commonly used static analysis  tools, enable data interchange, reduce cost and  complexity, and capture information useful for  assessing a project’s compliance with corporate  policy or certification standards.  STIX Version 2.1 STIX-v2.1 Other Methodology, data  specification OASIS  A language and serialisation format used to  exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI), STIX  enables CTI-sharing in a consistent and machine- readable manner, allowing security  communities to better understand what  computer-based attacks they are most likely to  see and to anticipate and/or respond to those  attacks faster and more effectively. STIX is  designed to improve many different capabilities,  such as collaborative threat analysis, automated  threat exchange, automated detection and  response, and more.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  53  TAXII Version 2.1 TAXII-v1.1.1-Overview Other Methodology OASIS  TAXII is an application layer protocol for the  communication of cyber threat information in a  simple and scalable manner. This specification  defines the TAXII RESTful API and its resources  along with the requirements for TAXII client and  server implementations.  Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator  Information (TAXII™) defines a set of services  and message exchanges that, when  implemented, enable sharing of actionable  cyber threat information across the organisation  and product or service boundaries. TAXII,  through its member specifications, defines  concepts, protocols and messages to exchange  cyber threat information for the detection,  prevention, and mitigation of cyber threats.  TAXII is not an information sharing initiative or  application and does not attempt to define trust  agreements, governance, or non-technical  aspects of cyber threat information sharing.  Enterprise Risk Management —  Integrated Framework  COSO ERM Guide/Guidance Guidance  COSO Committee  of Sponsoring  Organisations of  the Treadway  Commission  The Framework defines the essential  components of enterprise risk management,  discusses key ERM principles and concepts,  suggests a common ERM language, and provides  clear direction and guidance for enterprise risk  management.  Systems and software engineering  — Life cycle processes — Risk  management  ISO/IEC/IEEE  16085:2021 Guide/Guidance Guidelines Other  This document provides information on how to  design, develop, implement, and continually  improve risk management in a systems and  software engineering project throughout its life  cycle.  Risk management - Principles and  guidelines AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Standard Risk management Other  Providing principles and generic guidelines on  risk management, this standard can be used by  any public, private or community enterprise,  association, group or individual, and is not  specific to any industry or sector. It can be  applied throughout the life of an organisation,  and to a wide range of activities, including  strategies and decisions, operations, processes,  functions, projects, products, services and  assets. Although the standard provides generic  guidelines, it is not intended to promote  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  54  uniformity of risk management across  organisations. The design and implementation  of risk management plans and frameworks will  need to take into account the varying needs of a  specific organisation, its particular objectives,  context, structure, operations, processes,  functions, projects, products, services or assets  and specific practices employed.  Security for industrial automation  and control systems–Part 3-2:  Security risk assessment for system  design  ISA/IEC 62443-3-2 Standard Techniques Other  This document strives to define a set of  engineering measures that will guide an  organisation through  the  process  of  assessing  the  risk  of  a  particular industrial automation  and control system  (IACS)  and enable it  to  identify  and  apply  security countermeasures  to reduce that risk to tolerable levels.  OWASP Risk Rating Methodology  OWASP Risk  Assessment Framework  Other Risk Assessment  Framework OWASP  The OWASP Risk Assessment Framework  consists of static application security testing and  risk assessment testers able to analyse and  review their code quality and vulnerabilities.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  55  ANNEX B: ANALYSIS OF  EIDAS REGULATION  We present below an example of how ICT risk and risk management are treated by analysing  the existing eIDAS regulation (Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic  Transactions - Regulation (EU) No 910/2014).  eIDAS items Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic  Transactions - Regulation (EU) No 910/2014  Means  Identification  schemes – Mutual  recognition  Recital (20): cooperation by Member States should facilitate the  technical interoperability of the notified electronic identification  schemes with a view to fostering a high level of trust and security  appropriate to the degree of risk. The exchange of information and  the sharing of best practices between Member States with a view to  their mutual recognition should help such cooperation.  Risk  management  performed by  peer reviews  Trust Service  Providers  Recital (32): it should be incumbent on all trust service providers to  apply good security practice appropriate to the risks related to their  activities so as to boost users’ trust in the single market.  Apply good  security  practices  Data protection  handle by  electronic  registered  delivery service  Recital (36): ‘electronic registered delivery service’ means a service  that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by  electronic means and provides evidence relating to the handling of the  data transmitted, including proof of sending and receiving the data, and  that protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage  or any unauthorised alterations.  Management  of the risk of  loss, theft,  damage, or  unauthorised  alterations  Liability of all  trust service  providers –  assessment of  financial risk  Recital (37): this regulation should provide for the liability of all trust  service providers. In particular, it establishes the liability regime under  which all trust service providers should be liable for damage caused to  any natural or legal person due to failure to comply with the obligations  under this regulation. In order to facilitate the assessment of financial  risk that trust service providers might have to bear or that they should  cover by insurance policies, this regulation allows trust service  providers to set limitations, under certain conditions, on the use of the  services they provide and not to be liable for damages arising from the  use of services exceeding such limitations. Customers should be duly  informed about the limitations in advance. Those limitations should be  recognisable by a third party, for example by including information  about the limitations in the terms and conditions of the service provided  or through other recognisable means. For the purposes of giving effect  to those principles, this regulation should be applied in accordance with  national rules on liability. Therefore, this regulation does not affect  national rules on, for example, definition of damages, intention,  negligence or relevant applicable procedural rules.  Insurance  policies, set  of limitations  of liability in  their terms of  uses of the  service  Security risk  assessments and  notification of  security breaches  Recital (38): notification of security breaches and security risk  assessments is essential with a view to providing adequate information  to concerned parties in the event of a breach of security or loss of  integrity.  Article 8.2 (a): assurance level low shall refer to a means of electronic  identification in the context of an electronic identification scheme, which  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  56  provides a limited degree of confidence in the claimed or asserted  identity of a person, and is characterised with reference to technical  specifications, standards and procedures related thereto, including  technical controls, the purpose of which is to decrease the risk of  misuse or alteration of the identity;  Article 8.2 (b): assurance level substantial shall refer to a means of  electronic identification in the context of an electronic identification  scheme, which provides a substantial degree of confidence in the  claimed or asserted identity of a person, and is characterised with  reference to technical specifications, standards and procedures related  thereto, including technical controls, the purpose of which is to  decrease substantially the risk of misuse or alteration of the identity;  Article 12. 7: By 18 March 2015, the Commission shall, by means of  implementing acts, establish the necessary procedural arrangements to  facilitate cooperation between the Member States referred to in  paragraphs 5 and 6 with a view to fostering a high level of trust and  security appropriate to the degree of risk.  Article 19:  Security requirements applicable to trust service providers  1. Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall take  appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks  posed to the security of the trust services they provide. Having regard  to the latest technological developments, those measures shall ensure  that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. In  particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact  of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the adverse effects of  any such incidents.  Article 24.2 C) on:  Requirements for qualified trust service providers  2. A qualified trust service provider providing qualified trust services  shall:  (c) with regard to the risk of liability for damages in accordance with  Article 13, maintain sufficient financial resources and/or obtain  appropriate liability insurance, in accordance with national law.

The Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) states that ‘ENISA shall facilitate the  establishment and take-up of European and international standards for risk management and  for the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes’. (Article 8.5)  This analysis is intended to contribute to the achievement of this goal. It is based on a compiled,  comprehensive inventory of standards in the area of cybersecurity risk management and  methodologies related to standards. This publication provides guidance to EU Institutions,  bodies and agencies on the availability of standards and methodologies relevant to the  management of cybersecurity risk and outlines possible gaps in these domains, enabling the  relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies to initiate activities to close these gaps in order to  further implement the cybersecurity policies stemming from the legislation.  Furthermore, this publication can also be used by organisations as a library of risk management  standards and methodologies for their endeavour to implement risk management within their  organisation or in their developments of cybersecurity certification schemes.  Standards are developed and defined through a process of sharing knowledge and building  consensus among technical experts nominated by interested parties and other stakeholders.  When it comes to developing and establishing standards, a large variety of players exist.  Naturally, there is competition between these players but they also cooperate in many  instances, in particular when there is a common interest.  Standards are voluntary which means that there is no automatic legal obligation to apply them.  However, laws and regulations may refer to standards and even make compliance with them  compulsory. This document aims also at providing a brief introduction to the main players when  it comes to standards in the area of risk management, introducing the main characteristics of  the different document types published by these players, and introducing the inventory of Risk  Management Standards presented in the Annex A.  To help this targeted audience in understanding the risk management process and its  associated standards, this document is structured in chapters that cover the relevant areas.  Based on the analysis provided in section 5 and making a distinction between risk management  standards and risk management methodologies, we propose in section 6 a series of  recommendations on the use of risk management standards for various groups of stakeholders  – EU decision makers, European SDOs, and ENISA itself.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT  The purpose of this document is to provide a coherent overview of published standards that  address aspects of risk management and subsequently list methodologies and tools that can  be used to conform with or implement these standards.  This publication will provide guidance to EU institutions, bodies and agencies on the  availability of standards and methodologies relevant to risk management and outline possible  gaps in this domain, enabling the relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies to initiate  activities to close these gaps.  Furthermore, this publication can also be used by organisations as a library of risk  management standards and methodologies for their endeavour to implement risk  management within their organisations or develop cybersecurity certification schemes for ICT  products, services and processes.  The list of applicable risk management standards and the associated gap analysis provided in  this document will be some key inputs in providing content and support in a relevant  cybersecurity policy area related to risk management as described in the Cybersecurity Act,  Article 8, point 5:  “ENISA shall facilitate the establishment and take-up of European and international standards  for risk management and for the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes”.  This document also targets critical sectors as defined in the Annex II of the NIS Directive1:  Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial market infrastructures, the Health sector, Drinking  water supply and distribution, and Digital Infrastructure.  1.2 EU LEGAL REQUIREMENTS  European institutions, bodies and agencies have released several publications – including  regulations and directives – concerning the concept of risk management.  These publications are not limited to the classical domain of ICT but also cover transversal or  sectorial domains (e.g. maritime, automotive, space, energy, healthcare) with their underlying  information security and cybersecurity.  The concept of risk related to the security of ICT infrastructure was initially defined in the first  cyber security legislation: The NIS directive - The Network Information Security Directive -  Directive 2016/1148.  The directive has placed several legal obligations on ICT security and has also provided a clear  definition of how risk is defined in in the context of this directive.  Article 4 (definitions) point (9): ‘risk’ means any reasonably identifiable circumstance or  event having a potential adverse effect on the security of network and information  systems.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a  high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.  Risk Management  is all about  identifying and  protecting the  valuable assets of  an organisation.  Risk management  procedures are  fundamental  processes to  prepare  organisations for a  future  cybersecurity  attack, to evaluate  products and  services for their  resistance to  potential attacks  before placing  them on the  market, and to  prevent supply  chain fraud.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  6  The NIS directive can be considered as the origin of any EU requirement regarding risk  management within the ICT domain.  The table here below provides the references on risk management included in the NIS directive.  Table 1: References on risk management in the NIS directive  Article  Point Text  Recital Point 4 ‘Building upon the significant progress within the European Forum  of Member States in fostering discussions and exchanges on  good policy practices, including the development of principles for  European cyber-crisis cooperation, a Cooperation Group,  composed of representatives of Member States, the Commission,  and the European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security (‘ENISA’), should be established to support and facilitate  strategic cooperation between the Member States regarding the  security of network and information systems. For that group to be  effective and inclusive, it is essential that all Member States have  minimum capabilities and a strategy ensuring a high level of  security of network and information systems in their territory. In  addition, security and notification requirements should apply to  operators of essential services and to digital service  providers to promote a culture of risk management and  ensure that the most serious incidents are reported.’  Recital  Point 44 ‘Responsibilities in ensuring the security of network and  information systems lie, to a great extent, with operators of  essential services and digital service providers. A culture of risk  management, involving risk assessment and the  implementation of security measures appropriate to the risks  faced, should be promoted and developed through  appropriate regulatory requirements and voluntary industry  practices. Establishing a trustworthy level playing field is also  essential to the effective functioning of the Cooperation Group  and the CSIRTs network, to ensure effective cooperation from all  Member States.’  Recital Point 46 ‘Risk-management measures include measures to identify  any risks of incidents, to prevent, detect and handle  incidents and to mitigate their impact. The security of network  and information systems comprises the security of stored,  transmitted and processed data.’  Article 7 7,f ‘Each Member State shall adopt a national strategy on the  security of network and information systems defining the strategic  objectives and appropriate policy and regulatory measures with a  view to achieving and maintaining a high level of security of  network and information systems and covering at least the  sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in  Annex III. The national strategy on the security of network and  information systems shall address, in particular, the following  issues:  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  7  7, f) a risk assessment plan to identify risks.’  Regarding the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, the crucial EU legal  requirements are presented in the Cybersecurity Act Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2019/881  (CSA regulation).  Table 2: References on risk management in the CSA  CSA items Cybersecurity Act Regulation - Regulation (EU) 2019/881  Risk management  as a tool for  cybersecurity  vulnerability  management and  remediation  Recital point (11) Modern ICT products and systems often integrate and rely on one or  more third-party technologies and components such as software modules, libraries, or  application programming interfaces. This reliance, which is referred to as a ‘dependency’,  could pose additional cybersecurity risks as vulnerabilities found in third-party components  could also affect the security of the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. In  many cases, identifying and documenting such dependencies enables end users of  ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes to improve their cybersecurity risk  management activities by improving, for example, users’ cybersecurity vulnerability  management and remediation procedures.  Importance of  European and  international risk  management  standards and  methods  Recital (49) Efficient cybersecurity policies should be based on well-developed risk  assessment methods, in both the public and private sectors. Risk assessment methods  are used at different levels, with no common practice regarding how to apply them  efficiently. Promoting and developing best practices for risk assessment and for  interoperable risk management solutions in public-sector and private-sector organisations  will increase the level of cybersecurity in the Union. To that end, ENISA should support  cooperation between stakeholders at Union level and facilitate their efforts relating  to the establishment and take-up of European and international standards for risk  management and for the measurable security of electronic products, systems,  networks and services which, together with software, comprise the network and  information systems.  Creating the link  between the ICT  risk management  from the NIS  directive and the  CSA regulation  Article 5: Development and implementation of Union policy and law  ENISA shall contribute to the development and implementation of Union policy and law, by:  (2) assisting Member States to implement the Union policy and law regarding cybersecurity  consistently, in particular in relation to Directive (EU) 2016/1148, including by means  of issuing opinions, guidelines, providing advice and best practices on topics such  as risk management, incident reporting and information sharing, as well as by facilitating  the exchange of best practices between competent authorities in that regard.

SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS  2.1 SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS  The Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act) states that ‘ENISA shall facilitate the  establishment and take-up of European and international standards for risk management  and for the security of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes’. (Article 8 no. 5)  This analysis is intended to contribute to the achievement of this goal. It is based on a compiled  and comprehensive inventory of standards (Annex A) in the area of cybersecurity risk  management and methodologies related to standards. Special attention is given to the analysis  of gaps and overlaps of the available standards.  The analysis aims to identify practical ways to apply these standards by different stakeholders,  compiling guidelines and good practices.  2.2 NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDERS IN RELATION TO RISK MANAGEMENT  More and more organisations understand that cybersecurity and information security risks have  to be managed because corresponding threats can have substantial consequences to the  organisation or even threaten its existence.  As stated in the introduction, this publication shall provide guidance to EU institutions, bodies  and agencies, as well as to various organisations, to be used as a library of risk management  standards and methodologies for their endeavour to implement risk management processes.  Many of these stakeholders are looking for advice on which standards or methodologies are  suitable for their organisation. Small companies are often overwhelmed by what is offered in the  market and find choosing suitable methods difficult. This paper also presents methodologies for  small companies (e.g. OCTAVE-S). When implemented, risk management approaches are  influenced by the sector in which the organisation does its business. There are sector-specific  risk management standards and methodologies that take into account the related specifics.  2.3 DEFINITIONS  2.3.1 Risk management  Risk  There are two slightly different definitions within documents published by the ISO and the IEC  that are relevant for risk management. These are listed for comparison in the following table.  Table 6: Comparison of risk definitions in ISO standards and directives  Effect of uncertainty on objectives Effect on uncertainty  [SOURCE: ISO 31000:2018]  [SOURCE: ISO/IEC 27000:2018]  [SOURCE:  ISO Directives, Part 1, Annex SL,  Appendix 2]  Note 1: an effect is a deviation from the  expected. Certain organisations consider  positive deviations in addition to negative  Note 1 to entry: an effect is a deviation from  the expected — positive or negative.  Note 2 to entry: uncertainty is the state, even  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  11  deviations in the risk context.  Note 2: risk is usually expressed in terms of  risk sources, potential events, their  consequences and their likelihood.  Note 3: uncertainty is the state, even partial,  of deficiency of information related to  understanding or knowledge of an event, its  consequence, or likelihood.  Note 4: objectives are not only but often are  related to business, organisation or projects.  Another level of objectives is presented in  section 3.1.  partial, of deficiency of information related to  understanding or knowledge of an event, its  consequence, or likelihood.  Note 3 to entry: risk is often characterised by  reference to potential events (as defined in  ISO Guide 73) and consequences (as  defined in ISO Guide 73) or a combination of  these.  Note 4 to entry: risk is often expressed in  terms of a combination of the consequences  of an event (including changes in  circumstances) and the associated likelihood  (as defined in ISO Guide 73) of occurrence.  As stated in the comparison table above, there are slightly diverging definitions of risk within the  ISO domain. These definitions diverge depending on whether a risk is connected to a defined  objective (ISO 31000) or not. In the context of a management system standard, such as ISO/IEC  27001, risks can arise regardless of whether objectives have been set in advance.  ISO/IEC 27000:2018 contains the definition of ISO 31000:2018 because the ISO 31000 definition  is referenced in ISO/IEC 27005.  For ISO/IEC 27001, the definition of Annex SL is relevant, as ISO/IEC 27001 has to follow the  text of the ISO Directives.  For example, the sector-specific standard ISO/SAE 21434:2021 follows the definition on the right- hand side of the table, that risk is the ‘effect on uncertainty on road vehicle cybersecurity’.  In Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (‘NIS Directive’) there is a different definition of risk. Article 4 states  that risk is ‘any reasonably identifiable circumstance or event having a potential adverse effect on  the security of network and information systems’. Compared with the definitions given by ISO  standards and directives the focus here is on the threat component in relation to the  source of  risk not to the effect. Cf.

A standard is a document generally established by consensus and approved by a recognised  body that provides rules or guidance on the design, use or performance of materials, products,  technologies, processes, services, systems or persons.  Standards can be developed by national, regional and international standards developing  organisations2 (e.g. ISO, IEC, CEN, ETSI, DIN).They can also be developed by consortia of  businesses to address a specific marketplace need or by government departments to support  regulations. Not every standard is called a ‘standard’. For example, another common name used  is Technical Specification. In this case, as a rule, a qualified majority may also be sufficient for  the adoption of the document.  A more extensive description of standard developing organisations and their deliverables is  provided in chapter number 4.1. of this document (section 4.1.1.)  What is a methodology?  A methodology is a set of principles and methods (at least one) adhering to good practices used  to perform a particular activity. It’s a coherent and logical scheme that guides the choices users  of the methodology make.  What is the relation between standards and methodologies?  Some methodologies are (published as) standards and some standards include methodologies.  Option 1: Methodology is used to achieve conformance to a standard (with reference in part or in  whole to a certain standard and its requirements).  Option 2: Methodology is given as a standard and can be used to achieve conformance to a  standard and its requirements.  Option 3: Methodology is a set of good practices but not related to any standard and not used to  achieve conformance.  2 Abbreviation: SDO  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  13  A methodology clarifies how certain issues should be handled. The methodology is often defined  through test-specifications related to a standard. If a methodology is given as a standard the same  is true. Moreover there are also many standards which focus on what to do and not how to do  (mainly requirements standards).  Table 7: Examples of methodologies, which are published as standards  ISO 13053-1:2011 Quantitative methods in process improvement — Six Sigma — Part 1:  DMAIC methodology  ISO/IEC  18045:2008  Information technology — Security techniques — Methodology for IT  security evaluation  ETSI TS 102 165- 1:2017  CYBER —  Methods and protocols —  Part 1: Method and pro forma  for Threat, Vulnerability, Risk Analysis (TVRA)  2.3.3 Risk management vocabulary  The vocabulary of risk management is often different between standards and methodologies. It  can be observed that the definitions of terms used in well-known ISO standards and guides (Table  8) are quite similar while there are clear differences in other standards (e.g. in Table 9). ISO  definitions are compact while others are more extensive. The definition of risk acceptance is  missing in NIST and BSI Germany.

Risk management consists of the following steps:  1. Identification of threats  In this phase the various threats or threat models are identified according to different methods.  For example, the assets to be protected are listed according to the risk management policy and  the relevant potential threats are listed. Threat identification can also be done according to other  methods such as the identification of vulnerabilities or threat models. Standards can provide a  checklist to help with identifying different assets, threats or vulnerabilities consistent with  particular regulations (for example NIS or GDPR).  2. Evaluation of threats  The different threats are evaluated according to different sources. For example, cyber threat  intelligence (CTI) can be used or standards on the ontology and terminology of threats.  Standards can provide guidance on threat selection according to the security profile selected.  3. Evaluation of risk  The risk evaluation process is key to defining how to use the scale of threats, impacts, likelihood  and occurrence parameters in order to prioritise different threats. Here, standards are of strong  interest.  4. Mitigation of risk  Risk mitigation is the answer you will put in place in order to handle the risks identified. Risk management standards  like ISO/IEC 27005 or EN 303 645 are helpful examples.  5. Evaluation and assessment of risk controls  In this last step we will evaluate implemented security controls, check their efficiency and  assess the mitigation of security risk.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  15  2.4.2 ICT Products certification  A well-known framework for evaluating and certifying ICT products, which also became an  international standard is Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation3. EN  ISO/IEC 15408 establishes the concepts, principles and techniques for IT security evaluation.  The standard consists of three parts: the EN ISO/IEC 15408-1:20204 that introduces the general  concepts and model, the EN ISO/IEC 15408-2:20201 that includes the security functional  components and the EN ISO/IEC 15408-3:20201 that describes the security assurance  components.  ISO/IEC 18045:20201 is a companion standard for the ISO/IEC 15408 family and provides a  methodology to help an IT security evaluator to conduct a CC evaluation by defining the minimal  actions to be performed.  The IT Security of ICT products is concerned with the protection of assets. Assets according to  EN ISO/IEC 15408-1:2020 include the integrity of the contents of a database, the availability of  an electronic workflow, the authenticity of requests received by a webserver. The information of  many assets is stored, processed and transmitted by ICT products to meet the requirements  specified by the owner of the information.  Due to the CC security concept the information owner who wishes to minimise the risk to an  asset is exposed by imposing countermeasures. The selection of countermeasures depends on  the threats identified for the asset, consideration of the likelihood of the threat being realised  and the impact on the asset when a threat is realised. CC distinguishes between IT  countermeasures and non-IT countermeasures.  An example of a sector-specific standard for risk management of assets is EN ISO 14971:2019  Medical devices — Application of risk management to medical devices.  To become a CC evaluation body it is necessary to conform to the requirements written in EN  ISO/IEC 17025:2017. ISO/IEC 17000-series (17000:2020, 17020:2012, 17021:2015,  17024:2012, 17025:2017 and 17067:2013) is an international set of standards that mainly  provides from general concepts and principles for Conformity Assessment (CA) to guidelines,  good practices and requirements for bodies serving as certification authorities.  2.4.3 Management system certification  There are several international standards defining requirements for the certification of  management systems. The list includes:  • ISO 28000:2009: Specification for security management systems for the supply chain;  3 Common Criteria is abbreviated to CC.  4 A new edition is available as DIS.  An ICT product means an element or a group of elements of a network or information  system.  Definition from EU Cybersecurity Act  An ICT service means a service consisting fully or mainly in the transmission, storing,  retrieving or processing of information by means of network and information systems.  An ICT process means a set of activities performed to design, develop, deliver or maintain an  ICT product or ICT service.  Definition from EU Cybersecurity Act  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  16  • ISO 45001:2018 Occupational health and safety management systems; requirements  with guidance for use;  • EN ISO 50001:2018 which specifies requirements for establishing, implementing,  maintaining and improving an energy management system (EnMS);  • ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 Information technology — Service management — Part 1:  Service management system requirements;  • EN ISO/IEC 27001: 2017 Information technology - Security techniques - Information  security management systems5 – Requirements.  If an organisation intends to certify an ICT service or an ICT process or a group of these (called  ‘entity’ as of now), then it is suitable to define this entity as the scope of its management system.  On this basis, ICT services or ICT processes can be certified by assessing their conformity to  the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000 or EN ISO/IEC 27001.  When an organisation intends to achieve conformance with the requirements of a management  system standard such as EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017, the requirements addressing risk  management can be found in these clauses:  • 6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities  • 8.2 Information security risk assessment  • 8.3 Information security risk mitigation.  Whereas sub-clause 6.1.1 addresses high-level risks such as management system risks and  strategic risks, the sub-clauses 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 specify requirements regarding the management  of risk for the security of operational information.  ISO/IEC 27005 (Information security risk management) offers closely aligned support for  implementing the requirements for risk management in entities within the scope of the ISMS.  Furthermore, among others, the following standards are helpful:  • ISO 31000 – Risk management guidelines (general perspective)  • BSI 7799-3 –  Guidelines for information security risk management  • NIST SP 800-39 –  Managing Information Security Risk  • BSI Germany Standard 200-3 - Risk analysis based on IT-Grundschutz  Examples of sector-specific standards for risk management in the context of a management  system are:  • BS 31111:2018 Cyber risk and resilience: Guidance for the governing body and  executive management services (also useful for ICT product certification);  • ISO/FDIS 23314-2 Ships and marine technology — Ballast water management  systems (BWMS) — Part 2: Risk assessment and risk reduction of BWMS using  electrolytic methods;  • ASTM F3449-2 Standard Guide for Inclusion of Cyber Risks into Maritime Safety  Management Systems and services in Accordance with IMO Resolution MSC.428(98)- Cyber Risks and Challenges.  Conformance to ISO/IEC 27001 can be confirmed by certification bodies, which are accredited  in conformity with the families of standards ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006.  5 abbreviation: ISMS  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  17  3. BASELINE ANALYSIS  3.1 OBJECTIVES OF RISK MANAGEMENT  The main objective of risk management within an organisation is to determine possible  uncertainties or threats, to protect against resulting consequences and to permit the  achievement of business objectives.  The objectives of risk management can be derived from the overall objectives of the  organisation, its business and legal obligations.  These objectives must be clearly defined at the beginning of the risk management process.  These objectives must also be measurable in order to be able to verify their achievements. The  use of KPIs (key performance indicators) is recommended. The objectives must be related to  the assets of the entity that are to be protected against risks and their consequences.  These objectives are determined during the establishment of the context of a risk management  process (see Clause 3.3. Risk management process).  3.2 RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  The risk management process is the individual way in which an organisation addresses the  concept of risk and the relevant types of risk within itself. The risk management process is a  fundamental part of any organisation and has to be integrated into all relevant (business)  processes and activities, and if necessary – based on the type and nature of the business of the  organisation – on several layers.  If an organisation wants to achieve conformance with a management system standard (type A)  based on the ISO Directives, Annex SL, Appendix 2, the risk management process is one of the  fundamental and essential processes within the organisation within the scope of the  management system. Nevertheless, ISO 31000:2018 does not give guidance on a risk  management system but describes a risk management framework. EN ISO/IEC 27001:2018 is a  management system standard based on the Harmonised Framework and requires a risk  management process in clauses 6.1, 8.2 and 8.3.  Risk management may address individual types of risks, such as enterprise risk, market risk,  credit risk, operational risk, project risk, development risk, supply chain risk, infrastructure risk,  component risks or several of the risk types listed or all of them. This list is not exhaustive and  depending on the type of business an organisation has, additional types of risks may exist and  be of relevance.  In the context of this document which addresses cybersecurity and information security, these  types of risks have to be assessed in conjunction with the three properties of information  security – confidentiality, integrity and availability. For example, what consequences may arise  for market risk from a loss of integrity, or what consequences may arise for supply chain risk  from a loss of confidentiality, and so on?.  In the context of this document, the elements of the risk management process contained in ISO  31000:2018 will be applied to describe a possible implementation of a risk management  process within an organisation. Independent of the organisation’s actual implementation of its  risk management process, all activities outlined in ISO 31000:2018 will be more or less present,  independently of whether such a risk management process is integrated into an organisation  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  18  seeking conformance with EN ISO/IEC 27001:2018 or any other ISO management system  standard.  Scope, Context, Criteria  When establishing risk management within an organisation, the fundamental decisions  regarding the risk management process itself are made during the determination of the scope,  the context and the criteria.  Based on the scope of the risk management, different sub-processes using several risk  assessment methodologies may be applied within an organisation.  The scope may be derived from:  • the relevant internal and external interested parties;  • its level of application (strategic, operational, programme, project, supply-chain,  product development, software development);  • its inclusion into a formal management system;  • its relationships to other organisations, entities, activities, projects, processes;  • its objectives;  • the available resources (personnel, software tools, etc.)6.  6This list is not exhaustive.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  19  Risk management addressing information security or cybersecurity may also involve different  application domains:  • critical infrastructure (health, electricity, communication etc.);  • sensitive data;  • supply chain.  When it comes to the context, this may depend on:  • the interested parties (external and internal),  • the objectives and activities of the organisation,  • the purpose of the risk management,  • the integration into an existing risk management framework or management system.  During the determination of the criteria in this early stage of establishing risk management, the  organisation, based on the previous results of determining the scope and the context, also  determines:  • the type of risk it is managing,  • the risk assessment methodology to apply,  • the criteria for evaluation the risks,  • the criteria for accepting risk.  Thereafter, the risk criteria as determined have significant consequences on the subsequent  activities of a risk management process, such as risk assessment and risk mitigation.  Risk assessment  Risk assessment is most commonly composed of threats identification, threats evaluation, risk  analysis and risk evaluation (see Figure 1).  Depending on the decisions taken during the scope, context and criteria activities, different  methodologies may be implemented for different types of risks and for different layers.  Threats identification is the activity of finding and describing threats systematically and should  consider the following factors:  • sources of risk,  • causes and events,  • threats and vulnerabilities,  • emerging risks and threats,  • nature and value of assets,  • consequences and impact on processes and assets7.  During risk analysis, the factors listed above are used to comprehend the nature and the level of  a threat or risk based on factors such as:  • the likelihood of an event, threat or risk;  • the magnitude of consequences triggered by an event, threat or risk;  • the complexity including possible links, dependencies and cascading effects;  7This list is not exhaustive.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  20  • the effectiveness of existing controls;  • time-related factors such as volatility or the period under consideration.  The results of the risk analysis provide the input to the risk evaluation in which the results from  the risk analysis are compared to the previously established risk criteria including the criteria for  the acceptance of risk. These results may be calculated based on criteria for consequence and  likelihood, or by using other means such a heat maps or tables.  Risk treatment  Risk treatment (as defined in, among others, ISO 31000) is the activity of selecting an adequate  option for treating risks that are above a previously defined acceptable risk level.  These options are:  • avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to  the risk;  • taking or increasing the risk in order to pursue an opportunity;  • mitigating the source of the risk;  • changing the likelihood;  • changing the impacts and consequences;  • sharing the risk (e.g. through contracts, buying insurance);  • retaining the risk through an informed decision.8  The selected risk treatment option must be approved by the risk owner and documented. Based  on this decision, a risk treatment plan shall be formulated and approved by the risk owner, and  implemented according to the project plan included in the risk treatment plan.  A risk treatment plan and the newly introduced controls may result in new risks or threats that  need to be addressed separately.  The other elements of Figure 1 (Communication and Consultation, Recording and Reporting,  Monitoring and Review) are, in the context of this document, considered not to be part of the  risk management process but rather established parts of a management system based on an  ISO management system standard and are therefore not covered in this document.  Note: risk treatment that deals with negative consequences is sometimes referred to as risk  mitigation’.  3.3 USE OF STANDARDS IN RISK MANAGEMENT  When integrating the concept of risk management into its organisation, an entity is looking for  appropriate approaches that are adequate for their business and the scope and the objective of  their risk management efforts.  Organisations may decide that they need an overall enterprise risk management to address all  types of risks (such as operational risk, market risks, supply chain risks, project risks or strategic  risks) or just a specific type of risk (see examples of risks previously stated).  For these different scopes and objects, and specific to the organisations’ main business  activities, different risk assessment and treatment models may be used.  8This list is from ISO 31000: 2018, Clause 6.5.2  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  21  Thus, organisations may wish to learn from other organisations in their field of business and try  to establish approaches to best practices that seem to fit them and others in their discipline or  field of activities.  Based on this goal, it is common to find that risk assessment or risk treatment models for  specific sectors or businesses are developed by sector associations or interest groups. Many  times, these sector or discipline-specific models evolve into international standards by  forwarding their results to the technical committee of an international or European  standardisation organisation.  Being considered as a standard by an international community of experts and thereby gaining  wider attention and improvement, enables additional organisations to find adequate solutions to  fulfil their needs regarding the assessment and treatment of risks.  Such standards can provide generic guidance on terminology, principles, process models and  treatment options (e.g. ISO 31000) as well as detailed descriptions of risk assessment models  (e.g. ISO/IEC 31010, ISO/IEC 27005).  Applying these different standards at different levels of an organisation can enhance the  reproducibility of results, enable the comparison of different organisations and support the  evaluation of the processes involved and their results within an organisation. Applying the same  standard within a discipline or sector also provides the ability to benchmark one organisation  against another or against an average for a sector or an entire discipline.  Standards, in principle, also enable organisations to estimate and compare the suitability, the  effectiveness, the efficiency and the coverage of individual models and methods for a specific  sector or discipline of a business and thereby support organisations in choosing an adequate  standard for integration into their organisation.  Not only standards that especially address and describe risk assessment and risk treatment  methods are important for the integration of the concept of risk management into an  organisation. Widely accepted management system standards, such as ISO 9001 (Quality  management system), ISO 14001 (Environmental management system) and ISO/IEC 27001  (Information security management system), have the concept of risk awareness integrated in  their requirements and thus mandate the concept of risk management should an organisation  claim conformance to these management system standards.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  22  4. STANDARDS AND  METHODOLOGIES  4.1 RISK ASSESSMENT STANDARDS  Standards are developed and defined through a process of sharing knowledge and building  consensus among technical experts nominated by interested parties and other stakeholders.  When it comes to developing and establishing standards, there is a large variety of players.  Naturally, there is competition between these players but they also cooperate in many  instances, in particular when there is a common interest.  Standards are voluntary which means that there is no automatic legal obligation to apply them.  However, laws and regulations may refer to standards and even make compliance with them  compulsory.  The following sections:  • provide a brief introduction to the main players when it comes to standards in the area  of risk management;  • introduce the main characteristics of the different document types published by these  players;  • introduce the inventory of risk management standards as presented in Annex A of this  document.  4.1.1 European SDOs (ESOs) and European Standards  European Standards (ENs) are documents that have been ratified by one of the three European  Standardisation Organisations (ESOs), CEN, CENELEC or ETSI, and are recognised as  competent in the area of voluntary technical standardisation in accordance with EU Regulation  1025/2012.  • CEN, the European Committee for Standardization, reflects the economic and social  interests of 34 CEN Member countries channelled through their national  standardisation organisations and provides a platform for the development of  European standards and other technical documents in relation to a wide range of fields  and sectors including air and space, consumer products, defence and security, energy,  health and safety, ICT, machinery, services, smart living, and transport.  • CENELEC is the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation and is  responsible for standardisation in the electro-technical engineering field.  • ETSI addresses the ICT domain with particular focus on the communications aspects  for connected devices and the networks that connect them.  A European Standard (EN) ‘carries with it the obligation to be implemented at national level by  being given the status of a national standard and by the withdrawal of any conflicting national  standard’. Therefore, a European Standard (EN) automatically becomes a national standard in  each of the 34 CEN-CENELEC member countries.  ESO deliverables also include the following.  • CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement (CWA): a CWA is a CEN-CENELEC  agreement, developed by a workshop, which reflects the agreement of identified  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  23  individuals and organisations responsible for its contents. A CWA does not have the  status of a European Standard and CEN-CENELEC national members are not obliged  to withdraw national standards in conflict with a CWA.  • ETSI Standard (ETSI ES) and ETSI Guide (ETSI EG) are ETSI deliverables adopted  after weighted voting by ETSI members.  • An ETSI Technical Specification (ETSI TS) and an ETSI Technical Report (ETSI TR)  are ETSI deliverables adopted by the responsible Technical Body.  Within the three European SDOs, CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 13 ‘Cybersecurity  and Data Protection’ (CEN-CLC JTC 13) has published several standards in the area of risk  management (see Annex A), most of them having been adopted from SC 27 publications.  ENISA maintains a strong liaison with JTC 13 and maintains regular contact.  4.1.2 International SDOs and Standards  An International Standard (IS) is a document that has been developed through the consensus of  experts from many countries and has been approved and published by one of the globally  recognised international SDOs:  ISO: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent  international organisation, with a membership of 165 national standards bodies, that  develops voluntary, consensus-based international standards. Within ISO, TC 292  provides a family of standards in the area of risk management (e.g. ISO 31000) while  most cybersecurity related activities take place within subcommittee SC 27 of Joint  (with IEC) Technical Committee 1 (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27). ENISA liaises with SC 27  and maintains regular contact.  • IEC: the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) develops international  standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies.  • ITU (the International Telecommunication Union): has a Study Group SG17 – Security  where areas of cybersecurity are discussed. Currently this SDO is relatively less  advanced in the field of cybersecurity and thus can be considered as a secondary  priority.  Deliverables also include:  • Technical Specifications: a Technical Specification (TS) developed by an international  SDO addresses work still under technical development, or where it is believed that it  will eventually be transformed and republished as an International Standard.  • Technical Reports: a Technical Report (TR) is more informal than an IS or TS; it may,  for example, include data from an informative report or information on the perceived  ‘state of the art’.  4.1.3 National standardisation bodies and specialised agencies  National standardisation bodies and specialised agencies in the EU are also directly  represented in the ESOs and, in many instances, their national publications eventually become  European Norms or International Standards. However, the inventory established in Annex A of  this document refers to several risk management standards available solely from national  standardisation bodies and specialised agencies. Examples of such bodies include the  following.  • BSI: the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany is a national cyber  security authority, promoting IT security in Germany and also developing cybersecurity  standards and guidelines. BSI standards and technical reports are available at no cost  from www.bsi.bund.de.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  24  • NIST: the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is part of the US  Department of Commerce. Its Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is one of six  research laboratories within NIST. ITL has seven divisions including the Applied  Cybersecurity Division (ACD) and the Computer Security Division (CSD), both  developing cybersecurity standards and guidelines. CSD publications include the Risk  Management Framework NIST SP 800-37. NIST standards and guidelines are  available at no cost from www.nist.gov.  • ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’information), the French  National Cybersecurity Agency has been involved in risk management methodology  and processes. In particular ANSSI has been promoting the EBIOS risk manager  methodology.  4.1.4 Industrial bodies  Industrial bodies and fora are not considered formally as SDOs; however, they offer de-facto  standards in certain areas including risk management. Where applicable, the output of industrial  bodies is included in the inventory established in Annex A of this document.  As an example, OASIS began as a consortium of vendors and users and today is a large non- profit standards organisation advancing projects for, among others, cybersecurity, blockchain,  IoT, emergency management, and cloud computing. OASIS often submits specifications  produced by its TCs to other standards bodies (e.g. ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU-T, ETSI) for additional  ratification.  In particular, the OASIS TC Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for  Cyber Security aims to create standards that implement the course of action playbook model for  cybersecurity operations.  A second example is the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Standards Association  (IEEE SA), an entity within IEEE that develops global standards in a broad range of areas. As  with OASIS, some IEEE specifications are submitted to ‘official’ SDOs for additional ratification,  such as IEEE/ISO/IEC 16085:2020 - Systems and software engineering - Life cycle processes -  Risk management.  Important work in the area of risk management is also undertaken by GSMA,  4.1.5 The Risk Management Standards Inventory  Annex A of this document provides an inventory of almost fifty identified standards which relate  to risk management. The documents are characterised by:  • document source, e.g. national standard, European standard, international standard;  • document type, e.g. standard, technical specification, technical report;  • document scope, e.g. risk management vocabulary and guides, risk management  requirements, risk management evaluation methodology.  The inventory also provides information about applicable technical domains, document history,  and relevancy to EU legislation.  The following standards in the inventory are considered most relevant for risk management in  the context of information and cybersecurity and are thus labelled ‘Risk management’ in column  E (document scope) of the table.  • ISO/IEC 27005 – Information security risk management  This document was developed using ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 and provides general  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  25  guidelines for information security risk management in an organisation without  promoting any specific risk management method.  • ISO 31000 – Risk management guidelines  This document was developed by ISO TC 292 and provides principles, a framework  and a process for managing risk from a general perspective. The Australian and New  Zealand version AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 is identical to and reproduced from ISO  31000:2009.  • BSI 7799-3 – Guidelines for information security risk management.  • NIST SP 800-39 – Managing Information Security Risk  This document developed by NIST provides guidance for an integrated, organisation- wide programme for managing information security risk to organisational operations.  • BSI Germany Standard 200-3 – Risk analysis based on IT-Grundschutz  This methodology developed by the German Federal Office for Information Security  demonstrates how the threats listed in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues can be used to  carry out a simplified analysis of risks for information processing.  4.1.6 Risk management methodologies and tools  The main goal of risk management is (in general) to protect ICT products (software, hardware,  systems, components, services) and business assets, and minimise costs in cases of failures.  Thus it represents a core duty for successful business or IT management. Hence, risk  management describes a key activity for security within organisations and it is essentially based  on the experience and knowledge of methods of best practice and the tools that can be used.  These methods consist of an estimation of the risk situation based on the business process  models and the infrastructure within the organisation. In this context, these models support the  identification of potential risks and the development of appropriate protective measures. The  major focus lies on companies and the identification, analysis and evaluation of threats to their  respective corporate values.  The outcome of a risk analysis is in most cases a list of risks or threats to a system, together  with the corresponding probabilities. International standards in the field of risk management are  used to support the identification of these risks or threats as well as to assess their respective  probabilities. These standards (see Annex A) range from general considerations and guidelines  for risk management processes to specific guidelines for the IT sector (all the way to highly  specific frameworks as, for example, in the maritime sector. Most of these standards specify  framework conditions for the process of risk management but rarely go into detail on specific  methods for the analysis or assessment of risk. This is one reason differences in the  assessment of risk often arise within specific areas of application, making a direct comparison of  the results difficult.  In practice, choosing the right method and the right tool for the analysis and evaluation of risk  proves to be complicated. In recent years, a number of concepts, algorithms and tools have  evolved from research, which have been especially designed to protect the ICT infrastructure  and related systems. Since their historical background is settled in a business context, in these  methods a quantitative risk assessment is usually performed based on monetary costs (e.g.  EBIOS method and the aforementioned ISO / IEC 27005:2013 standard). In this context, most  of the methods and tools just use the commonly known rule of thumb ‘risk = probability x  potential damage’. Depending on the applied method, the terms and scales for the assessment  of the probabilities as well as the potential damage are predefined (such as in the NIST policy or  in the Mehari method).  In order to structure the process of risk assessment, various attempts have been made to use a  Bayesian approach for determining threat probabilities. For example the OCTAVE method is  based on subjectively estimated probabilities and thus can be understood as an apriori  distribution with regards to the Bayesian approach. The OCTAVE method uses UML as a  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  26  modelling language and represents a comprehensive collection of tools and best practice  methods for risk management. The ‘BowTie’ is a traditional widely used qualitative risk analysis  method. The CORAS method allows the integration of several different risk assessment  processes, whereas the identification of the probability of an attack is not done automatically but  apriori to any risk assessment.  Contrary to the aforementioned general and IT-specific guidelines for risk management, security  and risk management in various sectors emphasise different aspects in the RM methods. For  example, the maritime sector traditionally lays a big emphasis on physical and object security. In  particular, the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code define a set of  measures to enhance the security of port facilities and ships. It is only this year that IMO  published RM guidelines for the cyber assets of ships.  A sole focus on physical security is not sufficient any more in any sector due to the digitalisation  and security of the cyber-physical systems becoming equally important. Thus RM need to cover  all aspects. In this section we will present the main RM methodologies in terms of their main  characteristics, usability, resources needed, standards applies and implementation aspects  (supported by tools).  As explained in section 2.3, there are three options for the risk management analysis of  methodologies.  Option 1: Methodology is used to achieve conformance to a standard (referencing in part  or in whole to a certain standard and its requirements).  Expression des Besoins et Identification des Objectifs de Sécurité (EBIOS) Risk Manager  EBIOS Risk Manager is an information security risk management method, created under the  French General Secretariat of National Defence, consistent with ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC  27005, and enables the risk management requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 to be met.  • It allows to:  o establish the context (objectives, scope, critical and supporting assets on  which they are based, etc.) and deal with standard and accidental risks by  assessing compliance with the rules to which organisations have committed  themselves;  o assess targeted and sophisticated risks:   by studying and reconciling the points of view of the attacker  (sources of risk) and the defender (feared events, sources of risk  and their intended objectives);   by successive refinements (strategic scenarios studying the possible  attack paths of the sources of risk through the ecosystem of  stakeholders, and operational scenarios studying in detail the attack  chains that allow them to be implemented in practice);   estimating their severity and likelihood;  o deal with them in a proportionate manner, allowing the various components of  the risks identified to be dealt with as the studies are carried out and  completing the coverage of the risks in a coherent manner through an action  plan;  o accept the residual risks through a decision informed by the previous steps;  o communicate risks, as it is participatory and involves several stakeholders  (management, business, IT, security, legal, communication, etc.), and provide  intelligible results to the recipients of the studies;  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  27  o monitor and review risks as a principle of continuous improvement, by  identifying the risks to be monitored and by providing for the conditions for  updating the studies.  • More than a method, it is a methodology used as a toolbox whose terminology,  techniques, sequence, knowledge bases and manner of presenting the results will be  adjusted according to the object of the study (an entire organisation, a specific system,  a technical component, etc.) and its context.  Method for the Harmonised Analysis of Risk (MAGERIT)  Magerit is an open methodology for risk analysis and management developed by the Spanish  Higher Council for Electronic Government and offered as a framework and guide to the public  administration. It is the answer to the increasing dependency of public and private organisations  on information technologies to fulfil their mission and reach their business objectives.  Magerit users undertake the responsibility running the risk analysis process via workshops and  interviews, with specific representatives of the organisation participating only in specific phases  of the assessment process. It is compliant with  ISO/IEC 27005, covers all the requirements  defined by the ISO/IEC 27001, and conforms with the code of implementation of an ISMS  specified by ISO/IEC 27002:2005.  Option 2: Methodology is given as a standard and can be used to achieve conformance  to a standard and its requirements.  NIST 800-30 Methodology  NIST 800-30 is a free guide that provides a foundation for the development of an effective risk  management programme, containing both the definitions and the practical guidance necessary  for assessing and mitigating risks identified within IT systems. The ultimate goal is to help  mostly large scale organisations (such as governmental agencies and large companies) to  better manage risks associated with IT-related missions.  The method is compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001.  Option 3: Methodology is a set of good practices but not related to any standard and not  used to achieve conformance.  Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) Method  OCTAVE is a free of charge approach to evaluations of information security risk that is  comprehensive, systematic, context-driven, and self-directed. The approach is embodied in a  set of criteria that define the essential elements of an asset-driven evaluation of an information  security risk.  CCTA Risk Assessment and Management Methodology (CRAMM)  CRAMM is a method that an analyst or group of analysts may use to evaluate the security and  risk level of an organisation by analysing and combining the diverse knowledge distributed in  the local corporate environment. The computational method and technique that has been  adopted by CRAMM for the correlation and the determination of the results is quite primitive and  is based on a qualitative approach. CRAMM complies with the rules and obligations imposed by  the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.  IT-Grundschutz  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  28  IT-Grundschutz has been developed by the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany.  IT-Grundschutz provides a configuration for the establishment of an integrated and effective IT  security management. The method, before starting the risk analysis, involves a basic security  check to verify the security measures that have been implemented. Risk assessment identifies  the threats which have not been avoided by the measures, such as residual threats.  These threats can be eliminated by additional security measures. In this way, risk will be  reduced to an acceptable level. IT-Grundschutz adopts a qualitative risk analysis approach that  is associated with a primitive computational technique for the analysis and correlation of the  assessment information. The method is compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 as it addresses the  defined requirements as well as being suitable for the implementation of the ISMS process  described in ISO/IEC 27002.  MEHARI  MEHARI is a free of charge qualitative risk analysis and management method developed by  CLUSIF (Club for the Security of Information in France/Club de la Sécurité de l'Information  Français). MEHARI provides a consistent methodology, with appropriate knowledge bases such  as manuals and guides that describe the different modules (stakes, risks, vulnerabilities) that  has been designed to assist people involved in security management (CISOs, risk managers,  auditors, CIOs), in their various tasks and actions. The methodology is suitable for the  implementation of the ISMS process described by ISO/IEC 27001.  Information Security Assessment and Monitoring Method (ISAMM)  ISAMM is a quantitative type of risk management methodology that can be applied by various  organisations such as governmental agencies, large companies and small and medium size  enterprises. ISAMM is compliant with ISO/IEC 27002 and provides maximal support of the  ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS standard. It is also supported by a freeware tool.  4.2 OTHER SYSTEMS AND TOOLS SUPPORTING RM  Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder (BCEB) is a self-assessment tool to help  organisations better understand the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management efforts  and identity opportunities for improvement in the context of their overall performance.  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for  publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. It is a list of publicly disclosed  computer security flaws with a CVE ID number assigned by a CVE numbering authority (CNA).  There are about 100 CNAs, representing major ICT vendors, security companies and research  organisations. MITRE also issues CVEs directly. A single complex ICT product, such as an  operating system, can accumulate many CVEs.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for communicating the  characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS is well suited as a standard  measurement system for industries, organisations and governments that need accurate and  consistent vulnerability severity scores.  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a synthesis of interoperable specifications  derived from community ideas. This site contains information about both existing SCAP  specifications and emerging specifications relevant to NIST's security automation agenda.  OWASP threat modelling tool is an open source tool that works to identify, communicate and  understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value. Threat  modelling can be applied to a wide range of things, including software, applications, systems,  networks, distributed systems, things in the Internet of things, business processes, etc.  https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  29  Factors Analysis in Information Risk (FAIR Privacy) is a quantitative privacy risk framework  based on FAIR (Factors Analysis in Information Risk). FAIR Privacy examines personal privacy  risks (to individuals), not organisational risks. Included in this tool is a PowerPoint deck  illustrating the components of FAIR Privacy and an example based on the US Census. In  addition, an Excel spreadsheet provides a powerful risk calculator using Monte Carlo simulation.  SRAQ Online Risk Calculator adopts a technical approach to RA; it covers four areas:  identification of threats; development of  system diagrams; recommendation of controls; creation  of risk treatment plan.  Vulnerability registers and databases underpin the success of risk assessment which relies on  these registers and databases and on the formats, metrics and procedures used in these registers  and databases. They play an important role in the assessment and management of risk since  they provide a unique identifier for each vulnerability, a structured and machine-readable format  for the information and, typically, a number of references to fixes and patches. There are global  registers such as MITRE CVE, NVD and CNNVD as well as national and commercial registries  but no EU registry.  Sector specific prototypes for RM tools have been developed in various EC H2020 projects.  These include the following.  CYSM emphasises the protection of port facilities, based on the provision of a dynamic risk  management methodology for ports’ CII considering their physical-cyber nature. It implements  ISO 27001, ISO27005 and ISPS. The CYSM RA tool is based on a set of interactive and  collaborative technologies.  MEDUSA focuses on the protection of the port supply chain. It defines a methodological  approach to the identification of the multi-order dependencies of security incidents and risks,  within the scope of multi-sector cross-border scenarios. It is reflected in the provision of support  for ISO28000. MEDUSA is based on a set of visualisation tools and techniques to model and  simulate the supply chain scenarios of ports.  MITIGATE enhances CYSM and Medusa towards protecting port facilities within the scope of  interacting supply chains. MITIGATE adopts an evidence-driven maritime supply chain risk  assessment model in order to capture and deal with cascading effects risks, threats and  vulnerabilities, associated with the ICT-based maritime supply chain. It implements ISO 27001,  ISO27005 and IOS28000 and incorporates a set of ICT technologies, including semantic web  technologies (for ontology management, context management and profiling), cloud computing  and BigData and crowd-sourcing technologies (i.e. in order to collect and analyse open  information from public resources)  Cyberwatching Cyber Risk Temperature Tool is a tool developed for SMEs so they can  easily identify threats and estimate their risks.  RESISTO implements an innovative decision support system to protect communication  infrastructures from combined cyber-physical threats exploiting the Software De-fined Security  model on a suite of state-of-the-art cyber-physical security components (Blockchain, Machine  Learning, IoT security, Airborne threat detection, holistic audio-video analytics) and services.  FINSEC is a tool box that can be used by the financial sector. It implements an RA methodology  based on the enhancement and integration of various existing tools for anomaly detection, AI  CCTV analytics, risk assessment engines, collaborative analysis and management of risk.  There are global registers such as MITRE CVE, NVD, CNNVD. Many MSs have their own  registries (national and regional) that are not connected or interoperable as has been realised  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  30  through an on-going study by ENISA on ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Policies and Vulnerability  Databases’. Moreover, there is no EU registry that all EU vendors can use to report new  vulnerabilities. The national and regional registries are neither interoperable nor connected.  4.3 PRACTICAL USE OF STANDARDS AND METHODOLOGIES  Risk management standards and methodologies can be used for several purposes in an entity:  • Setting up or reinforcing a management process for the digital risk within an  organisation,  • Assessing and treating the risks relating to a digital project, in particular with the aim of  a security accreditation,  • Defining the level of security to be achieved for a product or service according to its  particular uses and the risks to be countered, from the perspective of certification or  accreditation for example.  Before going on to the different steps of a practical implementation, it is important to understand  the two main actors of the ICR possible risks, threat agent and the asset  1) The flow from threat agent to exposure of the asset  This diagram illustrates the various steps and causal relationship between the threat agent and  the exposure of the asset, which is commonly known as a ‘cyberattack’. The risk management  and the associated methodology and tools are a set of requirements to be followed to estimate  the level of risk that an entity is facing.  2) The threat agents can have different aspects and levels, depending on the value of the  targeted assets.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  31  It is interesting to see the evaluation of bank branches in the 1980s. The bank offices had  several security functions that people had to go through before being able to enter the office.  The asset to protected was the physical money. The banks performed risk analysis and realised  that the only asset to be protected was the physical money and so they removed it from the  hands of the employees. Now you can enter in any bank without going through any security  functions as the physical money is managed by the ATM and bank employees don’t have  access to it.  This example illustrates why it is important to first identify the assets that are to be protected. If  there is no asset then there is no risk.  The necessary steps to be conducted by any entity when starting its risk analysis can be  summarised as below):  • Item 1: Identification of the critical assets (data, material, place, people);  • Item 2: Identification of the threats of these critical assets;  • Item 3: Definition of the occurrence and the importance of this threats to calculate a rate of risk;  • item 4: Decision on risk mitigation (reduce, accept, transfer);  • Item 5: Planification of business continuity plan and business resumption plan;  • Item 6: Definition of the IT cartography or the product usage environment.  In order to perform these six steps, the practical use of the ISO/IEC 27005 Risk Management  Standard associated with the EBIOS RM assessment methodology can be applied. As the  EBIOS Risk Management Assessment methodology9 is based on the ISO/IEC 27005 and fully  compliant, the entity does not have to know the ISO/IEC 27005 standard to perform its Risk  mitigation analysis.  The EBIOS RM methodology adopts an iterative approach that revolves around five workshops.  9 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2019/11/anssi-guide-ebios_risk_manager-en-v1.0.pdf - all subsequent images that relate  to EBIOS RM are derived from this document, published by ANSSI  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2019/11/anssi-guide-ebios_risk_manager-en-v1.0.pdf  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  32  Figure 1 — An iterative approach in five workshops - Source ANSSI  WORKSHOP 1  Scope and  security  baseline  The first workshop aims to identify the studied object, the participants in the workshops  and the timeframe. During this workshop, you will list the missions, business assets and  supporting assets related to the studied object. You identify the feared events associated  with the business assets and assess the severity of their impacts. You also define the  security baseline.  WORKSHOP 2  Risk origins  In the second workshop, you identify and characterise the risk origins (RO) and their  high-level targets, called target objectives (TO). The RO/TO pairs deemed the most  relevant are selected at the end of this workshop. The results are formalised in a  mapping of the risk origins.  WORKSHOP 3  Strategic  scenarios  In workshop 3, you will get a clear view of the ecosystem and stablish a mapping of the  digital threat of the latter with respect to the studied object. This will allow you to  construct high-level scenarios, called strategic scenarios.  They represent the attack paths that a risk origin is likely to take to reach its target. These  scenarios are designed at the scale of the ecosystem and the business assets of the  studied object. They are assessed in terms of severity.  At the end of this workshop, you can already define the security measures on the  ecosystem.  WORKSHOP 4  Operational  scenarios  The purpose of workshop 4 is to construct technical scenarios that include the methods  of attack that are likely to be used by the risk origins to carry out the strategic scenarios.  This workshop adopts an approach similar to the one in the preceding workshop but  focuses on critical supporting assets. You then assess the level of likelihood of the  operational scenarios obtained.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  33  NOTE:  1) Workshops 3 and 4 are naturally applied during successive iterations.  2) Workshops 2, 3 and 4 make it possible to assess the risks, which constitute the last  stage of the digital risk management pyramid. They use the security baseline according  to different attack paths, which are relevant with regards to the threats considered and in  a limited number in order to facilitate the analysis.  WORKSHOP 5  Risk mitigation  The last workshop consists in creating a summary of all of the risks studied in order to  define a risk mitigation strategy. The latter is then broken down into security measures  written into a continuous improvement plan. During this workshop, you establish a  summary of the residual risks and define the framework for monitoring risks.  This series of five iterative workshops is summarised here below:  Figure 2: Link between the various workshop – source EBIOS RM - ANSSI  To support and implement this methodology you can use a simple table file. Some software  editors also provide dedicated software that is available in Software as a Service mode or local  mode.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  34  5. RESULTS OF THE  ANALYSIS  This section analyses the gaps and overlaps between the risk management standards  determined in section 4.1.5.  When analysing the documents discussed earlier, the distinction between risk management  standards and risk management methodologies becomes quite obvious. The relevant standards  are:  • ISO/IEC 27005 – Information security risk management,  • ISO 31000 – Risk management guidelines,  • BSI 7799-3 – Guidelines for information security risk management,  • NIST SP 800-39 – Managing information security risk,  • BSI Germany Standard 200-3 – Risk analysis based on IT-Grundschutz.  Their analysis in this section is performed from various perspectives:  • concepts, terms and definitions,  • risk criteria,  • areas of application,  • ICT,  • level of application,  • European vs international technical specifications,  • EU legislation vs standards.  Concepts, terms and definitions  All the identified risk management standards have influenced each other over the years. The  concepts, terms and definitions related to risk management outlined in ISO 31000 have been  incorporated in all of these other documents in more or less the same way.  Slight deviations exist depending whether the risk management standards analysed are more  related to or in support of management system standards based on ISO Directives or those  based on a risk management framework according to ISO 31000. This difference becomes  quite obvious when reading the diverging definitions of risk, but this distinction has no real-life  implications and can be viewed as a rather academic issue.  The risk management methodologies and tools do diverge to a much greater extend from each  other. This can mostly be attributed to the fact that these methodologies and tools have been  developed by different entities addressing different audiences and their needs. Not every  methodology or tool is universally applicable to any type or size of organisation and its scope.  In the ENISA report Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessments 2021 an overview of  terms is provided, along with an interpretation of the meaning of each term according to the  normative references found in ISO/IEC 270xx. In addition, how these definitions should be  understood and used in the context of the specification of security and assurance is explained.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  35  Risk Criteria  All risk management standards recommend the determination of risk criteria, although no  recommendation or requirement regarding the criteria themselves or the necessary levels or  threshold values are stated. According to the risk management standards, this remains a task  for the organisation implementing risk management.  The risk management methodologies and tools may have outlined these risk criteria – including  the levels and threshold values – within their content. Depending on the audience for a  methodology or tool, these criteria can be defined exactly for the specific area of application,  such as a specific business sector.  The various RA methodologies adopt different measurement and scales so as a result risk  levels estimates cannot be compared. These differences lead to selecting and implementing  different controls (some of them costlier that others) to mitigate the same risks. This problem  affects certification efforts as well. CVSS3.0 is being used broadly for scoring the severity of  vulnerabilities; however, it has not been adopted by all stakeholders.  Areas of application  All the risk management standards that have been identified can be applied by any organisation  in any business sector as these standards provide guidance on the framework for risk  management.  The situation is similar for organisations implementing risk management in the context of a  management system when seeking conformance to a management system standard.  Some methodologies and tools may be applicable only to a specific business sector. Others  also address ICT-risk from a cross-sector perspective.  The transversal standards intend to cover a large set of domains by being as generic and  reusable as possible. This is the case of standards developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 (ISO/IEC  27000 family, ISO/IEC 15408/18045) or by CEN CENELEC EN 17640 FITCEM or ETSI EN 303  645. Despite this fact it appears that for specific domains (automotive, aeronautics and space,  energy, sustainable industry, supply chain etc.), these standards are not sufficient and must be  supplemented with additional security requirements, and evaluation and assessment methods.  This can be due to specific features, regulations, user requirements or technology constraints.  ICT  There are many standards on ICT security (e.g. ISO/IEC 11770-3:2021) that provide accurate  technical information to ensure the security of ICT mechanisms and also several sector-specific  standards due to ISO /IEC 27002 Code of Practice for information security controls, e.g.  ISO/IEC 27011. They support managing ICT security risks by offering appropriate technology  and related mechanisms but they are not risk management standards.  ETSI TS T02 165-1 (2017) is a technical specification which defines a method for analysing the  risks of information and communications technology (ICT) systems using the threat, vulnerability  and risk analysis (TVRA) methodology. Primarily, this is a guidance for analysing threats  applicable to and vulnerabilities identified in a target of evaluation considered within the  Common Criteria evaluation methodology (ISO/IEC 15408 family). But there is no equivalent  standard considering ICT systems in a more general context.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  36  There are several sector-specific standards due to ISO /IEC 27002 Code of Practice for  information security controls, e.g. ISO/IEC 27011 (Code of practice for Information security  controls based on ISO/IEC 27002 for telecommunications organisations) and ISO/IEC 27017  (Code of practice for information security controls based on ISO/IEC 27002 for cloud services).  There are some standards applying risk management to technology, e.g. ISO 14971 (Medical  devices — Application of risk management to medical devices) and ISO 17666 (Space systems  — Risk management). But there is a gap due to the absence of a standard applying risk  management to ICT devices, ICT services and ICT processes to support the assessment and  treatment of corresponding risks.  The following results can be observed in several organisations:  1. Lack of coordination and alignment between the divisions responsible for business risk  management or information security management and ICT staff regarding risk  management;  2. Lack of conformity with regard to risk management language and the application of risk  management between the divisions responsible for business risk management or  information security management and ICT staff.  Level of application  As risk management standards only provide guidance on the framework, these standards can  be used by the whole of a legal entity10 from the perspective of its business, its services or  products, or be limited to its IT-operation only.  Depending on the audience and the intended use of a methodology or tool, similar  organisational levels can be addressed. Some tools cover all aspects of a management system  – such as management system risks, strategic risk and operational risks – others only address  operational risk for ICT-operations.  European vs international technical specifications  Out of the five risk management standards as determined, two are published by ISO, whereas  three standards are published by individual countries. None of these publications have any legal  basis throughout the European Union.  The situation poses similar problems regarding methodologies and tools.  Section 4.1.5 has identified ISO 31000 Risk Management Guidelines and ISO/IEC 27005  Information Security Risk Management as being the most relevant risk management standards  in the international domain, providing basic principles and generic guidelines. Unlike many other  international cybersecurity standards which have been adopted as European Norms, such  adoption has not happened in these two cases; however ISO 31000 was, for example, adopted  as a regional standard for Australia and New Zealand.  EU legislation versus standards  The EU’s NIS directive uses its own definition of risk which is not aligned with any of the other  definitions. For example, The definition of ‘risk’ is not uniform between the NIS directive and  ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27005. This issue may be rather academic but it can also create  some difficulties in bridging the regulatory context and the standardisation context.  10 From the perspective of management system standards, the organisation is always related to the scope of the  management system – and its risk management –  and the distinction between ‘legal organisation’ and ‘IT-operation’ is  incorrect.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  37  The risk-based approach is promoted in most of the recent efforts on digital legislation. As an  example, the IA Act defines four levels of risk: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and  minimal risk. To classify these four levels, an agreed quotation methodology should be  developed and, as of today, no standard is available nor is one in preparation.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  38  6. RECOMMENDATIONS  Basing on the analysis provided in section 5, we propose the following recommendations on the  use of risk management standards for various groups of stakeholders.  6.1 EU POLICY MAKERS  Recommendation 1:  EU policy makers should use risk management standards that have already been adopted in  future regulatory publications.  Note: This requires the successful implementation of recommendation 8.  Recommendation 2:  EU policy makers should make particular risk assessment methodologies or tools mandatory for  specific sectors, where and when necessary.  Recommendation 3:  When no risk management standard or risk assessment methodology or tool is appropriate for a  specific sector, EU policy makers should issue a request for standardisation to ESOs to cover  this need.  As an example – a European standard for a methodology for the assessment of ICT security is  missing. Such a European standard would allow a coherent approach to be made to comply  with the risk management obligation set out in different existing and upcoming cybersecurity  pieces of legislation. This methodology should be based on the ISO/IEC 27005 Information  security risk management and ISO/IEC ISO.IEC 31000 – Risk management guidelines.  Recommendation 4:  In the context of the Cybersecurity Act, one of the crucial actions should consist in verifying  whether European standards to apply risk management to ICT devices, ICT services and ICT  processes, which aim to support the assessment and treatment of corresponding risks, actually  exist. Otherwise, the EU Policy makers should issue a request for standardisation to ESOs to  cover this need.  Recommendation 5:  Cybersecurity education and practical skills need to be aligned and embedded in all educational  stages (from early childhood to lifelong learning) and during the whole professional life. All  educational enterprises in the MSs and all EU citizens from all sectors (e.g. health, government,  transport, finance, defence) need to have the opportunity to practice in national or clustered EU  cyber ranges to assess their skills. Risk management, based on the recognised standards, should  become one of the main topics of these activities.  Recommendation 6:  An ad hoc working group should be set up (preferably by ENISA) to determine some criteria to  define the levels of risks mentioned in European legislation (e.g. Artificial Intelligence Act). This  ad hoc working group should provide the necessary risk tools to compute the estimation of the  risk and to classify the results accordingly to the levels identified.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  39  6.2 EUROPEAN SDOS  Recommendation 7:  As identified earlier, security concepts (units of knowledge consisting of unique characteristics),  terms (verbal designations of the concepts), definitions (unique descriptive statements of the  concepts that identify them uniquely) and relations between concepts in different risk assessment  standards deviate among themselves as used by various SDOs. Further interpretation efforts are  needed for all risk assessment and risk management standards that appear in this document.  The SDOs are encouraged to use unified concepts, terms and definitions.  The concept approach, developed by the ISO Technical Committee TC37 Language and  Terminology, can be adopted where one term corresponds to one concept and only one concept  corresponds to one term.  Recommendation 8:  There is no existing European standard for a methodology to assess ICT security available at  the European level, creating some issues in referencing applicable standards in EU legislation.  As described in chapter 4.2 there are several methodologies with different approaches.  Efforts should be undertaken to address these gaps.  Recommendation 9:  ESOs should adopt ISO/IEC 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005 as European Norms.  The benefits of such regional adoption in the case of European Norms include the facts that:  • harmonisation within Europe makes it easier to comply with European rules and  regulations (stand-still on national work on the same topic);  • documents can be targeted at European needs;  • consensus building within Europe is easier than in the global context.  The potential adoption of ISO/IEC 31000 and/or ISO/IEC 27005 as European standards will  help to harmonise European approaches to risk management.  Recommendation 10:  ETSI should harmonise its TS 102 165-1 with ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005 to develop a  standard covering risk management for ICT systems which is applicable to systems in a  Common Criteria context as well as in risk management (asset-based approach) within the  scope of an ISMS.  6.3 ENISA  Recommendation 11:  ENISA should publish, on a regular basis, an overview of endorsed risk management standards  covering different domains and sectors.  Recommendation 12:  ENISA should publish an overview of endorsed methodologies and tools covering different  domains and sectors.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  40  Recommendation 13:  ENISA should encourage and support different disciplines and sectors to develop or advance  work regarding their assessment of sector-discipline-specific risk and methodologies and tools  for treating risk, in order to increase cooperation between stakeholders.  Recommendation 14:  ENISA should continue to work in close support with ESOs in fulfilling potential EU requests for  standardisation related to the management of risk.  Recommendation 15:  ENISA should establish a mechanism for assisting EU institutions, bodies and agencies, EU  Member States and private organisations regarding various aspects of risk management.

Risk Management Framework for  Information Systems and  Organizations: A System Life Cycle  Approach for Security and Privacy  SP 800-37 Rev.2 Guide/Guidance Guidance NIST  The Risk Management Framework provides a  process that integrates security, privacy, and  cyber supply chain risk management activities  into the system’s  development life cycle. The  risk-based approach to control selection and  specification considers effectiveness, efficiency,  and constraints due to applicable laws,  directives, executive orders, policies, standards  or regulations.  Managing Information Security Risk:  Organisation, Mission, and  Information System View  SP 800-39 Guide/Guidance Guidelines NIST  The purpose of Special Publication 800-39 is to  provide guidance for an integrated,  organisation-wide programme for managing  information security risk to organisational  operations (i.e. mission, functions, image, and  reputation), organisational assets, individuals,  other organisations and the nation resulting  from the operation and use of federal  information systems.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  49  Supply Chain Risk Management  Practices for Federal Information  Systems and Organisations  SP 800-161 Guide/Guidance Guidelines NIST  The purpose of this publication is to provide  guidance to federal agencies on identifying,  assessing, selecting and implementing risk  management processes and mitigating controls  throughout their organisations to help manage  ICT supply chain risks.  Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain  Risk Management: Observations  from Industry  NISTIR 8276 Other Best practices NIST  This document provides the ever-increasing  community of digital businesses a set of key  practices that any organisation can use to  manage cybersecurity risks associated with their  supply chains.  Integrating Cybersecurity and  Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) NISTIR 8286 Guide/Guidance Guidelines NIST  This document is intended to help individual  organisations within an enterprise improve their  cybersecurity risk information, which they  provide as inputs to their enterprise’s ERM  processes through communications and risk  information sharing. By doing so, enterprises  and their component organisations can better  identify, assess and manage their cybersecurity  risks in the context of their broader mission and  business objectives.  Risk analysis based on IT- Grundschutz  BSI-Standard 100-3 Other Methodology BSI (Germany)  The methodology demonstrates how the threats  listed in the IT-Grundschutz catalogues can be  used to carry out a simplified analysis of risks for  information processing.  IT-Grundschutz Methodology BSI-Standard 100-2 Other Methodology BSI (Germany)  The IT-Grundschutz Methodology is a BSI  methodology for effective management of the  information security that can be easily adapted  to the situation of a specific organisation. This  method provides both a methodology for  setting up a management system for  information security and a comprehensive basis  for assessing risks, monitoring the existing  security level, and implementing the  appropriate information safeguards.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  50  CACAO Security Playbooks Version  1.0  CACAO-Security- Playbooks-v1.0 Other Methodology OASIS  To defend against threat actors and their tactics,  organisations need to identify, create,  document, and test detection, investigation,  prevention, mitigation and remediation steps.  These steps, when grouped together form a  cyber security playbook that can be used to  protect organisational systems, networks, data  and users.  This specification defines the schema and  taxonomy for collaborative automated courses  of action for operations (CACAO) and security  playbooks and how these playbooks can be  created, documented and shared in a structured  and standardised way across organisational  boundaries and technological solutions. It  defines the following classes of objects:  playbooks (section 4), workflow steps (section  5), commands (section 6), targets (section 7),  extensions (section 8), and data markings  (section 9).  CSAF Common Vulnerability  Reporting Framework (CVRF)  Version 1.2.  CVRF-v1.2 Other guidelines, methodology,  data specification OASIS  A standard language supporting creation,  update, and interoperable exchange of security  advisories as structured information on  products, vulnerabilities and the status of  impact and remediation among interested  parties. The term Security Advisory is used to  describe any notification of security issues in  products of and by providers.  The focus is on the security aspect impacting (or  not impacting) specific combinations of  products, platforms, and versions. Information  on the presence or absence of work-arounds is  also considered part of the security issue.  It addresses security advisories from anyone  providing a product, i.e. developers or  maintainers of information system products or  services. This includes all authoritative product  vendors, product security incident response  teams (PSIRTs), and product resellers and  distributors, including authoritative vendor  partners.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  51  Open Command and Control  (OpenC2) Language Specification  Version 1.0  OpenC2-Lang-v1.0 Other Methodology, data  specification OASIS  A concise and extensible language to enable  machine-to-machine communications for  purposes of the command and control of cyber  defence components, subsystems and/or  systems in a manner that is agnostic of the  underlying products, technologies and transport  mechanisms.  OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables  command and control of cyber defence systems  and components, typically using a request- response paradigm. OpenC2 allows the  application producing the commands to  discover the set of capabilities supported by the  managed devices. These capabilities permit the  managing application to adjust its behaviour to  take advantage of the features exposed by the  managed device. The capability definitions can  be easily extended in a non-centralised manner,  allowing standard and non-standard capabilities  to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.  Open Command and Control  (OpenC2) Profile for Stateless  Packet Filtering Version 1.0  OpenC2-SLPF-v1.0 Other Methodology OASIS  Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a  concise, extensible language enabling command  and control of cyber defence components.  Stateless packet filtering is a cyber defence  mechanism that denies or allows traffic based  on static properties of the traffic, such as  address, port, protocol, etc. This profile defines  the actions, targets, specifiers and options that  are consistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2  Language Specification in the context of  stateless packet filtering (SLPF). An actuator  profile for OpenC2 that specifies the set of  actions, targets, specifiers and command  arguments integrates SLPF functionality with the  Open Command and Control (OpenC2)  Command set.  Specification for Transfer of OpenC2  Messages via HTTPS Version 1.0  OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0 Other Methodology OASIS  Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a  concise, extensible language enabling command  and control of cyber defence components.  Stateless packet filtering is a cyber defence  mechanism that denies or allows traffic based  on static properties of the traffic, such as  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  52  address, port, protocol, etc. This document  specifies the use of hypertext transfer protocol  (HTTP) over transport layer security (TLS) as a  transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages. The  specification provides guidance to the OpenC2  implementation community when using HTTPS  for OpenC2 message transport. It includes  guidance for the selection of TLS versions and  options suitable for use with OpenC2.  Static Analysis Results Interchange  Format (SARIF) Version 2.1  SARIF-v2.1.0 Other Methodology, data  specification OASIS  SARIF is included because of its potential  relevance to risk assessment. Software  developers use a variety of analysis tools to  assess program qualities such as correctness,  security, vulnerability, performance, compliance  with contractual or legal requirements, etc.  SARIF defines a standard format for the output  of static analysis tools to enable aggregation,  analysis, and sharing of results. The standard  defines a format for the output of static analysis  tools, in order to capture the range of data  produced by commonly used static analysis  tools, enable data interchange, reduce cost and  complexity, and capture information useful for  assessing a project’s compliance with corporate  policy or certification standards.  STIX Version 2.1 STIX-v2.1 Other Methodology, data  specification OASIS  A language and serialisation format used to  exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI), STIX  enables CTI-sharing in a consistent and machine- readable manner, allowing security  communities to better understand what  computer-based attacks they are most likely to  see and to anticipate and/or respond to those  attacks faster and more effectively. STIX is  designed to improve many different capabilities,  such as collaborative threat analysis, automated  threat exchange, automated detection and  response, and more.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  53  TAXII Version 2.1 TAXII-v1.1.1-Overview Other Methodology OASIS  TAXII is an application layer protocol for the  communication of cyber threat information in a  simple and scalable manner. This specification  defines the TAXII RESTful API and its resources  along with the requirements for TAXII client and  server implementations.  Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator  Information (TAXII™) defines a set of services  and message exchanges that, when  implemented, enable sharing of actionable  cyber threat information across the organisation  and product or service boundaries. TAXII,  through its member specifications, defines  concepts, protocols and messages to exchange  cyber threat information for the detection,  prevention, and mitigation of cyber threats.  TAXII is not an information sharing initiative or  application and does not attempt to define trust  agreements, governance, or non-technical  aspects of cyber threat information sharing.  Enterprise Risk Management —  Integrated Framework  COSO ERM Guide/Guidance Guidance  COSO Committee  of Sponsoring  Organisations of  the Treadway  Commission  The Framework defines the essential  components of enterprise risk management,  discusses key ERM principles and concepts,  suggests a common ERM language, and provides  clear direction and guidance for enterprise risk  management.  Systems and software engineering  — Life cycle processes — Risk  management  ISO/IEC/IEEE  16085:2021 Guide/Guidance Guidelines Other  This document provides information on how to  design, develop, implement, and continually  improve risk management in a systems and  software engineering project throughout its life  cycle.  Risk management - Principles and  guidelines AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Standard Risk management Other  Providing principles and generic guidelines on  risk management, this standard can be used by  any public, private or community enterprise,  association, group or individual, and is not  specific to any industry or sector. It can be  applied throughout the life of an organisation,  and to a wide range of activities, including  strategies and decisions, operations, processes,  functions, projects, products, services and  assets. Although the standard provides generic  guidelines, it is not intended to promote  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  54  uniformity of risk management across  organisations. The design and implementation  of risk management plans and frameworks will  need to take into account the varying needs of a  specific organisation, its particular objectives,  context, structure, operations, processes,  functions, projects, products, services or assets  and specific practices employed.  Security for industrial automation  and control systems–Part 3-2:  Security risk assessment for system  design  ISA/IEC 62443-3-2 Standard Techniques Other  This document strives to define a set of  engineering measures that will guide an  organisation through  the  process  of  assessing  the  risk  of  a  particular industrial automation  and control system  (IACS)  and enable it  to  identify  and  apply  security countermeasures  to reduce that risk to tolerable levels.  OWASP Risk Rating Methodology  OWASP Risk  Assessment Framework  Other Risk Assessment  Framework OWASP  The OWASP Risk Assessment Framework  consists of static application security testing and  risk assessment testers able to analyse and  review their code quality and vulnerabilities.  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  55  ANNEX B: ANALYSIS OF  EIDAS REGULATION  We present below an example of how ICT risk and risk management are treated by analysing  the existing eIDAS regulation (Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic  Transactions - Regulation (EU) No 910/2014).  eIDAS items Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic  Transactions - Regulation (EU) No 910/2014  Means  Identification  schemes – Mutual  recognition  Recital (20): cooperation by Member States should facilitate the  technical interoperability of the notified electronic identification  schemes with a view to fostering a high level of trust and security  appropriate to the degree of risk. The exchange of information and  the sharing of best practices between Member States with a view to  their mutual recognition should help such cooperation.  Risk  management  performed by  peer reviews  Trust Service  Providers  Recital (32): it should be incumbent on all trust service providers to  apply good security practice appropriate to the risks related to their  activities so as to boost users’ trust in the single market.  Apply good  security  practices  Data protection  handle by  electronic  registered  delivery service  Recital (36): ‘electronic registered delivery service’ means a service  that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by  electronic means and provides evidence relating to the handling of the  data transmitted, including proof of sending and receiving the data, and  that protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage  or any unauthorised alterations.  Management  of the risk of  loss, theft,  damage, or  unauthorised  alterations  Liability of all  trust service  providers –  assessment of  financial risk  Recital (37): this regulation should provide for the liability of all trust  service providers. In particular, it establishes the liability regime under  which all trust service providers should be liable for damage caused to  any natural or legal person due to failure to comply with the obligations  under this regulation. In order to facilitate the assessment of financial  risk that trust service providers might have to bear or that they should  cover by insurance policies, this regulation allows trust service  providers to set limitations, under certain conditions, on the use of the  services they provide and not to be liable for damages arising from the  use of services exceeding such limitations. Customers should be duly  informed about the limitations in advance. Those limitations should be  recognisable by a third party, for example by including information  about the limitations in the terms and conditions of the service provided  or through other recognisable means. For the purposes of giving effect  to those principles, this regulation should be applied in accordance with  national rules on liability. Therefore, this regulation does not affect  national rules on, for example, definition of damages, intention,  negligence or relevant applicable procedural rules.  Insurance  policies, set  of limitations  of liability in  their terms of  uses of the  service  Security risk  assessments and  notification of  security breaches  Recital (38): notification of security breaches and security risk  assessments is essential with a view to providing adequate information  to concerned parties in the event of a breach of security or loss of  integrity.  Article 8.2 (a): assurance level low shall refer to a means of electronic  identification in the context of an electronic identification scheme, which  RISK MANAGEMENT STANDARDS  March 2022  56  provides a limited degree of confidence in the claimed or asserted  identity of a person, and is characterised with reference to technical  specifications, standards and procedures related thereto, including  technical controls, the purpose of which is to decrease the risk of  misuse or alteration of the identity;  Article 8.2 (b): assurance level substantial shall refer to a means of  electronic identification in the context of an electronic identification  scheme, which provides a substantial degree of confidence in the  claimed or asserted identity of a person, and is characterised with  reference to technical specifications, standards and procedures related  thereto, including technical controls, the purpose of which is to  decrease substantially the risk of misuse or alteration of the identity;  Article 12. 7: By 18 March 2015, the Commission shall, by means of  implementing acts, establish the necessary procedural arrangements to  facilitate cooperation between the Member States referred to in  paragraphs 5 and 6 with a view to fostering a high level of trust and  security appropriate to the degree of risk.  Article 19:  Security requirements applicable to trust service providers  1. Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall take  appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks  posed to the security of the trust services they provide. Having regard  to the latest technological developments, those measures shall ensure  that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. In  particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact  of security incidents and inform stakeholders of the adverse effects of  any such incidents.  Article 24.2 C) on:  Requirements for qualified trust service providers  2. A qualified trust service provider providing qualified trust services  shall:  (c) with regard to the risk of liability for damages in accordance with  Article 13, maintain sufficient financial resources and/or obtain  appropriate liability insurance, in accordance with national law.

It may be that, due to the more robust security protection  that organizations have put in place, attackers successfully shifted towards suppliers. They managed to have  significant impacts in terms of the downtime of systems, monetary losses and reputational damages, to name but a  few. The importance of supply chains is attributed to the fact that successful attacks may impact a large amount  number of customers who make use of the affected supplier. Therefore, the cascading effects from a single attack  may have a widely propagated impact.  This report aims at mapping and studying the supply chain attacks that were discovered from January 2020 to early  July 2021. Based on the trends and patterns observed, supply chain attacks increased in number and sophistication  in the year 2020 and this trend is continuing in 2021, posing an increasing risk for organizations. It is estimated that  there will be four times more supply chain attacks in 2021 than in 2020. With half of the attacks being attributed to  Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) actors, their complexity and resources greatly exceed the more common non-  targeted attacks, and, therefore, there is an increasing need for new protective methods that incorporate suppliers in  order to guarantee that organizations remain secure.  This report presents the Agency’s Threat Landscape concerning supply chain attacks, produced with the support of  the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes1.  The main highlights of the report include the following:   A taxonomy to classify supply chain attacks in order to better analyse them in a systematic manner and  understand the way they manifest is described.   24 supply chain attacks were reported from January 2020 to early July 2021, and have been studied in  this report.   Around 50% of the attacks were attributed to well-known APT groups by the security community.   Around 42% of the analysed attacks have not yet been attributed to a particular group.   Around 62% of the attacks on customers took advantage of their trust in their supplier.   In 62% of the cases, malware was the attack technique employed.   When considering targeted assets, in 66% of the incidents attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in  order to further compromise targeted customers.   Around 58% of the supply chain attacks aimed at gaining access to data (predominantly customer data,  including personal data and intellectual property) and around 16% at gaining access to people.   Not all attacks should be denoted as supply chain attacks, but due to their nature many of them are  potential vectors for new supply chain attacks in the future.   Organizations need to update their cybersecurity methodology with supply chain attacks in mind  and to incorporate all their suppliers in their protection and security verification.  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  4  1. INTRODUCTION  Supply chain attacks have been a security concern for many years, but the community seems to have been facing a  increased number of more organized attacks since 2020. It may be that, due to the more robust security protection  that organizations have put in place, attackers have shifted towards suppliers and managed to cause significant  impact in terms of the downtime of systems, monetary losses and reputational damages, to name but a few. This  report aims at mapping and studying the supply chain attacks that were discovered between January 2020 and early  July 2021.  The devastating and ripple effect of supply chain attacks was seen in full force with the SolarWinds attack2.  SolarWinds is considered one of the largest supply chain attacks of the last few years, particularly taking into account  the affected entities that included governmental organizations and large corporations. It received great media  attention and led to policy initiatives around the globe3. More recently, in July 2021 the Kaseya4 attack manifested  itself and raised the need for further and dedicated attention to supply chain attacks affecting managed service  providers. Unfortunately, these two examples are not isolated cases and the number of supply chain attacks has  been steadily increasing over the last year. This trend further stresses the need for policymakers and the security  community to devise and introduce novel protective measures to address potential supply chain attacks in the future  and to mitigate their impact.  Through a careful survey and analysis, this report maps supply chain attacks based on incidents identified from  January 2020 to early July 2021. Each incident has been broken down into its key elements, such as the attack  techniques and assets of both suppliers and customers alike that are affected by adversaries. The introduction of a  taxonomy for supply chain attacks will facilitate their classification and may be the starting point for a more structured  approach in analysing such attacks and coming up with dedicated security controls to mitigate them. The proposed  taxonomy also helps to classify, compare and discuss these attacks using a common ground. The similarities  between the proposed taxonomy and other well-known frameworks are discussed.  This report also analyses the similarities between the lifecycle of supply chain attacks and the more well-known  attacks by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). A summary of the most prominent supply chain incidents since 2020  is included in the Annex, each of which has been decomposed in accordance with the aforementioned taxonomy.  The core of the report is an analysis of all the reported supply chain incidents to identify their key characteristics and  techniques. The analysis answers the questions: what are the most common attack techniques being used in supply  chain attacks, what are the main customer assets that attackers are after, and which is the relationship between  attacks and assets targeted?  With the rise in attention being paid to supply chain attacks, many other related security incidents were also  highlighted as being related to the supply chain, namely they were assumed to be supply chain attacks. We therefore  discuss what constitutes a supply chain attack and why many attacks are not really supply chain attacks, showing  some cases as examples. Understanding the threat landscape concerning supply chain attacks is important since  misclassification of incidents may lead to erroneous trend analysis and conclusions.  The report also includes a set of recommendations aimed at policymakers and organizations, in particularly suppliers,  the adoption of which may increase the overall security posture against supply chain attacks.  2 Russian SolarWinds hackers launch email attack on government agencies, The Guardian.  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/28/russian-solarwinds-hackers-launch-assault-government-agencies.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  6  2. WHAT IS A SUPPLY CHAIN  ATTACK?  Supply chain refers to the ecosystem of processes, people, organizations, and distributors involved in the  creation and delivery of a final solution or product5. In cybersecurity, the supply chain involves a wide range of  resources (hardware and software), storage (cloud or local), distribution mechanisms (web applications, online  stores), and management software.  There are four key elements in a supply chain:   Supplier: is an entity that supplies a product or service to another entity.   Supplier Assets: are valuable elements used by the supplier to produce the product or service.   Customer: is the entity that consumes the product or service produced by the supplier.   Customer Assets: are valuable elements owned by the target.  An entity can be individuals, groups of individuals, or organizations. Assets can be people, software, documents,  finances, hardware, or others.  A supply chain attack is a combination of at least two attacks. The first attack is on a supplier that is then used to  attack the target to gain access to its assets. The target can be the final customer or another supplier. Therefore, for  an attack to be classified as a supply chain one, both the supplier and the customer have to be targets.  2.1. TAXONOMY OF SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  This report proposes a taxonomy to characterize supply chain attacks and structure their subsequent analysis. This  taxonomy considers all four key elements of a supply chain, as well as the techniques used by attackers. The  taxonomy may help organisations in understanding the various parts of a supply chain attack, comparing them with  other similar cyber-attacks, and more importantly identifying the incidents as supply chain attacks.  The taxonomy should be used as a guiding template where, upon a new potential supply chain attack, the community  may try to analyse it by identifying and mapping out each of the four distinct taxonomy elements. If no customer is  attacked, or no supplier attacked, then it is probably not a supply chain attack6.  The taxonomy, as presented in Table 1, has one section for the supplier and one section for the customer. For the  supplier, the first part is called “Attack Technique Used to Compromise the Supply Chain” and it identifies how the  supplier was attacked. The second part for the supplier is called “Supplier Assets Targeted by the Supply Chain  Attack” and it identifies what was the target of the attack on the supplier.  For the customer, the first part is called “Attack Techniques Used to Compromise the Customer” and it identifies how  the customer was attacked. The second part for the customer is called “Customer Assets Targeted by the Supply  Chain Attack” and it identifies what was the target of the attack on the customer.  For each of these four distinguishing elements in the taxonomy, we have defined the elements that better  characterise a supply chain attack. By selecting the corresponding elements, it is possible to have a better  understanding of what is known or not known about an attack. The taxonomy is conceptually different from MITRE  ATT&CK® knowledge base and it does not aim to replace the latter but rather complement it. Attack techniques  defined in the proposed taxonomy and illustrated in Table 1 are in some cases related to relevant attack techniques  as identified in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, and are accordingly marked with the respective MITRE ATT&CK®  5 Beamon, B. M. (1998). Supply chain design and analysis: Models and methods.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  7  identifier in square brackets, for example [T1189]. The following subsections clarify each of the four parts of the  taxonomy and how to identify its elements.  Table 1: Proposed taxonomy for supply chain attacks. It has four parts: (i) attack techniques used on the supplier, (ii)  assets attacked in the supplier, (iii) attack techniques used on the customer, (iii) assets attacked in the customer.  SUPPLIER  CUSTOMER  Attack Techniques Used  to Compromise the  Supply Chain  Supplier Assets  Targeted by the Supply  Chain Attack  Attack Techniques Used  to Compromise the  Customer  Customer Assets  Targeted by the Supply  Chain Attack  Malware Infection  Social Engineering  Brute-Force Attack  Exploiting Software  Vulnerability  Exploiting Configuration  Vulnerability  Open-Source  Intelligence (OSINT)  Pre-existing Software  Software Libraries  Code  Configurations  Data  Processes  Hardware  People  Supplier  Trusted Relationship  [T1199]  Drive-by Compromise  [T1189]  Phishing [T1566]  Malware Infection  Physical Attack or  Modification  Counterfeiting  Data  Personal Data  Intellectual Property  Software  Processes  Bandwidth  Financial  People  An EU cybersecurity incident taxonomy7 is used for the purpose of incident response coordination activities and  information sharing at Union level. Since the taxonomy is conceptually different and does not allow for detailed  analysis of supply chain incidents, we recommend the complementary use of both taxonomies.  2.2. ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A SUPPLY CHAIN  The attack techniques refer to “how” the attack took place, and not “what” was used to attack. For example, this  category distinguishes whether the supplier was attacked with a password found online (OSINT) or whether the  password was brute-forced (Brute-Force Attack). However, it is not relevant for the taxonomy whether the password  found online was leaked, a default password or sold in a black market. The categories of Attack Techniques below  cover the attack techniques most commonly used in the supply chain attacks analysed in this report. It is evident that  more than one technique may have been used in any given attack and, in several cases, entities may not have the  knowledge on how the attackers gained access to their infrastructure, or this information was not divulged or duly  reported.  7  Cybersecurity incident taxonomy, Publications of the NIS Cooperation Group, July 2018.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group.

Each technique identifies how the attack  happened, and not what was attacked. Several techniques may be used in the same attack.  ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A SUPPLY CHAIN  Malware Infection e.g. spyware used to steal credentials from employees.  Social Engineering  e.g. phishing, fake applications, typo-squatting, Wi-Fi impersonation,  convincing the supplier to do something.  Brute-Force Attack e.g. guessing an SSH password, guessing a web login.  Exploiting Software  Vulnerability  e.g. SQL injection or buffer overflow exploit in an application.  Exploiting  Configuration  Vulnerability  e.g. taking advantage of a configuration problem.  Physical Attack or  Modification  e.g. modify hardware, physical intrusion.  Open-Source  Intelligence (OSINT)  e.g. search online for credentials, API keys, usernames.  Counterfeiting e.g. imitation of USB with malicious purposes.  2.3. SUPPLIER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  The supplier assets targeted by the attackers refers to “what” was the target of the attack on the supplier, which  allowed further attacks to be subsequently mounted. The targeted asset(s) usually has a direct relationship with the  final target and it is usually possible to understand the final intentions of the attacker by analysing the list of affected  assets. In some cases, because of a lack of information divulged or reported by the supplier, it is not possible to have  information on the target assets. This might also be the case when suppliers do not have the knowledge or expertise  to identify which assets were compromised by the attackers.  Table 3: Assets of the supplier targeted by attackers. Each element identifies what was attacked in the supplier.  Several techniques that could affect several assets may be used in the same attack.  SUPPLIER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Pre-existing Software  e.g. software used by the supplier, web servers, applications,  databases, monitoring systems, cloud applications, firmware. It does  not include software libraries.  Software Libraries  e.g. third party libraries, software packages installed from third parties  such as npm, ruby, etc.  Code  e.g. source code or software produced by the supplier.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  9  SUPPLIER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Configurations e.g. passwords, API keys, firewall rules, URLs.  Data  e.g. information about the supplier, values from sensors, certificates,  personal data of customers or suppliers themselves, personal data.  Processes  e.g. updates, backups or validation processes, signing certificates  processes.  Hardware e.g. hardware produced by the supplier, chips, valves, USBs.  People  e.g. targeted individuals with access to data, infrastructure, or to other  people.  2.4. ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A CUSTOMER  This element of the taxonomy refers to the attack techniques used to compromise the customer through their  supplier. Under this element of the taxonomy, we identify “how” the customer was attacked and not with “what”. It is a  technique and not a specific type of attack. For example, if the customer updates its software from the supplier and  receives a type of malware, the attack is both on a 'Trusted Relationship’ and a ‘Malware Infection’. It is evident that  more than one technique may be applied in several cases. Customers may not always have knowledge of the  technique used by attackers to gain access to their assets via their suppliers, but have the means to identify that the  technique used was not within their perimeter.  Table 4: Attack techniques used to compromise the customer. Each technique identifies how the attack happened,  and not what was attacked. Several techniques may be used in the same attack.  ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A CUSTOMER  Trusted Relationship  [T1199]  e.g. trust a certificate, trust an automatic update, trust an automatic  backup.  Drive-by  Compromise [T1189]  e.g. malicious scripts in a website to infect users with malware.  Phishing [T1566] e.g. messages impersonating the supplier, fake update notifications.  Malware Infection e.g. Remote Access Trojan (RAT), backdoor, ransomware.  Physical Attack or  Modification  e.g. modify hardware, physical intrusion.  Counterfeiting  e.g. create a fake USB, modify a motherboard, impersonation of  supplier’s personnel.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  10  2.5. CUSTOMER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Customer assets are the main and final target of the attackers and usually the raison d’etre for a supply chain attack.  These assets may vary depending on the industry sector and the type of service offered. The particular element in  the taxonomy is meant to facilitate understanding of the impact of the attack and also enable comparisons concerning  the goals of the attackers. Certain assets might have been directly targeted by attackers, whereas others may have  been inadvertently affected. More than one customer are usually affected by typical supply chain attacks. It is  possible that the customer may not be aware of the adversary's target (e.g., the attack was either unsuccessful or  quickly detected).  Table 5: Assets of the customer targeted by attackers. Each element identifies what was attacked in the customer.  Several techniques may be used in the same attack. This is usually the final target of the attack.  CUSTOMER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Data  e.g. payment data, video feeds, documents, emails, flight plans, sales  data and financial data, intellectual property.  Personal data  e.g. customer data, employee records, credentials.  Software  e.g. access to the customer product source code, modification of the  software of the customer.  Processes  e.g. documentation of internal processes of operation and  configurations, insertion of new malicious processes, documents of  schematics.  Bandwidth  e.g. use the bandwidth for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), send  SPAM or to infect others on a large scale.  Financial e.g. steal cryptocurrency, hijack bank accounts, money transfers.  People e.g. individuals targeted due their position or knowledge.  2.6. HOW TO MAKE USE OF THE TAXONOMY  The following is an example of how applying the taxonomy to a real case can help identify its particular features and  facilitate an understanding of the characteristics of the attack.  Codecov is a company that provides software for code coverage and testing tools. The company supplies tools to  other companies such as IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In April 2021, Codecov reported that attackers  obtained some of their valid credentials from a Docker image8 due to an error in how those Docker images were  created. Once the attackers obtained these credentials, they used them to compromise an “upload bash script” that is  used by Codecov customers9. Once the customers downloaded and executed this script, the attackers were able to  exfiltrate data from Codecov’s customers, including sensitive information that would allow the attackers to access the  customer resources10. Multiple Codecov customers reported that the attackers were able to access their source code  8 Codecov supply chain attack breakdown, GitGuardian, https://blog.gitguardian.com/codecov-supply-chain-breach/.

The attack was not attributed to specific adversaries. Figure 1  (below) depicts the steps involved in this particular attack.  Using this information, we can identify the four elements in the proposed taxonomy. The attack on the supplier means  how the attackers got access to the supplier, and in this case it was by “Exploiting a Configuration Vulnerability”.  Through this attack, the attackers target the asset of “code” in the supplier. After the elements for the supplier were  identified in the taxonomy, we can move to how the customer was attacked. In the Codecov case is through a  ‘Trusted Relationship’ with the supplier that was not secured and verified. The final asset targeted in the customer  was reported to be source code, so ‘Software’.  Table 6: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving the Codecov Company. The attackers  exploited a configuration vulnerability in Codecov which was used to modify the supplier’s code. The attackers  abused the trusted relationship between Codecov and its customers to exfiltrate data necessary to access the  customer’s software source code.

The Codecov container creation process had a  bug that was present in the online deployed containers (1). The attackers accessed the container and got Codecov’s  credentials (2). They then modified Codecov’s bash script (3) that was updated in the customers (4). The malicious  bash script exfiltrated the customer’s credentials to the attacker (5), who used them to access the data of customers  (6).  11 Rapid7 Source Code Breached in Codecov Supply-Chain Attack, The Hacker News, https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/rapid7-source-code-  breached-in-codecov.html.

SUPPLY CHAIN TAXONOMY AND OTHER FRAMEWORKS  2.7.1. MITRE ATT&CK® Knowledge Base  MITRE ATT&CK® is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behaviour. The taxonomy proposed in  the report differs from MITRE ATT&CK®12 because the purposes of both are very different. Therefore, it is not  possible to use MITRE ATT&CK® in the supply chain taxonomy, since we opted for placing emphasis on the four  aspects that typically characterise a supply chain attack and in particular the supplier-customer relationship. While  MITRE ATT&CK® completely maps the options and steps in the lifecycle of all attacks, its coverage of the details of a  supply chain are not yet that developed.  For example, in the MITRE ATT&CK® ‘Initial Access’ category, there is a technique called ‘Supply Chain  Compromise’13. This is very useful for companies to identify a supply chain as a risk, but too generic when focusing  explicitly on the supply chain attacks themselves. The proposed taxonomy maps all the details of the supply chain  attack itself, and therefore could potentially complement the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base.  2.7.2. Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain® Framework  The proposed taxonomy also has a different purpose than the well-known Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain®  framework14. The cyber kill chain is a framework that was designed to identify the steps taken by attackers to achieve  their goals. While these steps may be taken as part of a supply chain attack, they are too generic to classify,  understand and compare supply chain attacks. The taxonomy presented here proposes a more detail analysis of  these attacks and, more importantly, it helps map both attacks involved in a sole supply chain attack, one on the  supplier and one on the customer.  12 MITRE ATT&CK®, MITRE, https://attack.mitre.org/.

THE LIFECYCLE OF A SUPPLY  CHAIN ATTACK  It can be observed that a supply chain attack is usually composed of an attack on one or more suppliers and then a  later attack on the final target, namely the customer. Each of these attacks may resemble very closely the lifecycle of  APT attacks.  Although it is hard to agree on a unique definition of what an APT attack is, throughout this report it is considered that  an APT attack is any attack that is targeted, obtains unauthorized access to an organization (usually code execution),  is spread over a long period of time, and its final goal is in a specific relation to the target (as opposed to, for  example, cryptomining). Of course, such a definition is not complete and many others may exist. However, a  definition is important to understand that supply chain attacks are usually targeted, complex, costly and with attackers  probably planning them for a long time. The mere fact that at least two types of successful attacks are involved in  typical supply chain incidents, is an indicator of both the degree of sophistication of the adversaries, but also their  persistence and intent to succeed.  It is worth noting that many APT attacks were considered not ‘advanced’ by the community in relation to the quality of  their code, exploits and malware. However, it may be considered that the characterisation of being ‘advanced’ refers  to the whole operation and not necessarily merely to the code. In the end, planning, staging, developing and  executing two attacks in two organizations is a complex task.  These distinctions are crucial to understand that an organization could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack  even when its own defences are quite good and therefore the attackers are trying to explore new potential  highways to infiltrate them by moving to their suppliers and making a target out of them. Moreover, the potential  impact of supply chain attacks affecting numerous customers of the same supplier are probably immense. This is yet  another reason why these types of attacks are becoming increasingly common as they provide adversaries with a  means to potentially boost their reputations, as well as possibly make large financial gains.  An additional characteristic of supply chain attacks involves the complexity in handling them and the efforts required  to mitigate and address such attacks. The mere fact that at least two organisational entities are affected and the use,  most likely, of sophisticated attack vectors complicates the handling of an incident, forensics analysis and overall  management of the incident. The fact that the supplier-consumer relationship is continuously evolving and both  suppliers and customers are constantly updating their systems, introduces the need for continuous security of the  supply chain and active risk assessment and management.  The lifecycle of a supply chain attack has two main parts, the attack on the supplier and the attack on the customer.  Each of these attacks is usually complex, requiring one attack vector, one plan of action, and careful execution.  These attacks may take months to be successful and, in many cases, may go undetected for a long time. The  lifecycle of a supply chain attack can be seen in Figure 2.  The first attack in the lifecycle is called “Supplier APT Attack” and it focuses on compromising one or more suppliers.  The second attack in the lifecycle is called “Customer APT Attack” and it focuses on the final target of the attack.  These two parts are linked by the access to the supplier but otherwise may be quite different in techniques used,  attack vectors exploited and time spent on the attack.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  14  Figure 2: The lifecycle of supply chain attacks can be seen as two APT attacks intertwined. The first attack targets  one or more suppliers, and the second attack targets the customers. These attacks require careful planning and  execution.  In at least eleven attacks out of all the cases studied in this report, investigations confirmed that the supply chain  attacks were conducted by known APT groups. These attributions were done by the security companies responsible  for the reports referenced in Annex A. In the other thirteen cases the incidents were not fully investigated or  attribution was not possible. Such attributions support the idea that both parts of the lifecycle of a supply chain attack  can resemble the work of APT attacks. It is worth noting that attribution of attackers is very hard, prone to error,  imprecise and politically challenging, but not impossible.  Since each part of the supply chain attack may be seen as an APT attack, its individual lifecycle would generally  follow the same stages as other APT attacks. Such stages are detailed, for example, in the MITRE ATT&CK® Tactics  for Enterprises15.  15 MITRE ATT&CK® Tactics - Enterprise Version 9, MITRE, https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/.

PROMINENT SUPPLY CHAIN  ATTACKS  This section presents a summary of the most prominent supply chain attacks from January 2020 to early July 2021,  along with a classification following the proposed taxonomy. These cases were selected because of the large impact  produced in the community or because they highlight certain characteristics (as indicated in the elements of the  taxonomy) that are important. The complete list and description of all supply chain attacks from January 2020 to early  July 2021 is available in Annex A.  4.1. SOLARWINDS ORION: IT MANAGEMENT AND REMOTE MONITORING  SolarWinds is a company that supplies management and monitoring software16. Orion is SolarWinds’ network  management system (NMS) product17. In December 2020 it was discovered that Orion had been compromised. An  extensive investigation showed that attackers gained access to the SolarWinds network, possibly through exploiting a  zero-day vulnerability in a third-party application or device, a brute-force attack or through social engineering. Once  compromised, the attackers collected information for an extended period of time. The malicious software was injected  into Orion during the build process18,19. The compromised software was then downloaded directly by the customers  and was used to gather and steal information20. The attack was attributed to the APT29 group21,22.  Table 7: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving SolarWinds. The attackers used multiple attack  techniques to compromise SolarWinds Orion software. They modified code in the supplier and abused the trusted  relationship of customers in SolarWinds to update the customers with malware. The attackers’ final target was  customers’ data.

The attackers compromised SolarWinds and modified the code  of ORION software. The ORION instances in the customers were updated with malware, which allowed the attackers  to access the data of customers.  4.2. MIMECAST: CLOUD CYBERSECURITY SERVICES  Mimecast is a supplier of cloud-based cybersecurity services. Among the services it provides, Mimecast offers email  security services, which require customers to connect securely to Mimecast servers to use their Microsoft 365  accounts. In January 2021, it was discovered that attackers had compromised Mimecast (through the SolarWinds  supplier). After the compromise, a Mimecast-issued certificate used by customers to access Microsoft 365 services  was accessed by attackers, giving them the ability to intercept the network connections and to connect to the  Microsoft 365 accounts to steal information23,24. The attack was attributed to the APT29 group25. The compromise of  the supplier has been reportedly linked to SolarWinds, but there is no concrete information to validate this.  Table 8: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving Mimecast. It is unknown how attackers  targeted the suppliers’ data, specifically a Mimecast-issued certificate. The attackers abused the trusted relationship  of customers uploading their data to Mimecast. The attackers accessed the data of customers in Mimecast.

The attackers found credentials that allow them to compromise  the supplier and access their certificates. Then they use the certificates to access customer data after the customer  validated and trusted the certificate.  4.3. LEDGER: HARDWARE WALLET  Ledger is a company that supplies hardware wallet technology for cryptocurrencies. In July 2020, attackers obtained  valid credentials to access Ledger’s e-commerce database26. The stolen data was released publicly in an online  forum27. Attackers used the stolen data for online phishing and extortion of users28,29, and for stealing users’ money  through a physical attack after supplying users with counterfeit Ledger wallets which, when connected to a computer  that would ask users for their security keys, would infect the computer with malware and send the stolen information  back to the attackers30.

KASEYA: IT MANAGEMENT SERVICES COMPROMISED WITH RANSOMWARE  Kaseya is a software service provider specializing in remote monitoring and management tools. It offers VSA (Virtual  System/Server Administrator) software for its clients to download, and also to work through its own cloud servers.  MSPs (Managed Service Providers) can use the VSA software on premises or they can license the VSA cloud  servers of Kaseya. MSPs in turn offer various IT services to other clients31. In July 2021, attackers exploited a zero-  day vulnerability in Kaseya’s own systems (CVE-2021-3011632) that enabled the attackers to remotely execute  commands on the VSA appliances of Kaseya’s customers. Kaseya can send out remote updates to all VSA servers  and, on Friday July 2, 2021, an update was distributed to Kaseya clients’ VSA that executed code from the attackers.  This malicious code in turn deployed ransomware33,34 to the customers being managed by that VSA.  31 Ransomware Hits Hundreds of US Companies, Security Firm Says, NBC10 Philadelphia, https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-  international/new-ransomware-attack-paralyzes-hundreds-of-u-s-companies/2868462/.

AN EXAMPLE OF MANY UNKNOWNS: SITA PASSENGER SERVICE SYSTEM  The case of SITA is prominent due to the many components of supply chain attacks that remain unknown and the  possible implications of their impact. It illustrates that there can be many circumstances where the details of the attacks  are never published, due to technical impossibility or political and marketing decisions by the companies. There is a  trade-off between a benefit for the community, which may improve its security by learning from the details of how  others were compromised, and the benefits for the individual companies, e.g. financial, reputational and market35.  SITA is a company that specializes in air information technology and transport information. SITA’s passenger service  system is used to provide airlines with passenger information at the time of boarding, including the risk passengers  may pose to a country36.  35 Investors in SolarWinds sold millions in stock before Russia breach revealed, The Washington Post,  https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/15/solarwinds-russia-breach-stock-trades/.

Some of SITA’s customers also reported data breaches, such as Air India, Singapore Airlines  and Malaysia Airlines36.  Following reports of leaked data on the Internet, Air India also reported that its networks were compromised and data  was stolen.37 The compromise of Air India internal networks was allegedly related to the SITA incident because a  security company found that the name of one computer inside Air India was “SITASERVER4”. To date, it remains  unknown how the attackers gained access to the SITA servers and it is also not known how the attackers may have  accessed Air India, or whether they actually did so. The internal attack to Air India’s networks was attributed to the  group APT4137.  The number of unknown variables in this incident is an example of the threat landscape when it comes to supply  chain attacks. The level of maturity concerning cyber investigations and preparedness of many organizations should  also extend to their suppliers, due to their complex, intertwined relationships.  Table 11: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving SITA. It is not known how the attackers  accessed the supplier. The attackers accessed data on the supplier about its customers. It is not known how the  attackers managed to infiltrate Air India. The information available indicates that the attackers' main goal was  customer data.

ANALYSIS OF SUPPLY CHAIN  INCIDENTS  In this section we present an analysis of supply chain attacks based on attacks reported from early 2020 up to early  July 2021. The analysis focuses on publicly known supply chain attacks and a detailed overview may be found in  Annex A. As discussed later, some attacks appeared to be supply chain attacks but were not and so were omitted  from the analysis. A summary of all the incidents analysed in the report is shown in Table 12.

TIMELINE OF SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  The analysis shows that out of 24 confirmed supply chain attacks, 8 (33%) were reported in 2020 and 16 (66%) from  January 2021 to early July 2021. Based on this data, the trend forecasts that 2021 may have 4 times more  supply chain attacks than 2020.  Figure 8 shows a timeline of the attacks analysed in this report, highlighting those incidents that were attributed to  APT groups, and whether they had a global or regional impact. The impact is categorised in each attack as global or  regional. The attacks are considered to have a global impact if their customer base is global or if the number of end-  users possibly affected are in the millions. Alternatively, attacks that impact users in a specific region or country, or  that affect only a handful of users are considered to have a regional impact.  Figure 8: Timeline of supply chain attacks reported from January 2020 to early July 2021. The month indicated in the  Figure refers to the month the incident was reported and not when the attack happened. Incidents attributed to APT  groups are marked with black dots, incidents with global impact are marked with violet dots, and incidents with  regional impact are marked with green dots. A detailed summary of each incident is available in Annex A.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  23  5.2. UNDERSTANDING THE FLOW OF ATTACKS  Each of the incidents shown in Figure 7 was analysed, summarized, and classified according to the proposed  taxonomy. The taxonomy supports and facilitates the study of supply chain attacks as a whole in a structured  manner.  Figure 8 is a Sankey diagram38, which illustrates the flow of the most common attack techniques and assets observed  in the supply chain attacks that were studied in this report. Attack techniques [ST] are used against supplier  assets [SA], which are used in attack techniques [CT] to compromise customers’ assets [CA].  From Figure 8, it is clear that most attack techniques used to compromise the supplier (first column [ST]) are:   Unknown (66%), followed by   Exploiting software vulnerabilities (16%).  In terms of suppliers’ assets targeted (second column [SA]), most attacks aimed to compromise:   Code (66%),   Data (20%)   Processes (12%).  The compromised suppliers’ assets are used as an attack vector to compromise the customers. Those attacks are  mostly done (third column [CT]):   by Abusing the trust of the customer (62%) in the supplier, or   by using Malware (62%).  Independently of the technique used, most supply chain attacks aim at gaining access to (fourth column [CA]):   customer Data (58%),   key People (16%) and   Financial resources (8%).  38 Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.

GOAL ORIENTED ATTACKERS  When considering targeted assets, in 66% of the incidents attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in order to further  compromise the targeted customers. In 20% of the analysed incidents attackers’ targeted data, and in 12% the  targets of the attack on the supplier were internal processes. This is key to understanding where to focus efforts in  terms of cybersecurity protection. Organizations should focus their efforts on validating third-party code and software  to ensure it has not been tampered with or manipulated.  The final customer assets targeted on these supply chain attacks seem to be predominantly customer data, including  personal data and intellectual property. This was the case in 58% of the supply chain incidents analysed. Attackers  also targeted to a lesser degree other assets including people, software, and financial resources.  5.4. MOST ATTACK VECTORS TO COMPROMISE SUPPLIERS REMAIN UNKNOWN  Our findings show that in 66% of the supply chain attacks analysed, suppliers did not know, or were not  transparent, about how they were compromised. In contrast, less than 9% of the customers compromised through  supply chain attacks did not know how the attacks happened. This highlights the gap in terms of maturity in  cybersecurity incident reporting between suppliers and end-user facing companies.  Considering that 83% of the suppliers are in the technology sector, the lack of knowledge on how attacks happened  could either indicate a poor level of maturity when it comes to cyber defence in suppliers’ infrastructure or  unwillingness to share the relevant information. There are other factors that may contribute to a lack of understanding  of how suppliers are compromised, including the complexity and sophistication of the attacks and slowness in  discovering the attacks which in turn may hinder investigation.  5.5. SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS ATTRIBUTED TO APT GROUPS  More than 50% of the supply chain attacks were attributed to well-known cybercrime groups, including APT29,  APT41, Thallium APT, UNC2546, Lazarus APT, TA413 and TA428. The analysis shows that APT groups seem to  have a slight preference for targets with regional impact, and that a significant number of these attacks aimed to gain  access to customer data.  Out of the 24 incidents analysed, 10 were not attributed to a particular group. The main reason for the lack of  attribution may be that 7 of these attacks happened in the last 7 months. Incidents of this kind may take a longer time  to investigate, and even then, in certain cases, attribution is still not possible. However, given the sophistication of  these attacks, suppliers should expect to be targeted by organized cybercrime groups and prepare accordingly.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  26  6. NOT EVERYTHING IS A SUPPLY  CHAIN ATTACK  From January 2020 to early July 2021, there were many incidents that initially appeared to be supply chain attacks or  were considered part of a probable future supply chain attack. Many traditional software vulnerabilities that were  found were reported as a ‘risk’ for future supply chain attacks. Some cases involved vulnerabilities that were thought  to be intentionally placed in software or hardware but that were later found to be bugs or unintentional errors. Many of  these cases were not supply chain attacks since they did not involve a supplier being compromised.  On at least three occasions attackers targeted software libraries or dependencies. In one of these cases, reported in  December 2020, attackers uploaded malicious packages to RubyGems repository39. A very similar case was reported  in March 2021, when a security researcher managed to upload malicious NPM packages using names known to be  the names of components or infrastructure used by well-known companies40. A third case was reported in April 2021,  when attackers uploaded a malicious NPM package trying to deliberately impersonate a well-known package in an  attack dubbed brandjacking41. In all these cases, the attackers did not compromise existing packages nor the  software repositories themselves thus, without a clear attack on supplier assets, we don't consider them as supply  chain attacks.  In many cases, vulnerabilities in software were discovered but not used in attacks, or were discovered to be errors  and not intentionally introduced. The first example of such a case was reported in February 2020, in which a security  researcher disclosed a 0-day vulnerability in the firmware developed by the company Xiaongmai and used for DVRs,  NVRs and IP cameras42. Other examples include the vulnerabilities reported in Visual Studio Code extensions in May  202143, and on Pling-based free and open-source software (FOSS) marketplaces in June 202144. In all these cases,  vulnerabilities were discovered though no active attacks using them had been reported at the time of writing this  report. As mentioned in previous sections, a supply chain attack involves at least two attacks, namely on a supplier  and on a customer. Without an attack on a customer or a supplier, the attack is not considered a supply chain attack.  Additionally, there were other cases of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities that were not supply chain attacks.  One such case was the attack on Centreon systems. Centreon is a company that supplies IT monitoring services and  offers an open-source software IT monitoring tool. In January 2021, it was discovered that attackers had exploited  outdated public facing instances of Centreon to compromise customers' infrastructure45,46,47. The attackers, attributed  to be the Sandworm APT group, conducted their campaign for three years until they were discovered. The attack  aimed to exfiltrate information from the affected customers. The attack was targeted at French IT providers. This is a  case where a particular software vulnerability was exploited in a software installed by customers. However, the  supplier itself was not compromised and the vulnerabilities were not intentional.  39 Russian Sandworm hackers only hit orgs with old Centreon software, Bleeping Computer, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-  sandworm-hackers-only-hit-orgs-with-old-centreon-software/.

RECOMMENDATIONS  Supply chain attacks leverage the interconnectedness of the global markets. When multiple customers rely on  the same supplier, the consequences of a cyber-attack against this supplier are amplified, potentially resulting in a  large-scale national or even cross-border impact. For some products, such as software and executable code, the  existence of a supply chain is opaque or even completely hidden to the end user. End-user software depends,  directly or indirectly, on software provided by the supplier. Such dependencies include packages, libraries, and  modules — all of which are used pervasively to lower development costs and accelerate shipping times.  The better protected against cyber-attacks organizations become, the more the attention shifts to suppliers. The math  is simple, suppliers are becoming the weakest link on the supply chain. At the same time, customers demand  products that are more cybersecure but that remain at a low cost, two needs that it is not always possible to  reconcile.  As we observed in numerous incidents of supply chain attacks, organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the  need to assess of the cybersecurity maturity of their suppliers and the level of exposure to the risk arising  from this customer-supplier relationship. Customers need to assess and take into account the overall quality of  the products and cybersecurity practices of their suppliers, including whether they apply secure development  procedures. Moreover, customers should exercise increased due diligence in selecting and vetting their suppliers,  and in managing the risk that stems from these relationships.  To manage supply chain cybersecurity risk, customers should48:   identify and document types of suppliers and service providers,   define risk criteria for different types of suppliers and services (e.g. important supplier and customer  dependencies, critical software dependencies, single points of failure),   assess supply chain risks according to their own business continuity impact assessments and requirements,   define measures for risk treatment based on good practices,   monitor supply chain risks and threats, based on internal and external sources of information and on findings  from suppliers’ performance monitoring and reviews,   make their personnel aware of the risk.  To manage the relationship to suppliers, customers should:   manage suppliers over the whole lifecycle of a product or service, including procedures to handle end-of-life  products or components,   classify assets and information that are shared with or accessible to suppliers, and define relevant  procedures for their access and handling,   define obligations of suppliers for the protection of the organisation’s assets, for the sharing of information,  for audit rights, for business continuity, for personnel screening, and for the handling of incidents in terms  responsibilities, notification obligations and procedures,   define security requirements for the products and services acquired,   include all these obligations and requirements in contracts; agree on rules for sub-contracting and potential  cascading requirements,   monitor service performance and perform routine security audits to verify adherence to cybersecurity  requirements in agreements; this includes the handling of incidents, vulnerabilities, patches, security  requirements, etc.,   receive assurance of suppliers and service providers that no hidden features or backdoors are knowingly  included,  48 Derived by cybersecurity controls in standards ISO/IEC 27002, ISO 9001 and ISO 31000.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  28   ensure regulatory and legal requirements are considered,   define processes to manage changes in supplier agreements, e.g. changes in tools, technologies, etc.  On the other hand, suppliers should ensure the secure development of products and services that is consistent  with commonly accepted security practices49. Suppliers should:   ensure that the infrastructure used to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver products, components and  services follows cybersecurity practices,50,51;   implement a product development, maintenance and support process that is consistent with commonly  accepted product development processes,   implement a secure engineering process that is consistent with commonly accepted security practices52, 53,   consider applicability of technical requirements based on product category and risks54,   offering Conformance Statements to customers for known standards, i.e. ISO/IEC 27001, IEC 62443-4-1,  IEC 62443-4-2 (or specific ones such as the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) for cloud services), and  ensuring and attesting to, to the extent possible, the integrity and origin of open source software used within  any portion of a product,   define quality objectives such as the number of defects or externally identified vulnerabilities or externally  reported security issues, and use them as an instrument to improve overall quality,   maintain accurate and up-to-date data on the origin of software code or components, and on controls  applied to internal and third-party software components, tools, and services present in software development  processes,   perform regular audits to ensure that the above measures are met.  Moreover, as any product or service is built from or based on components and software that is subject to  vulnerabilities suppliers should implement good practices for vulnerability management55, such as:   the monitoring of security vulnerabilities reported by internal and external sources that includes used third-  party components,   the risk analysis of vulnerabilities by using a vulnerability scoring system (e.g. CVSS56),   maintenance policies for the treatment of identified vulnerabilities depending on the risk,   processes to inform customers,   patch verification and testing to ensure that operational, safety, legal, and cybersecurity requirements are  met and that the patch is compatible with non-built-in third-party components,   processes for secure patch delivery and documentation concerning patches to customers, or   participating in a vulnerability disclosure program that includes a reporting and disclosure process.  Vulnerabilities should be managed by suppliers in the form of patches. Likewise, a customer should monitor the  market for potential vulnerabilities or receive respective vulnerability notifications from his suppliers. Some good  practices for patch management include57:   maintaining an inventory of assets that includes patch-relevant information,  49 e.g. IEC 62443-4-1.  50 e.g. the ones in ISO/IEC 27001.  51 These may include technical measures, such as (a) separation of environments; (b) auditing trust relationships; (c) establishing multi-factor, risk-  based authentication and conditional access across the organisation; (d) minimizing dependencies on products that are part of the environments used  to develop, build, and edit software; (e) encrypting data; f) monitoring operations and alerts and responding to attempted and actual cyber incidents.  52 e.g. IEC 62443-2-4  53 These may include the use of automated tools, or comparable processes, to maintain trusted source code supply chains, thereby ensuring the  integrity of the code; or the use of automated tools, or comparable processes, that check for known and potential vulnerabilities and remediate them.  54 Standards like IEC 62443-4-2 provide a comprehensive set on security requirements which are categorized for requirements applicable for all  products, applicable for software applications (SAR), applicable for embedded devices (EDR), applicable for host devices (HDR) and applicable for  network devices (NDR).  55 More guidance on vulnerability and patch management can be found in standards IEC 62443-4-1, IEC 62443-2-4 and IEC TR 62443-2-3.  56 See https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document ;.  57 Derived by ISO/IEC 27002.  https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  29   using information resources to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities,   evaluating the risks of identified vulnerabilities and having a documented and implemented maintenance  policy available,   receiving patches only from legitimate sources and testing them before they are installed,   applying alternative measures should a patch not be available or applicable,   applying rollback procedures and effective back-up & restore processes.  Beyond what customers and suppliers can do individually, there are initiatives that can take place at the industry  level. Google introduced, in June 2021, an End-to-End Framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts  throughout the software supply chain called SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts)58. The goal of SLSA is  to improve the state of the industry, particularly open source, to defend against the most pressing threats to integrity.  Even though SLSA focuses on software supply chain attacks and not all the other types, it is a good starting point  that may benefit organizations.  A more general but extensive set of recommendations for defending against cybersecurity threats was launched in  June 2021 by MITRE, known as the MITRE D3FEND project59. MITRE D3FEND is a framework or structured  knowledge base that allows organizations to find specific mitigations to prevent specific attacks as shown in the  MITRE ATT&CK® framework. The project is not specific to supply chain nor to APT attacks but the recommendations  can be used to increase the basic level of security of organizations.  Still, not all supply chain risks can be mitigated by good practices implemented by customers, suppliers or  organisations. In particular, hidden functions and undocumented access capabilities (backdoors) in hardware  components cannot be exhaustively identified by the most common certifications or standard penetration tests.  Additionally zero-day vulnerabilities, i.e. vulnerabilities known only to and used by a specific group, remain a  challenge. Consequently, action may be needed at the national or even European level. National competent  authorities could perform national security risk assessments for supply chain risks, which take into account known  actors in order to derive measures on sourcing from suppliers at a national level. Moreover, supply chain attacks may  be sponsored by state actors with advanced capabilities, and in this case the assistance of relevant authorities may  be needed to mitigate the risks of state-sponsored attacks.  58 Google Online Security Blog: Introducing SLSA, an End-to-End Framework for Supply Chain Integrity, Google,  https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html.

CONCLUSIONS  As the cost of direct attacks against well-protected organizations increases, attackers prefer to attack their supply  chain, which provides the additional motivation of a potentially large-scale and cross-border impact. This migration  has resulted in a larger-than-usual number of supply chain attack cases reported, with a forecast of four times  more supply chain attacks in 2021 than in 2020. The inherent global nature of current supply chains increases the  potential impact of these attacks and broadens the attack surface for malicious actors. This report covers a number of  known attacks but, in reality, there may be more supply chain attacks that go undetected, not investigated or  attributed to other causes.  Particularly in software, supply chain attacks undermine trust in the software ecosystem. The incidents described  highlight the potential for malicious actors to compromise the software supply chain from its very early stages  (development phase). New approaches need to be developed to secure the supply chain by design. In this direction,  new initiatives such as Google SLSA and MITRE D3FEND, appear to be quite promising.  The analysis in this report shows that there is still a large number of unknown factors in the incidents investigated.  66% of the attack vectors used on suppliers still remain unknown. A lack of transparency or the ability to  investigate poses a serious risk to the trust of the supply chain. Improving the process of transparency and  accountability is the first step to improving the security of all elements in the supply chain and protecting final  customers.  Supply chain attacks can be complex, require careful planning and often take months or years to execute. While  more than 50% of these attacks are attributed to APT groups or well-known attackers, the effectiveness of  supply chain attacks may make suppliers an interesting target for other, more generic, types of attackers in the future.  It is therefore critical that organizations focus their security not only in their own organizations, but also on their  suppliers. This is particularly the case for cloud service providers and managed service providers, where recent  attacks highlight the increased need for cybersecurity controls in these sectors.  Due to increased interdependencies and complexities, the impact of attacks on suppliers may have far reaching  consequences. This is not only due to the large number of affected parties but, especially in cases where classified  information is exfiltrated, is a cause for concern for national security or for consequences of a geopolitical nature.  In this complex environment for supply chains, establishing good practices at EU level and coordinated actions  are both important to support all Member States in developing similar capabilities – to reach a common level of  security.

It offers VSA  (Virtual System/Server Administrator) software and provides its own cloud servers. MSPs (Managed Service  Providers) can use the VSA software on premises or they can license the VSA cloud servers of Kaseya. MSPs in turn  offer various IT services to other clients61.  In July 2021, attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Kaseya’s own systems (CVE-2021-3011662). Attackers  could remotely execute commands on the VSA appliances of Kaseya’s customers. Kaseya can send out remote  updates to all VSA servers and, on Friday July 2, 2021, an update was distributed to Kaseya clients’ VSA that  executed code from the attackers. This malicious code in turn deployed ransomware63,64 to the customers being  managed by that VSA.

In April 2021, Codecov reported that attackers  obtained some of their valid credentials from a Docker image due to an error in how those Docker images were  created.  Once the attackers obtained these credentials, they used them to compromise an ”upload bash script”70 that is used  by Codecov customers. Once the customers downloaded and executed this script, the attackers were able to  exfiltrate data from Codecov’s customers, including sensitive information that would allow the attackers to access the  customers’ resources71. Multiple Codecov customers reported that the attackers were able to access their source  code using stolen information from the Codecov breach71. The attack was not attributed.

Wizvera has a product called VeraPort, an installation integration product that allows users to install security software  required by their employers73. In November 2020, attackers compromised a legitimate website that had VeraPort  support. They replaced the VeraPort configuration in the compromised website to deliver malware instead of the  expected security software.  The configuration was digitally signed by Wizvera73. VeraPort checks whether the software being downloaded has a  valid digital signature, however it does not check who issued the certificate. Through this mechanism, South Korea  users that accessed the compromised website downloaded the malware. The attack was attributed to the Lazarus  APT group73.

In March 2021, it was disclosed that attackers had compromised SITA servers  to gain access to passenger data from the customers of SITA. Some of SITA’s customers also reported data  breaches, such as Air India, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.  Following reports of leaked data on the Internet, Air India also reported that its networks were compromised and data  was stolen. The compromise of Air India internal networks was allegedly related to the SITA incident because a  security company found that the name of one computer inside Air India was “SITASERVER4”.  To date, it remains unknown how the attackers gained access to the SITA servers and it is also not known how the  attackers may have accessed Air India, or whether they actually did so.

It may be that, due to the more robust security protection  that organizations have put in place, attackers successfully shifted towards suppliers. They managed to have  significant impacts in terms of the downtime of systems, monetary losses and reputational damages, to name but a  few. The importance of supply chains is attributed to the fact that successful attacks may impact a large amount  number of customers who make use of the affected supplier. Therefore, the cascading effects from a single attack  may have a widely propagated impact.  This report aims at mapping and studying the supply chain attacks that were discovered from January 2020 to early  July 2021. Based on the trends and patterns observed, supply chain attacks increased in number and sophistication  in the year 2020 and this trend is continuing in 2021, posing an increasing risk for organizations. It is estimated that  there will be four times more supply chain attacks in 2021 than in 2020. With half of the attacks being attributed to  Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) actors, their complexity and resources greatly exceed the more common non-  targeted attacks, and, therefore, there is an increasing need for new protective methods that incorporate suppliers in  order to guarantee that organizations remain secure.  This report presents the Agency’s Threat Landscape concerning supply chain attacks, produced with the support of  the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes1.  The main highlights of the report include the following:   A taxonomy to classify supply chain attacks in order to better analyse them in a systematic manner and  understand the way they manifest is described.   24 supply chain attacks were reported from January 2020 to early July 2021, and have been studied in  this report.   Around 50% of the attacks were attributed to well-known APT groups by the security community.   Around 42% of the analysed attacks have not yet been attributed to a particular group.   Around 62% of the attacks on customers took advantage of their trust in their supplier.   In 62% of the cases, malware was the attack technique employed.   When considering targeted assets, in 66% of the incidents attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in  order to further compromise targeted customers.   Around 58% of the supply chain attacks aimed at gaining access to data (predominantly customer data,  including personal data and intellectual property) and around 16% at gaining access to people.   Not all attacks should be denoted as supply chain attacks, but due to their nature many of them are  potential vectors for new supply chain attacks in the future.   Organizations need to update their cybersecurity methodology with supply chain attacks in mind  and to incorporate all their suppliers in their protection and security verification.  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  4  1. INTRODUCTION  Supply chain attacks have been a security concern for many years, but the community seems to have been facing a  increased number of more organized attacks since 2020. It may be that, due to the more robust security protection  that organizations have put in place, attackers have shifted towards suppliers and managed to cause significant  impact in terms of the downtime of systems, monetary losses and reputational damages, to name but a few. This  report aims at mapping and studying the supply chain attacks that were discovered between January 2020 and early  July 2021.  The devastating and ripple effect of supply chain attacks was seen in full force with the SolarWinds attack2.  SolarWinds is considered one of the largest supply chain attacks of the last few years, particularly taking into account  the affected entities that included governmental organizations and large corporations. It received great media  attention and led to policy initiatives around the globe3. More recently, in July 2021 the Kaseya4 attack manifested  itself and raised the need for further and dedicated attention to supply chain attacks affecting managed service  providers. Unfortunately, these two examples are not isolated cases and the number of supply chain attacks has  been steadily increasing over the last year. This trend further stresses the need for policymakers and the security  community to devise and introduce novel protective measures to address potential supply chain attacks in the future  and to mitigate their impact.  Through a careful survey and analysis, this report maps supply chain attacks based on incidents identified from  January 2020 to early July 2021. Each incident has been broken down into its key elements, such as the attack  techniques and assets of both suppliers and customers alike that are affected by adversaries. The introduction of a  taxonomy for supply chain attacks will facilitate their classification and may be the starting point for a more structured  approach in analysing such attacks and coming up with dedicated security controls to mitigate them. The proposed  taxonomy also helps to classify, compare and discuss these attacks using a common ground. The similarities  between the proposed taxonomy and other well-known frameworks are discussed.  This report also analyses the similarities between the lifecycle of supply chain attacks and the more well-known  attacks by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). A summary of the most prominent supply chain incidents since 2020  is included in the Annex, each of which has been decomposed in accordance with the aforementioned taxonomy.  The core of the report is an analysis of all the reported supply chain incidents to identify their key characteristics and  techniques. The analysis answers the questions: what are the most common attack techniques being used in supply  chain attacks, what are the main customer assets that attackers are after, and which is the relationship between  attacks and assets targeted?  With the rise in attention being paid to supply chain attacks, many other related security incidents were also  highlighted as being related to the supply chain, namely they were assumed to be supply chain attacks. We therefore  discuss what constitutes a supply chain attack and why many attacks are not really supply chain attacks, showing  some cases as examples. Understanding the threat landscape concerning supply chain attacks is important since  misclassification of incidents may lead to erroneous trend analysis and conclusions.  The report also includes a set of recommendations aimed at policymakers and organizations, in particularly suppliers,  the adoption of which may increase the overall security posture against supply chain attacks.  2 Russian SolarWinds hackers launch email attack on government agencies, The Guardian.  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/28/russian-solarwinds-hackers-launch-assault-government-agencies.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  6  2. WHAT IS A SUPPLY CHAIN  ATTACK?  Supply chain refers to the ecosystem of processes, people, organizations, and distributors involved in the  creation and delivery of a final solution or product5. In cybersecurity, the supply chain involves a wide range of  resources (hardware and software), storage (cloud or local), distribution mechanisms (web applications, online  stores), and management software.  There are four key elements in a supply chain:   Supplier: is an entity that supplies a product or service to another entity.   Supplier Assets: are valuable elements used by the supplier to produce the product or service.   Customer: is the entity that consumes the product or service produced by the supplier.   Customer Assets: are valuable elements owned by the target.  An entity can be individuals, groups of individuals, or organizations. Assets can be people, software, documents,  finances, hardware, or others.  A supply chain attack is a combination of at least two attacks. The first attack is on a supplier that is then used to  attack the target to gain access to its assets. The target can be the final customer or another supplier. Therefore, for  an attack to be classified as a supply chain one, both the supplier and the customer have to be targets.  2.1. TAXONOMY OF SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  This report proposes a taxonomy to characterize supply chain attacks and structure their subsequent analysis. This  taxonomy considers all four key elements of a supply chain, as well as the techniques used by attackers. The  taxonomy may help organisations in understanding the various parts of a supply chain attack, comparing them with  other similar cyber-attacks, and more importantly identifying the incidents as supply chain attacks.  The taxonomy should be used as a guiding template where, upon a new potential supply chain attack, the community  may try to analyse it by identifying and mapping out each of the four distinct taxonomy elements. If no customer is  attacked, or no supplier attacked, then it is probably not a supply chain attack6.  The taxonomy, as presented in Table 1, has one section for the supplier and one section for the customer. For the  supplier, the first part is called “Attack Technique Used to Compromise the Supply Chain” and it identifies how the  supplier was attacked. The second part for the supplier is called “Supplier Assets Targeted by the Supply Chain  Attack” and it identifies what was the target of the attack on the supplier.  For the customer, the first part is called “Attack Techniques Used to Compromise the Customer” and it identifies how  the customer was attacked. The second part for the customer is called “Customer Assets Targeted by the Supply  Chain Attack” and it identifies what was the target of the attack on the customer.  For each of these four distinguishing elements in the taxonomy, we have defined the elements that better  characterise a supply chain attack. By selecting the corresponding elements, it is possible to have a better  understanding of what is known or not known about an attack. The taxonomy is conceptually different from MITRE  ATT&CK® knowledge base and it does not aim to replace the latter but rather complement it. Attack techniques  defined in the proposed taxonomy and illustrated in Table 1 are in some cases related to relevant attack techniques  as identified in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, and are accordingly marked with the respective MITRE ATT&CK®  5 Beamon, B. M. (1998). Supply chain design and analysis: Models and methods.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  7  identifier in square brackets, for example [T1189]. The following subsections clarify each of the four parts of the  taxonomy and how to identify its elements.  Table 1: Proposed taxonomy for supply chain attacks. It has four parts: (i) attack techniques used on the supplier, (ii)  assets attacked in the supplier, (iii) attack techniques used on the customer, (iii) assets attacked in the customer.  SUPPLIER  CUSTOMER  Attack Techniques Used  to Compromise the  Supply Chain  Supplier Assets  Targeted by the Supply  Chain Attack  Attack Techniques Used  to Compromise the  Customer  Customer Assets  Targeted by the Supply  Chain Attack  Malware Infection  Social Engineering  Brute-Force Attack  Exploiting Software  Vulnerability  Exploiting Configuration  Vulnerability  Open-Source  Intelligence (OSINT)  Pre-existing Software  Software Libraries  Code  Configurations  Data  Processes  Hardware  People  Supplier  Trusted Relationship  [T1199]  Drive-by Compromise  [T1189]  Phishing [T1566]  Malware Infection  Physical Attack or  Modification  Counterfeiting  Data  Personal Data  Intellectual Property  Software  Processes  Bandwidth  Financial  People  An EU cybersecurity incident taxonomy7 is used for the purpose of incident response coordination activities and  information sharing at Union level. Since the taxonomy is conceptually different and does not allow for detailed  analysis of supply chain incidents, we recommend the complementary use of both taxonomies.  2.2. ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A SUPPLY CHAIN  The attack techniques refer to “how” the attack took place, and not “what” was used to attack. For example, this  category distinguishes whether the supplier was attacked with a password found online (OSINT) or whether the  password was brute-forced (Brute-Force Attack). However, it is not relevant for the taxonomy whether the password  found online was leaked, a default password or sold in a black market. The categories of Attack Techniques below  cover the attack techniques most commonly used in the supply chain attacks analysed in this report. It is evident that  more than one technique may have been used in any given attack and, in several cases, entities may not have the  knowledge on how the attackers gained access to their infrastructure, or this information was not divulged or duly  reported.  7  Cybersecurity incident taxonomy, Publications of the NIS Cooperation Group, July 2018.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-cooperation-group.

Each technique identifies how the attack  happened, and not what was attacked. Several techniques may be used in the same attack.  ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A SUPPLY CHAIN  Malware Infection e.g. spyware used to steal credentials from employees.  Social Engineering  e.g. phishing, fake applications, typo-squatting, Wi-Fi impersonation,  convincing the supplier to do something.  Brute-Force Attack e.g. guessing an SSH password, guessing a web login.  Exploiting Software  Vulnerability  e.g. SQL injection or buffer overflow exploit in an application.  Exploiting  Configuration  Vulnerability  e.g. taking advantage of a configuration problem.  Physical Attack or  Modification  e.g. modify hardware, physical intrusion.  Open-Source  Intelligence (OSINT)  e.g. search online for credentials, API keys, usernames.  Counterfeiting e.g. imitation of USB with malicious purposes.  2.3. SUPPLIER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  The supplier assets targeted by the attackers refers to “what” was the target of the attack on the supplier, which  allowed further attacks to be subsequently mounted. The targeted asset(s) usually has a direct relationship with the  final target and it is usually possible to understand the final intentions of the attacker by analysing the list of affected  assets. In some cases, because of a lack of information divulged or reported by the supplier, it is not possible to have  information on the target assets. This might also be the case when suppliers do not have the knowledge or expertise  to identify which assets were compromised by the attackers.  Table 3: Assets of the supplier targeted by attackers. Each element identifies what was attacked in the supplier.  Several techniques that could affect several assets may be used in the same attack.  SUPPLIER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Pre-existing Software  e.g. software used by the supplier, web servers, applications,  databases, monitoring systems, cloud applications, firmware. It does  not include software libraries.  Software Libraries  e.g. third party libraries, software packages installed from third parties  such as npm, ruby, etc.  Code  e.g. source code or software produced by the supplier.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  9  SUPPLIER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Configurations e.g. passwords, API keys, firewall rules, URLs.  Data  e.g. information about the supplier, values from sensors, certificates,  personal data of customers or suppliers themselves, personal data.  Processes  e.g. updates, backups or validation processes, signing certificates  processes.  Hardware e.g. hardware produced by the supplier, chips, valves, USBs.  People  e.g. targeted individuals with access to data, infrastructure, or to other  people.  2.4. ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A CUSTOMER  This element of the taxonomy refers to the attack techniques used to compromise the customer through their  supplier. Under this element of the taxonomy, we identify “how” the customer was attacked and not with “what”. It is a  technique and not a specific type of attack. For example, if the customer updates its software from the supplier and  receives a type of malware, the attack is both on a 'Trusted Relationship’ and a ‘Malware Infection’. It is evident that  more than one technique may be applied in several cases. Customers may not always have knowledge of the  technique used by attackers to gain access to their assets via their suppliers, but have the means to identify that the  technique used was not within their perimeter.  Table 4: Attack techniques used to compromise the customer. Each technique identifies how the attack happened,  and not what was attacked. Several techniques may be used in the same attack.  ATTACK TECHNIQUES USED TO COMPROMISE A CUSTOMER  Trusted Relationship  [T1199]  e.g. trust a certificate, trust an automatic update, trust an automatic  backup.  Drive-by  Compromise [T1189]  e.g. malicious scripts in a website to infect users with malware.  Phishing [T1566] e.g. messages impersonating the supplier, fake update notifications.  Malware Infection e.g. Remote Access Trojan (RAT), backdoor, ransomware.  Physical Attack or  Modification  e.g. modify hardware, physical intrusion.  Counterfeiting  e.g. create a fake USB, modify a motherboard, impersonation of  supplier’s personnel.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  10  2.5. CUSTOMER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Customer assets are the main and final target of the attackers and usually the raison d’etre for a supply chain attack.  These assets may vary depending on the industry sector and the type of service offered. The particular element in  the taxonomy is meant to facilitate understanding of the impact of the attack and also enable comparisons concerning  the goals of the attackers. Certain assets might have been directly targeted by attackers, whereas others may have  been inadvertently affected. More than one customer are usually affected by typical supply chain attacks. It is  possible that the customer may not be aware of the adversary's target (e.g., the attack was either unsuccessful or  quickly detected).  Table 5: Assets of the customer targeted by attackers. Each element identifies what was attacked in the customer.  Several techniques may be used in the same attack. This is usually the final target of the attack.  CUSTOMER ASSETS TARGETED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK  Data  e.g. payment data, video feeds, documents, emails, flight plans, sales  data and financial data, intellectual property.  Personal data  e.g. customer data, employee records, credentials.  Software  e.g. access to the customer product source code, modification of the  software of the customer.  Processes  e.g. documentation of internal processes of operation and  configurations, insertion of new malicious processes, documents of  schematics.  Bandwidth  e.g. use the bandwidth for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), send  SPAM or to infect others on a large scale.  Financial e.g. steal cryptocurrency, hijack bank accounts, money transfers.  People e.g. individuals targeted due their position or knowledge.  2.6. HOW TO MAKE USE OF THE TAXONOMY  The following is an example of how applying the taxonomy to a real case can help identify its particular features and  facilitate an understanding of the characteristics of the attack.  Codecov is a company that provides software for code coverage and testing tools. The company supplies tools to  other companies such as IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In April 2021, Codecov reported that attackers  obtained some of their valid credentials from a Docker image8 due to an error in how those Docker images were  created. Once the attackers obtained these credentials, they used them to compromise an “upload bash script” that is  used by Codecov customers9. Once the customers downloaded and executed this script, the attackers were able to  exfiltrate data from Codecov’s customers, including sensitive information that would allow the attackers to access the  customer resources10. Multiple Codecov customers reported that the attackers were able to access their source code  8 Codecov supply chain attack breakdown, GitGuardian, https://blog.gitguardian.com/codecov-supply-chain-breach/.

The attack was not attributed to specific adversaries. Figure 1  (below) depicts the steps involved in this particular attack.  Using this information, we can identify the four elements in the proposed taxonomy. The attack on the supplier means  how the attackers got access to the supplier, and in this case it was by “Exploiting a Configuration Vulnerability”.  Through this attack, the attackers target the asset of “code” in the supplier. After the elements for the supplier were  identified in the taxonomy, we can move to how the customer was attacked. In the Codecov case is through a  ‘Trusted Relationship’ with the supplier that was not secured and verified. The final asset targeted in the customer  was reported to be source code, so ‘Software’.  Table 6: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving the Codecov Company. The attackers  exploited a configuration vulnerability in Codecov which was used to modify the supplier’s code. The attackers  abused the trusted relationship between Codecov and its customers to exfiltrate data necessary to access the  customer’s software source code.

SUPPLY CHAIN TAXONOMY AND OTHER FRAMEWORKS  2.7.1. MITRE ATT&CK® Knowledge Base  MITRE ATT&CK® is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behaviour. The taxonomy proposed in  the report differs from MITRE ATT&CK®12 because the purposes of both are very different. Therefore, it is not  possible to use MITRE ATT&CK® in the supply chain taxonomy, since we opted for placing emphasis on the four  aspects that typically characterise a supply chain attack and in particular the supplier-customer relationship. While  MITRE ATT&CK® completely maps the options and steps in the lifecycle of all attacks, its coverage of the details of a  supply chain are not yet that developed.  For example, in the MITRE ATT&CK® ‘Initial Access’ category, there is a technique called ‘Supply Chain  Compromise’13. This is very useful for companies to identify a supply chain as a risk, but too generic when focusing  explicitly on the supply chain attacks themselves. The proposed taxonomy maps all the details of the supply chain  attack itself, and therefore could potentially complement the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base.  2.7.2. Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain® Framework  The proposed taxonomy also has a different purpose than the well-known Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain®  framework14. The cyber kill chain is a framework that was designed to identify the steps taken by attackers to achieve  their goals. While these steps may be taken as part of a supply chain attack, they are too generic to classify,  understand and compare supply chain attacks. The taxonomy presented here proposes a more detail analysis of  these attacks and, more importantly, it helps map both attacks involved in a sole supply chain attack, one on the  supplier and one on the customer.  12 MITRE ATT&CK®, MITRE, https://attack.mitre.org/.

THE LIFECYCLE OF A SUPPLY  CHAIN ATTACK  It can be observed that a supply chain attack is usually composed of an attack on one or more suppliers and then a  later attack on the final target, namely the customer. Each of these attacks may resemble very closely the lifecycle of  APT attacks.  Although it is hard to agree on a unique definition of what an APT attack is, throughout this report it is considered that  an APT attack is any attack that is targeted, obtains unauthorized access to an organization (usually code execution),  is spread over a long period of time, and its final goal is in a specific relation to the target (as opposed to, for  example, cryptomining). Of course, such a definition is not complete and many others may exist. However, a  definition is important to understand that supply chain attacks are usually targeted, complex, costly and with attackers  probably planning them for a long time. The mere fact that at least two types of successful attacks are involved in  typical supply chain incidents, is an indicator of both the degree of sophistication of the adversaries, but also their  persistence and intent to succeed.  It is worth noting that many APT attacks were considered not ‘advanced’ by the community in relation to the quality of  their code, exploits and malware. However, it may be considered that the characterisation of being ‘advanced’ refers  to the whole operation and not necessarily merely to the code. In the end, planning, staging, developing and  executing two attacks in two organizations is a complex task.  These distinctions are crucial to understand that an organization could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack  even when its own defences are quite good and therefore the attackers are trying to explore new potential  highways to infiltrate them by moving to their suppliers and making a target out of them. Moreover, the potential  impact of supply chain attacks affecting numerous customers of the same supplier are probably immense. This is yet  another reason why these types of attacks are becoming increasingly common as they provide adversaries with a  means to potentially boost their reputations, as well as possibly make large financial gains.  An additional characteristic of supply chain attacks involves the complexity in handling them and the efforts required  to mitigate and address such attacks. The mere fact that at least two organisational entities are affected and the use,  most likely, of sophisticated attack vectors complicates the handling of an incident, forensics analysis and overall  management of the incident. The fact that the supplier-consumer relationship is continuously evolving and both  suppliers and customers are constantly updating their systems, introduces the need for continuous security of the  supply chain and active risk assessment and management.  The lifecycle of a supply chain attack has two main parts, the attack on the supplier and the attack on the customer.  Each of these attacks is usually complex, requiring one attack vector, one plan of action, and careful execution.  These attacks may take months to be successful and, in many cases, may go undetected for a long time. The  lifecycle of a supply chain attack can be seen in Figure 2.  The first attack in the lifecycle is called “Supplier APT Attack” and it focuses on compromising one or more suppliers.  The second attack in the lifecycle is called “Customer APT Attack” and it focuses on the final target of the attack.  These two parts are linked by the access to the supplier but otherwise may be quite different in techniques used,  attack vectors exploited and time spent on the attack.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  14  Figure 2: The lifecycle of supply chain attacks can be seen as two APT attacks intertwined. The first attack targets  one or more suppliers, and the second attack targets the customers. These attacks require careful planning and  execution.  In at least eleven attacks out of all the cases studied in this report, investigations confirmed that the supply chain  attacks were conducted by known APT groups. These attributions were done by the security companies responsible  for the reports referenced in Annex A. In the other thirteen cases the incidents were not fully investigated or  attribution was not possible. Such attributions support the idea that both parts of the lifecycle of a supply chain attack  can resemble the work of APT attacks. It is worth noting that attribution of attackers is very hard, prone to error,  imprecise and politically challenging, but not impossible.  Since each part of the supply chain attack may be seen as an APT attack, its individual lifecycle would generally  follow the same stages as other APT attacks. Such stages are detailed, for example, in the MITRE ATT&CK® Tactics  for Enterprises15.  15 MITRE ATT&CK® Tactics - Enterprise Version 9, MITRE, https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/.

PROMINENT SUPPLY CHAIN  ATTACKS  This section presents a summary of the most prominent supply chain attacks from January 2020 to early July 2021,  along with a classification following the proposed taxonomy. These cases were selected because of the large impact  produced in the community or because they highlight certain characteristics (as indicated in the elements of the  taxonomy) that are important. The complete list and description of all supply chain attacks from January 2020 to early  July 2021 is available in Annex A.  4.1. SOLARWINDS ORION: IT MANAGEMENT AND REMOTE MONITORING  SolarWinds is a company that supplies management and monitoring software16. Orion is SolarWinds’ network  management system (NMS) product17. In December 2020 it was discovered that Orion had been compromised. An  extensive investigation showed that attackers gained access to the SolarWinds network, possibly through exploiting a  zero-day vulnerability in a third-party application or device, a brute-force attack or through social engineering. Once  compromised, the attackers collected information for an extended period of time. The malicious software was injected  into Orion during the build process18,19. The compromised software was then downloaded directly by the customers  and was used to gather and steal information20. The attack was attributed to the APT29 group21,22.  Table 7: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving SolarWinds. The attackers used multiple attack  techniques to compromise SolarWinds Orion software. They modified code in the supplier and abused the trusted  relationship of customers in SolarWinds to update the customers with malware. The attackers’ final target was  customers’ data.

The attackers compromised SolarWinds and modified the code  of ORION software. The ORION instances in the customers were updated with malware, which allowed the attackers  to access the data of customers.  4.2. MIMECAST: CLOUD CYBERSECURITY SERVICES  Mimecast is a supplier of cloud-based cybersecurity services. Among the services it provides, Mimecast offers email  security services, which require customers to connect securely to Mimecast servers to use their Microsoft 365  accounts. In January 2021, it was discovered that attackers had compromised Mimecast (through the SolarWinds  supplier). After the compromise, a Mimecast-issued certificate used by customers to access Microsoft 365 services  was accessed by attackers, giving them the ability to intercept the network connections and to connect to the  Microsoft 365 accounts to steal information23,24. The attack was attributed to the APT29 group25. The compromise of  the supplier has been reportedly linked to SolarWinds, but there is no concrete information to validate this.  Table 8: Supply chain attack taxonomy applied to the attack involving Mimecast. It is unknown how attackers  targeted the suppliers’ data, specifically a Mimecast-issued certificate. The attackers abused the trusted relationship  of customers uploading their data to Mimecast. The attackers accessed the data of customers in Mimecast.

LEDGER: HARDWARE WALLET  Ledger is a company that supplies hardware wallet technology for cryptocurrencies. In July 2020, attackers obtained  valid credentials to access Ledger’s e-commerce database26. The stolen data was released publicly in an online  forum27. Attackers used the stolen data for online phishing and extortion of users28,29, and for stealing users’ money  through a physical attack after supplying users with counterfeit Ledger wallets which, when connected to a computer  that would ask users for their security keys, would infect the computer with malware and send the stolen information  back to the attackers30.

KASEYA: IT MANAGEMENT SERVICES COMPROMISED WITH RANSOMWARE  Kaseya is a software service provider specializing in remote monitoring and management tools. It offers VSA (Virtual  System/Server Administrator) software for its clients to download, and also to work through its own cloud servers.  MSPs (Managed Service Providers) can use the VSA software on premises or they can license the VSA cloud  servers of Kaseya. MSPs in turn offer various IT services to other clients31. In July 2021, attackers exploited a zero-  day vulnerability in Kaseya’s own systems (CVE-2021-3011632) that enabled the attackers to remotely execute  commands on the VSA appliances of Kaseya’s customers. Kaseya can send out remote updates to all VSA servers  and, on Friday July 2, 2021, an update was distributed to Kaseya clients’ VSA that executed code from the attackers.  This malicious code in turn deployed ransomware33,34 to the customers being managed by that VSA.  31 Ransomware Hits Hundreds of US Companies, Security Firm Says, NBC10 Philadelphia, https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-  international/new-ransomware-attack-paralyzes-hundreds-of-u-s-companies/2868462/.

AN EXAMPLE OF MANY UNKNOWNS: SITA PASSENGER SERVICE SYSTEM  The case of SITA is prominent due to the many components of supply chain attacks that remain unknown and the  possible implications of their impact. It illustrates that there can be many circumstances where the details of the attacks  are never published, due to technical impossibility or political and marketing decisions by the companies. There is a  trade-off between a benefit for the community, which may improve its security by learning from the details of how  others were compromised, and the benefits for the individual companies, e.g. financial, reputational and market35.  SITA is a company that specializes in air information technology and transport information. SITA’s passenger service  system is used to provide airlines with passenger information at the time of boarding, including the risk passengers  may pose to a country36.  35 Investors in SolarWinds sold millions in stock before Russia breach revealed, The Washington Post,  https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/15/solarwinds-russia-breach-stock-trades/.

Some of SITA’s customers also reported data breaches, such as Air India, Singapore Airlines  and Malaysia Airlines36.  Following reports of leaked data on the Internet, Air India also reported that its networks were compromised and data  was stolen.37 The compromise of Air India internal networks was allegedly related to the SITA incident because a  security company found that the name of one computer inside Air India was “SITASERVER4”. To date, it remains  unknown how the attackers gained access to the SITA servers and it is also not known how the attackers may have  accessed Air India, or whether they actually did so. The internal attack to Air India’s networks was attributed to the  group APT4137.  The number of unknown variables in this incident is an example of the threat landscape when it comes to supply  chain attacks. The level of maturity concerning cyber investigations and preparedness of many organizations should  also extend to their suppliers, due to their complex, intertwined relationships.

ANALYSIS OF SUPPLY CHAIN  INCIDENTS  In this section we present an analysis of supply chain attacks based on attacks reported from early 2020 up to early  July 2021. The analysis focuses on publicly known supply chain attacks and a detailed overview may be found in  Annex A. As discussed later, some attacks appeared to be supply chain attacks but were not and so were omitted  from the analysis. A summary of all the incidents analysed in the report is shown in Table 12.  Table 12: Summary of the supply chain attacks identified, analysed and validated from January 2020 to early July  2021.

TIMELINE OF SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  The analysis shows that out of 24 confirmed supply chain attacks, 8 (33%) were reported in 2020 and 16 (66%) from  January 2021 to early July 2021. Based on this data, the trend forecasts that 2021 may have 4 times more  supply chain attacks than 2020.  Figure 8 shows a timeline of the attacks analysed in this report, highlighting those incidents that were attributed to  APT groups, and whether they had a global or regional impact. The impact is categorised in each attack as global or  regional. The attacks are considered to have a global impact if their customer base is global or if the number of end-  users possibly affected are in the millions. Alternatively, attacks that impact users in a specific region or country, or  that affect only a handful of users are considered to have a regional impact.  Figure 8: Timeline of supply chain attacks reported from January 2020 to early July 2021. The month indicated in the  Figure refers to the month the incident was reported and not when the attack happened. Incidents attributed to APT  groups are marked with black dots, incidents with global impact are marked with violet dots, and incidents with  regional impact are marked with green dots. A detailed summary of each incident is available in Annex A.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  23  5.2. UNDERSTANDING THE FLOW OF ATTACKS  Each of the incidents shown in Figure 7 was analysed, summarized, and classified according to the proposed  taxonomy. The taxonomy supports and facilitates the study of supply chain attacks as a whole in a structured  manner.  Figure 8 is a Sankey diagram38, which illustrates the flow of the most common attack techniques and assets observed  in the supply chain attacks that were studied in this report. Attack techniques [ST] are used against supplier  assets [SA], which are used in attack techniques [CT] to compromise customers’ assets [CA].  From Figure 8, it is clear that most attack techniques used to compromise the supplier (first column [ST]) are:   Unknown (66%), followed by   Exploiting software vulnerabilities (16%).  In terms of suppliers’ assets targeted (second column [SA]), most attacks aimed to compromise:   Code (66%),   Data (20%)   Processes (12%).  The compromised suppliers’ assets are used as an attack vector to compromise the customers. Those attacks are  mostly done (third column [CT]):   by Abusing the trust of the customer (62%) in the supplier, or   by using Malware (62%).  Independently of the technique used, most supply chain attacks aim at gaining access to (fourth column [CA]):   customer Data (58%),   key People (16%) and   Financial resources (8%).  38 Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.

GOAL ORIENTED ATTACKERS  When considering targeted assets, in 66% of the incidents attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in order to further  compromise the targeted customers. In 20% of the analysed incidents attackers’ targeted data, and in 12% the  targets of the attack on the supplier were internal processes. This is key to understanding where to focus efforts in  terms of cybersecurity protection. Organizations should focus their efforts on validating third-party code and software  to ensure it has not been tampered with or manipulated.  The final customer assets targeted on these supply chain attacks seem to be predominantly customer data, including  personal data and intellectual property. This was the case in 58% of the supply chain incidents analysed. Attackers  also targeted to a lesser degree other assets including people, software, and financial resources.  5.4. MOST ATTACK VECTORS TO COMPROMISE SUPPLIERS REMAIN UNKNOWN  Our findings show that in 66% of the supply chain attacks analysed, suppliers did not know, or were not  transparent, about how they were compromised. In contrast, less than 9% of the customers compromised through  supply chain attacks did not know how the attacks happened. This highlights the gap in terms of maturity in  cybersecurity incident reporting between suppliers and end-user facing companies.  Considering that 83% of the suppliers are in the technology sector, the lack of knowledge on how attacks happened  could either indicate a poor level of maturity when it comes to cyber defence in suppliers’ infrastructure or  unwillingness to share the relevant information. There are other factors that may contribute to a lack of understanding  of how suppliers are compromised, including the complexity and sophistication of the attacks and slowness in  discovering the attacks which in turn may hinder investigation.  5.5. SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS ATTRIBUTED TO APT GROUPS  More than 50% of the supply chain attacks were attributed to well-known cybercrime groups, including APT29,  APT41, Thallium APT, UNC2546, Lazarus APT, TA413 and TA428. The analysis shows that APT groups seem to  have a slight preference for targets with regional impact, and that a significant number of these attacks aimed to gain  access to customer data.  Out of the 24 incidents analysed, 10 were not attributed to a particular group. The main reason for the lack of  attribution may be that 7 of these attacks happened in the last 7 months. Incidents of this kind may take a longer time  to investigate, and even then, in certain cases, attribution is still not possible. However, given the sophistication of  these attacks, suppliers should expect to be targeted by organized cybercrime groups and prepare accordingly.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  26  6. NOT EVERYTHING IS A SUPPLY  CHAIN ATTACK  From January 2020 to early July 2021, there were many incidents that initially appeared to be supply chain attacks or  were considered part of a probable future supply chain attack. Many traditional software vulnerabilities that were  found were reported as a ‘risk’ for future supply chain attacks. Some cases involved vulnerabilities that were thought  to be intentionally placed in software or hardware but that were later found to be bugs or unintentional errors. Many of  these cases were not supply chain attacks since they did not involve a supplier being compromised.  On at least three occasions attackers targeted software libraries or dependencies. In one of these cases, reported in  December 2020, attackers uploaded malicious packages to RubyGems repository39. A very similar case was reported  in March 2021, when a security researcher managed to upload malicious NPM packages using names known to be  the names of components or infrastructure used by well-known companies40. A third case was reported in April 2021,  when attackers uploaded a malicious NPM package trying to deliberately impersonate a well-known package in an  attack dubbed brandjacking41. In all these cases, the attackers did not compromise existing packages nor the  software repositories themselves thus, without a clear attack on supplier assets, we don't consider them as supply  chain attacks.  In many cases, vulnerabilities in software were discovered but not used in attacks, or were discovered to be errors  and not intentionally introduced. The first example of such a case was reported in February 2020, in which a security  researcher disclosed a 0-day vulnerability in the firmware developed by the company Xiaongmai and used for DVRs,  NVRs and IP cameras42. Other examples include the vulnerabilities reported in Visual Studio Code extensions in May  202143, and on Pling-based free and open-source software (FOSS) marketplaces in June 202144. In all these cases,  vulnerabilities were discovered though no active attacks using them had been reported at the time of writing this  report. As mentioned in previous sections, a supply chain attack involves at least two attacks, namely on a supplier  and on a customer. Without an attack on a customer or a supplier, the attack is not considered a supply chain attack.  Additionally, there were other cases of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities that were not supply chain attacks.  One such case was the attack on Centreon systems. Centreon is a company that supplies IT monitoring services and  offers an open-source software IT monitoring tool. In January 2021, it was discovered that attackers had exploited  outdated public facing instances of Centreon to compromise customers' infrastructure45,46,47. The attackers, attributed  to be the Sandworm APT group, conducted their campaign for three years until they were discovered. The attack  aimed to exfiltrate information from the affected customers. The attack was targeted at French IT providers. This is a  case where a particular software vulnerability was exploited in a software installed by customers. However, the  supplier itself was not compromised and the vulnerabilities were not intentional.  39 Russian Sandworm hackers only hit orgs with old Centreon software, Bleeping Computer, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-  sandworm-hackers-only-hit-orgs-with-old-centreon-software/.

RECOMMENDATIONS  Supply chain attacks leverage the interconnectedness of the global markets. When multiple customers rely on  the same supplier, the consequences of a cyber-attack against this supplier are amplified, potentially resulting in a  large-scale national or even cross-border impact. For some products, such as software and executable code, the  existence of a supply chain is opaque or even completely hidden to the end user. End-user software depends,  directly or indirectly, on software provided by the supplier. Such dependencies include packages, libraries, and  modules — all of which are used pervasively to lower development costs and accelerate shipping times.  The better protected against cyber-attacks organizations become, the more the attention shifts to suppliers. The math  is simple, suppliers are becoming the weakest link on the supply chain. At the same time, customers demand  products that are more cybersecure but that remain at a low cost, two needs that it is not always possible to  reconcile.  As we observed in numerous incidents of supply chain attacks, organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the  need to assess of the cybersecurity maturity of their suppliers and the level of exposure to the risk arising  from this customer-supplier relationship. Customers need to assess and take into account the overall quality of  the products and cybersecurity practices of their suppliers, including whether they apply secure development  procedures. Moreover, customers should exercise increased due diligence in selecting and vetting their suppliers,  and in managing the risk that stems from these relationships.  To manage supply chain cybersecurity risk, customers should48:   identify and document types of suppliers and service providers,   define risk criteria for different types of suppliers and services (e.g. important supplier and customer  dependencies, critical software dependencies, single points of failure),   assess supply chain risks according to their own business continuity impact assessments and requirements,   define measures for risk treatment based on good practices,   monitor supply chain risks and threats, based on internal and external sources of information and on findings  from suppliers’ performance monitoring and reviews,   make their personnel aware of the risk.  To manage the relationship to suppliers, customers should:   manage suppliers over the whole lifecycle of a product or service, including procedures to handle end-of-life  products or components,   classify assets and information that are shared with or accessible to suppliers, and define relevant  procedures for their access and handling,   define obligations of suppliers for the protection of the organisation’s assets, for the sharing of information,  for audit rights, for business continuity, for personnel screening, and for the handling of incidents in terms  responsibilities, notification obligations and procedures,   define security requirements for the products and services acquired,   include all these obligations and requirements in contracts; agree on rules for sub-contracting and potential  cascading requirements,   monitor service performance and perform routine security audits to verify adherence to cybersecurity  requirements in agreements; this includes the handling of incidents, vulnerabilities, patches, security  requirements, etc.,   receive assurance of suppliers and service providers that no hidden features or backdoors are knowingly  included,  48 Derived by cybersecurity controls in standards ISO/IEC 27002, ISO 9001 and ISO 31000.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  28   ensure regulatory and legal requirements are considered,   define processes to manage changes in supplier agreements, e.g. changes in tools, technologies, etc.  On the other hand, suppliers should ensure the secure development of products and services that is consistent  with commonly accepted security practices49. Suppliers should:   ensure that the infrastructure used to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver products, components and  services follows cybersecurity practices,50,51;   implement a product development, maintenance and support process that is consistent with commonly  accepted product development processes,   implement a secure engineering process that is consistent with commonly accepted security practices52, 53,   consider applicability of technical requirements based on product category and risks54,   offering Conformance Statements to customers for known standards, i.e. ISO/IEC 27001, IEC 62443-4-1,  IEC 62443-4-2 (or specific ones such as the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) for cloud services), and  ensuring and attesting to, to the extent possible, the integrity and origin of open source software used within  any portion of a product,   define quality objectives such as the number of defects or externally identified vulnerabilities or externally  reported security issues, and use them as an instrument to improve overall quality,   maintain accurate and up-to-date data on the origin of software code or components, and on controls  applied to internal and third-party software components, tools, and services present in software development  processes,   perform regular audits to ensure that the above measures are met.  Moreover, as any product or service is built from or based on components and software that is subject to  vulnerabilities suppliers should implement good practices for vulnerability management55, such as:   the monitoring of security vulnerabilities reported by internal and external sources that includes used third-  party components,   the risk analysis of vulnerabilities by using a vulnerability scoring system (e.g. CVSS56),   maintenance policies for the treatment of identified vulnerabilities depending on the risk,   processes to inform customers,   patch verification and testing to ensure that operational, safety, legal, and cybersecurity requirements are  met and that the patch is compatible with non-built-in third-party components,   processes for secure patch delivery and documentation concerning patches to customers, or   participating in a vulnerability disclosure program that includes a reporting and disclosure process.  Vulnerabilities should be managed by suppliers in the form of patches. Likewise, a customer should monitor the  market for potential vulnerabilities or receive respective vulnerability notifications from his suppliers. Some good  practices for patch management include57:   maintaining an inventory of assets that includes patch-relevant information,  49 e.g. IEC 62443-4-1.  50 e.g. the ones in ISO/IEC 27001.  51 These may include technical measures, such as (a) separation of environments; (b) auditing trust relationships; (c) establishing multi-factor, risk-  based authentication and conditional access across the organisation; (d) minimizing dependencies on products that are part of the environments used  to develop, build, and edit software; (e) encrypting data; f) monitoring operations and alerts and responding to attempted and actual cyber incidents.  52 e.g. IEC 62443-2-4  53 These may include the use of automated tools, or comparable processes, to maintain trusted source code supply chains, thereby ensuring the  integrity of the code; or the use of automated tools, or comparable processes, that check for known and potential vulnerabilities and remediate them.  54 Standards like IEC 62443-4-2 provide a comprehensive set on security requirements which are categorized for requirements applicable for all  products, applicable for software applications (SAR), applicable for embedded devices (EDR), applicable for host devices (HDR) and applicable for  network devices (NDR).  55 More guidance on vulnerability and patch management can be found in standards IEC 62443-4-1, IEC 62443-2-4 and IEC TR 62443-2-3.  56 See https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document ;.  57 Derived by ISO/IEC 27002.  https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS  July 2021  29   using information resources to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities,   evaluating the risks of identified vulnerabilities and having a documented and implemented maintenance  policy available,   receiving patches only from legitimate sources and testing them before they are installed,   applying alternative measures should a patch not be available or applicable,   applying rollback procedures and effective back-up & restore processes.  Beyond what customers and suppliers can do individually, there are initiatives that can take place at the industry  level. Google introduced, in June 2021, an End-to-End Framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts  throughout the software supply chain called SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts)58. The goal of SLSA is  to improve the state of the industry, particularly open source, to defend against the most pressing threats to integrity.  Even though SLSA focuses on software supply chain attacks and not all the other types, it is a good starting point  that may benefit organizations.  A more general but extensive set of recommendations for defending against cybersecurity threats was launched in  June 2021 by MITRE, known as the MITRE D3FEND project59. MITRE D3FEND is a framework or structured  knowledge base that allows organizations to find specific mitigations to prevent specific attacks as shown in the  MITRE ATT&CK® framework. The project is not specific to supply chain nor to APT attacks but the recommendations  can be used to increase the basic level of security of organizations.  Still, not all supply chain risks can be mitigated by good practices implemented by customers, suppliers or  organisations. In particular, hidden functions and undocumented access capabilities (backdoors) in hardware  components cannot be exhaustively identified by the most common certifications or standard penetration tests.  Additionally zero-day vulnerabilities, i.e. vulnerabilities known only to and used by a specific group, remain a  challenge. Consequently, action may be needed at the national or even European level. National competent  authorities could perform national security risk assessments for supply chain risks, which take into account known  actors in order to derive measures on sourcing from suppliers at a national level. Moreover, supply chain attacks may  be sponsored by state actors with advanced capabilities, and in this case the assistance of relevant authorities may  be needed to mitigate the risks of state-sponsored attacks.  58 Google Online Security Blog: Introducing SLSA, an End-to-End Framework for Supply Chain Integrity, Google,  https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html.

CONCLUSIONS  As the cost of direct attacks against well-protected organizations increases, attackers prefer to attack their supply  chain, which provides the additional motivation of a potentially large-scale and cross-border impact. This migration  has resulted in a larger-than-usual number of supply chain attack cases reported, with a forecast of four times  more supply chain attacks in 2021 than in 2020. The inherent global nature of current supply chains increases the  potential impact of these attacks and broadens the attack surface for malicious actors. This report covers a number of  known attacks but, in reality, there may be more supply chain attacks that go undetected, not investigated or  attributed to other causes.  Particularly in software, supply chain attacks undermine trust in the software ecosystem. The incidents described  highlight the potential for malicious actors to compromise the software supply chain from its very early stages  (development phase). New approaches need to be developed to secure the supply chain by design. In this direction,  new initiatives such as Google SLSA and MITRE D3FEND, appear to be quite promising.  The analysis in this report shows that there is still a large number of unknown factors in the incidents investigated.  66% of the attack vectors used on suppliers still remain unknown. A lack of transparency or the ability to  investigate poses a serious risk to the trust of the supply chain. Improving the process of transparency and  accountability is the first step to improving the security of all elements in the supply chain and protecting final  customers.  Supply chain attacks can be complex, require careful planning and often take months or years to execute. While  more than 50% of these attacks are attributed to APT groups or well-known attackers, the effectiveness of  supply chain attacks may make suppliers an interesting target for other, more generic, types of attackers in the future.  It is therefore critical that organizations focus their security not only in their own organizations, but also on their  suppliers. This is particularly the case for cloud service providers and managed service providers, where recent  attacks highlight the increased need for cybersecurity controls in these sectors.  Due to increased interdependencies and complexities, the impact of attacks on suppliers may have far reaching  consequences. This is not only due to the large number of affected parties but, especially in cases where classified  information is exfiltrated, is a cause for concern for national security or for consequences of a geopolitical nature.  In this complex environment for supply chains, establishing good practices at EU level and coordinated actions  are both important to support all Member States in developing similar capabilities – to reach a common level of  security.

It offers VSA  (Virtual System/Server Administrator) software and provides its own cloud servers. MSPs (Managed Service  Providers) can use the VSA software on premises or they can license the VSA cloud servers of Kaseya. MSPs in turn  offer various IT services to other clients61.  In July 2021, attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Kaseya’s own systems (CVE-2021-3011662). Attackers  could remotely execute commands on the VSA appliances of Kaseya’s customers. Kaseya can send out remote  updates to all VSA servers and, on Friday July 2, 2021, an update was distributed to Kaseya clients’ VSA that  executed code from the attackers. This malicious code in turn deployed ransomware63,64 to the customers being  managed by that VSA.

The company supplies tools to  other companies such as IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In April 2021, Codecov reported that attackers  obtained some of their valid credentials from a Docker image due to an error in how those Docker images were  created.  Once the attackers obtained these credentials, they used them to compromise an ”upload bash script”70 that is used  by Codecov customers. Once the customers downloaded and executed this script, the attackers were able to  exfiltrate data from Codecov’s customers, including sensitive information that would allow the attackers to access the  customers’ resources71. Multiple Codecov customers reported that the attackers were able to access their source  code using stolen information from the Codecov breach71. The attack was not attributed.

Wizvera has a product called VeraPort, an installation integration product that allows users to install security software  required by their employers73. In November 2020, attackers compromised a legitimate website that had VeraPort  support. They replaced the VeraPort configuration in the compromised website to deliver malware instead of the  expected security software.  The configuration was digitally signed by Wizvera73. VeraPort checks whether the software being downloaded has a  valid digital signature, however it does not check who issued the certificate. Through this mechanism, South Korea  users that accessed the compromised website downloaded the malware. The attack was attributed to the Lazarus  APT group73.

SITA’s passenger  service system is used to provide airlines with passenger information at the time of boarding, including the risk  passengers may pose to a country114. In March 2021, it was disclosed that attackers had compromised SITA servers  to gain access to passenger data from the customers of SITA. Some of SITA’s customers also reported data  breaches, such as Air India, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.  Following reports of leaked data on the Internet, Air India also reported that its networks were compromised and data  was stolen. The compromise of Air India internal networks was allegedly related to the SITA incident because a  security company found that the name of one computer inside Air India was “SITASERVER4”.  To date, it remains unknown how the attackers gained access to the SITA servers and it is also not known how the  attackers may have accessed Air India, or whether they actually did so. The internal attach to Air India’s networks  was attributed to the group APT41115.

    "abstract": "This report aims at mapping and studying the supply chain attacks that were discovered from January 2020 to early July 2021. Based on the trends and patterns observed, supply chain attacks increased in number and sophistication in the year 2020 and this trend is continuing in 2021, posing an increasing risk for organizations. It is estimated that there will be four times more supply chain attacks in 2021 than in 2020. With half of the attacks being attributed to Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) actors, their complexity and resources greatly exceed the more common non-targeted attacks, and, therefore, there is an increasing need for new protective methods that incorporate suppliers in order to guarantee that organizations remain secure."

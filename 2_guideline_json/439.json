It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess  these electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their  legal effect.  Following the publication of the eIDAS Regulation, a set of secondary and co-regulatory acts had to be  published in order to provide technical guidance on how to implement the specific requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (in the TSP part of eIDAS, the European Commission decided to publish only the  mandatory ones). ENISA aimed to develop a concise set of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders, including Trust Service  Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies.  The objective of this document is to provide guidelines for fulfilling requirements originating from the  following articles of the eIDAS Regulation:   Art. 24.5 – Requirements for qualified trust service providers;   Art. 28.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic signatures;   Art. 32.3 – Requirements for the validation of qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 33.2 – Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 34.2 – Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 38.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic seals;   Art. 42.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic time stamps;   Art. 44.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services;   Art. 45.2 – Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  05  1. Introduction  1.1 General overview  Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation) and  repealing Directive 1999/93/EC2 is a milestone for providing a predictable regulatory environment enabling  secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and public authorities.  The eIDAS Regulation:   Ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes  (eIDs) to access public services in other Member States where eIDs are available and identification  scheme is notified to the European Commission.   Creates a European internal market for trust services (eTSs) - namely electronic signatures,  electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication.  In a nutshell, this Regulation renders that electronic identification (eID) and electronic Trust Services (eTS)  as key enablers for secure cross-border electronic transactions and central building blocks of the Digital  Single Market.  Since 1 July 2016 the eIDAS Regulation is directly applicable in EU Member States. It provides legal  certainty and encourages the usage of electronic identification means and trust services for online access  and online transactions at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic  identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other Member States where eIDs are available  and identification scheme is notified to the European Commission. It also creates an EU wide internal  market for electronic trust services by ensuring they will be recognised and functional across borders and  have the same legal status as traditional paper based procedures. National eIDs are recognised by foreign  public services if :   These eIDs are delivered in a notified scheme;   The public service accepts another notified eID of level substantial or high.  Qualified trust services have legal effects, but they are not necessarily the same as traditional paper based  procedures (with the exception of the qualified signature which is equivalent to a handwritten signature).  Following the publication of the eIDAS regulation, a set of secondary and co-regulatory acts could be  published in order to provide technical guidance on how to implement the specific requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (in the TSP part of eIDAS, the European Commission decided to publish only the  mandatory ones). ENISA aimed to develop a concise set of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders, including Trust Service  Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies. However it is encouraged to  stakeholders to verify that these guidelines are accepted by their national Supervisory Body.  2 See Annex B [No. 4] http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31999L0093  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  06  Furthermore, to effectively bring about the objectives of the eIDAS Regulation, such as improving  customer protection in internet transactions, work needs to be carried out to communicate on risks and  promote the acceptance and adoption of trust services in Europe. To achieve this, understanding the main  aspects of ENISA guidelines mentioned above can be helpful. Through better understanding the risk  management can be improved.  ENISA is supporting the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation since 2013 by:   providing security recommendations for a correct implementation of trust services,   mapping technical and regulatory requirements,   promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe,   informing relying parties and end users on how to secure their electronic transactions using trust  services, etc.  1.2 Scope of the document  Taking into account the complexity of the subject, wide sgacope of services and number of potentially  applicable standards, it is extremely relevant to provide an extensive and an as far as possible up-to-date  set of standards enabling all stakeholders to understand and perform eIDAS compliant activities. Most of  the standards are currently created by European Standardisation Organisations under standardisation  requests from the European Commission (former mandate m/460). This set of standards builds on a  number of existing internationally recognised standards and guidelines from ISO, ITU-T, CAB Forum and  IETF.  The objective of this document, following the ENISA deliverable from 2015, “Analysis of standards related  to Trust Service Providers - Mapping of requirements of eIDAS to existing standards” is to review and  produce guidelines for fulfilling requirements originating from the following articles of the eIDAS  Regulation:   Art. 24.5 – Requirements for qualified trust service providers;   Art. 28.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic signatures;   Art. 32.3 – Requirements for the validation of qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 33.2 – Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 34.2 – Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 38.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic seals;   Art. 42.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic time stamps;   Art. 44.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services;   Art. 45.2 – Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication  Other articles, where standards could prove to be useful to CABs and SBs in assessing the compliance with  the Regulation are 5.1, 13.2, 15, 19.1, 19.2, 24.1, 24.2 (except e & f), 24.3, 24.4, 26, 28.3, 28.4, 28.5, 36,  38.3, 38.4, 38.5.  This guideline will help all stakeholders to understand the mapping between the articles mentioned above  and reference numbers of standards, as well as practical recommendations for their usage. sIt is important  to note that some of eIDAS' requirements are not covered by standards yet, e. g. standards for electronic  registered delivery are only being developed in ETSI STF 523.  Many of the standards contain references to other standards, often several levels deep. Sometimes the  clauses with delegation include some additional requirements. Thus, a detailed set of requirements  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  07  corresponding to a particular article from eIDAS Regulation is a collection of requirements from the last  referenced document up to the first one.  The process approach is a method of dynamic security and compliance management. Its origins can be  traced to the classical school of management: the organization of production processes and ergonomic  research. The process approach was described in the ISO 9001:20003 standard. In previous standards, this  approach did not exist, the systems were implemented according to the standard points. The second  amendment of ISO 9000 standard issued in the year 2000 changed the structure of the standard, and  described the process approach principle thereby facilitating implementation. Currently, a process  approach is the main, fundamental principle in all management standards and best practices.  In the process management approach, each activity can be described as a set of interconnected processes.  Each process has goals and an owner, who is accountable for achieving process goals by controlling  process performance. Processes transform input into output utilizing resources. Processes have suppliers  (input) and clients (output). Input, output, resource utilization and overall process performance can be  measured and defined as goals for the accounting process owner, and also for process improvement.  Processes flow horizontally through an organization in contrast to vertical organization structure.  Generally, there are three main types of processes: management, core and support, but in this document  we will use other taxonomy based on rareness of processes. Some processes exist in each organization,  they are called herein after general processes, for example HR, finance. Other processes are common for  some common activities independently from TSP, for example Information Security Management System  (ISMS described in ISO/IEC 270014 standard) or IT service management system (described in ISO/IEC  200005 standard). These processes may exist or should be implemented in an organization by process  owners not only for TSP purposes. These processes should be shared throughout an organization. There is  no other reason to deploy this processes independently for TSP. This approach simplifies process  deployment to become TSP. Processes called herein after specific are core TSP processes, required  especially for TSP. These processes should be deployed according to an organizational culture similarly to  other activities, but requirements for them can be found only in formal standards regarding TSP activity.  To better understand their relations, the authors of these guidelines took into consideration stakeholders  of the processes, their requirements, obligations and benefits.  The structure of the document is organised to provide information and guidelines with regards to: the  equirements of each article mentioned above   content   guideline   list of standards and other documents (guidelines, recommendations), referred to as ‘standards’   TSP’s process   external stakeholders  3 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=21823  4See Annex B [No. 61]  5 See Annex B [No. 60]  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=21823  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  08  It is important to note that the scope of this document is restricted to qualified trust service providers and  qualified trust services, with the exception of article 32 which applies to both qualified and non-qualified  validation services.  The verbs “shall”, “should” and “may” in this document should be used in accondance with ETSI guide6.  6 https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  09  2. Requirements for qualified trust service providers  A Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) provides one or more qualified trust services.  The TSP needs to  submit a notification of its intention to provide qualified trust services together with a conformity  assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body to the supervisory body. The supervisory body  will analyse whether the TSP meets the applicable eIDAS requirements based on the notification and the  conformity assessment report. In case of a positive outcome of this analysis, the qualified status is granted  by the supervisory body to the TSP.  Qualified trust service providers are audited at least every 24 months by a conformity assessment body.  The audit confirms fulfilment of the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation. The general  requirements for qualified trust service providers are laid down in Article 24 of eIDAS Regulation.  The Commission may establish reference numbers of standards for trustworthy systems and products,  which comply with the requirements under points (e) and (f) of Article 24 (2). This chapter covers  guidelines for TSP’s based on standards complying with Article 24 requirements.  2.1  Article 24.1.  CONTENT  Article 24.1. When issuing a qualified certificate for a trust service, a qualified trust service provider shall  verify, by appropriate means and in accordance with national law, the identity and, if applicable, any  specific attributes of the natural or legal person to whom the qualified certificate is issued.  The information referred to in the first subparagraph shall be verified by the qualified trust service provider  either directly or by relying on a third party in accordance with national law:  a) by the physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized representative of the legal  person; or  b) remotely, using electronic identification means, for which prior to the issuance of the qualified  certificate, a physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized representative of the legal  person was ensured and which meets the requirements set out in Article 8 with regard to the  assurance levels ‘substantial’ or ‘high’; or  c) by means of a certificate of a qualified electronic signature or of a qualified electronic seal issued in  compliance with point (a) or (b); or  d) by using other identification methods recognized at national level which provide equivalent  assurance in terms of reliability to physical presence. The equivalent assurance shall be confirmed  by a conformity assessment body  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  10  GUIDELINE  It is recommended to follow chapters EN 319 411-17(6.2.2, 6.2.3) and corresponding chapters EN 319 411- 28 (6.2.2, 6.2.3) in particular, which present the identity verification process. It must be stressed that this  process is a critical part of the registration procedure for issuing a qualified certificate.  Generally, the identity verification process in the certificate issuance process have a lot in common with  identity proofing process during (notified) issuance of electronic identification means9. Therefore, it is  advised to familiarize oneself and re-use as a good practice (whenever applicable) technical standards set  out by the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 for the high and substantial assurance  levels of electronic identification means.  The above mentioned EN standards distinguish two types of identity verification:   initial identification described in EN 319 411-1(6.2.2) and EN 319 411-2 (6.2.2), where the issuance  of a certificate is meant for a person not registered (never before) by the QTSP,   in the re-keying process described in EN 319 411-1 (6.2.3) and EN 319 411-2 (6.2.3), which means  in the process of issuance of a new certificate for the person who has already been registered by  the QTSP (possess a qualified certificate from this QTSP).  In case of a re-key request, the identity verification procedure can be simplified, where existing evidence  can be re-used to validate the identity, provided the evidence remains valid given the time elapsed (and it  is allowed by the national legislation). In any case, such a procedure must meet all the requirements of  initial verification (as in chapter 6.2.2).  Further from above mentioned standards, identity verification must be carried out in accordance with the  national law of a Member State in which the QTSP has been granted the qualified status. TSPs operating in  a cross border situation (for example when enrolment takes place in a different country that the one  where QTSP is established) will require further guidance from supervisory bodies.  Generally, identity verification means collecting evidence or an attestation from an appropriate and  authorised source and checking its validity and authenticity. The most common way is to use a nationally  recognized identity document; other means are also allowed, for instance national registry information,  bank or utility account information, credit bureau information, breeder documents (unless local legislation  states otherwise).  In short the eIDAS Regulation provides four methods of identity verification:  a) face to face,  b) based on electronic identification means,  c) based on a qualified electronic signature or on a qualified electronic seal,  7See Annex B [No. 28]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941101/01.01.01_60/en_31941101v010101p.pdf  8See Annex B [No. 29]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941102/02.01.01_60/en_31941102v020101p.pdf  9 While there are similarities, there are also some differences. As an example, for issuance of electronic identification  means, physical face-to-face (or equivalence with it) is not a requirement. While the use of qualified certificate or seal  is permitted for the issuance of a qualified certificate (24.1.c), it is not for the issuance of electronic identification  means.  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  11  d) other methods recognised at national level of the Member State providing equivalent assurance in  terms of reliability to physical presence.  In a face to face identification process, where physical identity documents are used, the registration  authority personnel must have qualifications with regard to (physical) verification of ID documents and  their security features. This should be considered part of the general requirements for personnel of a QTSP  as per Article 24.2b and ETSI EN 319 40110 (see chapter 7.2 Human resources).  In a remote issuance process, electronic identification means (as defined by eIDAS) can be used for identity  verification (art. 24.1b).  When issuing a qualified certificate remotely, the identity verification process must provide equivalent  assurance in terms of reliability to physical presence. Therefore, to be compliant (with art. 24.1b) it is  (explicitly) mandatory to use electronic identification means for which physical presence was confirmed  at any stage of certificate handling (for exampleat the moment of generating the certificate, or when  credentials are handed to the person).  When other methods are used (d), it is necessary to verify that the given method provides assurance  equivalent to methods requiring physical presence. This will mean additional documentation needs to be  prepared by a QTSP, and the method is to be confirmed by a conformity assessment body and recognised  at national level.  Best practice has to yet to be established for how to meet the requirements of article 24.1 b) for physical  presence.  ETSI EN 319 411 standard refers to CA/Browser forum documents (applicable in the context of websites)  for details of verification procedure:   EVCG CA/Browser Forum: \"Guidelines for The Issuance and Management of Extended Validation  Certificates\"11 – see chapter 11,   BRG CA/Browser Forum: \"Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly- Trusted Certificates\"12 – see chapter 11  If in a given case discrepancies occur between mentioned standards and acts, the priority is as follows:   eIDAS Regulation,   implementing and delegated acts related to eIDAS Regulation,   national legislation,   standards published by standardization bodies (e.g. CEN/CENELEC/ETSI/ISO)   guidelines and documents by other bodies (e.g. CA/B forum, IETF)   other standards.

Following subchapters 24.2.a - 24.2.k refer to each requirement and propose standardisation for  compliance with it.  2.2.1 Article 24.2.a  CONTENT  [A qualified trust service provider providing qualified trust services shall:]  a) inform the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its qualified trust services and an  intention to cease those activities  GUIDELINE  This is a new provision compared to Directive 1999/93/EC14. There are no detailed rules of such  communication in standards, this is a gap in eIDAS related standardization and good practices should  apply. General provisions somehow applicable to this article are:   EN 319 40115 – chapter 6.1 item g) and h), 7.11 and 7.12,   EN 319 411-116 and EN 319 411-217 (for certification services),   EN 319 42118 (for time stamp services),   ISO/IEC 2700219 – chapter 12.1.2.  The gap can be met in a following way:   For changes in trust services: by simple extension to requirement EN 319 401 clause 6.1,   For intent to terminate: by EN 319 401 7.12 b i) which is required to be applied “before the TSP  terminates”.  Implementation of article 24.2.a is strictly related to the Change Management process. One of the main  goals of such a process is to introduce changes in a systematic, secure and effective manner based on risk.  Informing a supervisory body about changes in provision of qualified trust services, especially about  termination, is a countermeasure for subscribers and trusting entities against unnoticed, illegitimate use of  trusted mechanisms.  The reporting mechanism should provide event driven triggers and communication channels to report  changes to a supervisory body according to Member State regulations. It is a good practice to create a  communication plan associated with the change management process which covers communication with a  supervisory body.  EN 319 411 part 1 and 2 do not impose any specific requirements / rules related to communication (see  chapter 6.8.11). However, it is recommended that such rules should be defined and information about  14See Annex B [No. 4]  15See Annex B [No. 27]  16See Annex B [No. 28]  17See Annex B [No. 29]  18See Annex B [No. 35]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/319421/01.01.01_60/en_319421v010101p.pdf  19See Annex B [No. 62]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  14  them be included in the Trust Service Practice Statement or Certification Practice Statement. This is  derived from EN 319 401, chapter 6.1 (items g and h) requirements. It (item g) states, that “a TSP shall  notify of changes it intends to make in its practice statement and shall […] make the revised TSP practice  statement available immediately […]”. As “any change in the provision of its qualified trust services” (as  per provision of this eIDAS article) is in many cases reflected through practice statement change, it is  suggested to perform communication with a supervisory body at the same time as subscribers and relying  parties, and therefore “immediately”. In other cases (changes not reflected in a practice statement), it is  suggested to keep the same communication rules, with the exception that intention to terminate activities  by its nature should be communicated to a supervisory body earlier (than in the actual termination  process).  General requirements regarding a practice statement are also specified in EN 319 411-1 and EN 319 411-2  chapter 5.2 (for certification services) and in EN 319 421 chapter 6.2 (for time stamp services).  Best practices regarding the Change Management process can be found in chapter 12.1.2 of ISO/IEC 27002  standard.

QTSP should develop  and maintain an appropriate human resources process and procedures, education programs and keep  records of such activities.  This process should ensure:   reliability and competence of candidates for employment,   continuous personal education for staff and management,   trainings sessions,   security procedures trainings,   sufficient human resources of the TSP to fulfil requirements of segregation of duty, business  requirements and implement countermeasures resulting from risk analysis,   appropriate discipline,   proper record keeping of these activities.  General requirements (applicable to any trust service providers) are set by EN 319 401, chapter 7.2. For  detailed provisions this standard refers to ISO/IEC 27002.

This matter is only referred to in ETSI standards, with no more guidance than in the Regulation:   EN 319 40128 - chapter 7.1.1 item c),   EN 319 411-129 and EN 319 411-230 chapter 6.8.2 (fully refers to EN 319 401),  The gap can be addressed by extension to the requirement of EN 319 401 7.1.1 item c), to recommend that  the assessment of “financial resources and/or obtain appropriate liability insurance” required should be  based on a risk assessment (see clause 5), which takes into account commercial and financial issues.  This area should be treated based on the local (national) rules and legislation (if any) and good practices, as  part of risk management. Risk based approach is now the main one in all management systems standards.  As a common base, regardless of subject matter, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  established in 2011 a standard for risk management (ISO 2700531) that contains principles and guidelines,  and is recommended to use for risk analysis (taking into account financial and commercial aspects) by EN  319 401. At this moment there are no European standards for risk management, and it can be considered  as another standardisation gap in the eIDAS context.  The most common approach towards treatment of risk of liabilities for damage is risk sharing, and the  most common countermeasure is insurance against the risks. A QTSP should check legislation related to  the protection of consumers (subscribers) and trusting entities interests, in the Member State in which it  operates or would like to start the activity. This will allow identification of regulatory expectations as well  as enable meeting of its liability to external parties.  This is part of Compliance Management. If a regulator expects a TSP to declare an amount of liabilities, it is  the most cost effective to establish a Risk Management Process. Analysis of threats and potential losses  per service allow a TSP to calculate an amount of money to allocate to assure compensation for potential  damages or define insurance requirements and conditions.  Best practices regarding risk management process can be reached in ISO 31000 standard.

Use of trust services by subscribers and trusting entities requires notice or knowledge of the terms and  conditions of these services. One of QTSP’s obligations is to inform about terms and conditions for each  trust service. Information presented in the documentation should be up to date, understandable, easily  accessible and conspicuously communicated by stakeholders.  To fulfil this requirement a QTSP may create a Service Policy document that contains all necessary  information (as listed in chapter 6.2 of EN 319 401) and include it as an attachment to the subscriber  agreement, as well as make it available in an electronic form (eg. PDF file) on the QTSP’s web page. The  good practice is “involving” an acceptance method, such as a mandatory acceptance box or necessity of  scrolling down and an acceptance button at the end.  In case of use of electronic communication channels, a QTSP should assure availability and integrity of the  document with its terms and conditions. In the case of qualified certificates, it should be signed with an  Advanced Electronic Signature or an Advanced Electronic Seal as specified by eIDAS Regulation.  The content of such a document should include items as specified in above mentioned standards.  EN 319 401 in chapter 6.2 defines general requirements for content of the terms and conditions  information regarding its services, that shall be available to all subscribers and relying parties. These terms  and conditions shall specify for each trust service information such as: service policy being applied,  limitations on the use of the service (e.g. lifetime of public key certificates), information for relying parties  on how to verify the trust service token, subscribers’ obligations, limitations of liability, TSP contact  information and other. Terms and conditions shall be made available through durable means of  33See Annex B [No. 27]  34See Annex B [No. 28]  35See Annex B [No. 29]  36See Annex B [No. 7]  37See Annex B [No. 56]  38See Annex B [No. 35]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  20  communication, in particular it can be transmitted electronically. These are requirements that are  independent of the type of TSP. Other standards (described below) refine and extend these requirements  as applicable to particular forms of TSP.  For certification services, there are additional conditions defined in EN 319 411-1 and -2.  For Publicly-Trusted Certificates clause 9.6.3 and 9.8 (with the exception indicated in EVCG clause 18) of  BRG should apply additionally.  For Extended Validity Certificates, EVCG clause 11.8 should apply additionally.  The terms and conditions may use the model “PKI disclosure statement” given in annex A of EN 319 411-1.  PDF/A file format is highly recommended.  The document, containing terms and conditions of a qualified trust service, should be maintained as a part  of the Documentation Management process. The process should be effective and under control.

These terms can be defined  differently depending on the type of the service.  Depending on the purpose, a “trustworthy” system or product can be made of a certified hardware  component (hardware security module) or non-certified hardware (e.g. servers) or certified or non- certified software components or combination of all the aforementioned.  In addition, general means can/should be applied to achieve “trustworthiness” of a system or product:   EN and ETSI standards,   international standards (e.g. ISO), national and industry standards,   best practises,   security evaluation and certification by an independent body,   declaration of conformity,   technical, procedural and organisational means,   hardware and software.  It is assumed that for any “trustworthy” system all basic requirements are met, in particular:   EN 319 40140 - chapter 7.4 items a) and f), 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 (for all trust service providers),   EN 319 411-141 – chapter 6.5 (additional for trust service providers issuing certificates),   EN 319 411-242 chapter 6.5 (additional for trust service providers issuing qualified certificates),   EN 319 42143 – chapter 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10 (for trust service providers issuing time stamps),   ISO/IEC 2700244 – chapter 9, 10, 12, 14, 15.  With regard to certificate management, detailed requirements for “trustworthy system” are provided in  CEN/TS 419 261.  With regard to remote (server) signature, detailed requirements for “trustworthy system” are provided in  EN 419 241-1 (under drafting).  For certification and time stamp services, with regard to (secret) key generation and storage, a trustworthy  system is a Hardware Security Module (HSM) – see EN 319 411-1 (clause 6.5.2) and  EN 319 421 (clause  7.6.2 and 7.6.3) accordingly.  40 See Annex B [No. 27]  41 See Annex B [No. 28]  42 See Annex B [No. 29]  43 See Annex B [No. 35]  44 See Annex B [No. 62]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  22  Generally, article 24.2 e covers a wide range of security management process issues. Requirements  included in European standards are additional countermeasures to well known, internationally accepted  best practices, i.e. ISO/IEC 27002.  These requirements do not relate only to trustworthy systems and products that appear in dedicated  QTSPs processes, polices, etc. (i.e. key management, certification policy, etc.), but they are also related to  supporting processes.  Therefore, it is recommended that QTSP takes into account the above mentioned requirements and  according to them develops security means and controls in the following supporting processes:   Supplier service delivery management,   System acquisition, development and maintenance management,   Communications security management,   Operations security management,   Access control management.  Additional information about supporting processes and security issues can be found in ISO/IEC 27002:2013  and ISO/IEC 20000-1:201145  With regard to technical security, hardware security modules (HSMs) are recommended, and security  certification is a common and recommended way of ensuring conformity with security requirements and  achieving \"trustworthiness\" in the context of eIDAS Regulation.  This is to be stressed, that generally a “trustworthy system” may not be limited to a HSM only.  EN 319 411-1 (clause 6.5.2) and  EN 319 421 (clause 7.6.2 and 7.6.3) mandate that for certification and  time stamp services subscribers’ and authorities’ cryptographic (private) keys are generated and stored in  a certified HSM (“trustworthy system”). The HSMs should be certified at assurance level EAL4 or higher in  accordance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria), ISO/IEC 19790 or FIPS 140-2 L3 (all listed by EN 319  411-1), or equivalent national or internationally recognized evaluation criteria for IT security. With the  general availability of devices which meet ISO 15408, it is expected that ISO 19790 and FIPS PUB 140-2 will  no longer be acceptable.  ENISA recommends to use Common Criteria evaluated devices, based on protection profiles delivered by  ETSI and CEN (described below), to create a presumption of compliance and ease conformity assessment.  ENISA recommends to use certified HSMs for the generation and storage of cryptographic keys and  sensitive material for any kind of trust service.  ETSI and CEN WG17 provide guidelines and Protection Profiles for certification in the series of standards  EN 419 2x1.  For certification of HSM dedicated for QTSP root certification authority operations (signing, key  generation) CEN EN 419 221-246, -347 and -448 can be applied in accordance to their purposes, or CEN EN  45 See Annex B [No. 60]  46 See Annex B [No. 14]  47 See Annex B [No. 15]  48 See Annex B [No. 16]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  23  419 221-549 (a new, generic PP for trust services), once it is finalised by CEN (at the time of this report,  works are still ongoing).  For certification of a trustworthy system / HSM for time stamp services, CEN EN 419 23150 can be applied  or CEN EN 419 221-5 (a new, generic PP for trust services), once it is finalised by CEN (for the time of this  report, works are still ongoing). Alternatively, ANSSI DCSSI-PP 2008/0751 can be used, which is currently the  only Common Criteria evaluated protection profile for a timestamping system.  It is recommended to comply with this kind of service and aim to meet requirements of art. 30 and 39 of  the eIDAS. It is expected that this will be referenced in eIDAS through the Commission Implementing  Decision \"laying down standards for the security assessment of qualified signature and seal creation  devices pursuant to Articles 30(3) and 39(2)[…]\"52and becomes obligatory in the near future.  However, at the time of writing this report, this standard has not yet been issued (works are still ongoing in  CEN)53. Until the moment CEN TS 419 241-254is available and referenced in an implementing act,  alternative standards / Protection Profiles can be used (for performing evaluation and certification of a  trustworthy system for server signature) provided they ensure a comparable security level. An example of  such a standard is Protection Profile DCSSI-PP 2008/07 issued (and certified) by ANSSI. When the  alternative standards are applied by a TSP, however, a Conformity Assessment Body and an auditor may  require additional proof of adequacy of such standards to the given purpose and/or additional security  measures might be necessary for the TSP. This may mean for example documentation describing relevance  of such standards and/or mapping of actual trustworthy system components, expert opinion, etc. Any  alternative certification scheme can only be valid if it has first been notified to the European Commission  as required by Article 30(3)(b) of the eIDAS Regulation. Some alternative methods have been already  notified55.

This article expands article 24.2.e by additional aspects concerning personal data handling. Therefore it is  recommended that all general requirements as per chapter 2.2.5 of this document are met whenever  applicable, in particular:   EN 319 40158 – chapters 7.4 – 7.9,   EN 319 411-159 – chapter 6.4.3; 6.4.6; 6.5.5; 6.5.7,   EN 319 411-260 – chapter 6.4.3; 6.4.6; 6.5.5; 6.5.7,   ISO/IEC 2700261 – chapter 9.  It should be noted that personal data is part of sensitive information a QTSP acquires during standard  operations. Personal data protection is mentioned in article 24.2.j.  Such data should be preserved for a specified period of time. This period should be determined on a GRC  (Governance, Risk, Compliance) basis. It is recommended to implement data preservation for sensitive  information according to ETSI TS 101 533-1.  ETSI TS 101 533 standard is based on TS 102 573, ISO/IEC 2700162 and ISO/IEC 27002 standards.  TS102 573 provides requirements for trust service providers in respect to the storage of data for digital  accounting. The purpose of this document is to provide a common, objective and reliable basis for  preservation service providers to implement and manage secure Data Preservation Systems, meeting the  information security related quality addressed by the EU Directive 2006/123/EC on personal data  protection (replaced in 2016 by the EU General Regulation on Data Protection, 2016/679G). This covers  organisational and legal aspects, as well as technical ones, like those related to use and maintenance of an  electronic signature (for data preservation), storage access authorisation, authenticity and integrity.  58 See Annex B [No. 27]  59 See Annex B [No. 28]  60 See Annex B [No. 29]  61 See Annex B [No. 62]  62 See Annex B [No. 61]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  26  ISO/IEC 27002 provides clauses in relation to disposal handling and labelling of (storage) media, logging (of  security events), user access management and network access control.  There is a difference between “storage of data” and “preservation”:   (data) preservation service: service to which data objects are submitted to achieve specified  preservation goals over the long-term  which at least include proof of integrity and proof of  existence and which can maintain the validity status of digital signatures.   long-term: over technological changes such as crypto algorithms, key sizes or hash functions or of  storage technology  LIST OF STANDARDS   All standards mentioned within Article 24.2.e in scope of trustworthy systems.   ETSI TS 101 533-1: \"Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Data Preservation Systems  Security; Part 1: Requirements for Implementation and Management\"; (TSP-QC)   ETSI TS 101 533-2: Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Data Preservation Systems  Security; Part 2: Guidelines for Assessors63   ISO/IEC 27001 \"Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security  management systems - Requirements\"   ISO 27002 \"Information technology -- Security techniques -- Code of practice for information  security controls\"   ETSI TS 102 573: \"Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Policy requirements for trust  service providers signing and/or storing data for digital accounting\".

Therefore, it is recommended to follow standards and  guidelines related to these articles.  In addition, it is necessary to highlight the importance of the ISO/IEC 2700265 in this area, with respect to  information security management.  Protection against forgery and theft of data has organizational and technical aspects. Requirements within  the scope of a trustworthy system (part of technical aspect) are the same as in article 24.2.e and f. In the  field of data preservation, requirements are the same as in the article 24.2.f.  Implementation of other remaining requirements should be preceded by risk analysis. QTSP should  identify assets, vulnerabilities and countermeasures to minimalize the risk of forgery and theft. It is  recommended that this analysis is part of the whole risk management process of a QTSP organisation.  It is recommended that QTSP use recommendations from standard ISO/IEC 2700566 which is dedicated to  information security.  The catalogue of countermeasures is available as standard ISO/IEC 27002 expanded by countermeasures  derived from ETSI/CEN standards related to 24.2 clauses e) and f), in particular: ETSI EN 319 40167 clauses  7.6 and 7.7, ETSI EN 319 41168 and ETSI TS 101 53369.

Such recording may be done  electronically;  GUIDELINE  Article 24.2.h should be read together with the Article 17 4.i:  [Supervisory body]  4. For the purposes of paragraph 3 and subject to the limitations provided therein, the tasks of the  supervisory body shall include in particular:  (i) to verify the existence and correct application of provisions on termination plans in cases where the  qualified trust service provider ceases its activities, including how information is kept accessible in  accordance with point (h) of Article 24(2);  It is recommended to follow EN 319 40173 chapter 7.10 generally for any kind of (qualified) trust service.  These requirements can be met, for example, through the use of write-only media, a record of each  removable media used and the use of off-site backup.  For a TSP issuing certificates for signature and seal, clauses 6.4.5 and 6.4.6 from EN 319 411-174 and -275  are additionally applicable. There are some more requirements for qualified certificates (than for non- qualified) in this respect (see EN 319 411- chapter 6.4.5).  Some additional provisions are also given by:   EN 319 401 – clauses 7.7 e), 7.8 h) , 7.12,   EN 319 411-1 – clauses 6.2.2.l), 6.3.4.d), e), f) and h), 6.3.8 a), 6.4.5.c), 6.4.9   EN 319 411-2 clause 6.4.9 (fully refers to EN 319 411-1),  With regard to Publicly-Trusted Certificates, it is recommended to follow BRG CA/Browser Forum76 base  requirement document, chapters 5.4 and 5.5.  73 See Annex B [No. 27]  74 See Annex B [No. 28]  75 See Annex B [No. 29]  76 See Annex B [No. 7]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  30  With regard to Extended Validation Certificates, it is recommended to follow EVCG CA/Browser Forum77  chapter 15 and 17.  It is suggested to follow ETSI TS 101 533-178 for preserving records. They should be preserved for a  specified period of time, which should be determined on a GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) basis.  Keeping and preservation of the records should also be part of a TSP termination procedure. Records  should be transferred to a reliable party and this must be addressed in a TSP termination plan as per EN  419 401 chapter 7.12 item b) iii. For TSP issuing certificates, clause 6.4.9 of EN 319 411-1 should be applied  additionally. See also provisions for article 24.2. h.  Recommendations contained herein are to protect the QTSP against various claims. Keeping records in  conjunction with an internal audit programme is a countermeasure for various threats, i.e. forgery, theft,  fraud. It may also help the trusting parties to prevent the discrepancy of trusted relation.  QTSP should record and keep accessible activity-related data - issued and received - even after cessation of  a service. Partially the content of the records is mentioned in clauses 6.2.2 l, 6.3.4.e and f, 6.3.8.a, 6.4.5.c  of ETSI EN 319 411-1.  Below are examples of records:   records from the identification process,   audit logs,   records of evaluation of protections of CA, RA and Repository,   certificates and subscribers data base,   issued CRLs,   paper and electronic correspondence between QTSP and subscribers and relying parties during the  operation of certificates life cycle.  For QTSPs delivering qualified timestamping services, additional provisions are given by ETSI EN 319 421.  For other QTSPs, additional requirements depending on the type of qualified service have to be defined.

A termination plan is a document that should contain at least information on affected entities, reliable  party (parties) to which TSP obligations will be transferred, as well as a detailed procedure of notification  and transfer including a timing aspect with all affected parties taken into consideration.  Such document should be maintained as part of TSP documentation management and change  management processes, to keep them up-to-date.  According to this requirement, the document should be verified by a supervisory body.  For QTSPs delivering qualified timestamping services, additional provisions are given by ETSI EN 319 421.  For other QTSPs, additional requirements depending on the type of qualified service have to be defined.

Member States law based on  directive 95/46/EC is effective until May 2018. After this date QTSP should implement requirements of  regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on \"the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC\"  (General Data Protection Regulation).  The requirement of this article is related to compliance management. It is recommended that a TSP follows  EN 319 40183 chapter 7.13 provisions generally. For TSPs issuing certificates, standard EN 319 411 does not  bring additional provisions (see chapter 6.8.4 of EN 319 411-184 and -285). However the mentioned  standards do not contain detailed information on how to meet such requirement. Such (new)  requirements resulting from the introduction of \"privacy (data protection) by default\" and \"privacy (data  protection) by design\" rules will affect technical solutions. Especially systems related to trust services  provided remotely (where user authentication or personal data processing occur, for instance server  signature) will need to comply with these requirements.  The domain of data protection and privacy partially overlaps:   security,   confidentiality,   anonymity,   concepts of appropriate use,   protection of information.  So generally provisions related to security presented in earlier chapters are also applicable here (refer to  guidelines for Art. 24.2. b),e),f), g) and h)).  Based on the new General Data Protection Regulation, fundamental principles of privacy are:   Purpose limitation   Data minimisation   Data security – appropriate technical protection against unauthorised access, alteration,  destruction or disclosure   Control of the individual over his personal data:  o Right of access,  o Right to rectification,  o Right to request the deletion of personal data,  o Right to be informed about the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the  processing, etc.”  83 See Annex B [No. 27]  84 See Annex B [No. 28]  85 See Annex B [No. 29]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  35   Lawfulness of data processing  The general technical rules for products and systems are “privacy by design” and “privacy by default”.  Privacy by design means ensuring that privacy mechanisms are built in the products. Privacy by default  means that by default only necessary personal data is processed. It is therefore recommended that a  QTSP’s technical solutions (products and systems) for any services provided on-line to trust service  subscribers, provide the following key features (whenever applicable):   identification and authentication of parties,   explicit user consent,   selective disclosure and data minimisation,   secure storage and transfer,   user control,   anonymity and pseudonymity.  In respect to trust services delivered on-line (for example server signature), user authentication concerns  processing of only adequate identification data, relevant but not excessive to grant access to that service  online.  There are various technologies available, which would help process personal data according to data  protection rules. A set of privacy and data protection related standards/reports is under development by  European Standard Organisations86 as a part of mandate M/53087. These documents are meant to address  privacy management in the design and development and in the production and service provision processes  of security technologies, as well as provide practical guidelines for implementation. However, this is  beyond the scope of this guideline. It is simply suggested that the reader familiarises himself with these  standards (once published in the future) and assess the impact to the TSP activities and their related ICT  systems.  In addition, it is worth mentioning, that a new version of EN 419 212 standard (related to smart cards /  secure element based technology for signature and strong authentication) has been adopted, where its  Part 4 provides a set of privacy-oriented protocols that could be used to build (privacy protecting) user  authentication solutions.

QTSP should maintain a certificate database. This database should be protected to ensure availability and  integrity. It should be maintained on an operational basis, as part of the service delivery management.  General requirements for systems and security from EN 319 40191 and EN 319 411 are applicable. QTSP  may decide to provide access to external stakeholders, and in that case should provide secure electronic  communication channels to the database for external stakeholders.

If a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified certificates decides to revoke a certificate, it shall  register such revocation in its certificate database and publish the revocation status of the certificate in a  timely manner, and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt of the request. The revocation shall  become effective immediately upon its publication.]  4. With regard to paragraph 3, qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates shall provide to  any relying party information on the validity or revocation status of qualified certificates issued by them.  This information shall be made available at least on a per certificate basis at any time and beyond the  validity period of the certificate in an automated manner that is reliable, free of charge and efficient.  GUIDELINE  These articles are related to operating and maintaining a certificate database and in particular to  revocation management and revocation status services described (in particular) in:   ETSI EN 319 411-194 chapters 6.3.9 and 6.3.10,   ETSI EN 319 411-295 chapters 6.3.9 and 6.3.10.  For Organizational Validation Certificates and Domain Validation Certificates clause 4.10.2 of BRG  CA/Browser Forum applies additionally.  For Extender Validation Certificates clause 13 EVCG CA/Browser Forum96 applies additionally.  For Publicly-Trusted Certificates, Clause 4.9 of the BRG CA/Browser Forum97 applies additionally.  It is believed that EN 319 411-2 does not yet include sufficient provisions with regard to the CRL and OCSP  profile and creation process in order to meet the requirements of these articles. ETSI is working on further  requirements to be included in a revised version of EN 319 411-2 for the use of CRL and OCSP beyond the  certificate validity period.  Generally, validity and revocation status information should be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per  week.  In case of failure, TSP should endeavour to ensure that this information service is not unavailable  for longer than a maximum period of time as denoted in the Certification Practise Statement.  Two methods of providing validity and revocation status are the most popular: through a Certificate  Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Use of OCSP is recommended.  In case both methods are supported by a TSP, the information provided by all services should be consistent  over time, different delays in updating the status information for all these methods should be taken into  account. An exception to this is when an OCSP responder can answer with status ‘unknown’ if the  certificate has not been issued legitimately by the QTSP.  94 See Annex B [No. 28]  95 See Annex B [No. 29]  96 See Annex B [No. 56]  97 See Annex B [No. 7]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  39  Availability of certificate revocation information is crucial. QTSP should assure practically continuous  access to this information. Therefore, QTSP should identify assets, vulnerabilities and countermeasures to  minimalize risk of loss of availability. It is recommended these aspects are included in a global risk  management process, and ISO/IEC 2700598 is suggested here.  For more information about availability of service assurance refer to ISO/IEC 20000-1:201199 clause 6.

Qualified certificates for electronic signatures and for electronic seals  This chapter concerns specific requirements in relation to qualified certificates for electronic signatures  and qualified electronic seals.  ‘Electronic signature’ means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other  data in electronic form (e.g. a document), and which is used by the signatory to sign, whereas ‘electronic  seal’ is to ensure the origin and integrity of \"other\" electronic data (e.g. a document).  Qualified electronic signature (QES) is a particular kind of electronic signature. QES is an advanced  electronic signature that meets requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art. 26. QES is created using a qualified  electronic signature creation device (QSCD) and is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signature  (QC). Requirements for QC are laid down in eIDAS Regulation Annex I and for QSCD in Annex II.  Qualified electronic seal (QESeal) is an advanced electronic seal that meets requirements laid down in  eIDAS Regulation Art. 36 and created using a qualified electronic seal creation device. QESeal is based on a  qualified certificate for electronic seals. Requirements for a qualified certificate for electronic seals are laid  down in eIDAS Regulation Annex III. Requirements for a qualified electronic seal creation device are the  same as for QSCD.  3.1  Articles 28.1, 2, 3 and 38.1, 2, 3  CONTENT  28.1. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex I.  28.2. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall not be subject to any mandatory requirement  exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex I.  28.3. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures may include non-mandatory additional specific  attributes. Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition of qualified electronic  signatures.  38.1. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex III.  38.2. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall not be subject to any mandatory requirements  exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex III.  38.3. Qualified certificates for electronic seals may include non-mandatory additional specific attributes.  Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition of qualified electronic seals.  GUIDELINE  Requirements set out by these articles apply to TSPs issuing qualified certificates for signatures (which are  used by a signatory to sign, for instance a contract) and seals (which confirm origin and integrity of other  data, for instance a document). These requirements concern the content of the certificates.  Annex I and III of the eIDAS Regulation contain detailed requirements for certificate content. A QTSP  issuing qualified certificates should prepare a certificate profile for this purpose. The Regulation mandates  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  41  only information listed in Annex I and Annex III to be present, but other information can be added by a  QTSP.  It is recommended to follow:   ETSI EN 319 412-1101 (general provisions),   ETSI EN 319 412-2102 (certificates for natural persons),   ETSI EN 319 412-3103 (certificates for legal persons),   ETSI EN 319 412-5 (indication that a certificate is qualified)104   ETSI EN 319 411-1105 chapter 6.6.1,   ETSI EN 319 411-2106 chapter 6.6.1 (fully refers to ETSI EN 319 411-1),  All the certificate profiles specified in ETSI EN 319 412 series are based upon IETF RFC 5280107 for generic  profiling of Recommendation ITU-T X.509 | ISO/IEC 9594-8. The certificate profiles specify profiles for both  EU Qualified and non-qualified certificates as relevant. Reference is made to ETSI EN 319 412-5108 for  requirements relating to “QCStatement”. QTSP using ITU-T X.509 should ensure that corrigendum 1109 and  2110are applied to base standard.  Implementing additional attributes should be developed according to the same rules. During development  of additional fields in certificate structure TSP may use ETSI EN 319 412 -1 standard. Introduction of  additional (non-mandatory) attributes should not affect mandatory interoperability.

TSP should conduct risk analysis to recognize all potential activities which can lead to reinstating a revoked  certificate, for example restoring from backup. After the identification of potential threats appropriate  countermeasures should be taken. A suggested solution is to choose an appropriate technology which  prevents reinstating revoked certificates.  Before a TSP issues a certificate, some obligation should be accepted by the subject and/or subscriber. One  of them is not to create any electronic signature with the private key if the certificate has been revoked.  The TSP should revoke certificates in a timely manner based on authorized and validated certificate  revocation requests mentioned in EN 319 411-1 and -2, chapter 6.2.4.

GUIDELINE  Requirement applies only to a TSP issuing qualified certificates.  Since certificate suspension is subject to national regulation, it may vary between Member States. A TSP  should perform a compliance management process to ensure compliance to local regulation of the  Member state in which it is granted the qualified status.  If suspension is allowed in a Member State, it is recommended to follow the provisions of:   EN 319411-1116 chapters 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10,   EN 319411-2117 chapters 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10.  Generally, it is recommended to meet requirements and apply standards as defined for certificate  revocation and validity status in reference to articles 24.3 and 24.4 (refer to this document).  If Certificate Revocation Lists are used, they should be as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.509 |  ISO/IEC 9594-8 or IETF RFC 5280118.

Requirements for the validation of qualified electronic signatures  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs providing validation service of qualified electronic signatures.  Validation of qualified electronic signature is the process of verifying and confirming that a qualified  electronic signature is valid. Requirements for validation service of qualified electronic signature are laid  down in article 32 of eIDAS Regulation.  Validity of the signature is essential for electronic transactions and allows any relying party to trust signed  data and documents. Validation service provided to the relying parties shall be secure and based on  standards.  4.1  Article 32.1  CONTENT  1. The process for the validation of a qualified electronic signature shall confirm the validity of a qualified  electronic signature provided that:  (a) the certificate that supports the signature was, at the time of signing, a qualified certificate for  electronic signature complying with Annex I;  (b) the qualified certificate was issued by a qualified trust service provider and was valid at the time of  signing;  (c) the signature validation data corresponds to the data provided to the relying party;  (d) the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is correctly provided to the relying  party;  (e) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated to the relying party if a pseudonym was used at the time  of signing;  (f) the electronic signature was created by a qualified electronic signature creation device;  (g) the integrity of the signed data has not been compromised;  (h) the requirements provided for in Article 26 were met at the time of signing.  GUIDELINE  According to eIDAS Regulation validation means the process of verifying and confirming that an electronic  signature or a seal is valid. Validation process of a qualified electronic signatures is not yet specified by  published standards. Recommendations bellow are based on draft version of ETSI TS 119 172-4124. An  important part in guidance for a qualified validation services is ETSI EN319 102-1125 clause 5 which contains  basic requirements and rules for an electronic signature validation. It is important to note that  124 See Annex B [No. 53]  125 See Annex B [No. 18]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31910201/01.01.01_60/en_31910201v010101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  47  indeterminate results exceeding requirements of the Regulation do not have to be part of a verification  report.  All requirements laid down in the regulation for qualified validation of qualified electronic signatures are  explained below respectively to each requirement “a” to “h”.  4.1.1 Article 32.1.a, b and f  The certificate validity status of the certificates must be verified during the certificate path validation  process (ETSI EN 319 102-1 and IETF RFC 5280), for all certificate types (e.g. certificates issued to signer, to  CAs, to OCSP responders, to CRL Issuers, to Time-Stamping Units) and either OCSP or CRL checks must  be  carried out.  According to the European Commission Implementing Decision (CID)  (EU) 2015/1505126, Trusted Lists are  the single formal way to verify that a claimed qualified trust service is indeed granted a qualified status.  The validation procedure must verify that the qualified certificate was issued by a qualified trust service  provider by verifying its status on a Trusted List. Moreover, compliance with Annex A.1 ETSI 319 412-5127  should be assessed.  4.1.2 Article 32.1.c, d and e  This information should be provided as part of the validation report in the validation process:   All supported (in Certification Policy) formats (XAdES, CAdES, PAdES, ASiC), which are mentioned in EU  2015/1505 should be correctly validated.   A signing certificate should be included in a validation report   Since indication of the use of a pseudonym is included in the Subject field of the certificate, it has to  appear also in the validation report  More details can be found in ETSI TS 319 102, clause 5.1.3128 - Status indication of the signature validation  process and signature validation report in table 5 and 6.  4.1.3 Article 32.1.g and h  The integrity of the signed data is checked by performing cryptographic verifications and guaranteed by a  supported signature validation model which depends on the TSP. Validation service procedures for  establishing whether an electronic signature or electronic seal is technically valid should rely on the  process described in ETSI TS 319 102, especially clause 5.1.3 where one can find a description of a  validation signature model, basic building blocks  that are useable in the signature validation process for  126 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015D1505&from=en  127See Annex B [No. 34]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941205/02.01.01_60/en_31941205v020101p.pdf  128Status indication of the signature validation process and signature validation report in table 5 and 6, page  30  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  48  basic signatures, for time-stamps and for signatures with time and signatures with long-term or archival  validation data.

The system used for validating the qualified electronic signature should provide to the relying party the  correct result of the validation process and should allow the relying party to detect any security relevant  issues.  GUIDELINE  A system used for validation of qualified signatures should be reliable and consist of technically evaluated  security products protected against unauthorized modifications.  To provide the correct result of the signature validation process to the relying party, the validation report  should be done by a validation service in the correct format – for example when a human user is involved,  the report is presented in a way meaningful to the user – human readable form (PDF).  Elements, mentioned below, should be presented in a legible way to the verifier:  a) The  text or a similar indication of the scope of the validation executed on the validated signature:  According to draft version of ETSI TS 119 172-4130 it could be for example:  Signature validation policy for European qualified electronic signatures/seals using trusted lists  Validation of digital signature to identify whether it can be considered as a European qualified  electronic signature/seal using EUMS trusted lists in the sense of the applicable European  legislation at the time of signing, i.e. either Directive 1999/93/EC or Regulation (EU) No 910/2014;  b) the complete set of data representing the signer in its certificate,  c) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated if a pseudonym was used at the time of signing;  d) the time reference against which the results of the signature validation procedure are provided  (i.e. “time of signing”)  a. If a valid qualified timestamp is present, then the time reference can be taken from this  timestamp;  b. If no timestamp is present, then the time reference is the time of the validation;  c. If a non-qualified timestamp is present, then the QTSP must define in its validation policy  what is the time reference in this case.  e) the presentation of the data that has been covered by the signature (signed data),  f) any signature attributes that have been included in the signature (signed and not signed  attributes),  g) the overall status of the signature validation according to ETSI EN 319 102-1131  . Information  related to cryptographic suites used to generate the signature being validated and potential  security related issues against either national rules or ETSI TS 119 312132,  h) the detailed outcome of each validation step.  Additionally, for better understanding ETSI TS 119 101 V1.1.1 should be followed, in particular:   main validation functionalities (as specified in clause 8.2.2);   validation process rules enforcement (as specified in clause 8.2.3);   validation policy (as specified in clause 8.2.4);  130 See Annex B [No. 53]  131 See Annex B [No. 18]  132 See Annex B [No. 54]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119300_119399/119312/01.01.01_60/ts_119312v010101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  50   validation user interface (as specified in clause 8.2.5); and   validation input/output relative conformance (correctness of the implemented validation  procedure) (as specified in clause 8.2.6).

Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs providing qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures. Requirements for TSP’s providing validation are covered in the previous chapter. Here special  requirements convenient for qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures are listed.  5.1 Article 33  CONTENT  A qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a qualified trust  service provider who:  (a) provides validation in compliance with Article 32(1); and  (b) allows relying parties to receive the result of the validation process in an automated manner, which is  reliable, efficient and bears the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the provider of  the qualified validation service.  GUIDELINE  There are several options and possibilities for QTSPs to provide validation services. The selection of these  options is driven by a specific policy of the QTSP. Additionally, legal requirements can be provided through  specific policies, e.g. in the context of qualified electronic signatures as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.  Besides there are some additional requirements mentioned below:   Art.33.1(a) with regard to the validation process to be provided in compliance with Art.32.1.  (aligned(a) to (h)).   Art.33.1(b) for the provision of the validation result in an automated manner that needs:  o to provide to the relying party the correct result of the validation process and should allow  the relying party to detect any security relevant issues (in conjunction of Art.32.2);  o to be reliable and efficient; and  o to bear the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the QTSP  providing the qualified validation service.  All these elements are part of audit activities under the compliance management process.  To assure that the result of the validation process is reliable and efficient, it should be taken into  consideration to build and deploy a redundant system designed and maintained on actual requirements  concerning the availability of validation service. Requirements for redundancy should be derived from  actual regulations, incident reviews and identified risks. Besides that, the QTSP should provide a  comprehensive report of validation with all details obtained during the validation process for instance:   status indicator of the results of validation process;   indicator of the policy against which signature/seal has been validated;   time and date for which the validation status and validation data was determined or;   status of validation process  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  52  Additionally, to assure that response is reliable, QTSP should sign or seal responses with a valid advanced  electronic signature or seal.  Guidance for authorized responses can be found in clause 4.2.2.2 of the RFC  6960134. Response should be signed or sealed with keys listed on the European Union Member State  trusted list, or issued by a Certification Authority listed on the European Union Member State trusted list.

Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures and  seals  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs providing qualified preservation service for qualified  electronic signatures and TSPs providing qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals.  Requirements for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures is laid down in Article 34  of eIDAS Regulation. Requirements for a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals are laid  down in Article 40 of eIDAS Regulation.  The purpose of a preservation trust service is to ensure the legal validity of electronic signatures and  electronic seals over extended periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of  future technological changes.  6.1 Articles 34 and 40  CONTENT  [Article 34]  1. A qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a qualified  trust service provider that uses procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of  the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological validity period.  [Article 40]  Article[s 32, 33 and] 34 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the validation and preservation of qualified  electronic seals.  GUIDELINE  Requirements for QTSPs providing preservation services for qualified signature (and seals) are these  applicable to all TSPs/QTSPs, amended with the requirements laid down in the art. 34.  According to European Commission “Questions & Answers on Trust Services under eIDAS”137, the eIDAS  Regulation sets rules for the preservation of eSignatures, eSeals or certificates related to trust services.  Preservation is different from electronic archiving (which is not a trust service under eIDAS). The objectives  and targets of the process will make a distinction between the two activities:   preservation under eIDAS aims at guaranteeing the trustworthiness of a qualified electronic  signature or qualified electronic seal through time. The technology underpinning such trust service  therefore targets the electronic signature or seal;   Electronic archiving aims at ensuring that a document is stored in order to guarantee its integrity  (and other legal features). The technology underpinning electronic archiving therefore targets the  document. Electronic archiving remains the competence of Member States.  137https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  54  Whilst document integrity is not part of the legal requirements of the regulation some technologies  covered in the regulation, such as time-stamping, are applicable to the preservation of the integrity of  archived document as for preservation of electronic signatures. ETSI is working on the development of  standards in this area.  It is recommended that QTSP use technologies and procedures to create a Long Time Validation form of a  AdES signature138. The archive form of the signature should be prepared according to an appropriate ETSI  standard listed below (XAdES, CAdES, PAdES), respectively to chosen format of the signature. Systems and  polices should be prepared accordingly to respective standards listed below.  Whilst XAdES, CAdES, PAdES have a role to play in signature preservation, it is important to note the  ongoing standardisation in ETSI relating to signature and document preservation and use of standards such  as defined in RFC 4998, TS 101 533 as well upcoming standards in this area.

The purpose of an electronic time stamp is to provide evidence of data existing at a particular point in  time. A time stamp binds the stamped data to a particular time and protects its integrity. Time stamps are  issued by a time stamping trust service provided by TSP.  A Qualified electronic time stamp is a time stamp issued by qualified trust service provider and meets  requirements laid down in eIDAS Regulation Article 42. A Qualified time stamp enjoys legal presumption of  the accuracy of the date, the time and presumption of the integrity of stamped data from the time of  stamping.  7.1 Article 42  CONTENT  1. A qualified electronic time stamp shall meet the following requirements:  (a) it binds the date and time to data in such a manner as to reasonably preclude the possibility of the data  being changed undetectably;  (b) it is based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated Universal Time; and  (c) it is signed using an advanced electronic signature or sealed with an advanced electronic seal of the  qualified trust service provider, or by some equivalent method.  GUIDELINE  There are a few basic standards defining requirements for binding of date and time and for accurate time  sources:   ETSI EN 319 421148- Policy and Security Requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing Electronic  Time-Stamps   ETSI EN 319 422149- Time-stamping protocol and electronic time-stamp profiles   CEN EN 419 231150 - Protection profile for trustworthy systems supporting time stamping  To fulfil all requirements, it is necessary to consider general TSP standards:   ETSI EN 319 401151 - General Policy Requirements for Trust Service Providers   ETSI TS 119 312152 - Cryptographic Suites  148 See Annex B [No. 35]  149 See Annex B [No. 39]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/319422/01.01.01_60/en_319422v010101p.pdf  150 See Annex B [No. 9]  151 See Annex B [No. 27]  152 See Annex B [No. 54]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119300_119399/119312/01.01.01_60/ts_119312v010101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  57  A Qualified Trust Service Provider providing qualified time-stamping service (QTSA) has responsibility for  the provision of the time-stamping services and time stamping management. The QTSA has responsibility  for the operation of one or more units which creates and signs on behalf of the QTSA. These units should  be trustworthy using:  a) requirements for trustworthy systems EN 319 401 clauses clause  7.4 items a) and f), 7.5, 7.6, 7.7  and 7.8 and EN 319 421 clause 7.6.2 and 7.6.3, or  b) commonly recognised or standardized Protection Profile conforming to ISO/IEC 15408, such as in  CEN TS 419 231  ANSSI DCSSI-PP 2008/07 is currently the only Common Criteria evaluated protection profile for a  timestamping system, but CEN EN 419 231 is planned to supersede it when it is published.  A QTSA is a trust service provider as described in ETSI EN 319 401 which issues time stamps and fulfils all  obligations of Qualified Trust Service Provider laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  The QTSA should establish and make available to subscribers and relying parties the time stamp policy and  include the identifier for the policy in each issued time stamp. The following requirements should be  fulfilled:  a) The QTSA should maintain and protect all time signing systems in a secure zone.  b) The QTSA should configure all time signing systems by removing or disabling all accounts,  applications, services, protocols, and ports that are not used in the QTSA's operations.  c) Only trusted parties should access secure zones and high security zones.  According to ETSI EN 319 421 the policy should specify:  a) at least one hashing algorithm used to represent the datum being time-stamped;  b) the accuracy of the time in the time-stamps with respect to UTC;  c) any limitations on the use of the time-stamping service;  d) the subscriber's obligations, if any;  e) the relying party's obligations;  f) information on how to verify the time-stamp such that the relying party is considered to  \"reasonably rely\" on the time-stamp and any possible limitations on the validity period; and  g) any claim to meet the requirements on time-stamping services under national law.  To fulfil obligations laid down in eIDAS Regulation 42 (1.a) some obligations to the relying party are  needed. Basing on ETSI EN 319 421 these obligations are:  a) verify that the time-stamp has been correctly signed and that the private key used to sign the  time-stamp has not been compromised up to the time of the verification;  b) take into account any limitations on the usage of the time-stamp indicated by the time-stamp  policy; and  c) take into account any other precautions prescribed in agreements or elsewhere.  According to ETSI EN 319 421 QTSA operates units creating Time Stamps, the following requirements  apply:  a) The generation of signing key(s) should be undertaken in a physically secured environment by  personnel in trusted roles under, at least, dual control. The personnel authorized to carry out this  function should be limited to those required to do so under the QTSA's practices.  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  58  b) The generation of signing key(s) should be carried out within a secure cryptographic device which  is a trustworthy system which:  o is assured to EAL 4 or higher in accordance with ISO/IEC 15408153, or equivalent national or  internationally recognized evaluation criteria for IT security. If standard specifying  common criteria protection profiles CEN TS 419 221-2,3,4,5 is published, this protection  profile should be used as an evaluation criteria  o alternatively, meets the requirements identified in ISO/IEC 19790154 or FIPS PUB 140-2155,  level 3.  c) The key generation algorithm, the resulting signing key length and signature algorithm used for  signing time-stamps key should be as specified in ETSI TS 119 312.  d) A signing key should not be imported into different cryptographic modules.  e) If there are same keys in different cryptographic modules, they should be associated with the  same public key certificate into all the different cryptographic modules.  f) One time signing unit should have a single time-stamp signing key active at a time.  The time signing unit private keys should remain confidential and their integrity should be maintained. The  private signing key should be held and used within a cryptographic module which compels the same  evaluation criteria as unit used for the generation of signing keys. CEN EN 419 231 may establish additional  requirements for private key protection.  Time-stamps should conform to the time-stamp profile as defined in ETSI EN 319 422.  The time-stamps should be issued securely and should include the correct time. Detailed requirements for  time-stamp issuance are defined in ETSI EN 319 421 chapter 7.7.1.  QTSA is responsible for logging all events identified in ETSI EN 319 401. In addition, the following records  should be logged:  a) Records concerning all events relating to the life-cycle of time signing keys.  b) Records concerning all events relating to the life-cycle of time stamp certificates.  c) Records concerning all events relating to synchronization of a time signing system clock to UTC  (concerning normal re-calibration or synchronization of clocks used in time-stamping).  d) Records concerning all events relating to detection of loss of synchronization.  For all QTSA Qualified Time Stamps, signature verification (public) key certificate should be issued by a  certification authority fulfilling general requirementsof QTSPs. The relying party is expected to use a  Trusted List to establish whether the time-stamp unit and the timestamp are qualified. If the public key of  the time stamping service is listed in the Trusted List and the service it represents is a qualified time- stamping service, or Certification Authority is listed in the Trusted List, representing a qualified time- stamping service then the time-stamps issued by this TSU can be considered as qualified.  153See Annex B [No. 58]  154See Annex {No. 59]  ISO/IEC 19790:2012 the security requirements for a cryptographic module utilised within a security system protecting  sensitive information in computer and telecommunication systems, defines four security levels for cryptographic  modules.  155FIPS PUB 140-2is a National Institute of Standards and Technology standard, and it specifies the security  requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive  but unclassified information, it also defines four security levels for cryptographic modules.  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  59  The QC Statement \"esi4-qtstStatement-1\" as defined in ETSI EN 319 422, can be used as an indication that  the TSP claims the time-stamp to be a qualified electronic time-stamp.  According to ETSI EN 319 422, some requirements to Time Stamp Profile and Protocol should be placed:  a) A time-stamping server should support the time-stamping request and response as defined in IETF  RFC 3161156, clause 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 with the amendments defined in the following clauses.  b) Hash algorithms for the time-stamp data to be supported should be as specified in clause A.8 of  ETSI TS 119 312  c) Certificate used for the time stamp verification should meet the requirements defined in ETSI EN  319 412-2157 for the QTSA being a natural person or defined in ETSI EN 319 412-3158 for the QTSA  being a legal person with the amendments defined in the following clauses.  Trust Service Providers have certain responsibilities with regard to the algorithms they are using.  Although  any transition between algorithms is predominantly the work to be done by supervisory body, the  following approach should be taken by TSPs:   TSP shall actively seek cooperation with their users (especially public administration) with regard  to transition between algorithms. Sufficient advice and timely warning shall be offered to all, not  only customers but also relying parties.   TSP shall encourage the specification, spread of knowledge and implementation of appropriate  procedures.   TSP shall plan ahead conservation solutions and updates in SCVA due  to the changes of  cryptographic suites, algorithm breaks or other vulnerabilities.   TSP shall adapt in advance their own libraries and SCVA offered in their products. If TSP is not a  developer than at least contact and incitement for changes is necessary. As much as possible they  should assist also 3rd party developers helping them to prepare for change of algorithms in  signatures and certificates.   Change of algorithms should not economically hamper subscribers of trusted services. TSP shall  handle change of algorithms without requesting customer to pay for new cards or certificates.   In case of possible break of algorithms TSP shall inform publicly in plain language (not  cryptographic slang) what and how to do to preserve electronically signed/sealed documents,  avoid exploit and attacks etc.   Exploiting economically cryptography techniques in your products requires responsibility for all  users. TSP are responsible for development of knowledge on relying party systems and what  resources may be affected with cryptographic changes.

Requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services  This chapter concerns requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services laid down in Article  44 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS) is a service provided by a qualified trust service  provider (QTSP). QERDS securely transmits documents and data between third parties by electronic  means. QERDS may use other QERDS services to transfer data from the sender to addressee. QERDS  provides evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending and  receiving the data. QERDS protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any  unauthorised alterations. QERDS identifies both sender and addressee of the data.  8.1 Article 44  CONTENT  1. Qualified electronic registered delivery services shall meet the following requirements:  (a) they are provided by one or more qualified trust service provider(s);  (b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  (c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  (d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic signature or an advanced  electronic seal of a qualified trust service provider in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the  data being changed undetectably;  (e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data is clearly indicated to  the sender and addressee of the data;  (f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by a qualified electronic  time stamp.  In the event of the data being transferred between two or more qualified trust service providers, the  requirements in points (a) to (f) shall apply to all the qualified trust service providers.  GUIDELINE  All expected standards regarding qualified electronic registered delivery services have not yet been  completed nor published. There are more gaps in this area than answers laid down in standards. ETSI ESI  has started work on the development of standards for supporting qualified and non qualified electronic  registered delivery services as defined in the eIDAS (they will be the ETSI EN 319 522, ETSI EN 319 532, ETSI  EN 319 521, and ETSI EN 319 531, see the list of standards at the end of this clause and Annex B for further  details). This effort also targets at supporting conformance and interoperability tests (ETSI TS 119 524 and  ETSI TS 119 534).  This guideline in some parts is based on trust application building experience and should be reviewed and  updated after the publication of such relevant standards. Some security recommendations provided below  for qualified registered electronic delivery service are based on standards developed for business data  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  62  exchange. These standards are the ETSI TS 102 640REM163, OASIS AS4 Profile of ebMS 3.0 Version 1.0164  and OASIS ebXML Messaging Services Version 3.0165.  Art. 44 of the eIDAS Regulation requires the following on qualified electronic registered delivery services:  a) they are provided by one or more qualified trust service provider(s);  This point is not addressed in the standards. ETSI TS 102 640REM is not applicable in the context of eIDAS  Article 44.  The boundaries of qualified electronic registered delivery service are established by a network of qualified  trust service providers. QTSP should manage these relationships, and confirm that all “qualified electronic  delivery network” is based on qualified trust service providers. Recognition of qualified trust service  providers shall be based on Trust Lists.  Aspects covered in this chapter are part of the Service Level Agreement between trust service providers  and business continuity management.  According to ETSI TS 102 640166, some other (not qualified nor trusted) services can be involved in a  qualified electronic delivery process, for example:   notification of incoming delivery can be forwardFencryed via SMS/GSM network,   documents can be forwarded by a non-qualified service after delivery confirmation,   documents from non-qualified services origin delivered via a qualified electronic registered  delivery service.  In the event of the data being transferred between two or more qualified trust service providers, the  requirement in points (a) to (f) should apply to all the qualified trust service providers.  b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  Regarding the ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 standard, the choice of the authentication mechanism is left to the  trust service provider. Specific requirements must hence be specified in standards to reflect those in the  eIDAS Regulation.  163REM Registered Electronic Mail – standard based on e-mail protocols for Registered Electronic Delivery established  by e-Sens (https://www.esens.eu) project.  164 See Annex B [No. 69]  http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/profiles/AS4-profile/v1.0/os/AS4-profile-v1.0-os.html  165 See Annex B [No. 68]  https://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/core/cs02/ebms_core-3.0-spec-cs-02.html  166See Annex B [No. 46-50]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264002/02.01.01_60/ts_10264002v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264003/02.01.01_60/ts_10264003v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264004/02.01.01_60/ts_10264004v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264005/02.01.01_60/ts_10264005v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264002/02.01.01_60/ts_10264002v020101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264003/02.01.01_60/ts_10264003v020101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264004/02.01.01_60/ts_10264004v020101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  63  The Regulation defined Electronic Identification and Electronic Identification means, as part of the notified  European network allowing common recognition of personal identification. The Regulation also defined  levels of assurance of Electronic Identification means. If a qualified electronic registered delivery service  uses an external electronic identification scheme/service for the identification of the sender this external  system shall guarantee a high level of confidence of electronic identification. Identification scheme/service  should be notified167 or recognised on national level.  The identification of the sender should meet the requirements according to Art. 24.1. The authentication  of a previously identified sender shall meet the requirements with regard to the authentication  mechanisms for assurance level substantial.  Identification of the sender may be based on an advanced electronic signature of the sender. There are a  few options available to achieve such a high level of confidence:   a qualified electronic signature based on a qualified certificate of the sender;   an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate of the sender;   an advance electronic signature based on an issued non-qualified certificate.  If an advanced electronic signature meets points 1 or 2, it may be assumed that the required high level of  confidence of the identification of the sender is fulfilled. If an advanced electronic signature (point 3) is  based on another certificate then qualified, additional risk evaluation should be performed and the  qualified trust service policy should specify how such a requirement of a high level of confidence of the  identification can be fulfilled.  Identification of the sender can also be done by another non-electronic way, for example in person. The  procedure for verification of identity should be described in the policy and meet the high level of  confidence requirement.  c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  If qualified electronic delivery services are based on ETSI EN 319 532 under development (that evolve ETSI  TS 102 640 REM specifications to fit within the framework  of standards for supporting eIDAS),  identification of the recipient is part of the REM protocolThe Regulation requires identification of the  addressee and grants presumption of the identified addressee. For consistence with other trust services, it  is recommended that the identification of the addressee meets the requirements according to Art. 24.1.  The identification and subsequent authentications of the sender should at least meet the requirements of  level “substantial” according to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502. The authentication  of a previously identified addressee shall meet the requirements with  regard to the authentication  mechanisms for assurance level “substantial”.A Qualified Trusted Service provider should establish and  disseminate a trust service policy revealing how proof of receiving the data is confirmed. Some systems  can be based on a verification of delivery receipt and verification of an electronic signature or an electronic  seal of the recipient. It is a good practice to rely on qualified certificates verified through Trusted Lists, but  also Qualified Trust Service provider can establish alternative trust points based on risk analysis and  acceptance.  167eIDAS Article 9  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  64  It is important to mention that delivery of the data can be available to the recipient only after his proper  identification. If this process is based on an advanced electronic signature, the signature verification should  precede the delivery (availability) of the sent data.  If identification of the recipient is based on the identification process, it is highly recommended to conduct  the whole process in a secured and controlled environment of the qualified trust service provider. All  evidence of identification and delivery process should be gathered and protected.  Regarding eIDAS Regulation article 3 (36) electronic registered delivery service provides the proof of  sending the data and protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage and any  unauthorized alternations. Identification and authentication of the recipient is part of countersigns against  loss and theft of the delivered data. It is good practice to use end-to-end encryption from the sender to the  recipient to ensure confidentiality of the message payload so that only the intended recipient can access it.  Evidence of identification process should be collected and secured for the appropriate time. This time  should be established and described in the service policy.  d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic signature or an  advanced electronic seal of a qualified trust service provider in such a manner as to preclude  the possibility of the data being changed undetectably;  The QTSA is responsible for the operation of one or more units which creates and signs/seals on behalf of  the QTSA the delivered data. Basing on ETSI TS 102 640, an advanced electronic signature or an advanced  electronic seal should be created via a Secure Signature Creation Device..  It is good practice to make the data available to the sender signed/sealed by QTSP. The data should be  secured by a signature/seal placed on the proof of sending, while ensuring the sent data is integrally linked  to this proof.  The certificate allowing verification of an advanced electronic signature or an advanced electronic seal  should be verifiable via a Trust Service List.  e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data is clearly  indicated to the sender and addressee of the data;  The best practice is to deliver exactly the same data that was sent, but for interoperability reasons it may  be necessary to alter it. If data is altered, information about this should be revealed to both, the sender  and the recipient..  Indication about altered data should be part of the delivery process and should be available to the  recipient before receiving the confirmation of proof of delivery. Proof of delivery should link in an  integrated way the finally delivered data with the identification means of addressee and time of delivery.  f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by a qualified  electronic time stamp.  Proof of sending and proof of receiving should be integrally linked to sent/delivered data and time  stamped by a qualified time stamp. Qualified time stamp requirements are part of the previous chapter.  Future ETSI standardisation work on electronic registered delivery services will have leverage over the  existing multipart TS 102 640 series addressing standardisation of registered electronic mail (REM) and  align these specifications to the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Effective production of such REM  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  65  specifications and more general specifications addressing all other types of electronic registered delivery  services has not been planned yet.

Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates for website authentication  (QCWA). Requirements for a qualified certificate for website authentication are laid down in Article 45 of  the eIDAS Regulation.  QCWA is a certificate for website authentication, which is issued by a qualified trust service provider  (QTSP). Requirements for QCWA are laid down in Annex IV of the eIDAS Regulation.  The purpose of certificates for website authentication is providing an attested link to natural or legal  person for whom the certificate was issued and to make it possible to authenticate and link a website to a  user. Website authentication certificates are in common use, and are the common used safeguard against  on-line service threats.  9.1 Article 45  CONTENT  1.Qualified certificates for website authentication shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex IV:  Annex IV:  Qualified certificates for website authentication shall contain:  (a) an indication, at least in a form suitable for automated processing, that the certificate has been issued  as a qualified certificate for website authentication;  (b) a set of data unambiguously representing the qualified trust service provider issuing the qualified  certificates including at least the Member State in which that provider is established and: — for a legal  person: the name and, where applicable, registration number as stated in the official records, — for a  natural person: the person’s name;  (c) for natural persons: at least the name of the person to whom the certificate has been issued, or a  pseudonym. If a pseudonym is used, it shall be clearly indicated; for legal persons: at least the name of the  legal person to whom the certificate is issued and, where applicable, registration number as stated in the  official records;  (d) elements of the address, including at least city and State, of the natural or legal person to whom the  certificate is issued and, where applicable, as stated in the official records;  (e) the domain name(s) operated by the natural or legal person to whom the certificate is issued;  (f) details of the beginning and end of the certificate’s period of validity;  (g) the certificate identity code, which must be unique for the qualified trust service provider;  (h) the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service  provider;  (i) the location where the certificate supporting the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic  seal referred to in point  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  67  (h) is available free of charge;  (j) the location of the certificate validity status services that can be used to enquire as to the validity status  of the qualified certificate.  GUIDELINE  These requirements apply to a TSP issuing qualified certificates for website authentication only.  QTSP issuing qualified certificates for website authentication should prepare a certificate profile for this  purpose. When certificates are issued as EU Qualified Certificates, they should include QCStatements. A  QCStatement included in a certificate should be prepared accordingly to ETSI EN 319 412-5175. Issuance of  qualified certificates for website authentication is regulated by a certification policy. The certification  policy should comply with ETSI EN 319 411-2176, and the certificate should include a certificate policies  extension. Keeping a certificate profile appropriate to regulations is part of the compliance management  process.  A certificate for website authentication contains the name of the legal or natural person to whom the  certificate is issued and operated by their domain name. Verification of this data should be completed  based on requirements laid down in Article 24 (1). Additional guidance from CA/Browser Forum:  \"Guidelines for The Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates177 (on legal entities),  standards for identity proofing for personal certificates (for natural persons).  NOTE: QTSP using ITU-T X.509 should ensure that corrigendum 1178 and 2179 is applied to base standard.

It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess  these electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their  legal effect.  Following the publication of the eIDAS Regulation, a set of secondary and co-regulatory acts had to be  published in order to provide technical guidance on how to implement the specific requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (in the TSP part of eIDAS, the European Commission decided to publish only the  mandatory ones). ENISA aimed to develop a concise set of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders, including Trust Service  Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies.  The objective of this document is to provide guidelines for fulfilling requirements originating from the  following articles of the eIDAS Regulation:   Art. 24.5 – Requirements for qualified trust service providers;   Art. 28.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic signatures;   Art. 32.3 – Requirements for the validation of qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 33.2 – Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 34.2 – Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 38.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic seals;   Art. 42.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic time stamps;   Art. 44.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services;   Art. 45.2 – Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  05  1. Introduction  1.1 General overview  Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic  identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation) and  repealing Directive 1999/93/EC2 is a milestone for providing a predictable regulatory environment enabling  secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens and public authorities.  The eIDAS Regulation:   Ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes  (eIDs) to access public services in other Member States where eIDs are available and identification  scheme is notified to the European Commission.   Creates a European internal market for trust services (eTSs) - namely electronic signatures,  electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication.  In a nutshell, this Regulation renders that electronic identification (eID) and electronic Trust Services (eTS)  as key enablers for secure cross-border electronic transactions and central building blocks of the Digital  Single Market.  Since 1 July 2016 the eIDAS Regulation is directly applicable in EU Member States. It provides legal  certainty and encourages the usage of electronic identification means and trust services for online access  and online transactions at EU level.  The eIDAS Regulation ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic  identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other Member States where eIDs are available  and identification scheme is notified to the European Commission. It also creates an EU wide internal  market for electronic trust services by ensuring they will be recognised and functional across borders and  have the same legal status as traditional paper based procedures. National eIDs are recognised by foreign  public services if :   These eIDs are delivered in a notified scheme;   The public service accepts another notified eID of level substantial or high.  Qualified trust services have legal effects, but they are not necessarily the same as traditional paper based  procedures (with the exception of the qualified signature which is equivalent to a handwritten signature).  Following the publication of the eIDAS regulation, a set of secondary and co-regulatory acts could be  published in order to provide technical guidance on how to implement the specific requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (in the TSP part of eIDAS, the European Commission decided to publish only the  mandatory ones). ENISA aimed to develop a concise set of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders, including Trust Service  Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies. However it is encouraged to  stakeholders to verify that these guidelines are accepted by their national Supervisory Body.  2 See Annex B [No. 4] http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31999L0093  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  06  Furthermore, to effectively bring about the objectives of the eIDAS Regulation, such as improving  customer protection in internet transactions, work needs to be carried out to communicate on risks and  promote the acceptance and adoption of trust services in Europe. To achieve this, understanding the main  aspects of ENISA guidelines mentioned above can be helpful. Through better understanding the risk  management can be improved.  ENISA is supporting the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation since 2013 by:   providing security recommendations for a correct implementation of trust services,   mapping technical and regulatory requirements,   promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe,   informing relying parties and end users on how to secure their electronic transactions using trust  services, etc.  1.2 Scope of the document  Taking into account the complexity of the subject, wide sgacope of services and number of potentially  applicable standards, it is extremely relevant to provide an extensive and an as far as possible up-to-date  set of standards enabling all stakeholders to understand and perform eIDAS compliant activities. Most of  the standards are currently created by European Standardisation Organisations under standardisation  requests from the European Commission (former mandate m/460). This set of standards builds on a  number of existing internationally recognised standards and guidelines from ISO, ITU-T, CAB Forum and  IETF.  The objective of this document, following the ENISA deliverable from 2015, “Analysis of standards related  to Trust Service Providers - Mapping of requirements of eIDAS to existing standards” is to review and  produce guidelines for fulfilling requirements originating from the following articles of the eIDAS  Regulation:   Art. 24.5 – Requirements for qualified trust service providers;   Art. 28.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic signatures;   Art. 32.3 – Requirements for the validation of qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 33.2 – Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 34.2 – Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures;   Art. 38.6 – Qualified certificates for electronic seals;   Art. 42.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic time stamps;   Art. 44.2 – Requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services;   Art. 45.2 – Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication  Other articles, where standards could prove to be useful to CABs and SBs in assessing the compliance with  the Regulation are 5.1, 13.2, 15, 19.1, 19.2, 24.1, 24.2 (except e & f), 24.3, 24.4, 26, 28.3, 28.4, 28.5, 36,  38.3, 38.4, 38.5.  This guideline will help all stakeholders to understand the mapping between the articles mentioned above  and reference numbers of standards, as well as practical recommendations for their usage. sIt is important  to note that some of eIDAS' requirements are not covered by standards yet, e. g. standards for electronic  registered delivery are only being developed in ETSI STF 523.  Many of the standards contain references to other standards, often several levels deep. Sometimes the  clauses with delegation include some additional requirements. Thus, a detailed set of requirements  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  07  corresponding to a particular article from eIDAS Regulation is a collection of requirements from the last  referenced document up to the first one.  The process approach is a method of dynamic security and compliance management. Its origins can be  traced to the classical school of management: the organization of production processes and ergonomic  research. The process approach was described in the ISO 9001:20003 standard. In previous standards, this  approach did not exist, the systems were implemented according to the standard points. The second  amendment of ISO 9000 standard issued in the year 2000 changed the structure of the standard, and  described the process approach principle thereby facilitating implementation. Currently, a process  approach is the main, fundamental principle in all management standards and best practices.  In the process management approach, each activity can be described as a set of interconnected processes.  Each process has goals and an owner, who is accountable for achieving process goals by controlling  process performance. Processes transform input into output utilizing resources. Processes have suppliers  (input) and clients (output). Input, output, resource utilization and overall process performance can be  measured and defined as goals for the accounting process owner, and also for process improvement.  Processes flow horizontally through an organization in contrast to vertical organization structure.  Generally, there are three main types of processes: management, core and support, but in this document  we will use other taxonomy based on rareness of processes. Some processes exist in each organization,  they are called herein after general processes, for example HR, finance. Other processes are common for  some common activities independently from TSP, for example Information Security Management System  (ISMS described in ISO/IEC 270014 standard) or IT service management system (described in ISO/IEC  200005 standard). These processes may exist or should be implemented in an organization by process  owners not only for TSP purposes. These processes should be shared throughout an organization. There is  no other reason to deploy this processes independently for TSP. This approach simplifies process  deployment to become TSP. Processes called herein after specific are core TSP processes, required  especially for TSP. These processes should be deployed according to an organizational culture similarly to  other activities, but requirements for them can be found only in formal standards regarding TSP activity.  To better understand their relations, the authors of these guidelines took into consideration stakeholders  of the processes, their requirements, obligations and benefits.  The structure of the document is organised to provide information and guidelines with regards to: the  equirements of each article mentioned above   content   guideline   list of standards and other documents (guidelines, recommendations), referred to as ‘standards’   TSP’s process   external stakeholders  3 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=21823  4See Annex B [No. 61]  5 See Annex B [No. 60]  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=21823  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  08  It is important to note that the scope of this document is restricted to qualified trust service providers and  qualified trust services, with the exception of article 32 which applies to both qualified and non-qualified  validation services.  The verbs “shall”, “should” and “may” in this document should be used in accondance with ETSI guide6.  6 https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  09  2. Requirements for qualified trust service providers  A Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) provides one or more qualified trust services.  The TSP needs to  submit a notification of its intention to provide qualified trust services together with a conformity  assessment report issued by a conformity assessment body to the supervisory body. The supervisory body  will analyse whether the TSP meets the applicable eIDAS requirements based on the notification and the  conformity assessment report. In case of a positive outcome of this analysis, the qualified status is granted  by the supervisory body to the TSP.  Qualified trust service providers are audited at least every 24 months by a conformity assessment body.  The audit confirms fulfilment of the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation. The general  requirements for qualified trust service providers are laid down in Article 24 of eIDAS Regulation.  The Commission may establish reference numbers of standards for trustworthy systems and products,  which comply with the requirements under points (e) and (f) of Article 24 (2). This chapter covers  guidelines for TSP’s based on standards complying with Article 24 requirements.  2.1  Article 24.1.  CONTENT  Article 24.1. When issuing a qualified certificate for a trust service, a qualified trust service provider shall  verify, by appropriate means and in accordance with national law, the identity and, if applicable, any  specific attributes of the natural or legal person to whom the qualified certificate is issued.  The information referred to in the first subparagraph shall be verified by the qualified trust service provider  either directly or by relying on a third party in accordance with national law:  a) by the physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized representative of the legal  person; or  b) remotely, using electronic identification means, for which prior to the issuance of the qualified  certificate, a physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized representative of the legal  person was ensured and which meets the requirements set out in Article 8 with regard to the  assurance levels ‘substantial’ or ‘high’; or  c) by means of a certificate of a qualified electronic signature or of a qualified electronic seal issued in  compliance with point (a) or (b); or  d) by using other identification methods recognized at national level which provide equivalent  assurance in terms of reliability to physical presence. The equivalent assurance shall be confirmed  by a conformity assessment body  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  10  GUIDELINE  It is recommended to follow chapters EN 319 411-17(6.2.2, 6.2.3) and corresponding chapters EN 319 411- 28 (6.2.2, 6.2.3) in particular, which present the identity verification process. It must be stressed that this  process is a critical part of the registration procedure for issuing a qualified certificate.  Generally, the identity verification process in the certificate issuance process have a lot in common with  identity proofing process during (notified) issuance of electronic identification means9. Therefore, it is  advised to familiarize oneself and re-use as a good practice (whenever applicable) technical standards set  out by the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 for the high and substantial assurance  levels of electronic identification means.  The above mentioned EN standards distinguish two types of identity verification:   initial identification described in EN 319 411-1(6.2.2) and EN 319 411-2 (6.2.2), where the issuance  of a certificate is meant for a person not registered (never before) by the QTSP,   in the re-keying process described in EN 319 411-1 (6.2.3) and EN 319 411-2 (6.2.3), which means  in the process of issuance of a new certificate for the person who has already been registered by  the QTSP (possess a qualified certificate from this QTSP).  In case of a re-key request, the identity verification procedure can be simplified, where existing evidence  can be re-used to validate the identity, provided the evidence remains valid given the time elapsed (and it  is allowed by the national legislation). In any case, such a procedure must meet all the requirements of  initial verification (as in chapter 6.2.2).  Further from above mentioned standards, identity verification must be carried out in accordance with the  national law of a Member State in which the QTSP has been granted the qualified status. TSPs operating in  a cross border situation (for example when enrolment takes place in a different country that the one  where QTSP is established) will require further guidance from supervisory bodies.  Generally, identity verification means collecting evidence or an attestation from an appropriate and  authorised source and checking its validity and authenticity. The most common way is to use a nationally  recognized identity document; other means are also allowed, for instance national registry information,  bank or utility account information, credit bureau information, breeder documents (unless local legislation  states otherwise).  In short the eIDAS Regulation provides four methods of identity verification:  a) face to face,  b) based on electronic identification means,  c) based on a qualified electronic signature or on a qualified electronic seal,  7See Annex B [No. 28]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941101/01.01.01_60/en_31941101v010101p.pdf  8See Annex B [No. 29]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941102/02.01.01_60/en_31941102v020101p.pdf  9 While there are similarities, there are also some differences. As an example, for issuance of electronic identification  means, physical face-to-face (or equivalence with it) is not a requirement. While the use of qualified certificate or seal  is permitted for the issuance of a qualified certificate (24.1.c), it is not for the issuance of electronic identification  means.  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  11  d) other methods recognised at national level of the Member State providing equivalent assurance in  terms of reliability to physical presence.  In a face to face identification process, where physical identity documents are used, the registration  authority personnel must have qualifications with regard to (physical) verification of ID documents and  their security features. This should be considered part of the general requirements for personnel of a QTSP  as per Article 24.2b and ETSI EN 319 40110 (see chapter 7.2 Human resources).  In a remote issuance process, electronic identification means (as defined by eIDAS) can be used for identity  verification (art. 24.1b).  When issuing a qualified certificate remotely, the identity verification process must provide equivalent  assurance in terms of reliability to physical presence. Therefore, to be compliant (with art. 24.1b) it is  (explicitly) mandatory to use electronic identification means for which physical presence was confirmed  at any stage of certificate handling (for exampleat the moment of generating the certificate, or when  credentials are handed to the person).  When other methods are used (d), it is necessary to verify that the given method provides assurance  equivalent to methods requiring physical presence. This will mean additional documentation needs to be  prepared by a QTSP, and the method is to be confirmed by a conformity assessment body and recognised  at national level.  Best practice has to yet to be established for how to meet the requirements of article 24.1 b) for physical  presence.  ETSI EN 319 411 standard refers to CA/Browser forum documents (applicable in the context of websites)  for details of verification procedure:   EVCG CA/Browser Forum: \"Guidelines for The Issuance and Management of Extended Validation  Certificates\"11 – see chapter 11,   BRG CA/Browser Forum: \"Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly- Trusted Certificates\"12 – see chapter 11  If in a given case discrepancies occur between mentioned standards and acts, the priority is as follows:   eIDAS Regulation,   implementing and delegated acts related to eIDAS Regulation,   national legislation,   standards published by standardization bodies (e.g. CEN/CENELEC/ETSI/ISO)   guidelines and documents by other bodies (e.g. CA/B forum, IETF)   other standards.

Following subchapters 24.2.a - 24.2.k refer to each requirement and propose standardisation for  compliance with it.  2.2.1 Article 24.2.a  CONTENT  [A qualified trust service provider providing qualified trust services shall:]  a) inform the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its qualified trust services and an  intention to cease those activities  GUIDELINE  This is a new provision compared to Directive 1999/93/EC14. There are no detailed rules of such  communication in standards, this is a gap in eIDAS related standardization and good practices should  apply. General provisions somehow applicable to this article are:   EN 319 40115 – chapter 6.1 item g) and h), 7.11 and 7.12,   EN 319 411-116 and EN 319 411-217 (for certification services),   EN 319 42118 (for time stamp services),   ISO/IEC 2700219 – chapter 12.1.2.  The gap can be met in a following way:   For changes in trust services: by simple extension to requirement EN 319 401 clause 6.1,   For intent to terminate: by EN 319 401 7.12 b i) which is required to be applied “before the TSP  terminates”.  Implementation of article 24.2.a is strictly related to the Change Management process. One of the main  goals of such a process is to introduce changes in a systematic, secure and effective manner based on risk.  Informing a supervisory body about changes in provision of qualified trust services, especially about  termination, is a countermeasure for subscribers and trusting entities against unnoticed, illegitimate use of  trusted mechanisms.  The reporting mechanism should provide event driven triggers and communication channels to report  changes to a supervisory body according to Member State regulations. It is a good practice to create a  communication plan associated with the change management process which covers communication with a  supervisory body.  EN 319 411 part 1 and 2 do not impose any specific requirements / rules related to communication (see  chapter 6.8.11). However, it is recommended that such rules should be defined and information about  14See Annex B [No. 4]  15See Annex B [No. 27]  16See Annex B [No. 28]  17See Annex B [No. 29]  18See Annex B [No. 35]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/319421/01.01.01_60/en_319421v010101p.pdf  19See Annex B [No. 62]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  14  them be included in the Trust Service Practice Statement or Certification Practice Statement. This is  derived from EN 319 401, chapter 6.1 (items g and h) requirements. It (item g) states, that “a TSP shall  notify of changes it intends to make in its practice statement and shall […] make the revised TSP practice  statement available immediately […]”. As “any change in the provision of its qualified trust services” (as  per provision of this eIDAS article) is in many cases reflected through practice statement change, it is  suggested to perform communication with a supervisory body at the same time as subscribers and relying  parties, and therefore “immediately”. In other cases (changes not reflected in a practice statement), it is  suggested to keep the same communication rules, with the exception that intention to terminate activities  by its nature should be communicated to a supervisory body earlier (than in the actual termination  process).  General requirements regarding a practice statement are also specified in EN 319 411-1 and EN 319 411-2  chapter 5.2 (for certification services) and in EN 319 421 chapter 6.2 (for time stamp services).

QTSP should build an appropriate organization structure. Staff with good knowledge, segregation of duties  and sufficient funds for maintaining this staff is a part of building QTSPs reliability. QTSP should develop  and maintain an appropriate human resources process and procedures, education programs and keep  records of such activities.  This process should ensure:   reliability and competence of candidates for employment,   continuous personal education for staff and management,   trainings sessions,   security procedures trainings,   sufficient human resources of the TSP to fulfil requirements of segregation of duty, business  requirements and implement countermeasures resulting from risk analysis,   appropriate discipline,   proper record keeping of these activities.  General requirements (applicable to any trust service providers) are set by EN 319 401, chapter 7.2. For  detailed provisions this standard refers to ISO/IEC 27002.

This matter is only referred to in ETSI standards, with no more guidance than in the Regulation:   EN 319 40128 - chapter 7.1.1 item c),   EN 319 411-129 and EN 319 411-230 chapter 6.8.2 (fully refers to EN 319 401),  The gap can be addressed by extension to the requirement of EN 319 401 7.1.1 item c), to recommend that  the assessment of “financial resources and/or obtain appropriate liability insurance” required should be  based on a risk assessment (see clause 5), which takes into account commercial and financial issues.  This area should be treated based on the local (national) rules and legislation (if any) and good practices, as  part of risk management. Risk based approach is now the main one in all management systems standards.  As a common base, regardless of subject matter, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  established in 2011 a standard for risk management (ISO 2700531) that contains principles and guidelines,  and is recommended to use for risk analysis (taking into account financial and commercial aspects) by EN  319 401. At this moment there are no European standards for risk management, and it can be considered  as another standardisation gap in the eIDAS context.  The most common approach towards treatment of risk of liabilities for damage is risk sharing, and the  most common countermeasure is insurance against the risks. A QTSP should check legislation related to  the protection of consumers (subscribers) and trusting entities interests, in the Member State in which it  operates or would like to start the activity. This will allow identification of regulatory expectations as well  as enable meeting of its liability to external parties.  This is part of Compliance Management. If a regulator expects a TSP to declare an amount of liabilities, it is  the most cost effective to establish a Risk Management Process. Analysis of threats and potential losses  per service allow a TSP to calculate an amount of money to allocate to assure compensation for potential  damages or define insurance requirements and conditions.  Best practices regarding risk management process can be reached in ISO 31000 standard.

Use of trust services by subscribers and trusting entities requires notice or knowledge of the terms and  conditions of these services. One of QTSP’s obligations is to inform about terms and conditions for each  trust service. Information presented in the documentation should be up to date, understandable, easily  accessible and conspicuously communicated by stakeholders.  To fulfil this requirement a QTSP may create a Service Policy document that contains all necessary  information (as listed in chapter 6.2 of EN 319 401) and include it as an attachment to the subscriber  agreement, as well as make it available in an electronic form (eg. PDF file) on the QTSP’s web page. The  good practice is “involving” an acceptance method, such as a mandatory acceptance box or necessity of  scrolling down and an acceptance button at the end.  In case of use of electronic communication channels, a QTSP should assure availability and integrity of the  document with its terms and conditions. In the case of qualified certificates, it should be signed with an  Advanced Electronic Signature or an Advanced Electronic Seal as specified by eIDAS Regulation.  The content of such a document should include items as specified in above mentioned standards.  EN 319 401 in chapter 6.2 defines general requirements for content of the terms and conditions  information regarding its services, that shall be available to all subscribers and relying parties. These terms  and conditions shall specify for each trust service information such as: service policy being applied,  limitations on the use of the service (e.g. lifetime of public key certificates), information for relying parties  on how to verify the trust service token, subscribers’ obligations, limitations of liability, TSP contact  information and other. Terms and conditions shall be made available through durable means of  33See Annex B [No. 27]  34See Annex B [No. 28]  35See Annex B [No. 29]  36See Annex B [No. 7]  37See Annex B [No. 56]  38See Annex B [No. 35]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  20  communication, in particular it can be transmitted electronically. These are requirements that are  independent of the type of TSP. Other standards (described below) refine and extend these requirements  as applicable to particular forms of TSP.  For certification services, there are additional conditions defined in EN 319 411-1 and -2.  For Publicly-Trusted Certificates clause 9.6.3 and 9.8 (with the exception indicated in EVCG clause 18) of  BRG should apply additionally.  For Extended Validity Certificates, EVCG clause 11.8 should apply additionally.  The terms and conditions may use the model “PKI disclosure statement” given in annex A of EN 319 411-1.  PDF/A file format is highly recommended.  The document, containing terms and conditions of a qualified trust service, should be maintained as a part  of the Documentation Management process. The process should be effective and under control.

These terms can be defined  differently depending on the type of the service.  Depending on the purpose, a “trustworthy” system or product can be made of a certified hardware  component (hardware security module) or non-certified hardware (e.g. servers) or certified or non- certified software components or combination of all the aforementioned.  In addition, general means can/should be applied to achieve “trustworthiness” of a system or product:   EN and ETSI standards,   international standards (e.g. ISO), national and industry standards,   best practises,   security evaluation and certification by an independent body,   declaration of conformity,   technical, procedural and organisational means,   hardware and software.  It is assumed that for any “trustworthy” system all basic requirements are met, in particular:   EN 319 40140 - chapter 7.4 items a) and f), 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 (for all trust service providers),   EN 319 411-141 – chapter 6.5 (additional for trust service providers issuing certificates),   EN 319 411-242 chapter 6.5 (additional for trust service providers issuing qualified certificates),   EN 319 42143 – chapter 7.6, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10 (for trust service providers issuing time stamps),   ISO/IEC 2700244 – chapter 9, 10, 12, 14, 15.  With regard to certificate management, detailed requirements for “trustworthy system” are provided in  CEN/TS 419 261.  With regard to remote (server) signature, detailed requirements for “trustworthy system” are provided in  EN 419 241-1 (under drafting).  For certification and time stamp services, with regard to (secret) key generation and storage, a trustworthy  system is a Hardware Security Module (HSM) – see EN 319 411-1 (clause 6.5.2) and  EN 319 421 (clause  7.6.2 and 7.6.3) accordingly.  40 See Annex B [No. 27]  41 See Annex B [No. 28]  42 See Annex B [No. 29]  43 See Annex B [No. 35]  44 See Annex B [No. 62]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  22  Generally, article 24.2 e covers a wide range of security management process issues. Requirements  included in European standards are additional countermeasures to well known, internationally accepted  best practices, i.e. ISO/IEC 27002.  These requirements do not relate only to trustworthy systems and products that appear in dedicated  QTSPs processes, polices, etc. (i.e. key management, certification policy, etc.), but they are also related to  supporting processes.  Therefore, it is recommended that QTSP takes into account the above mentioned requirements and  according to them develops security means and controls in the following supporting processes:   Supplier service delivery management,   System acquisition, development and maintenance management,   Communications security management,   Operations security management,   Access control management.  Additional information about supporting processes and security issues can be found in ISO/IEC 27002:2013  and ISO/IEC 20000-1:201145  With regard to technical security, hardware security modules (HSMs) are recommended, and security  certification is a common and recommended way of ensuring conformity with security requirements and  achieving \"trustworthiness\" in the context of eIDAS Regulation.  This is to be stressed, that generally a “trustworthy system” may not be limited to a HSM only.  EN 319 411-1 (clause 6.5.2) and  EN 319 421 (clause 7.6.2 and 7.6.3) mandate that for certification and  time stamp services subscribers’ and authorities’ cryptographic (private) keys are generated and stored in  a certified HSM (“trustworthy system”). The HSMs should be certified at assurance level EAL4 or higher in  accordance with ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria), ISO/IEC 19790 or FIPS 140-2 L3 (all listed by EN 319  411-1), or equivalent national or internationally recognized evaluation criteria for IT security. With the  general availability of devices which meet ISO 15408, it is expected that ISO 19790 and FIPS PUB 140-2 will  no longer be acceptable.  ENISA recommends to use Common Criteria evaluated devices, based on protection profiles delivered by  ETSI and CEN (described below), to create a presumption of compliance and ease conformity assessment.  ENISA recommends to use certified HSMs for the generation and storage of cryptographic keys and  sensitive material for any kind of trust service.  ETSI and CEN WG17 provide guidelines and Protection Profiles for certification in the series of standards  EN 419 2x1.  For certification of HSM dedicated for QTSP root certification authority operations (signing, key  generation) CEN EN 419 221-246, -347 and -448 can be applied in accordance to their purposes, or CEN EN  45 See Annex B [No. 60]  46 See Annex B [No. 14]  47 See Annex B [No. 15]  48 See Annex B [No. 16]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  23  419 221-549 (a new, generic PP for trust services), once it is finalised by CEN (at the time of this report,  works are still ongoing).  For certification of a trustworthy system / HSM for time stamp services, CEN EN 419 23150 can be applied  or CEN EN 419 221-5 (a new, generic PP for trust services), once it is finalised by CEN (for the time of this  report, works are still ongoing). Alternatively, ANSSI DCSSI-PP 2008/0751 can be used, which is currently the  only Common Criteria evaluated protection profile for a timestamping system.  It is recommended to comply with this kind of service and aim to meet requirements of art. 30 and 39 of  the eIDAS. It is expected that this will be referenced in eIDAS through the Commission Implementing  Decision \"laying down standards for the security assessment of qualified signature and seal creation  devices pursuant to Articles 30(3) and 39(2)[…]\"52and becomes obligatory in the near future.  However, at the time of writing this report, this standard has not yet been issued (works are still ongoing in  CEN)53. Until the moment CEN TS 419 241-254is available and referenced in an implementing act,  alternative standards / Protection Profiles can be used (for performing evaluation and certification of a  trustworthy system for server signature) provided they ensure a comparable security level. An example of  such a standard is Protection Profile DCSSI-PP 2008/07 issued (and certified) by ANSSI. When the  alternative standards are applied by a TSP, however, a Conformity Assessment Body and an auditor may  require additional proof of adequacy of such standards to the given purpose and/or additional security  measures might be necessary for the TSP. This may mean for example documentation describing relevance  of such standards and/or mapping of actual trustworthy system components, expert opinion, etc. Any  alternative certification scheme can only be valid if it has first been notified to the European Commission  as required by Article 30(3)(b) of the eIDAS Regulation. Some alternative methods have been already  notified55.

This article expands article 24.2.e by additional aspects concerning personal data handling. Therefore it is  recommended that all general requirements as per chapter 2.2.5 of this document are met whenever  applicable, in particular:   EN 319 40158 – chapters 7.4 – 7.9,   EN 319 411-159 – chapter 6.4.3; 6.4.6; 6.5.5; 6.5.7,   EN 319 411-260 – chapter 6.4.3; 6.4.6; 6.5.5; 6.5.7,   ISO/IEC 2700261 – chapter 9.  It should be noted that personal data is part of sensitive information a QTSP acquires during standard  operations. Personal data protection is mentioned in article 24.2.j.  Such data should be preserved for a specified period of time. This period should be determined on a GRC  (Governance, Risk, Compliance) basis. It is recommended to implement data preservation for sensitive  information according to ETSI TS 101 533-1.  ETSI TS 101 533 standard is based on TS 102 573, ISO/IEC 2700162 and ISO/IEC 27002 standards.  TS102 573 provides requirements for trust service providers in respect to the storage of data for digital  accounting. The purpose of this document is to provide a common, objective and reliable basis for  preservation service providers to implement and manage secure Data Preservation Systems, meeting the  information security related quality addressed by the EU Directive 2006/123/EC on personal data  protection (replaced in 2016 by the EU General Regulation on Data Protection, 2016/679G).

Therefore, it is recommended to follow standards and  guidelines related to these articles.  In addition, it is necessary to highlight the importance of the ISO/IEC 2700265 in this area, with respect to  information security management.  Protection against forgery and theft of data has organizational and technical aspects. Requirements within  the scope of a trustworthy system (part of technical aspect) are the same as in article 24.2.e and f. In the  field of data preservation, requirements are the same as in the article 24.2.f.  Implementation of other remaining requirements should be preceded by risk analysis. QTSP should  identify assets, vulnerabilities and countermeasures to minimalize the risk of forgery and theft. It is  recommended that this analysis is part of the whole risk management process of a QTSP organisation.  It is recommended that QTSP use recommendations from standard ISO/IEC 2700566 which is dedicated to  information security.  The catalogue of countermeasures is available as standard ISO/IEC 27002 expanded by countermeasures  derived from ETSI/CEN standards related to 24.2 clauses e) and f), in particular: ETSI EN 319 40167 clauses  7.6 and 7.7, ETSI EN 319 41168 and ETSI TS 101 53369.

Such recording may be done  electronically;  GUIDELINE  Article 24.2.h should be read together with the Article 17 4.i:  [Supervisory body]  4. For the purposes of paragraph 3 and subject to the limitations provided therein, the tasks of the  supervisory body shall include in particular:  (i) to verify the existence and correct application of provisions on termination plans in cases where the  qualified trust service provider ceases its activities, including how information is kept accessible in  accordance with point (h) of Article 24(2);  It is recommended to follow EN 319 40173 chapter 7.10 generally for any kind of (qualified) trust service.  These requirements can be met, for example, through the use of write-only media, a record of each  removable media used and the use of off-site backup.  For a TSP issuing certificates for signature and seal, clauses 6.4.5 and 6.4.6 from EN 319 411-174 and -275  are additionally applicable. There are some more requirements for qualified certificates (than for non- qualified) in this respect (see EN 319 411- chapter 6.4.5).  Some additional provisions are also given by:   EN 319 401 – clauses 7.7 e), 7.8 h) , 7.12,   EN 319 411-1 – clauses 6.2.2.l), 6.3.4.d), e), f) and h), 6.3.8 a), 6.4.5.c), 6.4.9   EN 319 411-2 clause 6.4.9 (fully refers to EN 319 411-1),  With regard to Publicly-Trusted Certificates, it is recommended to follow BRG CA/Browser Forum76 base  requirement document, chapters 5.4 and 5.5.  73 See Annex B [No. 27]  74 See Annex B [No. 28]  75 See Annex B [No. 29]  76 See Annex B [No. 7]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  30  With regard to Extended Validation Certificates, it is recommended to follow EVCG CA/Browser Forum77  chapter 15 and 17.  It is suggested to follow ETSI TS 101 533-178 for preserving records. They should be preserved for a  specified period of time, which should be determined on a GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) basis.  Keeping and preservation of the records should also be part of a TSP termination procedure. Records  should be transferred to a reliable party and this must be addressed in a TSP termination plan as per EN  419 401 chapter 7.12 item b) iii. For TSP issuing certificates, clause 6.4.9 of EN 319 411-1 should be applied  additionally. See also provisions for article 24.2. h.  Recommendations contained herein are to protect the QTSP against various claims. Keeping records in  conjunction with an internal audit programme is a countermeasure for various threats, i.e. forgery, theft,  fraud. It may also help the trusting parties to prevent the discrepancy of trusted relation.  QTSP should record and keep accessible activity-related data - issued and received - even after cessation of  a service. Partially the content of the records is mentioned in clauses 6.2.2 l, 6.3.4.e and f, 6.3.8.a, 6.4.5.c  of ETSI EN 319 411-1.  Below are examples of records:   records from the identification process,   audit logs,   records of evaluation of protections of CA, RA and Repository,   certificates and subscribers data base,   issued CRLs,   paper and electronic correspondence between QTSP and subscribers and relying parties during the  operation of certificates life cycle.  For QTSPs delivering qualified timestamping services, additional provisions are given by ETSI EN 319 421.  For other QTSPs, additional requirements depending on the type of qualified service have to be defined.

A termination plan is a document that should contain at least information on affected entities, reliable  party (parties) to which TSP obligations will be transferred, as well as a detailed procedure of notification  and transfer including a timing aspect with all affected parties taken into consideration.  Such document should be maintained as part of TSP documentation management and change  management processes, to keep them up-to-date.  According to this requirement, the document should be verified by a supervisory body.  For QTSPs delivering qualified timestamping services, additional provisions are given by ETSI EN 319 421.

Member States law based on  directive 95/46/EC is effective until May 2018. After this date QTSP should implement requirements of  regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on \"the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC\"  (General Data Protection Regulation).  The requirement of this article is related to compliance management. It is recommended that a TSP follows  EN 319 40183 chapter 7.13 provisions generally. For TSPs issuing certificates, standard EN 319 411 does not  bring additional provisions (see chapter 6.8.4 of EN 319 411-184 and -285). However the mentioned  standards do not contain detailed information on how to meet such requirement. Such (new)  requirements resulting from the introduction of \"privacy (data protection) by default\" and \"privacy (data  protection) by design\" rules will affect technical solutions. Especially systems related to trust services  provided remotely (where user authentication or personal data processing occur, for instance server  signature) will need to comply with these requirements.  The domain of data protection and privacy partially overlaps:   security,   confidentiality,   anonymity,   concepts of appropriate use,   protection of information.  So generally provisions related to security presented in earlier chapters are also applicable here (refer to  guidelines for Art. 24.2. b),e),f), g) and h)).  Based on the new General Data Protection Regulation, fundamental principles of privacy are:   Purpose limitation   Data minimisation   Data security – appropriate technical protection against unauthorised access, alteration,  destruction or disclosure   Control of the individual over his personal data:  o Right of access,  o Right to rectification,  o Right to request the deletion of personal data,  o Right to be informed about the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the  processing, etc.”  83 See Annex B [No. 27]  84 See Annex B [No. 28]  85 See Annex B [No. 29]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  35   Lawfulness of data processing  The general technical rules for products and systems are “privacy by design” and “privacy by default”.  Privacy by design means ensuring that privacy mechanisms are built in the products. Privacy by default  means that by default only necessary personal data is processed. It is therefore recommended that a  QTSP’s technical solutions (products and systems) for any services provided on-line to trust service  subscribers, provide the following key features (whenever applicable):   identification and authentication of parties,   explicit user consent,   selective disclosure and data minimisation,   secure storage and transfer,   user control,   anonymity and pseudonymity.  In respect to trust services delivered on-line (for example server signature), user authentication concerns  processing of only adequate identification data, relevant but not excessive to grant access to that service  online.  There are various technologies available, which would help process personal data according to data  protection rules. A set of privacy and data protection related standards/reports is under development by  European Standard Organisations86 as a part of mandate M/53087. These documents are meant to address  privacy management in the design and development and in the production and service provision processes  of security technologies, as well as provide practical guidelines for implementation. However, this is  beyond the scope of this guideline. It is simply suggested that the reader familiarises himself with these  standards (once published in the future) and assess the impact to the TSP activities and their related ICT  systems.  In addition, it is worth mentioning, that a new version of EN 419 212 standard (related to smart cards /  secure element based technology for signature and strong authentication) has been adopted, where its  Part 4 provides a set of privacy-oriented protocols that could be used to build (privacy protecting) user  authentication solutions.

The revocation shall  become effective immediately upon its publication.]  4. With regard to paragraph 3, qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates shall provide to  any relying party information on the validity or revocation status of qualified certificates issued by them.  This information shall be made available at least on a per certificate basis at any time and beyond the  validity period of the certificate in an automated manner that is reliable, free of charge and efficient.  GUIDELINE  These articles are related to operating and maintaining a certificate database and in particular to  revocation management and revocation status services described (in particular) in:   ETSI EN 319 411-194 chapters 6.3.9 and 6.3.10,   ETSI EN 319 411-295 chapters 6.3.9 and 6.3.10.  For Organizational Validation Certificates and Domain Validation Certificates clause 4.10.2 of BRG  CA/Browser Forum applies additionally.  For Extender Validation Certificates clause 13 EVCG CA/Browser Forum96 applies additionally.  For Publicly-Trusted Certificates, Clause 4.9 of the BRG CA/Browser Forum97 applies additionally.  It is believed that EN 319 411-2 does not yet include sufficient provisions with regard to the CRL and OCSP  profile and creation process in order to meet the requirements of these articles. ETSI is working on further  requirements to be included in a revised version of EN 319 411-2 for the use of CRL and OCSP beyond the  certificate validity period.  Generally, validity and revocation status information should be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per  week.  In case of failure, TSP should endeavour to ensure that this information service is not unavailable  for longer than a maximum period of time as denoted in the Certification Practise Statement.  Two methods of providing validity and revocation status are the most popular: through a Certificate  Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Use of OCSP is recommended.  In case both methods are supported by a TSP, the information provided by all services should be consistent  over time, different delays in updating the status information for all these methods should be taken into  account. An exception to this is when an OCSP responder can answer with status ‘unknown’ if the  certificate has not been issued legitimately by the QTSP.  94 See Annex B [No. 28]  95 See Annex B [No. 29]  96 See Annex B [No. 56]  97 See Annex B [No. 7]  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  39  Availability of certificate revocation information is crucial. QTSP should assure practically continuous  access to this information. Therefore, QTSP should identify assets, vulnerabilities and countermeasures to  minimalize risk of loss of availability. It is recommended these aspects are included in a global risk  management process, and ISO/IEC 2700598 is suggested here.

Qualified certificates for electronic signatures and for electronic seals  This chapter concerns specific requirements in relation to qualified certificates for electronic signatures  and qualified electronic seals.  ‘Electronic signature’ means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other  data in electronic form (e.g. a document), and which is used by the signatory to sign, whereas ‘electronic  seal’ is to ensure the origin and integrity of \"other\" electronic data (e.g. a document).  Qualified electronic signature (QES) is a particular kind of electronic signature. QES is an advanced  electronic signature that meets requirements of eIDAS Regulation Art. 26. QES is created using a qualified  electronic signature creation device (QSCD) and is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signature  (QC). Requirements for QC are laid down in eIDAS Regulation Annex I and for QSCD in Annex II.  Qualified electronic seal (QESeal) is an advanced electronic seal that meets requirements laid down in  eIDAS Regulation Art. 36 and created using a qualified electronic seal creation device. QESeal is based on a  qualified certificate for electronic seals. Requirements for a qualified certificate for electronic seals are laid  down in eIDAS Regulation Annex III. Requirements for a qualified electronic seal creation device are the  same as for QSCD.  3.1  Articles 28.1, 2, 3 and 38.1, 2, 3  CONTENT  28.1. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex I.  28.2. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall not be subject to any mandatory requirement  exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex I.  28.3. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures may include non-mandatory additional specific  attributes. Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition of qualified electronic  signatures.  38.1. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex III.  38.2. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall not be subject to any mandatory requirements  exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex III.  38.3. Qualified certificates for electronic seals may include non-mandatory additional specific attributes.  Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition of qualified electronic seals.  GUIDELINE  Requirements set out by these articles apply to TSPs issuing qualified certificates for signatures (which are  used by a signatory to sign, for instance a contract) and seals (which confirm origin and integrity of other  data, for instance a document). These requirements concern the content of the certificates.  Annex I and III of the eIDAS Regulation contain detailed requirements for certificate content. A QTSP  issuing qualified certificates should prepare a certificate profile for this purpose. The Regulation mandates  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  41  only information listed in Annex I and Annex III to be present, but other information can be added by a  QTSP.  It is recommended to follow:   ETSI EN 319 412-1101 (general provisions),   ETSI EN 319 412-2102 (certificates for natural persons),   ETSI EN 319 412-3103 (certificates for legal persons),   ETSI EN 319 412-5 (indication that a certificate is qualified)104   ETSI EN 319 411-1105 chapter 6.6.1,   ETSI EN 319 411-2106 chapter 6.6.1 (fully refers to ETSI EN 319 411-1),  All the certificate profiles specified in ETSI EN 319 412 series are based upon IETF RFC 5280107 for generic  profiling of Recommendation ITU-T X.509 | ISO/IEC 9594-8. The certificate profiles specify profiles for both  EU Qualified and non-qualified certificates as relevant. Reference is made to ETSI EN 319 412-5108 for  requirements relating to “QCStatement”. QTSP using ITU-T X.509 should ensure that corrigendum 1109 and  2110are applied to base standard.  Implementing additional attributes should be developed according to the same rules. During development  of additional fields in certificate structure TSP may use ETSI EN 319 412 -1 standard. Introduction of  additional (non-mandatory) attributes should not affect mandatory interoperability. Examples of  additional (non-mandatory) attributes are:   Organizational Unit,   State or Province Name,   Locality,   Title.

TSP should conduct risk analysis to recognize all potential activities which can lead to reinstating a revoked  certificate, for example restoring from backup. After the identification of potential threats appropriate  countermeasures should be taken. A suggested solution is to choose an appropriate technology which  prevents reinstating revoked certificates.  Before a TSP issues a certificate, some obligation should be accepted by the subject and/or subscriber. One  of them is not to create any electronic signature with the private key if the certificate has been revoked.  The TSP should revoke certificates in a timely manner based on authorized and validated certificate  revocation requests mentioned in EN 319 411-1 and -2, chapter 6.2.4.

GUIDELINE  Requirement applies only to a TSP issuing qualified certificates.  Since certificate suspension is subject to national regulation, it may vary between Member States. A TSP  should perform a compliance management process to ensure compliance to local regulation of the  Member state in which it is granted the qualified status.  If suspension is allowed in a Member State, it is recommended to follow the provisions of:   EN 319411-1116 chapters 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10,   EN 319411-2117 chapters 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10.  Generally, it is recommended to meet requirements and apply standards as defined for certificate  revocation and validity status in reference to articles 24.3 and 24.4 (refer to this document).  If Certificate Revocation Lists are used, they should be as defined in Recommendation ITU-T X.509 |  ISO/IEC 9594-8 or IETF RFC 5280118.

Requirements for the validation of qualified electronic signatures  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs providing validation service of qualified electronic signatures.  Validation of qualified electronic signature is the process of verifying and confirming that a qualified  electronic signature is valid. Requirements for validation service of qualified electronic signature are laid  down in article 32 of eIDAS Regulation.  Validity of the signature is essential for electronic transactions and allows any relying party to trust signed  data and documents. Validation service provided to the relying parties shall be secure and based on  standards.  4.1  Article 32.1  CONTENT  1. The process for the validation of a qualified electronic signature shall confirm the validity of a qualified  electronic signature provided that:  (a) the certificate that supports the signature was, at the time of signing, a qualified certificate for  electronic signature complying with Annex I;  (b) the qualified certificate was issued by a qualified trust service provider and was valid at the time of  signing;  (c) the signature validation data corresponds to the data provided to the relying party;  (d) the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is correctly provided to the relying  party;  (e) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated to the relying party if a pseudonym was used at the time  of signing;  (f) the electronic signature was created by a qualified electronic signature creation device;  (g) the integrity of the signed data has not been compromised;  (h) the requirements provided for in Article 26 were met at the time of signing.  GUIDELINE  According to eIDAS Regulation validation means the process of verifying and confirming that an electronic  signature or a seal is valid. Validation process of a qualified electronic signatures is not yet specified by  published standards. Recommendations bellow are based on draft version of ETSI TS 119 172-4124. An  important part in guidance for a qualified validation services is ETSI EN319 102-1125 clause 5 which contains  basic requirements and rules for an electronic signature validation. It is important to note that  124 See Annex B [No. 53]  125 See Annex B [No. 18]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31910201/01.01.01_60/en_31910201v010101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  47  indeterminate results exceeding requirements of the Regulation do not have to be part of a verification  report.  All requirements laid down in the regulation for qualified validation of qualified electronic signatures are  explained below respectively to each requirement “a” to “h”.  4.1.1 Article 32.1.a, b and f  The certificate validity status of the certificates must be verified during the certificate path validation  process (ETSI EN 319 102-1 and IETF RFC 5280), for all certificate types (e.g. certificates issued to signer, to  CAs, to OCSP responders, to CRL Issuers, to Time-Stamping Units) and either OCSP or CRL checks must  be  carried out.  According to the European Commission Implementing Decision (CID)  (EU) 2015/1505126, Trusted Lists are  the single formal way to verify that a claimed qualified trust service is indeed granted a qualified status.  The validation procedure must verify that the qualified certificate was issued by a qualified trust service  provider by verifying its status on a Trusted List. Moreover, compliance with Annex A.1 ETSI 319 412-5127  should be assessed.  4.1.2 Article 32.1.c, d and e  This information should be provided as part of the validation report in the validation process:   All supported (in Certification Policy) formats (XAdES, CAdES, PAdES, ASiC), which are mentioned in EU  2015/1505 should be correctly validated.   A signing certificate should be included in a validation report   Since indication of the use of a pseudonym is included in the Subject field of the certificate, it has to  appear also in the validation report  More details can be found in ETSI TS 319 102, clause 5.1.3128 - Status indication of the signature validation  process and signature validation report in table 5 and 6.  4.1.3 Article 32.1.g and h  The integrity of the signed data is checked by performing cryptographic verifications and guaranteed by a  supported signature validation model which depends on the TSP. Validation service procedures for  establishing whether an electronic signature or electronic seal is technically valid should rely on the  process described in ETSI TS 319 102, especially clause 5.1.3 where one can find a description of a  validation signature model, basic building blocks  that are useable in the signature validation process for  126 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015D1505&from=en  127See Annex B [No. 34]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941205/02.01.01_60/en_31941205v020101p.pdf  128Status indication of the signature validation process and signature validation report in table 5 and 6, page  30  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  48  basic signatures, for time-stamps and for signatures with time and signatures with long-term or archival  validation data.

The system used for validating the qualified electronic signature should provide to the relying party the  correct result of the validation process and should allow the relying party to detect any security relevant  issues.  GUIDELINE  A system used for validation of qualified signatures should be reliable and consist of technically evaluated  security products protected against unauthorized modifications.  To provide the correct result of the signature validation process to the relying party, the validation report  should be done by a validation service in the correct format – for example when a human user is involved,  the report is presented in a way meaningful to the user – human readable form (PDF).  Elements, mentioned below, should be presented in a legible way to the verifier:  a) The  text or a similar indication of the scope of the validation executed on the validated signature:  According to draft version of ETSI TS 119 172-4130 it could be for example:  Signature validation policy for European qualified electronic signatures/seals using trusted lists  Validation of digital signature to identify whether it can be considered as a European qualified  electronic signature/seal using EUMS trusted lists in the sense of the applicable European  legislation at the time of signing, i.e. either Directive 1999/93/EC or Regulation (EU) No 910/2014;  b) the complete set of data representing the signer in its certificate,  c) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated if a pseudonym was used at the time of signing;  d) the time reference against which the results of the signature validation procedure are provided  (i.e. “time of signing”)  a. If a valid qualified timestamp is present, then the time reference can be taken from this  timestamp;  b. If no timestamp is present, then the time reference is the time of the validation;  c. If a non-qualified timestamp is present, then the QTSP must define in its validation policy  what is the time reference in this case.  e) the presentation of the data that has been covered by the signature (signed data),  f) any signature attributes that have been included in the signature (signed and not signed  attributes),  g) the overall status of the signature validation according to ETSI EN 319 102-1131  . Information  related to cryptographic suites used to generate the signature being validated and potential  security related issues against either national rules or ETSI TS 119 312132,  h) the detailed outcome of each validation step.  Additionally, for better understanding ETSI TS 119 101 V1.1.1 should be followed, in particular:   main validation functionalities (as specified in clause 8.2.2);   validation process rules enforcement (as specified in clause 8.2.3);   validation policy (as specified in clause 8.2.4);  130 See Annex B [No. 53]  131 See Annex B [No. 18]  132 See Annex B [No. 54]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119300_119399/119312/01.01.01_60/ts_119312v010101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  50   validation user interface (as specified in clause 8.2.5); and   validation input/output relative conformance (correctness of the implemented validation  procedure) (as specified in clause 8.2.6).

Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs providing qualified validation service for qualified electronic  signatures. Requirements for TSP’s providing validation are covered in the previous chapter. Here special  requirements convenient for qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures are listed.  5.1 Article 33  CONTENT  A qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a qualified trust  service provider who:  (a) provides validation in compliance with Article 32(1); and  (b) allows relying parties to receive the result of the validation process in an automated manner, which is  reliable, efficient and bears the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the provider of  the qualified validation service.  GUIDELINE  There are several options and possibilities for QTSPs to provide validation services. The selection of these  options is driven by a specific policy of the QTSP. Additionally, legal requirements can be provided through  specific policies, e.g. in the context of qualified electronic signatures as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.  Besides there are some additional requirements mentioned below:   Art.33.1(a) with regard to the validation process to be provided in compliance with Art.32.1.  (aligned(a) to (h)).   Art.33.1(b) for the provision of the validation result in an automated manner that needs:  o to provide to the relying party the correct result of the validation process and should allow  the relying party to detect any security relevant issues (in conjunction of Art.32.2);  o to be reliable and efficient; and  o to bear the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the QTSP  providing the qualified validation service.  All these elements are part of audit activities under the compliance management process.  To assure that the result of the validation process is reliable and efficient, it should be taken into  consideration to build and deploy a redundant system designed and maintained on actual requirements  concerning the availability of validation service. Requirements for redundancy should be derived from  actual regulations, incident reviews and identified risks. Besides that, the QTSP should provide a  comprehensive report of validation with all details obtained during the validation process for instance:   status indicator of the results of validation process;   indicator of the policy against which signature/seal has been validated;   time and date for which the validation status and validation data was determined or;   status of validation process  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  52  Additionally, to assure that response is reliable, QTSP should sign or seal responses with a valid advanced  electronic signature or seal.  Guidance for authorized responses can be found in clause 4.2.2.2 of the RFC  6960134. Response should be signed or sealed with keys listed on the European Union Member State  trusted list, or issued by a Certification Authority listed on the European Union Member State trusted list.

Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures and  seals  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs providing qualified preservation service for qualified  electronic signatures and TSPs providing qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals.  Requirements for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures is laid down in Article 34  of eIDAS Regulation. Requirements for a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals are laid  down in Article 40 of eIDAS Regulation.  The purpose of a preservation trust service is to ensure the legal validity of electronic signatures and  electronic seals over extended periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of  future technological changes.  6.1 Articles 34 and 40  CONTENT  [Article 34]  1. A qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a qualified  trust service provider that uses procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of  the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological validity period.  [Article 40]  Article[s 32, 33 and] 34 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the validation and preservation of qualified  electronic seals.  GUIDELINE  Requirements for QTSPs providing preservation services for qualified signature (and seals) are these  applicable to all TSPs/QTSPs, amended with the requirements laid down in the art. 34.  According to European Commission “Questions & Answers on Trust Services under eIDAS”137, the eIDAS  Regulation sets rules for the preservation of eSignatures, eSeals or certificates related to trust services.  Preservation is different from electronic archiving (which is not a trust service under eIDAS). The objectives  and targets of the process will make a distinction between the two activities:   preservation under eIDAS aims at guaranteeing the trustworthiness of a qualified electronic  signature or qualified electronic seal through time. The technology underpinning such trust service  therefore targets the electronic signature or seal;   Electronic archiving aims at ensuring that a document is stored in order to guarantee its integrity  (and other legal features). The technology underpinning electronic archiving therefore targets the  document. Electronic archiving remains the competence of Member States.  137https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/questions-answers-trust-services-under-eidas  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  54  Whilst document integrity is not part of the legal requirements of the regulation some technologies  covered in the regulation, such as time-stamping, are applicable to the preservation of the integrity of  archived document as for preservation of electronic signatures. ETSI is working on the development of  standards in this area.  It is recommended that QTSP use technologies and procedures to create a Long Time Validation form of a  AdES signature138. The archive form of the signature should be prepared according to an appropriate ETSI  standard listed below (XAdES, CAdES, PAdES), respectively to chosen format of the signature. Systems and  polices should be prepared accordingly to respective standards listed below.  Whilst XAdES, CAdES, PAdES have a role to play in signature preservation, it is important to note the  ongoing standardisation in ETSI relating to signature and document preservation and use of standards such  as defined in RFC 4998, TS 101 533 as well upcoming standards in this area.

Requirements for the qualified electronic time stamp  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs issuing qualified electronic time stamps.  The purpose of an electronic time stamp is to provide evidence of data existing at a particular point in  time. A time stamp binds the stamped data to a particular time and protects its integrity. Time stamps are  issued by a time stamping trust service provided by TSP.  A Qualified electronic time stamp is a time stamp issued by qualified trust service provider and meets  requirements laid down in eIDAS Regulation Article 42. A Qualified time stamp enjoys legal presumption of  the accuracy of the date, the time and presumption of the integrity of stamped data from the time of  stamping.  7.1 Article 42  CONTENT  1. A qualified electronic time stamp shall meet the following requirements:  (a) it binds the date and time to data in such a manner as to reasonably preclude the possibility of the data  being changed undetectably;  (b) it is based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated Universal Time; and  (c) it is signed using an advanced electronic signature or sealed with an advanced electronic seal of the  qualified trust service provider, or by some equivalent method.  GUIDELINE  There are a few basic standards defining requirements for binding of date and time and for accurate time  sources:   ETSI EN 319 421148- Policy and Security Requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing Electronic  Time-Stamps   ETSI EN 319 422149- Time-stamping protocol and electronic time-stamp profiles   CEN EN 419 231150 - Protection profile for trustworthy systems supporting time stamping  To fulfil all requirements, it is necessary to consider general TSP standards:   ETSI EN 319 401151 - General Policy Requirements for Trust Service Providers   ETSI TS 119 312152 - Cryptographic Suites  148 See Annex B [No. 35]  149 See Annex B [No. 39]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/319422/01.01.01_60/en_319422v010101p.pdf  150 See Annex B [No. 9]  151 See Annex B [No. 27]  152 See Annex B [No. 54]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119300_119399/119312/01.01.01_60/ts_119312v010101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  57  A Qualified Trust Service Provider providing qualified time-stamping service (QTSA) has responsibility for  the provision of the time-stamping services and time stamping management. The QTSA has responsibility  for the operation of one or more units which creates and signs on behalf of the QTSA. These units should  be trustworthy using:  a) requirements for trustworthy systems EN 319 401 clauses clause  7.4 items a) and f), 7.5, 7.6, 7.7  and 7.8 and EN 319 421 clause 7.6.2 and 7.6.3, or  b) commonly recognised or standardized Protection Profile conforming to ISO/IEC 15408, such as in  CEN TS 419 231  ANSSI DCSSI-PP 2008/07 is currently the only Common Criteria evaluated protection profile for a  timestamping system, but CEN EN 419 231 is planned to supersede it when it is published.  A QTSA is a trust service provider as described in ETSI EN 319 401 which issues time stamps and fulfils all  obligations of Qualified Trust Service Provider laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  The QTSA should establish and make available to subscribers and relying parties the time stamp policy and  include the identifier for the policy in each issued time stamp. The following requirements should be  fulfilled:  a) The QTSA should maintain and protect all time signing systems in a secure zone.  b) The QTSA should configure all time signing systems by removing or disabling all accounts,  applications, services, protocols, and ports that are not used in the QTSA's operations.  c) Only trusted parties should access secure zones and high security zones.  According to ETSI EN 319 421 the policy should specify:  a) at least one hashing algorithm used to represent the datum being time-stamped;  b) the accuracy of the time in the time-stamps with respect to UTC;  c) any limitations on the use of the time-stamping service;  d) the subscriber's obligations, if any;  e) the relying party's obligations;  f) information on how to verify the time-stamp such that the relying party is considered to  \"reasonably rely\" on the time-stamp and any possible limitations on the validity period; and  g) any claim to meet the requirements on time-stamping services under national law.  To fulfil obligations laid down in eIDAS Regulation 42 (1.a) some obligations to the relying party are  needed. Basing on ETSI EN 319 421 these obligations are:  a) verify that the time-stamp has been correctly signed and that the private key used to sign the  time-stamp has not been compromised up to the time of the verification;  b) take into account any limitations on the usage of the time-stamp indicated by the time-stamp  policy; and  c) take into account any other precautions prescribed in agreements or elsewhere.  According to ETSI EN 319 421 QTSA operates units creating Time Stamps, the following requirements  apply:  a) The generation of signing key(s) should be undertaken in a physically secured environment by  personnel in trusted roles under, at least, dual control. The personnel authorized to carry out this  function should be limited to those required to do so under the QTSA's practices.  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  58  b) The generation of signing key(s) should be carried out within a secure cryptographic device which  is a trustworthy system which:  o is assured to EAL 4 or higher in accordance with ISO/IEC 15408153, or equivalent national or  internationally recognized evaluation criteria for IT security. If standard specifying  common criteria protection profiles CEN TS 419 221-2,3,4,5 is published, this protection  profile should be used as an evaluation criteria  o alternatively, meets the requirements identified in ISO/IEC 19790154 or FIPS PUB 140-2155,  level 3.  c) The key generation algorithm, the resulting signing key length and signature algorithm used for  signing time-stamps key should be as specified in ETSI TS 119 312.  d) A signing key should not be imported into different cryptographic modules.  e) If there are same keys in different cryptographic modules, they should be associated with the  same public key certificate into all the different cryptographic modules.  f) One time signing unit should have a single time-stamp signing key active at a time.  The time signing unit private keys should remain confidential and their integrity should be maintained. The  private signing key should be held and used within a cryptographic module which compels the same  evaluation criteria as unit used for the generation of signing keys. CEN EN 419 231 may establish additional  requirements for private key protection.  Time-stamps should conform to the time-stamp profile as defined in ETSI EN 319 422.  The time-stamps should be issued securely and should include the correct time. Detailed requirements for  time-stamp issuance are defined in ETSI EN 319 421 chapter 7.7.1.  QTSA is responsible for logging all events identified in ETSI EN 319 401. In addition, the following records  should be logged:  a) Records concerning all events relating to the life-cycle of time signing keys.  b) Records concerning all events relating to the life-cycle of time stamp certificates.  c) Records concerning all events relating to synchronization of a time signing system clock to UTC  (concerning normal re-calibration or synchronization of clocks used in time-stamping).  d) Records concerning all events relating to detection of loss of synchronization.  For all QTSA Qualified Time Stamps, signature verification (public) key certificate should be issued by a  certification authority fulfilling general requirementsof QTSPs. The relying party is expected to use a  Trusted List to establish whether the time-stamp unit and the timestamp are qualified. If the public key of  the time stamping service is listed in the Trusted List and the service it represents is a qualified time- stamping service, or Certification Authority is listed in the Trusted List, representing a qualified time- stamping service then the time-stamps issued by this TSU can be considered as qualified.  153See Annex B [No. 58]  154See Annex {No. 59]  ISO/IEC 19790:2012 the security requirements for a cryptographic module utilised within a security system protecting  sensitive information in computer and telecommunication systems, defines four security levels for cryptographic  modules.  155FIPS PUB 140-2is a National Institute of Standards and Technology standard, and it specifies the security  requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive  but unclassified information, it also defines four security levels for cryptographic modules.  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  59  The QC Statement \"esi4-qtstStatement-1\" as defined in ETSI EN 319 422, can be used as an indication that  the TSP claims the time-stamp to be a qualified electronic time-stamp.  According to ETSI EN 319 422, some requirements to Time Stamp Profile and Protocol should be placed:  a) A time-stamping server should support the time-stamping request and response as defined in IETF  RFC 3161156, clause 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 with the amendments defined in the following clauses.  b) Hash algorithms for the time-stamp data to be supported should be as specified in clause A.8 of  ETSI TS 119 312  c) Certificate used for the time stamp verification should meet the requirements defined in ETSI EN  319 412-2157 for the QTSA being a natural person or defined in ETSI EN 319 412-3158 for the QTSA  being a legal person with the amendments defined in the following clauses.  Trust Service Providers have certain responsibilities with regard to the algorithms they are using.  Although  any transition between algorithms is predominantly the work to be done by supervisory body, the  following approach should be taken by TSPs:   TSP shall actively seek cooperation with their users (especially public administration) with regard  to transition between algorithms. Sufficient advice and timely warning shall be offered to all, not  only customers but also relying parties.   TSP shall encourage the specification, spread of knowledge and implementation of appropriate  procedures.   TSP shall plan ahead conservation solutions and updates in SCVA due  to the changes of  cryptographic suites, algorithm breaks or other vulnerabilities.   TSP shall adapt in advance their own libraries and SCVA offered in their products. If TSP is not a  developer than at least contact and incitement for changes is necessary. As much as possible they  should assist also 3rd party developers helping them to prepare for change of algorithms in  signatures and certificates.   Change of algorithms should not economically hamper subscribers of trusted services. TSP shall  handle change of algorithms without requesting customer to pay for new cards or certificates.   In case of possible break of algorithms TSP shall inform publicly in plain language (not  cryptographic slang) what and how to do to preserve electronically signed/sealed documents,  avoid exploit and attacks etc.   Exploiting economically cryptography techniques in your products requires responsibility for all  users. TSP are responsible for development of knowledge on relying party systems and what  resources may be affected with cryptographic changes.

Requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services  This chapter concerns requirements for qualified electronic registered delivery services laid down in Article  44 of the eIDAS Regulation.  Qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS) is a service provided by a qualified trust service  provider (QTSP). QERDS securely transmits documents and data between third parties by electronic  means. QERDS may use other QERDS services to transfer data from the sender to addressee. QERDS  provides evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending and  receiving the data. QERDS protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any  unauthorised alterations. QERDS identifies both sender and addressee of the data.  8.1 Article 44  CONTENT  1. Qualified electronic registered delivery services shall meet the following requirements:  (a) they are provided by one or more qualified trust service provider(s);  (b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  (c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  (d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic signature or an advanced  electronic seal of a qualified trust service provider in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the  data being changed undetectably;  (e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data is clearly indicated to  the sender and addressee of the data;  (f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by a qualified electronic  time stamp.  In the event of the data being transferred between two or more qualified trust service providers, the  requirements in points (a) to (f) shall apply to all the qualified trust service providers.  GUIDELINE  All expected standards regarding qualified electronic registered delivery services have not yet been  completed nor published. There are more gaps in this area than answers laid down in standards. ETSI ESI  has started work on the development of standards for supporting qualified and non qualified electronic  registered delivery services as defined in the eIDAS (they will be the ETSI EN 319 522, ETSI EN 319 532, ETSI  EN 319 521, and ETSI EN 319 531, see the list of standards at the end of this clause and Annex B for further  details). This effort also targets at supporting conformance and interoperability tests (ETSI TS 119 524 and  ETSI TS 119 534).  This guideline in some parts is based on trust application building experience and should be reviewed and  updated after the publication of such relevant standards. Some security recommendations provided below  for qualified registered electronic delivery service are based on standards developed for business data  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  62  exchange. These standards are the ETSI TS 102 640REM163, OASIS AS4 Profile of ebMS 3.0 Version 1.0164  and OASIS ebXML Messaging Services Version 3.0165.  Art. 44 of the eIDAS Regulation requires the following on qualified electronic registered delivery services:  a) they are provided by one or more qualified trust service provider(s);  This point is not addressed in the standards. ETSI TS 102 640REM is not applicable in the context of eIDAS  Article 44.  The boundaries of qualified electronic registered delivery service are established by a network of qualified  trust service providers. QTSP should manage these relationships, and confirm that all “qualified electronic  delivery network” is based on qualified trust service providers. Recognition of qualified trust service  providers shall be based on Trust Lists.  Aspects covered in this chapter are part of the Service Level Agreement between trust service providers  and business continuity management.  According to ETSI TS 102 640166, some other (not qualified nor trusted) services can be involved in a  qualified electronic delivery process, for example:   notification of incoming delivery can be forwardFencryed via SMS/GSM network,   documents can be forwarded by a non-qualified service after delivery confirmation,   documents from non-qualified services origin delivered via a qualified electronic registered  delivery service.  In the event of the data being transferred between two or more qualified trust service providers, the  requirement in points (a) to (f) should apply to all the qualified trust service providers.  b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  Regarding the ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 standard, the choice of the authentication mechanism is left to the  trust service provider. Specific requirements must hence be specified in standards to reflect those in the  eIDAS Regulation.  163REM Registered Electronic Mail – standard based on e-mail protocols for Registered Electronic Delivery established  by e-Sens (https://www.esens.eu) project.  164 See Annex B [No. 69]  http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/profiles/AS4-profile/v1.0/os/AS4-profile-v1.0-os.html  165 See Annex B [No. 68]  https://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/core/cs02/ebms_core-3.0-spec-cs-02.html  166See Annex B [No. 46-50]  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264002/02.01.01_60/ts_10264002v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264003/02.01.01_60/ts_10264003v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264004/02.01.01_60/ts_10264004v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264005/02.01.01_60/ts_10264005v020101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264001/02.01.01_60/ts_10264001v020101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264002/02.01.01_60/ts_10264002v020101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264003/02.01.01_60/ts_10264003v020101p.pdf http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10264004/02.01.01_60/ts_10264004v020101p.pdf  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  63  The Regulation defined Electronic Identification and Electronic Identification means, as part of the notified  European network allowing common recognition of personal identification. The Regulation also defined  levels of assurance of Electronic Identification means. If a qualified electronic registered delivery service  uses an external electronic identification scheme/service for the identification of the sender this external  system shall guarantee a high level of confidence of electronic identification. Identification scheme/service  should be notified167 or recognised on national level.  The identification of the sender should meet the requirements according to Art. 24.1. The authentication  of a previously identified sender shall meet the requirements with regard to the authentication  mechanisms for assurance level substantial.  Identification of the sender may be based on an advanced electronic signature of the sender. There are a  few options available to achieve such a high level of confidence:   a qualified electronic signature based on a qualified certificate of the sender;   an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate of the sender;   an advance electronic signature based on an issued non-qualified certificate.  If an advanced electronic signature meets points 1 or 2, it may be assumed that the required high level of  confidence of the identification of the sender is fulfilled. If an advanced electronic signature (point 3) is  based on another certificate then qualified, additional risk evaluation should be performed and the  qualified trust service policy should specify how such a requirement of a high level of confidence of the  identification can be fulfilled.  Identification of the sender can also be done by another non-electronic way, for example in person. The  procedure for verification of identity should be described in the policy and meet the high level of  confidence requirement.  c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  If qualified electronic delivery services are based on ETSI EN 319 532 under development (that evolve ETSI  TS 102 640 REM specifications to fit within the framework  of standards for supporting eIDAS),  identification of the recipient is part of the REM protocolThe Regulation requires identification of the  addressee and grants presumption of the identified addressee. For consistence with other trust services, it  is recommended that the identification of the addressee meets the requirements according to Art. 24.1.  The identification and subsequent authentications of the sender should at least meet the requirements of  level “substantial” according to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502. The authentication  of a previously identified addressee shall meet the requirements with  regard to the authentication  mechanisms for assurance level “substantial”.A Qualified Trusted Service provider should establish and  disseminate a trust service policy revealing how proof of receiving the data is confirmed. Some systems  can be based on a verification of delivery receipt and verification of an electronic signature or an electronic  seal of the recipient. It is a good practice to rely on qualified certificates verified through Trusted Lists, but  also Qualified Trust Service provider can establish alternative trust points based on risk analysis and  acceptance.  167eIDAS Article 9  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  64  It is important to mention that delivery of the data can be available to the recipient only after his proper  identification. If this process is based on an advanced electronic signature, the signature verification should  precede the delivery (availability) of the sent data.  If identification of the recipient is based on the identification process, it is highly recommended to conduct  the whole process in a secured and controlled environment of the qualified trust service provider. All  evidence of identification and delivery process should be gathered and protected.  Regarding eIDAS Regulation article 3 (36) electronic registered delivery service provides the proof of  sending the data and protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage and any  unauthorized alternations. Identification and authentication of the recipient is part of countersigns against  loss and theft of the delivered data. It is good practice to use end-to-end encryption from the sender to the  recipient to ensure confidentiality of the message payload so that only the intended recipient can access it.  Evidence of identification process should be collected and secured for the appropriate time. This time  should be established and described in the service policy.  d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic signature or an  advanced electronic seal of a qualified trust service provider in such a manner as to preclude  the possibility of the data being changed undetectably;  The QTSA is responsible for the operation of one or more units which creates and signs/seals on behalf of  the QTSA the delivered data. Basing on ETSI TS 102 640, an advanced electronic signature or an advanced  electronic seal should be created via a Secure Signature Creation Device..  It is good practice to make the data available to the sender signed/sealed by QTSP. The data should be  secured by a signature/seal placed on the proof of sending, while ensuring the sent data is integrally linked  to this proof.  The certificate allowing verification of an advanced electronic signature or an advanced electronic seal  should be verifiable via a Trust Service List.  e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data is clearly  indicated to the sender and addressee of the data;  The best practice is to deliver exactly the same data that was sent, but for interoperability reasons it may  be necessary to alter it. If data is altered, information about this should be revealed to both, the sender  and the recipient..  Indication about altered data should be part of the delivery process and should be available to the  recipient before receiving the confirmation of proof of delivery. Proof of delivery should link in an  integrated way the finally delivered data with the identification means of addressee and time of delivery.  f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by a qualified  electronic time stamp.  Proof of sending and proof of receiving should be integrally linked to sent/delivered data and time  stamped by a qualified time stamp. Qualified time stamp requirements are part of the previous chapter.  Future ETSI standardisation work on electronic registered delivery services will have leverage over the  existing multipart TS 102 640 series addressing standardisation of registered electronic mail (REM) and  align these specifications to the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Effective production of such REM  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  65  specifications and more general specifications addressing all other types of electronic registered delivery  services has not been planned yet.  The standards could be used as a basis for a technical definition of the qualified electronic registered  delivery services, under additional requirements (service profiles) covering the above elements. For  instance, the requirement that sent data must be signed/sealed according to (d).

Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication  This chapter concerns requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates for website authentication  (QCWA). Requirements for a qualified certificate for website authentication are laid down in Article 45 of  the eIDAS Regulation.  QCWA is a certificate for website authentication, which is issued by a qualified trust service provider  (QTSP). Requirements for QCWA are laid down in Annex IV of the eIDAS Regulation.  The purpose of certificates for website authentication is providing an attested link to natural or legal  person for whom the certificate was issued and to make it possible to authenticate and link a website to a  user. Website authentication certificates are in common use, and are the common used safeguard against  on-line service threats.  9.1 Article 45  CONTENT  1.Qualified certificates for website authentication shall meet the requirements laid down in Annex IV:  Annex IV:  Qualified certificates for website authentication shall contain:  (a) an indication, at least in a form suitable for automated processing, that the certificate has been issued  as a qualified certificate for website authentication;  (b) a set of data unambiguously representing the qualified trust service provider issuing the qualified  certificates including at least the Member State in which that provider is established and: — for a legal  person: the name and, where applicable, registration number as stated in the official records, — for a  natural person: the person’s name;  (c) for natural persons: at least the name of the person to whom the certificate has been issued, or a  pseudonym. If a pseudonym is used, it shall be clearly indicated; for legal persons: at least the name of the  legal person to whom the certificate is issued and, where applicable, registration number as stated in the  official records;  (d) elements of the address, including at least city and State, of the natural or legal person to whom the  certificate is issued and, where applicable, as stated in the official records;  (e) the domain name(s) operated by the natural or legal person to whom the certificate is issued;  (f) details of the beginning and end of the certificate’s period of validity;  (g) the certificate identity code, which must be unique for the qualified trust service provider;  (h) the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service  provider;  (i) the location where the certificate supporting the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic  seal referred to in point  Recommendations for QTSPs based on Standards  December 2017  67  (h) is available free of charge;  (j) the location of the certificate validity status services that can be used to enquire as to the validity status  of the qualified certificate.  GUIDELINE  These requirements apply to a TSP issuing qualified certificates for website authentication only.  QTSP issuing qualified certificates for website authentication should prepare a certificate profile for this  purpose. When certificates are issued as EU Qualified Certificates, they should include QCStatements. A  QCStatement included in a certificate should be prepared accordingly to ETSI EN 319 412-5175. Issuance of  qualified certificates for website authentication is regulated by a certification policy. The certification  policy should comply with ETSI EN 319 411-2176, and the certificate should include a certificate policies  extension. Keeping a certificate profile appropriate to regulations is part of the compliance management  process.  A certificate for website authentication contains the name of the legal or natural person to whom the  certificate is issued and operated by their domain name. Verification of this data should be completed  based on requirements laid down in Article 24 (1). Additional guidance from CA/Browser Forum:  \"Guidelines for The Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates177 (on legal entities),  standards for identity proofing for personal certificates (for natural persons).  NOTE: QTSP using ITU-T X.509 should ensure that corrigendum 1178 and 2179 is applied to base standard.

ENISA  Annual Activity  Report 2014  European Union  Agency for  Network and  Information Security  ii  A message from  the Executive Director Overview I am happy to state that 2014 was another successful year for the Agency, with ENISA maintaining its track record of  delivering according to plan and within allocated budget. At the same time, we improved the positioning of services for  our major stakeholders while ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework. On a more personal note, the Manage- ment Board approved the extension of my mandate for one more term of 5 years, which I take as a sign that the Agency  is responding well to the needs of its stakeholder communities.  External Impact Broadly speaking, ENISA’s activities can be divided into three main areas:  • Recommendations to its stakeholders  • Support for policy development and implementation  • ‘Hands on’ work with operational communities.  Throughout 2014, ENISA strengthened its contribution in each of these areas, sup- porting Member States and private sector actors in responding to a rapidly devel- oping threat environment and helping to lay solid foundations for the information  systems of the future.  Where recommendations are concerned, the Agency produced a total of 37 re- ports on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from national issues such as the protec- tion of critical infrastructure to issues affecting individual citizens such as privacy  and data protection. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an example of such a report.  This document offers a consolidated picture of threat information collected from  public sources throughout the globe and presents the top threats and the way in  which they are evolving in distinct business areas. One of the strengths of the ENI- SA Threat Landscape approach is that it provides useful information to a diverse set  of stakeholder communities.  The work carried out in the area of Article 13a of the Telecommunications Framework Directive of 2009 continues to be  the best known example of where ENISA is working to support policy initiatives; in addition to this we are active in a num- ber of policy initiatives, including support for the eIDAS legislation [11] and preparing for implementation of the proposed  NIS Directive [3] and Data Protection legislation [10].  The pan‑European Exercise continues to provide valuable insight into the way in which operational communities collab- orate across the EU in order to respond to serious NIS incidents that affect several Member States. Previous exercises al- lowed the Member States to develop a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for handling such incidents. The 2014  exercise, which is based on the participation of operational teams spread throughout the EU was used to test and further  develop these procedures. Building on this past experience, the 2014 exercise introduced a new level of sophistication by  Udo Helmbrecht  iii  explicitly testing the tactical, operational and strategic phases of response to an incident in separate steps. The third phase  of this exercise, which concerns the strategic response, will be carried out in 2015.  Article 14 requests, which are essentially a mechanism that allows Member States and EU institutions to request specific  items of work of the Agency outside the work programme execution process, continue to be popular. ENISA received 12  new requests in 2014 and continued to work on 19 ongoing requests (including 2013) from following countries: Austria,  Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxemburg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Spain and  from the European Commission.  Internal improvements In order to support the new mandate and further improve the operational model based on two locations, I introduced  a new organisational structure in October 2014. This new structure is dictated by the new challenges identified in the  rapidly changing operating environment with the limited number of human resources at the Agency’s disposal.  In addition, a large refurbishment project was conducted to improve the working conditions of the staff located in Athens.  This refurbishment did not impact the delivery of ENISA work programme and the Agency delivered on time and within  budget. The newly refurbished building not only represents a significant improvement in the daily lives of our operation- al staff, but is also better equipped from an IT and telecommunications perspective, which should also result in further  performance gains.  Conclusions 2014 has been another very successful year for the Agency. It has been a year in which we have strengthened our relations  with our stakeholders and assisted them in making significant improvements to the state of cyber security throughout the  EU. In parallel, we continue to make internal improvements that keep staff morale high and make the agency a challenging  and pleasant place to work.  I would like to end by thanking both our stakeholders and staff for their contributions to this success.

List of policy documents ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ 59  1  Introduction  2  1 Introduc tion  1.1 ENISA in brief The European Union Agency for Network and Informa- tion Security (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for cyber se- curity in Europe. ENISA supports the EU and the Member  States in enhancing and strengthening their capability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to net- work and information security problems and incidents.  ENISA’s vision is to secure and enable Europe’s informa- tion society and to use its unique competencies to help  to drive the cyber landscape in Europe.  The Agency works closely together with members of  both the public and private sector, to deliver advice and  solutions that are based on solid operational experience.  ENISA also supports the development of the European  Union (EU) policy and law on matters relating to network  and information security (NIS), thereby contributing to  economic growth in Europe’s internal market.  ENISA was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC)  No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and the Coun- cil. The Agency therefore celebrated in 2014 ten years of  successful activity in the European Cyber Security Land- scape. At the same time, 2014 is the first year of the new  mandate of the Agency. Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (1)  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May  2013 concerning the European Union Agency for Net- work and Information Security extends ENISA’s mandate  until 19 June 2020.  ENISA’s strategic objectives include: (i) developing and  maintaining a high level of expertise of EU actors tak- ing into account evolutions in network and information  security (NIS); (ii) assisting the Member States and the  Commission in enhancing capacity building throughout  the EU; (iii) assisting the Member States and the Com- mission in developing and implementing the policies  necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements  of network and information security; and (iv) enhancing  cooperation both between the Member States of the EU  and between related NIS communities.  According to article 4 of Regulation 526/2013, the Agen- cy is comprised of the Management Board (MB); the  Executive Director and staff; and the Permanent Stake- holders Group (PSG). In order to contribute to enhancing  the effectiveness and efficiency of the operation of the  Agency, the MB has established an Executive Board.  (1) For the links and names of all relevant policy documents  mentioned in this report please see Annex G.  The MB holds its ordinary meeting to adopt decisions on  budgetary and administrative matters as well as rules im- plementing provisions of ENISA Regulation No 526/2013  and Staff Regulations. The Board also adopts planning  documents such as annual work programme, multi‑an- nual staff policy plan, statement of estimates and others.  The PSG is an advisory body in respect of the agency’s  performance of its activities. It also advises the Executive  Director on drawing up a proposal for the Agency’s work  programme. Two PSG meetings were held as planned  during the 2014.  1.2 The year in brief 2014 was another successful year for the Agency. As can  be seen in Section 2, ENISA delivered according to plan  and within the allocated budget, improving its roles and  the positioning of its services to its stakeholders while  ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework.  Building on its renewed regulatory framework, ENISA  was particularly active in:  • Supporting EU policy building by developing and main- taining high level of expertise related to NIS, facilitat- ing voluntary information, establishing mutual inter- actions, contributing to EU policy initiatives and sup- porting EU in education research and standardisation.  • Supporting capacity building of EU Member States,  public and private sectors as well as contributing to  raising the level of awareness of EU citizens.  • Supporting the implementation of EU legislation re- lated to NIS and supporting cooperation between all  stakeholders relevant and active in the area of NIS.  The activities and the achievements of 2014 are present- ed in Section 2, with the more significant achievements  being also highlighted in Section 1.3. The activities are  presented by matching the achieved results against the  impact indicators and the proposed deliverables from  WP2014. The horizontal activities, such as Article 14 re- quests (2), collaboration with NLO, communication and  dissemination activities are also presented in Section 2.  (2) Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (a) the  European Parliament; (b) the Council; (c) the Commission; and  (d) any competent body appointed by a Member State, such  as a national regulatory authority could address requests for  advice and assistance falling within the Agency’s objectives  and tasks. An overview of the requests to the Agency that  were addressed during 2014 is included in section 2.1.4.1.  3  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  To support the new mandate and activities based in two  locations, in line with the operational and horizontal ob- jectives of the Agency, ENISA’s structure (see Section 3.4  and Annex A) was reorganised by the Executive Director  in October 2014. The Agency’s organisational structure is  dictated by the new challenges identified in the rapidly  changing operating environment with the limited number  of human resources at the Agency’s disposal. During 2014,  a large refurbishment project was conducted to improve  the working conditions of the staff located in Athens. This  refurbishment did not impact the delivery of ENISA work  programme and the Agency delivered in time and within  budget. The management of resources is described in Sec- tion 3 while more information is provided on assessment  and management assurance in Sections 4 and 5.  The document includes also a set of annexes proving  more details for this report.  In September 2014, the Management Board endorsed  the extension of the mandate of the Executive Director  of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht for one more term of 5 years.  1.3 Summary  1.3.1 Key performance indicators  Whilst the agency delivered against its annual work pro- gramme, it is worth highlighting that all deliverables met  or exceeded the key performance indicators set (see Sec- tion 2.1 for more details). Some of these achievements  are outlined here and examples are provided on how the  agency achieved its goals.  1.3.1.1  Supporting EU policy building.  Identifying evolving threats,  risks and challenges  • Impact Indicator (I.I.1.1-1): The ENISA Threat Land- scape becomes an important point of reference for se- curity experts worldwide and is referenced in at least  10 security related information sources worldwide.  • Achieved results: Achieved: More than 20 different or- ganisations are using the conclusions of ENISA’s Threat  Landscape report 2014. Several hundred references to  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013 have been made via the  main cyber security web pages and blogs.  • NB: The number of organisations quoting the ENISA  Threat Landscape deliverables is significantly above  expectations.  1.3.1.2 Supporting EU policy building.  Contributing to EU policy initiatives  • Impact Indicator (I.I.1.2-3): Five Member States eID  competent bodies/authorities, five independent  auditing bodies and five trust service providers take  part in the development of a common audit frame- work for trust service providers.  • Achieved results: Achieved: In total, more than 35  stakeholders requested to review the draft docu- ment, including FESA members (Member States),  TSPs and auditing bodies. The paper underwent re- views in various stages of the development process.  • NB: ENISA set of recommendations for TSPs devel- oped in 2014-2015 is becoming a real point of refer- ence for European TSPs in their daily work.  1.3.1.3 Support capacity building. Support  Private Sector Capacity Building  • Impact Indicator (I.I.2.2-3): 15 Cloud Computing  Providers and five Member States competent au- thorities contribute to ENISA’s study on minimum  security measures for cloud computing.  • Achieved results: Achieved: 20 Cloud providers and  12 Member States participating in the study for  Cloud Certification Metaframework.  • NB: ENISA collected the ICT security requirements  for the public sector from 12 Member States. This  study was greatly complemented by the input from  the community, which was a great undertaking for  ENISA to centralise all the information.  1.3.1.4 Support cooperation.  Implementation of EU legislation  • Impact Indicator (I.I.3.2-1): 23 Member States con- tribute to ENISA’s work on the implementation of  Article 13a and 12 Member states directly use the  outcomes of this work by explicit references or by  adopting the same approach nationally.  • Achieved results: Achieved. All 28 Member States  plus two EFTA Countries sent to ENISA and the Com- mission annual summary reports about incidents  that occurred in 2013. All Member States use the  ENISA Technical Guideline on Article 13a Incident  Reporting in their annual reporting. More than 12  Member States and some of the larger European  Electronic Communications Providers use directly  4  1 Introduc tion  or refer to the ENISA Technical Guideline on Secu- rity Measures. During 2014, ENISA performed three  workshops with the Article 13a Expert Group at- tended by NRAs from around 20 Member States.  • NB: ENISA reports in this area rely now on input  from all EU Member States and two EFTA countries  and are used by more than 12 Member States and  service providers.  1.3.1.5 Support cooperation.  Crisis cooperation — exercises  • Impact Indicator (I.I.3.1-1): At least 24 EU Member  States and EFTA countries confirm their support for  Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014).  • Achieved results: Achieved: CE 2014 involved 1400 ex- perts and over 450 teams, with an equal representa- tion from the public and private sector (n/g CERTs,  cyber security agencies, public sector teams, Telecom  Operators, Energy Sector Companies). Over all the  different phases of Cyber Europe 2014 there were 29  different participating countries (26 EU MS, 3 EFTA)  and the EU Institutions. In the first phase of CE2014  (TLEx) over 600 experts were involved, coming from  214 teams representing both private and public sector  institutions (n/g CERTs, cyber security agencies, public  sector entities, telecom operators, energy sector com- panies etc.). In the second phase of CE2014 (OLEx)  over 800 experts were involved. An impressive num- ber of over 1400 experts were involved in the exercis- es in some way during CE2014. Member States have  declared their satisfaction with the exercise through  evaluation surveys and through communications via  the ENISA Management Board members and NLOs.  • NB: This activity had a record number of partici- pants and it is worth mentioning also the number  of Member States involved and the participation of  private sector.  1.3.2 Policy highlights of the year  The policy highlights of 2014 were as follows:  • Successful execution of the pan‑European cyber se- curity exercise  • ENISA support of EU policy and legislation  • Publication of recommendations in a number of ar- eas central to NIS policy  The successful completion of the tactical and operation- al phases of the 2014 pan-European cyber security ex- ercise marks a significant step in improving the level of  preparedness of the EU for a major cyberattack targeting  several Member States. Previous exercises allowed the  Member States to develop a set of Standard Operating  Procedures (SOP) for handling such incidents. The 2014  exercise, which is based on the participation of opera- tional teams spread throughout the EU is now being  used to test and further develop these procedures. The  third phase of this exercise, which concerns the strategic  response, will be carried out in 2015.  ENISA carried out a number of activities that directly or  indirectly support EU policy initiatives. The Agency sup- ported the Commission and the Member States in the  development of a common audit framework for trust ser- vice providers in the context of the eIDAS regulation. In  parallel, the Agency continues to support Member States  in the implementation of Article 13a of the Telecommu- nications Framework Directive. The reports that are pub- lished by the Agency and which reflect data collected  through this process provide a valuable insight into the  risks affecting telecommunications infrastructure.  The Agency continues to support developments in the  area of data protection by producing targeted studies  illustrating how the concepts underlying the proposed  new legislation can be implemented in real operational  environments. Indeed, ENISA is uniquely positioned to  assist the private sector in implementing more effective  tools and procedures in this area.  Finally, ENISA published a number of studies that provide  concrete advice and recommendations to its stakeholders  in a variety of areas central to current NIS policy. The ENI- SA Threat Landscape is a good example of a study that is  interesting to all ENISA stakeholders, providing a descrip- tion of the top threats and how they apply to different  business models. Other ENISA studies provide advice and  guidance in areas that are key to economic growth, such  as Cloud Computing, SCADA systems, SMART cities and  the protection of Critical Information Infrastructure.  1.3.3 Key conclusions on the  effectiveness of the internal  control systems and financial  management  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  5  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  Compliance with these standards is compulsory for fi- nancial management.  The Agency has also put in place an organisational struc- ture and a set of internal control systems that are suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which it  operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the min- imum requirements that its internal control systems need  to comply with. Previously developed internal procedures  were grouped together, prioritised and implemented in  the daily workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern during  the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the recom- mendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA and IAS).  During 2014, the Agency achieved compliance with the  internal control standards. For more details please refer  to Sections 3 to 6 and to the Annexes of this report.  1.3.4 Information for the stakeholders  Whilst ENISA has aligned its activities with the EU policy  agenda and is delivering high quality results, the growing  demand to secure our infrastructures and economy call  for ENISA’s proactivity in in the area of NIS.  Recently ENISA assessed both the current cyber-threat  landscape and upcoming trends. While significant chang- es in top threats, increased complexity of attacks, suc- cessful internationally coordinated operations of law  enforcement and security vendors have been noted,  successful attacks on vital security functions of the Inter- net can also be observed. Positive developments can be  attributed to successful law enforcement operations and  to the mobilisation of the cyber‑security community.  But there is an alarming side to the threat landscape:  • Core security protocols of the Internet have been  under massive stress.  • Massive data breaches demonstrated how effective- ly cyber-threat agents abuse security weaknesses of  businesses and governments.  • Privacy and personal data breaches have weakened  the trust of users in the Internet.  • Increased sophistication and advances in target- ed campaigns have demonstrated new qualities of  attacks.  It is evident that these cyber-threat dynamics dictate the  need for a better orchestration of all relevant stakehold- ers. Some of the conclusions arising out of this assess- ment are:  • It is imperative to increase cyber‑threat knowledge  through cooperation: The ‘publicity’ of threat infor- mation in related media is quite high. In the future  it will be necessary to establish cooperation (consol- idate efforts) among various players in the field to  quickly obtain quality information on cyber threats  and on defence measures. As Cyber-Europe has  demonstrated, cooperation and coordination is key  to effective response to cyber‑security incidents.  • Capability building in cyber‑threat assessment and  defence is of strategic importance: Sophistication of  cyber threats are increasing. We see currently de- fence practices from the past losing efficiency (i.e.  classical signature‑based anti‑virus). Methods used  by high capability threat actors today are adopted  by cyber criminals tomorrow. This increases chal- lenges in capability building.  • It is vital to collect accurate information on success- ful cyber‑security incidents: The unknown number  of breaches and security incidents is of major con- cern to security experts and in particular to law  enforcement. Breach notification needs to be put  on a wider basis via corresponding regulations in  various areas/sectors, eventually covering end‑user  impact. This will help assessing the currently large  grey numbers assumed.  • Increased agility in security response is essential:  The high speed of changes in cyber-threat landscape  makes agile response indispensable. Information on  cyber threats should be the key parameter in active- ly adapting security protection practices towards  a more agile management of security at all (techni- cal, organisational and policy) levels.  ENISA seeks to support the NIS community, the Member  States and the EU institutions in the coordination of bet- ter mechanisms and improved means to support the pol- icy agenda of the EU. ENISA will continue to contribute  its expertise to support NIS in Europe in the context of  the current threat landscape and the current challenges  in the area of NIS.  6  2 Polic y achievements  2  Policy achievements  7  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  2.1 Achievement of general  and specific policy  objectives  The core activities of ENISA for 2014 have been grouped  into three work streams (WS). This section follows the  same structure for reporting as the structure of the ENI- SA work programme 2014. The three streams of activity  during 2014 were:  • WS1: ‘Support EU policy building’ designed to sup- port the policy-making process by making available  to policy‑makers consolidated information on the  emerging threat landscape and by formulating key  messages to the Member States on how to ensure  that their policies and capabilities are aligned with  EU objectives, taking into account lessons learned  within the different Member States. This involves  the unification of available information sources  under a common context and will also require the  involvement of important stakeholders in the are- as of threat assessment, risk mitigation and policy  definition.  • WS2: ‘Support capacity building’ addressed a num- ber of activities designed to assist both the public  sector and private sector in the Member States in  protecting critical information infrastructures (CIIP).  By facilitating cooperation and coordination be- tween public and private sectors within the Mem- ber States, ENISA continues to support the develop- ment of policies, measures, and recovery strategies  to meet the challenges of a continuously evolving  threat environment.  • WS3: ‘Support cooperation’ was about strengthen- ing NIS in the European single market. Cooperation  strengthens the capacities of Member States, EU  institutions and third countries and helps them to  deal with crises. The approach builds upon existing  collaboration in existing communities, further en- hancing community building in Europe and beyond.  This work also looked at the development of tools to  facilitate and improve the international communica- tion and interchange of security relevant informa- tion within communities sharing the same interest  in different Member States.  In the following sections, we will focus on each of these  streams of activities. After a general presentation of the  policy achievements, more detailed information is pro- vided matching planned activities and the achieved re- sults. Detailed tables are provided showing the proposed  Impact Indicators and how they were achieved as well as  the proposed deliverables and the achieved publications  or activities.  2.1.1 Policy achievements in WS1‑  Support EU policy building  The following work packages constitute Work Stream 1.  For each work package, the main objectives and policy  achievements are identified.  • WPK1.1. Identifying evolving threats, risks and  challenges  ▪ The main objective of this work package was  to collect and collate current data in order to  develop the ENISA threat landscape. It includes  current threats, as well as threat trends in NIS  and emerging technologies. The threat land- scape is based on existing publicly available  material on threats, risks and trends.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of threats and risks, supporting ENISA objec- tives and mandate as well as Council Resolu- tion on a collaborative European approach to  network and information security:  ◦ ENISA developed a perspective of the Euro- pean landscape of the NIS gaps and needs.  The deliverables on threat landscape pro- vide a European perspective based collected  ENISA lists top cyber‑threats in this years  Threat Landscape Report  8  2 Polic y achievements  threats (e.g. incorporating information on  European companies such as size, type of  business, etc.).  ◦ The ENISA Threat Landscape 2014 was de- veloped as continuation of the work started  in 2012. Compared to previous years, there  is noticeable improvement in the quality of  threat information collected within related  organisations. The improvements in infor- mation collection were based on liaison  with sources of threat information to es- tablish effective dissemination of generated  information.  ◦ Analysis and assessment of previous year  forecasts was carried out.  • WPK1.2. Contributing to EU policy initiatives.  ▪ The main objective of this work package was to  provide input to new policy initiatives before they  are launched and to assist the European Commis- sion and the Member States in implementing  such policies initiatives with an NIS perspective.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area of  cloud, supporting EU’s cloud computing strategy  and partnership:  ◦ ENISA continues to play an active role in the  implementation of the EU’s cloud computing  strategy. The Agency provides technical ad- vice, recommendations and good practices  to Commission’s Selected Industry Groups  in Cloud Computing (C‑SIGs). ENISA is the  leader of the C‑SIG on certification publish- ing two tools (Cloud Certification Schemes  List and Cloud Certification Schemes Meta- framework available here: https://resilience. enisa.europa.eu/cloud‑computing‑certifica- tion) fulfilling in this way the first objective  of the strategy. The Agency also participated  in the C‑SIG on SLAs and Code of Conduct.  ◦ ENISA organised the 3rd Secure Cloud con- ference offering an interesting agenda for  2 days (SecureCloud2014). The conference  was opened by Commission’s Vice‑Presi- dent Kroes and involved many high‑level  presentations from both public and private  sector experts.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of smart grid, supporting EU’s Smart Grids  strategy:  ◦ Since 2013, ENISA assists the Commission,  Member States and the private sector in  the implementation of the EU’s smart grids  strategy. The Agency provides technical ad- vice, recommendations and good practices  in the area of minimum security measures  for smart grids, certification of smart grid  components, privacy profile of smart me- ters, and incident reporting mechanisms. In  2014, the smart grid security measures were  adopted by the Smart Grid Task Force of the  European Commission.  ◦ To enhance this work the European Com- mission organised a dissemination work- shop for the smart grid security measures  with representatives from the private and  public sector reaching out to the greater  community. The outcome of this workshop  is a decision of the European Commission  to fund a study on costs and incentives of  implementation of these security measures.  ◦ ENISA initiated collaboration with SOGIS  (Senior Officials Group for Information  Systems Security) on ICT security certifi- cation. Together with the EU, the Agency  jointly organised a workshop on IT security  certification as a competitive advantage of  European industry.

Technical protection measures to prevent  data breaches, specified in legal documents  such as European Commission regulation  611/2013, need to be matched with tech- nical specifications in order to secure per- sonal data. During 2014, ENISA updated the  recommendations published during 2013  and extended them to cover more applica- tion scenarios such as cloud computing.  ◦ In 2014, ENISA published its first best prac- tice guide for prevention of data leakage  and appropriate controls for the access of  data using security and privacy by design  and by default to support with a technical  perspective the policy requirements for  data protection.  ◦ Furthermore ENISA organised an event,  the Annual Privacy Forum (APF’2014), to  establish a forum fostering the exchange  of information and experiences between  the research and academic communities,  and the EU policy and industry repre- sentatives in the area of privacy and data  protection. The event, organised together  with European Commission DG CONNECT  followed the success of the first edition of  APF’2012. The focus of the event was to  bring a strong technical perspective to the  debate, to focus on mechanisms to protect  personal data, and to allow different com- munities to exchange best practices.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of EU electronic identification and trust servic- es framework, supporting the new regulation  on trust service providers:  ◦ ENISA continued and expanded its support  focusing the recently adopted Regulation  on electronic identification and trusted ser- vices for electronic transactions in the inter- nal market. ENISA has already contributed  to this area by providing recommendations  in the areas of mechanisms for reporting se- curity breaches by the trust service provid- ers to the competent bodies and minimum  security measures and security best practic- es for trust services providers.  ◦ During 2014, ENISA focused its support  related to the implementation of the pro- visions of the proposal, with a focus on the  areas of common audit schemes for trust  services providers in Member States as  well as technical guidelines for conformity  assessment bodies performing audits and  trust service providers.  • WPK1.3. Supporting the EU in education, research  and standardisation.  ▪ During 2014, ENISA continued its efforts to sup- port EU funded R & D initiatives such as FP7 and  H2020 and standardisation activities including  EU initiatives such as the ETSI CEN CENELEC  Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG). Fur- thermore, activities have been carried out in the  area of education following the objectives of the  NIS cyber security strategy such as NIS driving li- cense and European Cyber Security Month 2014  (ECSM’2014).  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area of  standardisation, supporting NIS cyber security  strategy and the Action Plan for an innovative  and competitive Security Industry as well as  Council Resolution on a collaborative European  approach to Network and Information Security:  ◦ Since 2012, ENISA contributes actively to the  creation and work of the ETSI CEN‑CENELEC  cyber security coordination group (CSCG).  This collaboration with CSCG continued  during 2014 seeking out synergies with the  Agency’s work programme and involved  standardisation bodies in the different work  packages, as appropriate.  ◦ Responding to a request from ETSI, ENISA  participated in the review of the ETSI tech- nical specification TS 119 312 — Electronic  signatures and infrastructures (ESI) cryp- tographic suites.  10  2 Polic y achievements  ◦ In 2014, ENISA developed an inventory of  relevant standardisation activities in the  areas of NIS and privacy.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of education, supporting NIS cyber security  strategy:  ◦ Contribution to the ‘EU NIS driving li- cence’. Together with relevant stakeholder  community, ENISA coordinated the devel- opment of a road map for the implemen- tation of a ‘Network and information secu- rity driving licence’. This road map covers  the needs of different levels of education,  e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary ed- ucation. It exploits existing material and  synergies among relevant training bodies.  ◦ ENISA contributed/participated in the  evaluation of the calls of proposals for EU  funded R & D published by the European  Commission and provides advice via advi- sory boards for EU funded projects.  ◦ ENISA also analysed the status of cyber  security competitions in Europe. Such  competitions could be used to trigger an  interest for the area of NIS.  ◦ During 2014 ENISA supported the Europe- an Commission in preparing the European  Cyber Security Month 2014 (ECSM’2014).  This is a continuation of the activity of  2013; during 2014 many more Member  States participated in ECSM.  2.1.1.1 General achievements.

ENISA, with this work  stream, aims to raise the level of security across Member  States and the private sector by supporting the develop- ment of relevant capabilities.  The following work packages constitute Work Stream 2.  For each work package, the main objectives and policy  achievements are identified.  • WPK 2.1. Support Member States’ capacity building  ▪ The objective of this work package is to sup- port the development of prevention, detection,  analysis and response capabilities within Mem- ber States institutions and EU institutions.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area of  cyber security strategies, supporting the Digital  Agenda and the EU cyber security strategies:  ◦ ENISA continues to support Member  States in developing their capabilities in  the area of National Cyber Security Strat- egies (NCSS). The Agency, building on  previous work in the area of NCSS, acted  during 2014 as facilitator among Member  States and fostered the sharing of good  practices. In 2013, ENISA created a map of  cyber security strategies; in 2014, this be- came a central point of information on ex- isting strategies from the EU and across the  world. The map is updated regularly (and  is available at: http://www.enisa.europa. eu/activities/Resilience‑and‑CIIP/nation- al‑cyber‑security‑strategies‑ncsss/nation- al-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world).  ◦ ENISA took stock of existing evaluation/ assessment mechanisms of NCSS, identi- fying good practices, validating them with  public and private sector and finally issuing  a white paper with practical recommen- dations on the evaluation and update of  existing NCSS. ENISA created in 2013 the  NCSS working group with experts from  the governmental agencies dealing with  NCSS. In 2014, five new Member States  representatives joined the group.

The goal was  to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ through  a dialogue with relevant stakeholders, and  to draw a road map of CERT activities for  the coming years.  ◦ To support above‑mentioned action, on re- quest, tailored support capability building  for CERTs trainings were organised focus- ing on suitable exercises to technical staff  from EU Member States, EU institutions  and other appropriate audiences.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of regional, sector‑specific and national cyber  exercises, supporting EU Cyber cyber security  strategy:  ◦ In the past, the Agency has supported  national, regional and sectorial cyber ex- ercises efforts upon request (Art14 of the  ENISA regulation). This effort continued  in 2014 in line with the ENISA regulation,  the EU cyber security strategy and the EU  Member States’ needs.  ◦ Where appropriate the Agency collab- orated with and supported regional or  sectorial cyber exercises in a cost efficient  manner, for example by re-using exercise  planning and management knowledge and  tools from other exercises and efforts.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of National and European PPPs, supporting EU  Cyber Security Strategy:  ◦ ENISA continued to support Member States  in the development of their capabilities in  the area of national public‑private partner- ships (PPPs). A limited number of PPPs open- ly discussed with ENISA on the structure,  topics and procedures followed. This year  ENISA was able to engage with more than 12  Member States on the topic of NCSS, where  national PPPs are present. During the NISP  and NCSS meetings there were more than  15 private companies consulted on the topic.  • WPK 2.2. Support private sector capacity building  ▪ The objectives of this work package were to  focus on enhancing the capabilities of the pri- vate sector through cooperation with the pub- lic sector in several areas such as smart grids,  ICS‑SCADA, cloud computing, finance and elec- tronic communication networks. The work car- ried out in this context attempted to improve  the capacity of the Member States for dealing  with large-scale cyber incidents, by improving  the state of preparedness of the private sector  community. ENISA assisted Member States in  achieving this by providing assistance and ad- vice but did not engage in operational work.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution of the activ- ity leverage the NIS Platform as a tool to en‑ hance public private cooperation, as covered  by EU Cyber Security Strategy:  ◦ In 2014, ENISA supported the NIS platform,  the successor of EP3R, with the goal of en- gaging more targeted public and private  stakeholders, especially experts from small  industry players. ENISA supported the work- ing groups and their chairpersons (e.g. via  the resilience portal, conference calls), con- tributing to the outcomes of the working  groups, and ensuring its quality. The Agency  kept the working groups informed about  the latest developments in their respective  areas including deliverables published by  the Agency (e.g. art. 13 a working group).  ◦ The NIS platform community has grown ex- ponentially: Over 500 participants from all  Member States, involvement of public, pri- vate sector and academia. The NISP working  groups called for future research and evolu- tion of security practices for large and SMEs.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution of the activi- ty on Provide advice and assistance to targeted  stakeholder communities, as covered by EU cy‑ ber security strategy and CIIP action plan:  ◦ In 2014, the Agency also took stock of exist- ing initiatives on the certification of cyber se- curity skills of ICS‑SCADA experts and issued  practical recommendations to stakeholders  for the wide deployment of such schemes.  A workshop under the topic was organised,  bringing together 60 experts from this com- munity (public and private sector).  14  2 Polic y achievements  ◦ ENISA runs an expert group with 15 ex- perts from utilities manufactures vendors  and public authorities. In addition, ENISA  is supporting and contributing to the EURO  SCSIE group, a recognised WG on ICS SCA- DA security.  ◦ As an additional study, ENISA issued a re- port on ‘Smart grid certification in Europe:  challenges and recommendations’ and or- ganised a validation workshop.  ◦ In the area of Cloud Computing and in  order to support cloud certification activ- ities for the EC Cloud Strategy, ENISA col- lected the ICT security requirements for  the public sector from 12 Member States.  This study has been complemented by the  community, which has been enhanced by  the effort of ENISA to centralise the in- formation collected. This undertaking has  been greatly appreciated by the European  Commission and the community.  ◦ ENISA, under the ‘Governmental clouds’  study, created a useful ‘how-to’ guide with  a step-by-step procedure the public admin- istrators would need to follow to deploy  cloud services. This study has been validat- ed by 4 user cases of cloud computing im- plementations in the Member States.  ◦ Since 2013, ENISA runs a working group  with experts from 17 Member States on  the area of governmental Clouds, which  validates and supports ENISA’s work.  ◦ ENISA provided advice in the area of fi- nance, as covered by Network and infor- mation security in the finance sector study.  ENISA study was completed by interview- ing 12 NCBs (national central banks), and  15 industry representatives. The Agency  identified possible areas of improvement  and issued recommendations that will im- prove the security of transactions in the  finance sector.  ◦ The Electronic Communications (eComms)  reference group has grown and it now  comprises of 23 providers that support  ENISA’s work on a harmonised framework  for minimum security measures.  ◦ Under this experts’ group, the Internet In- frastructure security and resilience refer- ence group was created. This group brings  together 20 technical experts in network  operations, cyber security and contin- gency, with representatives from Internet  organisations, Internet service providers,  academia and governments from 10 dif- ferent Member States. In 2014 the con- tributions of this group to the ENISA de- liverable ‘threat landscape of the Internet  infrastructure’ and ‘Methodologies for the  identification of CIIs assets and services’  were fundamental and helped to focus the  studies.  • WPK 2.3. Raising the level of preparedness of EU  citizens  ▪ The objectives of this work package were to (a)  support awareness‑raising and training activities  in Member States to develop the security dimen- sion in the use of ICTs and (b) support the organ- ization of the cyber security month by providing  expertise related to the activities of ENISA.  ▪ Achievements and evolution in the activities  linked to raising the level of preparedness of  EU citizens, supporting ENISA objectives and  the cyber security strategy:  October is European Cyber Security Month  15  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  ◦ Through its NIS expertise, ENISA partici- pated together with different stakehold- ers in actively promoting cyber security  awareness. The 2014 activities were built  on the activities from previous years; at  the same time the 2014 results provided  the priorities and the context for growth  and development for the future years.  ◦ The agency supported the European Com- mission in preparing and running the Eu- ropean Cyber Security Month (ECSM), in  October 2014. A report was also published  assessing the impact and the development  of ECSM 2014.  ◦ ENISA maintained a webpage and support- ed ECSM by providing a new self-assess- ment tool, using the ENISA knowledge da- tabase and the agencies deliverables as raw  material. ENISA established partnerships  with academic institutions and provided  information and expertise in its core areas  in order to feed the academic curricula and  the recommendations from ENISA reports.  ◦ Furthermore ENISA cooperated with educa- tional bodies to do all the preparatory activ- ities to successfully organize a cyber‑securi- ty championship from 2015 where univer- sity students will compete in proposing NIS  solutions.  2.1.2.1 General achievements.

Support cooperation  Cooperation is a necessary prerequisite for strengthen- ing the capacities of Member States, EU institutions and  the private sector. During 2014, ENISA continued to build  upon existing collaboration in existing communities, and  to further enhance community building in Europe. ENISA  continues to provide a supporting role for these com- munities, developing tools to facilitate and improve the  international communication and interchange of securi- ty relevant information within communities sharing the  same interest in different Member States.  The following work packages constitute Work Stream 3.  For each work package the main objectives and policy  achievements are identified.  • WPK 3.1. Crisis cooperation — exercises.  ▪ The objective of this work package was to pre- pare and carry out the Cyber Europe Exercise  2014, in close collaboration with all relevant  stakeholders.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of Pan-European Cyber Exercises, supporting  EU Cyber Security Strategy, CIIP Action Plan  2009 and 2011, EU Internal Security Strategy:  ◦ In 2014, ENISA organised the third pan-Eu- ropean cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014  (CE2014). This exercise built on the experi- ence gained in previous exercises and took  account of previous recommendations.  The exercise was more ambitious than pre- vious efforts, e.g., technical depth, scenar- ios, stakeholders involved, objectives, pro- cedures to be tested, complexity etc.  ◦ The exact setup and exercise plan was  agreed upon by the EU Member States and  EFTA countries, in line with the EU cyber  security strategy.  ◦ Enhancing the capacity to support and or- ganise cyber exercises. ENISA further en- hanced its methodology, seminars, train- ings and technical capabilities on the or- ganisation and management of large‑scale  cyber crisis exercises. The Agency contin- ued enhancing its capabilities for man- aging complex, distributed exercises, by  building on previous efforts in tools and  methods and by facilitating strategic part- nerships, such as the one with DG JRC. For  example, more structural links have been  established with the European Cybercrime  Centre and the European Defence Agency.  ◦ Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises ac- tivities overview. ENISA continued to sup- port Member States in the maintenance  and training of operational procedures  for cyber crisis cooperation. This and the  activities described above including key  findings in the area of Cyber Crisis Cooper- ation and Exercises (C3E) are summarised  in a report published at the end of 2014.  This report will help ENISA to reach out to  other communities/sectors with lessons  learnt from supporting exercises (achiev- ing broader impact).  ▪ In the ENISA WP 2014, an activity was pro- posed, pending the agreement of MB, covering  a possible EU-US Cybersecurity Exercise. This  activity was not carried out, in agreement with  the European Commission and the ENISA MB.  • WPK 3.2. Implementation of EU legislation.  ▪ The objectives of this work package were two- fold, (a) the continuation of work in the area  of Incident Reporting (Article 13a) by analysing  the received data, and (b) the preparation for  the reporting for Article 4 of the ePrivacy Di- rective and Article 15 (3) of the European Com-  (3) The Article 15 referring to ‘Security requirements applicable  to trust service providers’ in the proposed eIDAS regulation  (Commission Communication (COM(2012)238 final of 4  June 2012) changed number to Article 19 in the adopted  Regulation (EU) N°910/2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market (eIDAS Regulation), published in July 2014.  Biggest EU cyber security exercise to  date Cyber Europe 2014  19  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  mission proposal for the Regulation on eID and  trusted services.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of analysis of incident reporting, supporting  EU Cyber Security Strategy, Article 13a of the  revised Framework Directive on electronic  communications and Articles 4 of the ePrivacy  Directive:  ◦ ENISA continued collecting and analysing  national reports of security breaches from  NRAs in accordance with Article 13a of the  Framework Directive on electronic com- munications. The annual incident report  covering incident of 2013 was published  during 2014. All the 28 Member States  plus two EFTA countries sent to ENISA and  the European Commission the annual re- ports for 2013.  ◦ All Member States use the ENISA Technical  Guideline on Article 13a Incident Report- ing in their annual reporting. More than  12 Member States and some of the larg- er European Electronic Communications  Providers use directly or refer to the ENISA  Technical Guideline on Security Measures.  ◦ The series of Article 13a expert’s group  meeting continue by having ENISA organ- ising the 14th meeting of the group in Oc- tober 2014 in Athens.  ◦ ENISA supported the creation of a joint  WG of all the competent authorities of  implementing the Article 4 (NRAs and  DPAs) under the auspices of the European  Commission.  ◦ Despite the fact that the deliverable fore- seen in the work programme 2014 called  ‘Guidelines on Incident Reporting Scheme  for Article15’ was postponed for next year,  according to WP2014 amendments, ENI- SA created a reference group of experts,  called the Article19 EG (4), with represent- atives for 14 Member States.  (4) Refers to Article 19 ‘Security requirements applicable to trust  service providers’ of the adopted Regulation (EU) N°910/2014.  ▪ Some of the activities foreseen in ENISA  WP2014 were amended during the year and  two of the activities of WPK3.2 were cancelled  due to the fact that the respective proposed  legislation was not approved as considered in  Work programme planning. The affected activ- ities are: the Guidelines on Incident Reporting  Scheme for Article 15 (5), in the context of reg- ulation on electronic identification and trusted  services, as well as the activity intended to Sup- port the implementation of the upcoming NIS  Directive.  • WPK 3.3. Regular cooperation among NIS  communities.  ▪ The objective of this work package was to fur- ther enhance the cooperation between opera- tional communities, mainly CERTs and Law En- forcement Agencies.  ▪ Achievements and evolution in the activities  linked to NIS cooperation, supporting EU Cyber  Security Strategy, Digital agenda, the commu‑ nication on EU Internal Security Strategy:  ◦ During 2014, ENISA continued to actively  support, and when appropriate, organise  common trainings with communities such  as CERTs and LEA; two workshops from the  annual series of workshops ‘CERTs in Eu- rope’ were organised in 2014, which was  the 9th annual edition.  ◦ ENISA leveraged synergies with the Euro- pean Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), through  formal and informal cooperation channels,  where appropriate respecting the respec- tive mandates.  ◦ During 2014, the Agency continued to col- lect good practices for CERTs and LEAs, and  further enhanced the ENISA exercise and  training material. ENISA took stock of exist- ing communities and cyber security chal- lenges related to the work of CERTs and  published best practices and guidelines.  (5) Refers to Article 15 of the proposed eIDAS regulation. As  explained in previous footnotes, in the adopted Regulation  (EU) N°910/2014, this is now Article 19 ‘Security requirements  applicable to trust service providers’.  20  2 Polic y achievements  2.1.3.1 General achievements.

WPK 3.1: Crisis cooperation — exercises  I.I.3.1‑1 At least 24 EU Member States and EFTA countries  confirm their support for Cyber Europe 2014  (CE2014)  Achieved: CE 2014 involved 1400 experts and over 450 teams, with  an equal representation of public and private sector teams (n/g  CERTs, Cybersecurity Agencies, Public Sector teams, Telecom Oper- ators, Energy Sector Companies). In the different phases of Cyber  Europe 2014 there were 29 different participating countries (26 EU  Member States, 3 EFTA) and the EU Institutions. In the first phase  of CE2014 (TLEx) over 600 experts were involved, coming from  214 teams representing both private and public sector institutions  (n/g CERTs, Cybersecurity Agencies, Public sector entities, telecom  operators, energy sector companies etc.). In the second phase of  CE2014 (OLEx) we had over 800 experts. An impressive total of  over 1400 experts were involved in the exercises in some way dur- ing CE2014. Member States have declared their satisfaction to the  exercise through evaluation surveys and through communications  via the ENISA Management Board members and NLOs.  I.I.3.1‑2 At least 80 % of Member States that are in the pro- cess of establishing National Contingency Plans by  2016 are supported by ENISA.  Achieved: One of the objectives of CE2014 was to give the op- portunity to Member States to test their national capabilities and  procedures. Out of the 29 countries (EU and EFTA) that collectively  participated in the first two phases of CE2014 (TLEx and OLEx) all  have confirmed that they have tested their national contingency  plans and capabilities. Overall 29 countries (26 EU Member States,  3 EFTA) were supported.  I.I.3.1‑3 At least 24 Member States are familiar with the op- erational procedures during cyber crisis by 2016  Achieved. The second phase of CE2014 was mainly focused on test- ing the operational procedures for cyber security cooperation in  Europe. All of the 26 countries that participated in this phase were  trained to use these procedures. In addition, the countries that  did not play in this phase had access to and received the updated  version of the SOPs within the pilot SOP portal within the Cyber  Exercise Platform.  WPK3.2. WPK 3.2: Implementation of EU legislation  I.I.3.2‑1 23 Member States contribute to ENISA’s work on  the implementation of Article 13a and 12 Member  states directly use the outcomes of this work by ex- plicit references or by adopting the same approach  nationally.  Achieved: All 28 Member States plus two EFTA Countries sent to  ENISA and the Commission annual summary reports about inci- dents that occurred in 2013. All Member States use the ENISA  Technical Guideline on Article 13a Incident Reporting in their annu- al reporting. More than 12 Member States and some of the larger  European Electronic Communications Providers use directly or re- fer to the ENISA Technical Guideline on Security Measures. During  2014 ENISA has performed three workshops with the Article 13a  Expert Group attended by NRAs from around 20 Member States.  I.I.3.2‑2 10 Member States contribute to the work facilitat- ed by ENISA on implementing and enforcing article  4 and 6 Member States make direct use of the  outcomes of this work by explicit references or by  adopting the same approach nationally.  Achieved: The participants in the ENISA Electronic Communications  Reference Group consisting of 23 Providers support ENISAs work  on a joint technical guidelines on Article 13a (Telecom Framework  Directive) security measures and Article 4 (ePrivacy Directive) secu- rity measures.  I.I.3.2‑3 10 Member States contribute to ENISA’s work on  implementing article 15  Work postponed. Based on the WP2014 amendment (October  2014) due to the late adoption of the regulation on trust service  providers, the deliverable addressing Article 15, of mentioned reg- ulation, has been postponed for 2015.  21  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  WPK3�3� WPK 3.3: Regular cooperation among NIS communities  I.I.3.3‑1 At least 10 Member States and two national/in- ternational LEA support the conclusions of the 9th  ENISA CERT workshop.  Achieved: In total we hosted 44 participants from several parties:  19 Member States + Switzerland + Norway; 10 international organi- sations + 11 LEA + 23 CERTs  I.I.3.3‑2 At least 10 Member States support the Good Prac- tice Guide and/or (where applicable) training and  exercise material for the exchange and processing  of actionable information by CERTs  Achieved. As part of expert group, reviewers, commenters ENISA  hosted teams from Siemens (Germany), SWITCH (Switzerland),  Portugal (CERT.PT), Poland (CERT.PL), Austria (CERT.AT) Czech Re- public (CESNET), from the US (CERT.CC and US‑CERT) international  organisations like FIRST, NEC, NATO, NAIST, Invincea and the CSIRT  Gadgets Foundation (13 teams altogether). In the BoF session at  the FIRST conference 2014 many more teams provided input for  the study. Participants in the TF‑CSIRT meeting in Las Palmas: CERT.AT, CERT. EE, CERT.CZ, Inteco‑CERT, Janet, CSIRT.MU, CERT.PL, CERT.PT,  SWITCH, CIRCL, Siemens CERT, Pionier‑CERT/PSNC, Panasonic,  XING‑cert, IRIS‑CERT, UiO‑CERT (14 teams)  I.I.3.3‑3 10 operational CERTs agree to adopt the recom- mendations of stocktaking on channels and for- mats for exchange of operational information  Achieved. Most of the EU teams use the same or similar concepts  and models like the study laid out. Several discussions throughout  the year and addressing the CERT communities resulted in positive  feedback from a minimum of 13 Member States (from several  teams, among them from Portugal, Poland, Austria, Switzerland,  Luxembourg, Romania, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Germa- ny, Latvia, Belgium, CERT‑EU, etc.)  I.I.3.3‑4 Two CERTs agree to pilot the good practice materi- al for first responders (material developed in coop- eration and accordance with the EC3) (Q4)  Achieved. Teams from Switzerland, Portugal and Czech Republic  agreed to pilot the material, so that when ENISA does a follow-up  project, experiences will already exist.  22  2 Polic y achievements  2.1.3.2 Specific achievements.

As the NLO  members are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and  interaction, in terms of outreach, effective liaison in the  Member States and dissemination, the communication  covered time‑critical announcements and information on  upcoming ENISA project related tenders, requests vacan- cy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where the  Agency contributes to (for example co‑organiser, etc.).  An assessment of the NLO section page under the ENISA  home page was carried out in an effort to revise this tool  of communication between the Agency and the NLOs.  New sections were added to this area of the ENISA web- site, such as the News from the Member States and in- formation on NLO meetings (agenda, presentations, etc.)  A generic presentation about ENISA was distributed to  the network in order to aid NLOs in their role of ‘facilita- tors’ of ENISA activities in their country.  NLOs actively supported eight (8) ENISA projects in 2014  compared to three (3) in 2013. Their contribution was  instrumental in the implementation of the European  Cyber‑Security Month (ECSM), the Smart Grid security  mandates stocktaking and the National Cyber‑Security  Strategies (NCSS) workshop and working group.  2.1.4.3 Corporate communication,  dissemination activities and outreach  Following the Agency’s re‑organisation in 2013, the com- munications team now consists of the Spokesperson (or  alternate: Corporate Communication Assistant) who col- laborates and liaises closely with the Stakeholder Commu- nication Assistant from the Core Operations Department.  Cooperation with media outlets placed emphasis on the  EU and Brussels media scene. The result was increased TV  coverage, editorials in the press and articles published in  numerous media outlets for 2014. Also the communication  was tailored towards public relations campaigns for specific  events, projects, activities and deliverables. This incorpo- rated digital communications, external communications,  media and events across the EU, promoting in a dynamic  way the digital revolution and the EU single market.  In the following subsections we cover some of the activi- ties, events, and statistics associated with our communi- cation activities.  ENISA celebrates 10 years of supporting EU cyber security  with a high‑profile event on the Future of Cyber Security Challenges  25  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  2.1.4.3.1 Celebrating a decade of contribution to  the EU’s cyber security — High level Event  2014  ENISA celebrated on 1 October its 10-year Agency pres‑ ence with a high-level event ‘10 years of securing Eu- rope’s cyber security… and beyond!’ in Brussels, recap- ping the achievements of the Agency during these ten  years, and looking ahead at the future cyber challenges  for Europe. The event also included the official launch  of the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM). For the  occasion the Agency produced relevant material:  • the 2014 High‑level event — ENISA today and in the  Future publication, providing an overview of ENISA’s  work at a policy, operational and EU level  • the ENISA cyber cooperation report looks at a dec- ade of achievement, summarising the threat land- scape, the recent developments in EU policy and the  regulatory framework.  • EU Digital Security Policy (policy) paper, which looks  into the barriers for an alternative model for the EU  cyber security industry  • 7 Information Briefs with recommendations on cy- ber security topics in several EU languages  The event focused on the European Parliament and the  new Commission of the next five years, looking ahead at  the future cyber challenges for Europe. Topics discussed  included:  • Can Cybersecurity be an Economic Enabler?  • Can we Secure Future Technologies?  • Cyber Security in the EU — achievements and future  challenges  • Showcasing in a Live Hacking demonstration  2.1.4.3.2 ENISA branding of its 10-year celebration  This year ENISA’s promotional material reflected its 10‑ year celebration. The material was distributed at the  high-level event, to special events, workshops or con- ferences, as well as to ENISA visitors and for awareness  raising.  Throughout the year an anniversary banner was visual  on all Agency corporate material, featuring on the web- site, the social media outlets, stationary and all materials  produced or used. This enhanced putting across the mes- sage on cyber security and the Agency’s presence in the  field. It also enhanced overall visual identity and contrib- uted in the effort to trigger perceptions and discussion  on cyber security.  2.1.4.3.3 Publications  ENISA is active in publishing the results of its work i.e.  reports, studies, info notes and enhancing its communi- cation and reach with various stakeholders. The Agen- cy makes a point of making the Executive Director, the  Head of Core Operations and staff members available to  communicate and provide their expertise externally to  the public. Within this context, a significant number of  interviews, editorials, and feature articles are provided  to key publications and media outlets promoting cyber  security and awareness from an official EU and respected  source.  In addition, the Agency has published numerous pub- lications with 45 work programme deliverables as well  as various ad hoc technical or policy reports, papers and  studies or other publications.  2.1.4.3.4 Multilingual approach  A key challenge always remains reaching out to diverse  publics. The communications team continues its efforts  in providing tailor made, consistent messages, using the  appropriate channels. In addition the Agency publishes  its press releases in five languages — English, German,  French, Spanish and Greek — for its stakeholders and  media.  2.1.4.3.5 Media outreach  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme gives  the Agency the opportunity to extend its reach to more  stakeholders than through direct means. Following the  successful practice of the previous years, through an en- hanced media distribution and monitoring process, the  Agency enhanced the targeting and reach of its media  work. During 2014, major accomplishments include the:  • Production and release of 23 media releases  • Publication of 103 individual news items on the ENI- SA website  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/countries-aligned-for-the-deployment-of-the-european-cyber-security-month https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/2014-high-level-event-enisa-today-and-in-the-future https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/2014-high-level-event-enisa-today-and-in-the-future https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/enisa-cyber-cooperation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/eu-digital-security-policy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014/european-cyber-security-month-recommendations-for-all https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014/european-cyber-security-month-recommendations-for-all  26  2 Polic y achievements  • Simultaneous publication of media releases and  news items in ENISA’s social media channels (Face- book, Twitter, LinkedIn)  2.1.4.3.6 Cross media impact  ENISA generated 4 346 mentions in EU media compared  to 2 500 last year, increasing significantly its reach and  impact across the EU’s 24 languages. Directly, media re- leases on the ENISA website received more than 213 000  unique page views in 2014, while individual news sto- ries on the ENISA website received more than 84 000  direct hits. Figures continue to show a clear correlation  between peaks in web visitors and the distribution of  media releases in multiple channels, thus demonstrating  the beneficial effect of the communication and media  activity.  Total readership reached 5.4 million in total, with an In- ternet reach of 3.9 billion for the year.  2.1.4.3.7 Social media  ENISA continues its successful engagement with the on- line community through its social media outlets. All of  ENISA’s activities and deliverables are communicated via  the social media channels, and generate increasing traf- fic towards them and the Agency website, activities and  deliverables. In addition, they are incorporated in the  Agency’s communication (publications, presentations,  emails, brand material etc.) Furthermore the Agency  conducted an external analysis which showed that the  channels are updated often, achieving a better impact  and reach. In particular, social media monitoring reports  have shown an increased reach of ENISA’s channels.  Main accomplishments include:  • More than 6000 followers in the ENISA Twitter channel  • More than 2800 Tweets from the Agency’s account.  In total there were 16 625 tweets placing twitter as  the Agency’s leading social media outlet.  • 3500 Followers in the ENISA LinkedIn page  • 58 videos posted to YouTube  • Hundreds of thousands of users reached by messag- es posted by ENISA  2.1.4.3.8 Digital media  ENISA’s website continues to be the Agency’s main com- munication channel. In 2014, the efforts for improve- ment were continued and several recommendations  from the usability study performed in 2013 were imple- mented. ENISA’s website received more than 3 million  unique page views in 2014.  Technical improvements in 2014 included the develop- ment of new web tools for the Agency’s website and  portals (used by specialist expert communities) and the  application of all the security patches to the infrastruc- ture used by the ENISA site.  The dedicated portal for the European Cyber Security  Month was redesigned and enhanced with new func- tionalities to better support the ECSM initiative and its  constantly growing community.  Furthermore, the structure of the Agency’s three mini  sites in Greek, German and French was further enhanced  in 2014 in a constant effort for improvement. The struc- ture has become more user friendly and news in these  three languages is presented and read with much less  effort.  ENISA created around 46 videos and clips communicat- ing its events and activities. Indicatively we mention the  CE2014 official video clip, CE2014 official launch, the ENI- SA high‑level event and ECSM launch, the Annual Privacy  Forum 2014, and the Secure Cloud 2014. Videos are of  increasing interest to various stakeholder groups and the  Agency envisages the production of more and relevant  material for a number of its activities, helping its mes- sages to be communicated in a more interactive manner.  2.1.4.3.9 Additional outreach activities  ENISA continued actively its participation to events in- creasing visibility, involvement, recognition and aware- ness at a local, national or EU level.  Increased coverage was generated regarding ENISA’s  threat landscape report, CERT training, National Cyber  Security strategies, Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014), one  of the Agency’s flagship initiatives, and the Cloud Cer- tification Schemes Metaframework, mapping security  requirements, with its first client being the EU Commis- sion. CE2014 was the biggest pan-European cyber exer- cise to date, bringing together over 50 senior represent- atives from 23 European Union and EFTA countries, with  over 600 actors across Europe.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014/cyber-europe-2014-information/visual-material-for-cyber-europe-2014/cyber-europe-2014-video-clip https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014/cyber-europe-2014-information/visual-material-for-cyber-europe-2014/cyber-europe-2014-official-launch  27  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  A particular interest was taken in bringing the Agency  and the EU closer to the local community which was re- flected through the participation in the Model European  Union (MEU) Creta 2014, between 22-26 October 2014  in Heraklion Crete; a handover ceremony for the dona‑ tion of electronic equipment in December 2014; and an  event with the regional government celebrating ENISA’s  10-year presence in Crete. In the beginning of the year,  the former EU Vice President and Commissioner for the  Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes, visited the ENISA premises  in Athens. The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  and Europe Day are two other EU activities ENISA is ac- tively involved in, encouraging and promoting the local  community participation.  The Communications team continues its close collabo- ration with the NIS experts supporting the production  of the Info Notes activity where short expert reports  provide a pragmatic analysis on trending security issues  and themes. The activity has proven to be an important  tool which stakeholders turn to for reliable information  on security issues. Themes included the ‘Heartbleed” (6)  vulnerability and the BASH Shellshock Bug (7).  A new section ‘News from the Member States’, was  added to our webpage, following a request of the com- munity. This section covers the latest technical cyber se- curity updates from the EU Member States and is aimed  to increase interaction with the specific community.

The  QMS comprises of a set of standard operating proce- dures (SOPs) and other guidance instruments that ad- dress critical business areas. A dedicated methodology  supports the generic promulgation of operational pro- cedures of the Agency based on the Deming cycle; this  methodology allows for the setting of SMART goals and  KPIs in line with standardisation requirements in quality  management.  In 2014, a set of tools and applications were launched  to improve operational performance most notably in  the area of project management; consequently a project  management methodology and a project office facility  were made available to increase operational efficiency  and productivity, while a project management tool was  further developed to improve its fitness for purpose.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-heartbleed-a-wake-up-call/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-heartbleed-a-wake-up-call/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-heartbleed-a-wake-up-call/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-the-bash-shellshock-bug/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-the-bash-shellshock-bug/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-the-bash-shellshock-bug/at_download/fullReport  28  3 Management of  resources  3  Management  of resources  29  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  3.1 Management Board The agency is governed by the Management Board (MB),  composed of one representative from each Member  State and two representatives from the European Com- mission. EEA countries are presented as observers to  the MB. In line with Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, the  MB held its ordinary meeting in October 2014. At this  meeting, the MB adopted a number of administrative,  budgetary and management decisions. For example, the  amendments to the work programme 2014 were adopt- ed to reflect the recent adoption of the Regulation on  electronic identification and trust services (Regulation  (EU) No 910/2014) and still ongoing legislative procedure  to adopt the NIS Directive (COM(2013)48 Final).  The adoption of the ENISA anti‑fraud strategy was  among the decisions taken. Minutes and decisions of  the MB are available on the ENISA website: http://www. enisa.europa.eu/about‑enisa/structure‑organization/ management-board.  In addition, the MB Chair called for an extraordinary  meeting on the extension of the term of office of the Ex- ecutive Director. The Board decided to extend the term  of office for 5 years.  3.2 Major events During 2014, there were no major events to significant- ly impact ENISA activities and delivery against its work  programme.  3.3 Management of financial  resources  3.3.1 Budget execution of EU subsidy  (C1 funds)  In terms of budget execution, the expenditure appropria- tions corresponding to the Union contribution allocated to  ENISA and the interest generated by cash at banks during  2014, i.e. the budget of ENISA of 9 091 917.98 EUR, were  committed at a rate of 100.00 % on 31.12.2014 compared to  99.72 % on 31.12.2013.  ENISA did not cancel any appropriations of the year (C1) ap- propriations by the end of the year (cancellation rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already prov- en capacity of the Agency to efficiently use the entrusted  funds, in order to implement its annual work programme  as well as manage its administrative expenditure and  investments.  The respective payment rate on EU subsidy expenditure  appropriations as included in the MFF 2014‑2020 was  85.61 % in 2014 compared to 91.32 % in 2013. The pay- ment rate of 2014 is slightly lower than 2013. However,  the ratio of payment is high and demonstrates that the  capacity of the Agency to finalise its annual activities  and to execute the relevant payments within the year  of reference was maintained. The procurement planning  which was moved forward to the end of the preceding  year (2013) and enabled the launch of projects related  to the work programme in early 2014, contributed sig- nificantly to the improvement of the payment rate of ap- propriations of the year (C1).  3.3.2 Budget execution of additional  funds received in 2013 for  Athens office refurbishment  works (C3 appropriations)  In addition to the initial EU subsidy to its budget 2013,  in November 2013 ENISA was granted the amount of  480 632.00 EUR, which resulted in the funds carried over  to 2014 for commitment (non‑automatic carry over). The  total amount of 504 934.00 EUR – related to the refur- bishment works and infrastructure investments in the  new office in Marousi, Athens – was carried over to 2014  by Decision MB/2014/02 WP of the Management Board  adopted on 7 February 2014.  Following a call for tenders for the refurbishment works,  which concluded to the award of a contract, and the sig- nature of another contract for upgrading Internet con- nectivity infrastructure (Dark Fibre), ENISA finally com- mitted 503 834.00 EUR, and the total amount of budget  2013 which remained uncommitted (and was therefore  cancelled) was 1 100.00 EUR, representing 0.01 % of the  total budget 2013 (8).  The tables below demonstrate a detailed analysis of the  commitments and payments made in 2014, including the  appropriations carried over from 2013 by decision of the  Management Board for the refurbishment works.  (8) Budget commitment validated and contract awarded for  the refurbishment project for 478.900 EUR on 17/03/2014.  Budget commitment validated and contract awarded for  upgraded Internet connectivity (Dark Fibre) for 24.934 EUR  on 07/03/2014. Total amount committed in 2014 on amounts  carried over from 2013, based on MB decision: 503.834 EUR.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board  30  3 Management of  resources  3.3.3 Amending budgets/budgetary  Transfers  The following table summarises the budget transfers and  the amending budget (AB) 1/2014 effect on the initial  budget 2014:  Table — Summary of transfers and AB 1/2014 effect:  Initial budget Transfers 1-3 B2014  approved by ED  Amending budget 1/2014  transfers  New appropriations 2014  (AB 01/2014)  Title 1 5 947 226.00 0.00 – 896.00 5 946 330.00  Title 2 875 000.00 0.00 670 000.00 1 545 000.00  Title 3 2 264 128.00 0.00 0.00 2 264 128.00  Total 9 086 354.00 0.00 669 104.00 9 755 458.00  The table below summarises the budget transfers and  the amending budget (AB) 2/2014 effect:  Table — Summary of transfers and AB 2/2014 effect:  New appropria‑ tions 2014  (AB 01/2014)  Transfers 4-7 B2014  approved by ED  Correction of allocation of  new revenue appropriations  (AB 02/2014)  Amending budget  2/2014  Transfers  New appropriations  2014 (AB 02/2014)  Title 1 5 946 330.00 – 209 836.61 0.00 – 218 518.53 5 517 973.86  Title 2 1 545 000.00 110 700.00 – 47 161.34 204 856.63 1 813 395.29  Title 3 2 264 128.00 99 136.61 0.00 13 662.90 2 376 927.51  Total 9 755 458.00 0.00 – 47 161.34 0.00 9 708 296.66  The table below summarises the effect of the budget  transfers following the adoption of the AB 02/2014 to  the final budget execution:  Table — Summary of transfers’ effect on final budget execution:  New appropriations 2014  (AB 02/2014)  Transfers 8-12 B2014  approved by ED  Final budget e  xecution 2014  Title 1 5 517 973.86 43 102.60 5 561 076.4600  Title 2 1 813 395.29 48 407.99 1 861 803.28  Title 3 2 376 927.51 – 91 510.59 2 285 416.92  Total 9 708 296.66 0.00 9 708 296.66  31  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  3.3.4 Carry forward of commitment  appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to the EU  subsidy (C1 appropriations), which were not consumed  by payments at the end of 2014, were carried forward  (automatic carry forward) to 2015 (C8 appropriations).  All commitment appropriations corresponding to the  subsidy from the Greek Government for the lease of ENI- SA premises in Greece (external assigned revenue — R0  appropriations) were paid by 31 December 2014, there- fore no commitment appropriations were automatically  carried over to 2015 (R0 appropriations).  The commitment appropriations corresponding to the  carried over amount from 2013 by a decision of the  Management Board (non‑automatic carry‑over to C3 ap- propriations 2014) which were not paid by 31 December  2014, i.e. the amount of 23 945.00 EUR payable to the  contractor that was withheld as performance guarantee,  is automatically carried forward to 2015 (C8 appropria- tions 2015).  The funds carried forward to 2015 (C8 appropriations)  are detailed below:  Title Carried forward  (to C8 2015)  EU subsidy  Carried forward  (C3 2014 to  C8 2015)  EU subsidy  Total carried  forward  to 2015  EU subsidy Title 1 —  Staff 394 950.16 0.00 384 950.16  Title 2 —  Administration 589 036.04 23 945.00 612 981.04  Title 3 —  Operations 334 489.60 0.00 334 489.60  Total 1 308 475.80 23 945.00 1 332 420.80  The total cancelled appropriations carried forward from  2013 to 2014 (C8 appropriations of 2014) but finally not  paid in 2014, was 49 460.01 EUR (representing 6.89 % of  the total appropriations carried forward to 2014).  3.3.5 Types of procurement  procedures  In 2014, a total of 29 procurement procedures were  launched, 42 contracts (18 framework service contracts  and 25 service contracts) and 236 purchase orders (95  of which were issued against pre‑existing framework ser- vice contracts) were signed.  3.3.6 Interest charged by suppliers  During 2014, the Agency had to pay no interest to its  suppliers as result of keeping the payment terms agreed  with the suppliers.  3.4 Management of human  resources  3.4.1 Human resources  At the end of 2014, 62 statutory staff were employed  in the Agency. During 2014, three staff left the Agency,  ten vacancy notices were published and seven staff were  recruited.  ENISA still experiences challenges in attracting and hold- ing suitably qualified staff to support the activities of the  Agency. This is a challenge due to several factors, how- ever one prime factor is the location, Heraklion, where  international education is a challenging factor.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members:  • a service-level agreement has been concluded with  each of the private schools being used by the chil- dren of the staff in Athens as there are no European  schools based there.  • A new mandate and service agreement has been  concluded between the Commission and ENISA  which provides the detail of the funding for Euro- pean schools being used by the children of the staff  of ENISA.  In 2014, 20 implementing rules prepared by the Commis- sion were considered by ENISA and sent to the Manage- ment Board for approval. These approved implementing  rules provide clarification and detail on the application of  the staff regulations, which provide the legal basis for the  obligations and rights of staff members.  In 2014, ENISA also engaged consultants to complete  a staff survey to report on aspects of living and work- ing at ENISA. The results were compared with a previous  staff survey carried out in 2012; significant improve- ments verified as to past results have been noted. The  results of the latest survey are being analysed with  a view to learning and improving the quality of the lives  of staff at ENISA.  32  3 Management of  resources  A number of activities with staff were held throughout  the year to improve team building and the working en- vironment. These exercise proved to be well received by  the staff and helps to bridge the barrier created from the  operation of two offices in a small agency.  The organisational chart, establishment plan and the sta- tistics for ENISA staff is attached in Annex A.1.  3.4.2 Results of screening  The Agency performed a job screening benchmarking  exercise for the first time in 2014. The result of the exer- cise, which is a snap shot of the staffing situation on end  December 2014, appears in Annex A.4. For 2014 there  are no comparative data related to the previous year. The  ‘overhead’, support functions, is only 22 % of the total  population, which is below the maximum value accepted  for the Agencies that is estimated at 25 %.  3.5 Assessment by  management  3.5.1 Effectiveness of controls for  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to en- sure the management of risks related to the legality and  regularity of underlying transactions. These control pro- cesses take into account the multi‑annual character of  programmes and the nature of the payments concerned.  In order to achieve the best control possible, the Agen- cy has focused intensively on the verification of results  before transactions are initiated (‘ex‑ante verification’).  In line with Internal Control Standard 8 (ICS 8 Processes  and Procedures), the Agency has done the ex‑post con- trol report of the 2013 financial year. The recommen- dations issued in the report were addressed during the  year.  The ex‑post controls of the financial year 2013 were quite  extensive. A total of 224 financial transactions were sam- pled and controlled representing 16,27 % of all financial  transactions of the Agency and representing 70.29 % of  the 2013 Agency’s budget.  The ex‑post controls of the financial year 2014 followed  procedures set in previous years. A total of 174 financial  transactions were sampled and controlled represent- ing 9.22 % of all financial transactions of the Agency or  70.99 % of the 2014 Agency’s budget. As a result, one  recommendation was issued in regard to the a posteriori  commitments of the Agency – the late opening of the fi- nancial tool ABAC at the beginning of the year.  Moreover, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is re- sponsible for the annual audit of the Agency, which is  concluded by the publication of an annual report accord- ing to the provisions of Article 287(1) of TFEU. For sev- eral consecutive years, the ECA reports have confirmed  improvement in the Agency’s overall internal controls  environment and performance.  3.6 Budget implementation  tasks entrusted to other  services and entities  The Agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  3.7 Assessment of audit results  and follow up of audit  recommendations  3.7.1 Internal Audit Services (IAS)  At the beginning of 2014, the Agency had 25 open rec- ommendations. During the year, the Agency closed 24 of  them. In November 2014, the IAS visited the Agency in  order to proceed with a control ‘on the spot’ to close the  remaining open recommendations. After their visit, the  Agency remains with only one open recommendation.  This open recommendation will be closed as soon as the  Agency implements a tool for e‑workflows (implementa- tion in January 2015). The Agency has an internal control  coordinator’s team.  3.7.2 European Court of Auditors  (ECA)  The annual report of ECA for 2012 ENISA contained two  important recommendations. The Court noted a weak- ness in the documentation of the fixed assets and a delay  in performance of a physical inventory count.  33  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  The first recommendation concerning the weakness in  the documentation of the fixed assets was closed by the  ECA. A lot of effort was put into the management of fixed  assets. A full physical inventory was done across both  premises (Heraklion and Athens), the retirement exer- cise was done and the reconciliation of fixed assets with  the accounts was finalised.  The second recommendation concerning the physical  inventory is a process that is still ongoing. Indeed, the  declassification exercise was done in 2014 as well as the  donation exercise. The process regarding the disposal of  the remaining declassified items, by way of destruction  and auction, will be completed by the end of the first  semester of 2015.  The ECA’s report on 2014 accounts is expected in the  third quarter of 2015. The Agency expects that the  Court’s opinion on the true and fair presentation of the  accounts as well as on the legality and regularity of the  transactions underlying the accounts will be unqualified  as it has been for the past eight years.  3.7.3 Follow up of audits plans, audits  and recommendations.  The Agency has only one open recommendation regard- ing the workflows of financial transactions.  This recommendation will be closed in the beginning of  2015, as soon as the Agency will implement an e-work- flow tool (implementation in January 2015).  3.7.4 Follow up of observations from  the discharge authority.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 3 April  2014, the Executive Director of the Agency was granted  the discharge in respect of the implementation of the  Agency’s budget for the financial year 2012.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 3 April  2014, the closure of the accounts of the Agency for the  financial year 2012 was approved.  3.7.4.1 Follow‑up of the 2011 discharge  The discharge authority acknowledged that the reduc- tion in the level of appropriations carried forward to the  next year was achieved by shifting procurement plan- ning from the first quarter of the financial year to the last  quarter of the preceding year.  The discharge authority acknowledged that the first  Agency’s inventory count was launched in April 2013 us- ing ABAC assets application and technology, whereby the  Agency verified the existence, valuation, eligibility and  correctness of fixed asset records.  The discharge authority acknowledged that the neces- sary measures were taken to address the lack of trans- parency of recruitment procedures and that the Court  of Auditors marked the issue as completed in its report.  3.7.4.2 Budget and financial management  The discharge authority noted with satisfaction that the  effective implemented budget control system during the  financial year 2012 resulted in a budget implementation  rate of 100 % and that the payment appropriations exe- cution rate was 91.45 %.  3.7.4.3 Commitments and carry overs  The discharge authority acknowledged that the Court of  Auditors’ annual audit had found no notable issues as  regards the level of carry overs in 2012 and commend- ed the Agency for adhering to the principle of annularity  and for timely execution of its budget.  3.7.4.4 Transfers  The discharge authority noted with satisfaction that  according to the annual activity report, as well as the  Court of Auditors’ audit findings, the level and nature of  transfers in 2012 had remained within the limits of the  financial rules and commended the Agency on its good  budgetary planning.  3.7.4.5 Procurement and recruitment  procedures  The discharge authority noted that for the year 2012,  neither sampled transactions nor other audit findings  had led to any comments on the Agency’s procurement  procedures in the Court of Auditors’ annual audit report  and noted that the Court of Auditors had made no com- ments in its annual audit report for 2012 with regard to  the Agency’s recruitment procedures.  3.7.4.6 Prevention and management of  conflicts of interests and transparency  The discharge authority acknowledged that the Manage- ment Board approved and signed the decision on prac- tical arrangements for implementing transparency and  confidentiality rules in October 2013 and acknowledged  34  3 Management of  resources  from the Agency that CVs, declarations of interest of the  Executive Director, the directors and the heads of de- partment were fully published on the agency’s website  as requested by the discharge authority on the agency’s  discharge 2012.  3.7.4.7 Comments on internal controls  The discharge authority noted with concern that ac- cording to the Court of Auditors’ annual audit report,  although the financial regulation and the corresponding  implementing rules provide for a physical inventory of  fixed assets at least every three years, this was not re- spected and the Agency did not carry out a comprehen- sive physical inventory in 2012, following the physical in- ventory of 2009; acknowledged that it would have been  either very difficult or even counterproductive to carry  out an inventory in 2012 because the inventory manage- ment module of the integrated budget and accounting  platform, supported by the Commission (DG BUDG), has  only been in place since that same year; it acknowledged  that this issue had been addressed with the new system  in 2013.  3.7.4.8 Internal audit  In 2012, the Commission’s Internal Audit Service (IAS)  carried out an in-depth risk assessment exercise in order  to determine the audit priorities for the coming three  years; observes that the IAS submitted its final strategic  audit plan for 2013‑2015 on 3 December 2012, defining  the prospective topics for the IAS audits of the Agency  for this period; notes that the IAS also carried out a desk  review on information provided by the Agency, which  showed that no critical recommendations were open  as of 31 December 2012; notes with concern, however,  that the implementation of four very important recom- mendations was delayed, with respect to the deadlines  defined by the Agency in the original action plans; notes  that two of those recommendations are actually closed.  3.7.4.9 Performance  The discharge authority requested the Agency to com- municate the results and impact of its work on European  citizens in an accessible way, mainly through its website.  The Agency is continually striving to improve the way in  which it interacts with its stakeholder communities. Most  of the Agency’s work is aimed at professional audienc- es in both the private and public sector, which is where  we place the emphasis on our stakeholder engagement  strategy. However, we realise the need to keep the EU  citizen informed about our work and we have there- fore recently broadened our communications approach  to include social media (notably Facebook and Twitter)  whilst also improving our presence in the national and  international press. The initial results are encouraging.  As mentioned in Section 2.1.4.3 where more details on  communication are given, ENISA generated 4 346 men- tions during 2014 in EU media, which is higher than  the outreach of 2013.. At the same time the number of  website visits increased (please refer to Section 2.1.4.3  for detailed data). The presence of the Agency on social  media is increasing, with the number of participants on  Facebook and Twitter doubling in the last year.  The Agency also makes good use of classical communi- cation tools. The annual report provides an extensive  reference to the achievements and the concrete impact  of Agency activities for any given year. The report shows  that the activities of ENISA aim at enhancing the security  infrastructure, regulations and culture of the Member  States and the NIS community and indirectly affect the  citizen’s life. ENISA has launched an internal consultation  process to identify the optimal form of report on the im- pact of its work to the EU citizen level.  35  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  4  Assessment of the  effectiveness of the  internal control systems  36  4 Assessment of  the effec tiveness of  the internal  control  systems  4.1 Risk management The Agency is actually using the risk assessment done by  the Internal Audit Service in 2012.  A revision of the risk management will be done during  2015.  In terms of fraud prevention and detection, the Man- agement Board adopted the Agency’s anti‑fraud strategy  and action plan in 2014.  4.2 Compliance and  effectiveness of internal  control standards  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  Compliance with these standards is compulsory for fi- nancial management.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational  structure and the internal control systems suited to the  achievement of policy and control objectives, in accord- ance with the standards and having due regard to the risks  associated with the environment in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopt- ed a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the  minimum requirements with which its internal control  systems need to comply. Previously developed inter- nal procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the Agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern during  the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the recom- mendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA and IAS).  During 2014, the Agency achieved compliance with the  internal control standards listed below.  4.2.1 Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in the ENI- SA Regulation. Mission statements for departments and  units were established based on the evolution of the or- ganisation in 2014. The roles and tasks of each depart- ment and unit are clearly defined.  4.2.2 Ethical and organisational values  (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place — including updates  and yearly reminders — to ensure that all staff are aware  of relevant ethical and organisational values (e.g. ethical  conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fraud pre- vention, reporting of irregularities). Specific training is  organised by the Agency for its staff every year in order  to reinforce professional behaviour, compliance with the  expected behaviour, ethics and integrity, and in order to  prevent workplace harassment.  4.2.3 Staff allocation and mobility  (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary, management aligns organisation- al structures and staff allocations with priorities and  workload.  4.2.4 Staff evaluation and  development (ICS 4)  In the context of the career development report (CDR)  process, discussions are held individually with all staff  to establish their annual objectives. Staff performance is  evaluated according to standards set by the Agency. An  annual training plan is developed at Agency level based  on needs deriving from the policy of the Agency. As part of  the CDR process, every year each staff member completes  an individual training plan. Management ensures that at  a minimum every staff member attends the compulsory  training courses defined in the annual training plan.  4.2.5 Objectives and performance  indicators (ICS 5)  The work programme and budget preparation procedures  were developed in 2009 and revised in 2014. The annu- al work programme (WP) of the Agency is developed by  the Agency services, with continuous input and guidance  from its two governing bodies, the Management Board  and the permanent stakeholders group. The WP clearly  sets out how the planned activities at each management  level contribute to the achievement of objectives, taking  into account the resources allocated and the risks identi- fied. The WP objectives are established on SMART (spe- cific, measureable, achievable, relevant, time‑bound) cri- teria and are updated during the year in order to address  significant changes in priorities and activities.  37  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  The role of the Executive Board is to assist preparing  decisions to be adopted by the Management Board on  administrative and budgetary matters only.  The Agency has based the measurement of its perfor- mance on key performance indicators (KPIs) that are ap- plied to all areas of activity. KPIs are more qualitative for  the Agency’s operational goals, whereas they are more  quantitative for the Agency’s administrative goals. The  effectiveness of key controls is assessed using relevant  KPIs, including self‑assessments that have been car- ried out in the form of progress reports and follow up  actions that seek to re‑align divergences from the work  programme.  The Agency’s work programmes are annual and multi‑an- nual. The MB and the PSG give orientation and input on  a regular basis throughout the WP development process  as well as during the year of implementation.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed again to optimise the  budget execution for 5 consecutive years. The commit- ment rate of budget appropriations available for the year  2014 (C1) reached 100 %, another consecutive year in  which the total Agency budget was consumed.  4.2.6 Risk management process  (ICS 6)  The IAS performed a risk assessment of the Agency in  2012. Risks identified as very important during the pre- vious audits were addressed by the Agency and actions  were planned and communicated to the IAS accordingly.  In 2014, effort and resources were devoted to addressing  and mitigating the risks that had been identified. This sat- isfactorily addressed the recommendations of both the  ECA and IAS, as noted in their annual reports.  4.2.7 Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned and  communicated by means of the Executive Director’s deci- sions (EDD). It conforms to regulatory requirements and is  appropriate to the level of importance of the decisions to  be taken as well as the risks involved. All delegated, author- ising officers have received and acknowledged the Charter  of the role and responsibility of the authorising officer (by  delegation) as well as the individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined, re- corded and kept up to date. It records derogations grant- ed to allow staff to remain in sensitive functions beyond  5 years along with documentation of the risk analysis  and the controls for mitigation.  Due care has been taken in order to avoid potential con- flict of interest situations. However, due to the small size  of the Agency, the mobility of staff in sensitive functions  is very limited and takes into account service needs and  available resources. Proper back‑ups are designated in  order to ensure business continuity.  4.2.8 Processes and procedures  (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen the Pro- cesses and Procedures Internal Control Standard. The  Agency created a policy on financial circuits. The roles  and responsibilities of financial actors are described in  this policy as well as existing workflows.  A code of professional conduct for ex‑ante financial ver- ification was developed. This document emphasises the  role and responsibilities of the Financial Verifying Agent.  The Agency proceeded in 2014 with the full 2013 ex‑post  control exercise and will deliver the 2014 ex‑post control  report in the first quarter of 2015.  Importantly in 2014, a quality management system was  implemented strengthening the performance manage- ment of the Agency.  4.2.9 Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The Management Team, which comprises the  Executive Director and the heads of departments and  units, meets weekly and sets priorities for the actions  to be taken in order to achieve the short- and medi- um‑term objectives of the Agency. A list of action items  is compiled. It contains all agreed actions as allocated  to specific departments or units. The list is published  on a dedicated Intranet page and regularly reviewed by  the management team. Management supervision cov- ers both legality and regularity aspects (i.e. set‑up and  compliance with applicable rules) and operational per- formance (i.e. achievement of Annual WP objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in order to  address accepted ECA and IAS audit recommendations  38  4 Assessment of  the effec tiveness of  the internal  control  systems  and monitors the implementation of these action plans  throughout the year.  The implementation of the project management tool  MATRIX, has enhanced the planning, implementation,  monitoring and reporting of operational projects, and  has enabled the establishment of a common project  management framework across different organisational  units of the Agency.  4.2.10 Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and dep- utising arrangements for relevant operational activities  and financial transactions — are in place to ensure the  continuity of all services during ‘business‑as‑usual’ inter- ruptions (such as sick leave, staff mobility, migration to  new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT business continuity plan (BCP) has been developed  and implemented. An Agency‑wide BCP, designed to cov- er crisis response and recovery arrangements with re- spect to major disruptions, has been developed and fully  implemented. The latter BCP identifies the functions,  services and infrastructure that need to be restored  within certain time limits and the resources necessary  for this purpose. Electronic and hard copy versions of  both BCPs are stored in secure and easily accessible loca- tions, which are known to relevant staff.  4.2.11 Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related pro- cedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory security  measures; (2) provisions on document management;  and (3) rules on the protection of personal data. Infor- mation security policy specific to data categorisation and  labelling is in place. As regards the exchange of informa- tion classified at the level RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED,  an administrative arrangement between the Security Di- rectorate of the European Commission and the Agency  was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets out the  conditions according to which documents need to be  registered, filed and saved using the Agency’s registra- tion and filing systems. A special, intranet‑based tool was  developed to capture the information needed to register  and retrieve documents. In addition, an incoming and  outgoing mail procedure was developed.  4.2.12 Information and communication  (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices are in  place for sharing information and monitoring activities.  These include regular management team meetings dur- ing which issues relevant to performance, audit results  and financial information are discussed, and actions are  decided upon and assigned. Regular financial reporting is  available to all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All engagements  in new projects are discussed during the implementation  of the annual work programme and decisions are docu- mented and communicated.  An external communication strategy is in place. ICT se- curity policies are in place for main systems and sub-sys- tems, and described in procedures and policies. Internal  communication is also supported through use of the in- tranet and through weekly staff meetings within units.  External communication and dissemination procedures  must be further developed and communicated to staff  accordingly.  The weekly Staff Meeting is used as platform of com- munication between all departments. Every week, staff  members can share their work with the rest of the  Agency.  4.2.13 Accounting and financial  reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are document- ed in the Internal Control Manual of the Agency. The  preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting  on budget implementation is centralised in the Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Section, within the Admin- istration and Support Department. The European Com- mission’s budget and accounting management system,  ABAC, is the main tool used for financial management. It  is compliant with applicable financial regulatory frame- works. The ABAC assets module is used for the manage- ment of ENISA’s inventory. Financial management infor- mation produced by the Agency, including financial infor- mation provided in the annual activity report, complies  with applicable financial and accounting rules.  4.2.14 Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to measure  the performance and assess the impact of the Agency’s  projects as provided for in its Annual work programmes.  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  The General Report and the Annual Activity Report are  the tools used by the Agency to report on performance  and impact. The feedback of relevant stakeholders is tak- en into account.  4.2.15 Assessment of internal control  systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the compliance  of annual activities and performance with the internal  control systems in place, as part of preparation of the  Annual Activity Report.  4.2.16 Internal audit capability (ICS 16)  The head of the Administration and Support Department  assumes the internal control coordination (ICC) function.  He is responsible for implementing internal control sys- tems in the Agency and liaising with the IAS of the Euro- pean Commission. As the Agency lacks human resources,  the role of Internal  Audit Capability (IAC) cannot be performed. Since 2005,  the Agency has relied on the IAS to carry out internal au- dits. The IAS plays a key role in auditing bodies of the  European Union.  Internal control tasks performed in ENISA include 100 %  of ex‑ante verifications, annual ex‑post controls, hierar- chical controls and outsourced engagements, coordinat- ed by the ICC.  In line with the Strategic Audit Plan 2013‑2015, the In- ternal Audit Service (IAS) carried out in 2014 a control  ‘on the spot’. Out of 25 open recommendations in 2014,  there is only one left open, which will be closed early  2015. The role of ICC was reinforced in order to comply  with all the recommendations issued by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control sys- tem, generally the Agency complies with the three as- sessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that have  the requisite knowledge and skills; (2) systems and pro- cedures designed and implemented to manage the key  risks effectively; and (3) no instances of ineffective con- trols that have exposed the Agency to substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of the con- tinuous improvement of management procedures. It  includes taking into account any control weaknesses re- ported and exceptions recorded.  40  5 Management assurance  5  Management assurance  41  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  5.1 Review of the elements  supporting assurance  The risk framework is used as a common means of clas- sifying and communicating risk across the agency. It pro- vides a common understanding and language regarding  ‘risk’, as well a structure for the assessment, reporting  and monitoring of risk. The risk framework defines the  categories, subcategories and business risks applicable at  the organisational level, for ENISA as a whole. It includes:  • Risk categories and subcategories  • Risks specific to each category (business risks)  • Risk definition  Assessment by management:  The Agency’s operations are channelled through the follow- ing activity areas that belong to administrative functions:  • Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with the annual work programme in terms of opera- tional and administrative activities.  • Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be in‑sourced  by the Agency. External agents are appointed either  through a procurement procedure or through a call  for expressions of interest for funding related to the  co‑organisation of events. Alternatively, in the case  of working group members, they may be chosen by  means of a selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its adminis- trative activities, the Agency has carried out the activities  presented in the table below:  Systemic process Activity Performance indicator  1 Follow up on auditor’s comments and rec- ommendations regarding ADM practices and  procedures as they are implemented in line  with financial regulation (FR), implementing  rules (IR) and staff regulations (SR).  Update of documents and activi- ties reporting.  Feedback by auditors in the next application period and  overall improvement of performance.  2 Opening and closing of the annual budget  and preparation of budgetary statements.  Approved budget tree opened,  appropriations posted properly.  Annual budget lines open and running by the end of the year  with the anticipated budget, economic outturn account and  supporting operations completed in time.  3 Implementation and consolidation of inter- nal controls, as appropriate.  Annual review of internal  controls.  Guidelines and checklists reviewed, annual risk assessment  done. Controls updated accordingly. Staff participation and  information.  4 Performance evaluation Organise annual performance  evaluation. Administer appeals  Number of evaluations carried out.  5 Annual training programme Draft the generic training plan of  the Agency.  Document presentation and implementation of programme.  6 Recruitment plan Execute the Agency recruitment  plan in line with the establish- ment pan.  Number of staff hired to cover new posts or make up for  resignations.  7 Internal ICT networks and systems Secure ICT networks and systems  in place.  Results of external security assessment/ audit.  8 Public procurement Regular, consistent observation  of public procurement practices  and appropriate assistance pro- vided to all departments.  Clear mandate of the procurement function established, staff  informed, forms available, number and type of procurement  processes handled, files of procurement processes organ- ised, and files for audit available. List of number of purchase  orders per supplier, number of complaints processed.  9 Contract management General support on contract  management.  Number of contracts prepared and signed by the Agency,  number of requests for support received from departments,  number of claims processed.  10 Ex‑ante controls Well developed at procedural,  operational and financial levels.  Number of transactions as compared to number of errone- ous transactions.  11 Ex‑post controls Well developed and done on an  annual basis  Number of transactions as compared to number of errone- ous transactions.  42  5 Management assurance  5.2 Exceptions In 2014, the Agency recorded 18 exceptions. Only four  are with high materiality. For three of these cases, the  root of the problem was the late opening of the financial  tool ABAC and one case is with regard to the payment of  the rent to the Greek authorities of the Athens building  (delay in receiving the funds from the Greek authorities  to pay the rent led to an ‘a posteriori’ commitment).  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors. The  results are contained in the reports listed. These reports  result from a systematic analysis of the evidence availa- ble. This approach provides sufficient guarantees on the  completeness and reliability of the information reported,  and results in complete coverage of the budget delegat- ed to the Executive Director of ENISA.  43  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  43  6  Declaration of assurance  44  6 Declaration of  assurance  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  In my capacity as authorising officer  Declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view (9).  State that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described  in this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles  of sound financial management, and that the control procedures put in place give the  necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my  disposal, such as the results of the self‑assessment, ex‑post controls, the work of the internal  audit capability, the observations of the Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the  reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year of this declaration.  Confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here which could harm the interests  of the agency.  Heraklion, 08.06.2015  [signed]  Udo Helmbrecht Executive Director  (9) True and fair in this context means a reliable, complete and correct view on the state of affairs in  the service.  45  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  Annexes  46  Annexes  A.

Materiality criteria ENISA is not using any materiality criteria. Indeed 100 % of the financial transactions are submitted to the ex‑ante control  (verification before the authorisation).  In order to strengthen the controls, ENISA executes yearly the ex‑post control exercise (verification after authorisation).  The exercise methodology for sample selection is a judgmental (non‑statistical) method designed to demonstrate bias in  the selection of transactions for ex‑post control, taking into account the potential for error identified by the Agency, either  through the value of the transaction, the initiating procedure used and the Agency’s risk assessment, their documentation  or through discussion.

Interruption or delay of  the services provided due  to a late contracting (poor  planning and organisa- tion of the procurement  process).  Publication of intended  procurements/Work programme  100 % of the forecast pro- curements (open procedures  published in OJEU and web- site) are justified in a note  addressed to the AO(D)  Costs: estimation of cost  of staff involved and the  related contract values  (if external expertise is  used). Benefits: Amount of  rejections of unjustified  purchases. Estimation of litigation  avoided and eventual  discontinuation of the ser- vice provided.  Effectiveness: Number  of projected tenders  cancelled, Number of  contracts discontinued or  underutilised due to poor  planning. Efficiency: For consultan- cy-based tenders for oper- ations; average person day  cost per tender.

Benefits: limit the risk of litiga- tion, limit the risk of cancella- tion of a tender. Amount of contracts for which  the approval and supervisory  control detected material error.  Effectiveness: N° of ‘open’  or procedures where only  one or no offers were  received. N° of requests for clarifica- tion regarding the tender. Efficiency: Estimated aver- age cost of a procurement  procedure.Additional supervi-  sory verification by  specialised expert  actor or entity.  100 % of the tenders  above a financial threshold  (e.g.>60 000 €) are reviewed.

ENISA  Annual Activity  Report 2014  European Union  Agency for  Network and  Information Security  ii  A message from  the Executive Director Overview I am happy to state that 2014 was another successful year for the Agency, with ENISA maintaining its track record of  delivering according to plan and within allocated budget. At the same time, we improved the positioning of services for  our major stakeholders while ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework. On a more personal note, the Manage- ment Board approved the extension of my mandate for one more term of 5 years, which I take as a sign that the Agency  is responding well to the needs of its stakeholder communities.  External Impact Broadly speaking, ENISA’s activities can be divided into three main areas:  • Recommendations to its stakeholders  • Support for policy development and implementation  • ‘Hands on’ work with operational communities.  Throughout 2014, ENISA strengthened its contribution in each of these areas, sup- porting Member States and private sector actors in responding to a rapidly devel- oping threat environment and helping to lay solid foundations for the information  systems of the future.  Where recommendations are concerned, the Agency produced a total of 37 re- ports on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from national issues such as the protec- tion of critical infrastructure to issues affecting individual citizens such as privacy  and data protection. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an example of such a report.  This document offers a consolidated picture of threat information collected from  public sources throughout the globe and presents the top threats and the way in  which they are evolving in distinct business areas. One of the strengths of the ENI- SA Threat Landscape approach is that it provides useful information to a diverse set  of stakeholder communities.  The work carried out in the area of Article 13a of the Telecommunications Framework Directive of 2009 continues to be  the best known example of where ENISA is working to support policy initiatives; in addition to this we are active in a num- ber of policy initiatives, including support for the eIDAS legislation [11] and preparing for implementation of the proposed  NIS Directive [3] and Data Protection legislation [10].  The pan‑European Exercise continues to provide valuable insight into the way in which operational communities collab- orate across the EU in order to respond to serious NIS incidents that affect several Member States. Previous exercises al- lowed the Member States to develop a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for handling such incidents. The 2014  exercise, which is based on the participation of operational teams spread throughout the EU was used to test and further  develop these procedures. Building on this past experience, the 2014 exercise introduced a new level of sophistication by  Udo Helmbrecht  iii  explicitly testing the tactical, operational and strategic phases of response to an incident in separate steps. The third phase  of this exercise, which concerns the strategic response, will be carried out in 2015.  Article 14 requests, which are essentially a mechanism that allows Member States and EU institutions to request specific  items of work of the Agency outside the work programme execution process, continue to be popular. ENISA received 12  new requests in 2014 and continued to work on 19 ongoing requests (including 2013) from following countries: Austria,  Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxemburg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Spain and  from the European Commission.  Internal improvements In order to support the new mandate and further improve the operational model based on two locations, I introduced  a new organisational structure in October 2014. This new structure is dictated by the new challenges identified in the  rapidly changing operating environment with the limited number of human resources at the Agency’s disposal.  In addition, a large refurbishment project was conducted to improve the working conditions of the staff located in Athens.  This refurbishment did not impact the delivery of ENISA work programme and the Agency delivered on time and within  budget. The newly refurbished building not only represents a significant improvement in the daily lives of our operation- al staff, but is also better equipped from an IT and telecommunications perspective, which should also result in further  performance gains.  Conclusions 2014 has been another very successful year for the Agency. It has been a year in which we have strengthened our relations  with our stakeholders and assisted them in making significant improvements to the state of cyber security throughout the  EU. In parallel, we continue to make internal improvements that keep staff morale high and make the agency a challenging  and pleasant place to work.  I would like to end by thanking both our stakeholders and staff for their contributions to this success.

List of policy documents ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ 59  1  Introduction  2  1 Introduc tion  1.1 ENISA in brief The European Union Agency for Network and Informa- tion Security (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for cyber se- curity in Europe. ENISA supports the EU and the Member  States in enhancing and strengthening their capability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to net- work and information security problems and incidents.  ENISA’s vision is to secure and enable Europe’s informa- tion society and to use its unique competencies to help  to drive the cyber landscape in Europe.  The Agency works closely together with members of  both the public and private sector, to deliver advice and  solutions that are based on solid operational experience.  ENISA also supports the development of the European  Union (EU) policy and law on matters relating to network  and information security (NIS), thereby contributing to  economic growth in Europe’s internal market.  ENISA was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC)  No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and the Coun- cil. The Agency therefore celebrated in 2014 ten years of  successful activity in the European Cyber Security Land- scape. At the same time, 2014 is the first year of the new  mandate of the Agency. Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (1)  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May  2013 concerning the European Union Agency for Net- work and Information Security extends ENISA’s mandate  until 19 June 2020.  ENISA’s strategic objectives include: (i) developing and  maintaining a high level of expertise of EU actors tak- ing into account evolutions in network and information  security (NIS); (ii) assisting the Member States and the  Commission in enhancing capacity building throughout  the EU; (iii) assisting the Member States and the Com- mission in developing and implementing the policies  necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements  of network and information security; and (iv) enhancing  cooperation both between the Member States of the EU  and between related NIS communities.  According to article 4 of Regulation 526/2013, the Agen- cy is comprised of the Management Board (MB); the  Executive Director and staff; and the Permanent Stake- holders Group (PSG). In order to contribute to enhancing  the effectiveness and efficiency of the operation of the  Agency, the MB has established an Executive Board.  (1) For the links and names of all relevant policy documents  mentioned in this report please see Annex G.  The MB holds its ordinary meeting to adopt decisions on  budgetary and administrative matters as well as rules im- plementing provisions of ENISA Regulation No 526/2013  and Staff Regulations. The Board also adopts planning  documents such as annual work programme, multi‑an- nual staff policy plan, statement of estimates and others.  The PSG is an advisory body in respect of the agency’s  performance of its activities. It also advises the Executive  Director on drawing up a proposal for the Agency’s work  programme. Two PSG meetings were held as planned  during the 2014.  1.2 The year in brief 2014 was another successful year for the Agency. As can  be seen in Section 2, ENISA delivered according to plan  and within the allocated budget, improving its roles and  the positioning of its services to its stakeholders while  ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework.  Building on its renewed regulatory framework, ENISA  was particularly active in:  • Supporting EU policy building by developing and main- taining high level of expertise related to NIS, facilitat- ing voluntary information, establishing mutual inter- actions, contributing to EU policy initiatives and sup- porting EU in education research and standardisation.  • Supporting capacity building of EU Member States,  public and private sectors as well as contributing to  raising the level of awareness of EU citizens.  • Supporting the implementation of EU legislation re- lated to NIS and supporting cooperation between all  stakeholders relevant and active in the area of NIS.  The activities and the achievements of 2014 are present- ed in Section 2, with the more significant achievements  being also highlighted in Section 1.3. The activities are  presented by matching the achieved results against the  impact indicators and the proposed deliverables from  WP2014. The horizontal activities, such as Article 14 re- quests (2), collaboration with NLO, communication and  dissemination activities are also presented in Section 2.  (2) Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (a) the  European Parliament; (b) the Council; (c) the Commission; and  (d) any competent body appointed by a Member State, such  as a national regulatory authority could address requests for  advice and assistance falling within the Agency’s objectives  and tasks. An overview of the requests to the Agency that  were addressed during 2014 is included in section 2.1.4.1.  3  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  To support the new mandate and activities based in two  locations, in line with the operational and horizontal ob- jectives of the Agency, ENISA’s structure (see Section 3.4  and Annex A) was reorganised by the Executive Director  in October 2014. The Agency’s organisational structure is  dictated by the new challenges identified in the rapidly  changing operating environment with the limited number  of human resources at the Agency’s disposal. During 2014,  a large refurbishment project was conducted to improve  the working conditions of the staff located in Athens. This  refurbishment did not impact the delivery of ENISA work  programme and the Agency delivered in time and within  budget. The management of resources is described in Sec- tion 3 while more information is provided on assessment  and management assurance in Sections 4 and 5.  The document includes also a set of annexes proving  more details for this report.  In September 2014, the Management Board endorsed  the extension of the mandate of the Executive Director  of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht for one more term of 5 years.  1.3 Summary  1.3.1 Key performance indicators  Whilst the agency delivered against its annual work pro- gramme, it is worth highlighting that all deliverables met  or exceeded the key performance indicators set (see Sec- tion 2.1 for more details). Some of these achievements  are outlined here and examples are provided on how the  agency achieved its goals.  1.3.1.1  Supporting EU policy building.  Identifying evolving threats,  risks and challenges  • Impact Indicator (I.I.1.1-1): The ENISA Threat Land- scape becomes an important point of reference for se- curity experts worldwide and is referenced in at least  10 security related information sources worldwide.  • Achieved results: Achieved: More than 20 different or- ganisations are using the conclusions of ENISA’s Threat  Landscape report 2014. Several hundred references to  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013 have been made via the  main cyber security web pages and blogs.  • NB: The number of organisations quoting the ENISA  Threat Landscape deliverables is significantly above  expectations.  1.3.1.2 Supporting EU policy building.  Contributing to EU policy initiatives  • Impact Indicator (I.I.1.2-3): Five Member States eID  competent bodies/authorities, five independent  auditing bodies and five trust service providers take  part in the development of a common audit frame- work for trust service providers.  • Achieved results: Achieved: In total, more than 35  stakeholders requested to review the draft docu- ment, including FESA members (Member States),  TSPs and auditing bodies. The paper underwent re- views in various stages of the development process.  • NB: ENISA set of recommendations for TSPs devel- oped in 2014-2015 is becoming a real point of refer- ence for European TSPs in their daily work.  1.3.1.3 Support capacity building. Support  Private Sector Capacity Building  • Impact Indicator (I.I.2.2-3): 15 Cloud Computing  Providers and five Member States competent au- thorities contribute to ENISA’s study on minimum  security measures for cloud computing.  • Achieved results: Achieved: 20 Cloud providers and  12 Member States participating in the study for  Cloud Certification Metaframework.  • NB: ENISA collected the ICT security requirements  for the public sector from 12 Member States. This  study was greatly complemented by the input from  the community, which was a great undertaking for  ENISA to centralise all the information.  1.3.1.4 Support cooperation.  Implementation of EU legislation  • Impact Indicator (I.I.3.2-1): 23 Member States con- tribute to ENISA’s work on the implementation of  Article 13a and 12 Member states directly use the  outcomes of this work by explicit references or by  adopting the same approach nationally.  • Achieved results: Achieved. All 28 Member States  plus two EFTA Countries sent to ENISA and the Com- mission annual summary reports about incidents  that occurred in 2013. All Member States use the  ENISA Technical Guideline on Article 13a Incident  Reporting in their annual reporting. More than 12  Member States and some of the larger European  Electronic Communications Providers use directly  4  1 Introduc tion  or refer to the ENISA Technical Guideline on Secu- rity Measures. During 2014, ENISA performed three  workshops with the Article 13a Expert Group at- tended by NRAs from around 20 Member States.  • NB: ENISA reports in this area rely now on input  from all EU Member States and two EFTA countries  and are used by more than 12 Member States and  service providers.  1.3.1.5 Support cooperation.  Crisis cooperation — exercises  • Impact Indicator (I.I.3.1-1): At least 24 EU Member  States and EFTA countries confirm their support for  Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014).  • Achieved results: Achieved: CE 2014 involved 1400 ex- perts and over 450 teams, with an equal representa- tion from the public and private sector (n/g CERTs,  cyber security agencies, public sector teams, Telecom  Operators, Energy Sector Companies). Over all the  different phases of Cyber Europe 2014 there were 29  different participating countries (26 EU MS, 3 EFTA)  and the EU Institutions. In the first phase of CE2014  (TLEx) over 600 experts were involved, coming from  214 teams representing both private and public sector  institutions (n/g CERTs, cyber security agencies, public  sector entities, telecom operators, energy sector com- panies etc.). In the second phase of CE2014 (OLEx)  over 800 experts were involved. An impressive num- ber of over 1400 experts were involved in the exercis- es in some way during CE2014. Member States have  declared their satisfaction with the exercise through  evaluation surveys and through communications via  the ENISA Management Board members and NLOs.  • NB: This activity had a record number of partici- pants and it is worth mentioning also the number  of Member States involved and the participation of  private sector.  1.3.2 Policy highlights of the year  The policy highlights of 2014 were as follows:  • Successful execution of the pan‑European cyber se- curity exercise  • ENISA support of EU policy and legislation  • Publication of recommendations in a number of ar- eas central to NIS policy  The successful completion of the tactical and operation- al phases of the 2014 pan-European cyber security ex- ercise marks a significant step in improving the level of  preparedness of the EU for a major cyberattack targeting  several Member States. Previous exercises allowed the  Member States to develop a set of Standard Operating  Procedures (SOP) for handling such incidents. The 2014  exercise, which is based on the participation of opera- tional teams spread throughout the EU is now being  used to test and further develop these procedures. The  third phase of this exercise, which concerns the strategic  response, will be carried out in 2015.  ENISA carried out a number of activities that directly or  indirectly support EU policy initiatives. The Agency sup- ported the Commission and the Member States in the  development of a common audit framework for trust ser- vice providers in the context of the eIDAS regulation. In  parallel, the Agency continues to support Member States  in the implementation of Article 13a of the Telecommu- nications Framework Directive. The reports that are pub- lished by the Agency and which reflect data collected  through this process provide a valuable insight into the  risks affecting telecommunications infrastructure.  The Agency continues to support developments in the  area of data protection by producing targeted studies  illustrating how the concepts underlying the proposed  new legislation can be implemented in real operational  environments. Indeed, ENISA is uniquely positioned to  assist the private sector in implementing more effective  tools and procedures in this area.  Finally, ENISA published a number of studies that provide  concrete advice and recommendations to its stakeholders  in a variety of areas central to current NIS policy. The ENI- SA Threat Landscape is a good example of a study that is  interesting to all ENISA stakeholders, providing a descrip- tion of the top threats and how they apply to different  business models. Other ENISA studies provide advice and  guidance in areas that are key to economic growth, such  as Cloud Computing, SCADA systems, SMART cities and  the protection of Critical Information Infrastructure.  1.3.3 Key conclusions on the  effectiveness of the internal  control systems and financial  management  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  5  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  Compliance with these standards is compulsory for fi- nancial management.  The Agency has also put in place an organisational struc- ture and a set of internal control systems that are suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which it  operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the min- imum requirements that its internal control systems need  to comply with. Previously developed internal procedures  were grouped together, prioritised and implemented in  the daily workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern during  the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the recom- mendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA and IAS).  During 2014, the Agency achieved compliance with the  internal control standards. For more details please refer  to Sections 3 to 6 and to the Annexes of this report.  1.3.4 Information for the stakeholders  Whilst ENISA has aligned its activities with the EU policy  agenda and is delivering high quality results, the growing  demand to secure our infrastructures and economy call  for ENISA’s proactivity in in the area of NIS.  Recently ENISA assessed both the current cyber-threat  landscape and upcoming trends. While significant chang- es in top threats, increased complexity of attacks, suc- cessful internationally coordinated operations of law  enforcement and security vendors have been noted,  successful attacks on vital security functions of the Inter- net can also be observed. Positive developments can be  attributed to successful law enforcement operations and  to the mobilisation of the cyber‑security community.  But there is an alarming side to the threat landscape:  • Core security protocols of the Internet have been  under massive stress.  • Massive data breaches demonstrated how effective- ly cyber-threat agents abuse security weaknesses of  businesses and governments.  • Privacy and personal data breaches have weakened  the trust of users in the Internet.  • Increased sophistication and advances in target- ed campaigns have demonstrated new qualities of  attacks.  It is evident that these cyber-threat dynamics dictate the  need for a better orchestration of all relevant stakehold- ers. Some of the conclusions arising out of this assess- ment are:  • It is imperative to increase cyber‑threat knowledge  through cooperation: The ‘publicity’ of threat infor- mation in related media is quite high. In the future  it will be necessary to establish cooperation (consol- idate efforts) among various players in the field to  quickly obtain quality information on cyber threats  and on defence measures. As Cyber-Europe has  demonstrated, cooperation and coordination is key  to effective response to cyber‑security incidents.  • Capability building in cyber‑threat assessment and  defence is of strategic importance: Sophistication of  cyber threats are increasing. We see currently de- fence practices from the past losing efficiency (i.e.  classical signature‑based anti‑virus). Methods used  by high capability threat actors today are adopted  by cyber criminals tomorrow. This increases chal- lenges in capability building.  • It is vital to collect accurate information on success- ful cyber‑security incidents: The unknown number  of breaches and security incidents is of major con- cern to security experts and in particular to law  enforcement. Breach notification needs to be put  on a wider basis via corresponding regulations in  various areas/sectors, eventually covering end‑user  impact. This will help assessing the currently large  grey numbers assumed.  • Increased agility in security response is essential:  The high speed of changes in cyber-threat landscape  makes agile response indispensable. Information on  cyber threats should be the key parameter in active- ly adapting security protection practices towards  a more agile management of security at all (techni- cal, organisational and policy) levels.  ENISA seeks to support the NIS community, the Member  States and the EU institutions in the coordination of bet- ter mechanisms and improved means to support the pol- icy agenda of the EU. ENISA will continue to contribute  its expertise to support NIS in Europe in the context of  the current threat landscape and the current challenges  in the area of NIS.  6  2 Polic y achievements  2  Policy achievements  7  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  2.1 Achievement of general  and specific policy  objectives  The core activities of ENISA for 2014 have been grouped  into three work streams (WS). This section follows the  same structure for reporting as the structure of the ENI- SA work programme 2014. The three streams of activity  during 2014 were:  • WS1: ‘Support EU policy building’ designed to sup- port the policy-making process by making available  to policy‑makers consolidated information on the  emerging threat landscape and by formulating key  messages to the Member States on how to ensure  that their policies and capabilities are aligned with  EU objectives, taking into account lessons learned  within the different Member States. This involves  the unification of available information sources  under a common context and will also require the  involvement of important stakeholders in the are- as of threat assessment, risk mitigation and policy  definition.  • WS2: ‘Support capacity building’ addressed a num- ber of activities designed to assist both the public  sector and private sector in the Member States in  protecting critical information infrastructures (CIIP).  By facilitating cooperation and coordination be- tween public and private sectors within the Mem- ber States, ENISA continues to support the develop- ment of policies, measures, and recovery strategies  to meet the challenges of a continuously evolving  threat environment.  • WS3: ‘Support cooperation’ was about strengthen- ing NIS in the European single market. Cooperation  strengthens the capacities of Member States, EU  institutions and third countries and helps them to  deal with crises. The approach builds upon existing  collaboration in existing communities, further en- hancing community building in Europe and beyond.  This work also looked at the development of tools to  facilitate and improve the international communica- tion and interchange of security relevant informa- tion within communities sharing the same interest  in different Member States.  In the following sections, we will focus on each of these  streams of activities. After a general presentation of the  policy achievements, more detailed information is pro- vided matching planned activities and the achieved re- sults. Detailed tables are provided showing the proposed  Impact Indicators and how they were achieved as well as  the proposed deliverables and the achieved publications  or activities.  2.1.1 Policy achievements in WS1‑  Support EU policy building  The following work packages constitute Work Stream 1.  For each work package, the main objectives and policy  achievements are identified.  • WPK1.1. Identifying evolving threats, risks and  challenges  ▪ The main objective of this work package was  to collect and collate current data in order to  develop the ENISA threat landscape. It includes  current threats, as well as threat trends in NIS  and emerging technologies. The threat land- scape is based on existing publicly available  material on threats, risks and trends.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of threats and risks, supporting ENISA objec- tives and mandate as well as Council Resolu- tion on a collaborative European approach to  network and information security:  ◦ ENISA developed a perspective of the Euro- pean landscape of the NIS gaps and needs.  The deliverables on threat landscape pro- vide a European perspective based collected  ENISA lists top cyber‑threats in this years  Threat Landscape Report  8  2 Polic y achievements  threats (e.g. incorporating information on  European companies such as size, type of  business, etc.).  ◦ The ENISA Threat Landscape 2014 was de- veloped as continuation of the work started  in 2012. Compared to previous years, there  is noticeable improvement in the quality of  threat information collected within related  organisations. The improvements in infor- mation collection were based on liaison  with sources of threat information to es- tablish effective dissemination of generated  information.  ◦ Analysis and assessment of previous year  forecasts was carried out.  • WPK1.2. Contributing to EU policy initiatives.  ▪ The main objective of this work package was to  provide input to new policy initiatives before they  are launched and to assist the European Commis- sion and the Member States in implementing  such policies initiatives with an NIS perspective.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area of  cloud, supporting EU’s cloud computing strategy  and partnership:  ◦ ENISA continues to play an active role in the  implementation of the EU’s cloud computing  strategy. The Agency provides technical ad- vice, recommendations and good practices  to Commission’s Selected Industry Groups  in Cloud Computing (C‑SIGs). ENISA is the  leader of the C‑SIG on certification publish- ing two tools (Cloud Certification Schemes  List and Cloud Certification Schemes Meta- framework available here: https://resilience. enisa.europa.eu/cloud‑computing‑certifica- tion) fulfilling in this way the first objective  of the strategy. The Agency also participated  in the C‑SIG on SLAs and Code of Conduct.  ◦ ENISA organised the 3rd Secure Cloud con- ference offering an interesting agenda for  2 days (SecureCloud2014). The conference  was opened by Commission’s Vice‑Presi- dent Kroes and involved many high‑level  presentations from both public and private  sector experts.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of smart grid, supporting EU’s Smart Grids  strategy:  ◦ Since 2013, ENISA assists the Commission,  Member States and the private sector in  the implementation of the EU’s smart grids  strategy. The Agency provides technical ad- vice, recommendations and good practices  in the area of minimum security measures  for smart grids, certification of smart grid  components, privacy profile of smart me- ters, and incident reporting mechanisms. In  2014, the smart grid security measures were  adopted by the Smart Grid Task Force of the  European Commission.  ◦ To enhance this work the European Com- mission organised a dissemination work- shop for the smart grid security measures  with representatives from the private and  public sector reaching out to the greater  community. The outcome of this workshop  is a decision of the European Commission  to fund a study on costs and incentives of  implementation of these security measures.  ◦ ENISA initiated collaboration with SOGIS  (Senior Officials Group for Information  Systems Security) on ICT security certifi- cation. Together with the EU, the Agency  jointly organised a workshop on IT security  certification as a competitive advantage of  European industry.

Technical protection measures to prevent  data breaches, specified in legal documents  such as European Commission regulation  611/2013, need to be matched with tech- nical specifications in order to secure per- sonal data. During 2014, ENISA updated the  recommendations published during 2013  and extended them to cover more applica- tion scenarios such as cloud computing.  ◦ In 2014, ENISA published its first best prac- tice guide for prevention of data leakage  and appropriate controls for the access of  data using security and privacy by design  and by default to support with a technical  perspective the policy requirements for  data protection.  ◦ Furthermore ENISA organised an event,  the Annual Privacy Forum (APF’2014), to  establish a forum fostering the exchange  of information and experiences between  the research and academic communities,  and the EU policy and industry repre- sentatives in the area of privacy and data  protection. The event, organised together  with European Commission DG CONNECT  followed the success of the first edition of  APF’2012. The focus of the event was to  bring a strong technical perspective to the  debate, to focus on mechanisms to protect  personal data, and to allow different com- munities to exchange best practices.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of EU electronic identification and trust servic- es framework, supporting the new regulation  on trust service providers:  ◦ ENISA continued and expanded its support  focusing the recently adopted Regulation  on electronic identification and trusted ser- vices for electronic transactions in the inter- nal market. ENISA has already contributed  to this area by providing recommendations  in the areas of mechanisms for reporting se- curity breaches by the trust service provid- ers to the competent bodies and minimum  security measures and security best practic- es for trust services providers.  ◦ During 2014, ENISA focused its support  related to the implementation of the pro- visions of the proposal, with a focus on the  areas of common audit schemes for trust  services providers in Member States as  well as technical guidelines for conformity  assessment bodies performing audits and  trust service providers.  • WPK1.3. Supporting the EU in education, research  and standardisation.  ▪ During 2014, ENISA continued its efforts to sup- port EU funded R & D initiatives such as FP7 and  H2020 and standardisation activities including  EU initiatives such as the ETSI CEN CENELEC  Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG). Fur- thermore, activities have been carried out in the  area of education following the objectives of the  NIS cyber security strategy such as NIS driving li- cense and European Cyber Security Month 2014  (ECSM’2014).  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area of  standardisation, supporting NIS cyber security  strategy and the Action Plan for an innovative  and competitive Security Industry as well as  Council Resolution on a collaborative European  approach to Network and Information Security:  ◦ Since 2012, ENISA contributes actively to the  creation and work of the ETSI CEN‑CENELEC  cyber security coordination group (CSCG).  This collaboration with CSCG continued  during 2014 seeking out synergies with the  Agency’s work programme and involved  standardisation bodies in the different work  packages, as appropriate.  ◦ Responding to a request from ETSI, ENISA  participated in the review of the ETSI tech- nical specification TS 119 312 — Electronic  signatures and infrastructures (ESI) cryp- tographic suites.  10  2 Polic y achievements  ◦ In 2014, ENISA developed an inventory of  relevant standardisation activities in the  areas of NIS and privacy.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of education, supporting NIS cyber security  strategy:  ◦ Contribution to the ‘EU NIS driving li- cence’. Together with relevant stakeholder  community, ENISA coordinated the devel- opment of a road map for the implemen- tation of a ‘Network and information secu- rity driving licence’. This road map covers  the needs of different levels of education,  e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary ed- ucation. It exploits existing material and  synergies among relevant training bodies.  ◦ ENISA contributed/participated in the  evaluation of the calls of proposals for EU  funded R & D published by the European  Commission and provides advice via advi- sory boards for EU funded projects.  ◦ ENISA also analysed the status of cyber  security competitions in Europe. Such  competitions could be used to trigger an  interest for the area of NIS.  ◦ During 2014 ENISA supported the Europe- an Commission in preparing the European  Cyber Security Month 2014 (ECSM’2014).  This is a continuation of the activity of  2013; during 2014 many more Member  States participated in ECSM.  2.1.1.1 General achievements.

ENISA, with this work  stream, aims to raise the level of security across Member  States and the private sector by supporting the develop- ment of relevant capabilities.  The following work packages constitute Work Stream 2.  For each work package, the main objectives and policy  achievements are identified.  • WPK 2.1. Support Member States’ capacity building  ▪ The objective of this work package is to sup- port the development of prevention, detection,  analysis and response capabilities within Mem- ber States institutions and EU institutions.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area of  cyber security strategies, supporting the Digital  Agenda and the EU cyber security strategies:  ◦ ENISA continues to support Member  States in developing their capabilities in  the area of National Cyber Security Strat- egies (NCSS). The Agency, building on  previous work in the area of NCSS, acted  during 2014 as facilitator among Member  States and fostered the sharing of good  practices. In 2013, ENISA created a map of  cyber security strategies; in 2014, this be- came a central point of information on ex- isting strategies from the EU and across the  world. The map is updated regularly (and  is available at: http://www.enisa.europa. eu/activities/Resilience‑and‑CIIP/nation- al‑cyber‑security‑strategies‑ncsss/nation- al-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world).  ◦ ENISA took stock of existing evaluation/ assessment mechanisms of NCSS, identi- fying good practices, validating them with  public and private sector and finally issuing  a white paper with practical recommen- dations on the evaluation and update of  existing NCSS. ENISA created in 2013 the  NCSS working group with experts from  the governmental agencies dealing with  NCSS. In 2014, five new Member States  representatives joined the group. The first  workshop on NCSS took place in 2014 and  gathered more than 50 participants from  the public and private sector and the Euro- pean Commission.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/tsp-auditing-framework/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/tsp-auditing-framework/ http://privacyforum.eu/news/proceedings-apf14-privacy-technologies-and-policy http://privacyforum.eu/news/proceedings-apf14-privacy-technologies-and-policy http://2014.privacyforum.eu/programme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standards-eidas https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standards-eidas https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/cybersecurity-competitions-2014-the-status-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/cybersecurity-competitions-2014-the-status-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/cybersecurity-competitions-2014-the-status-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/public-private-partnerships-in-network-and-information-security-education http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world  13  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of developing CERT capabilities, supporting  the Digital Agenda:  ◦ In 2014, ENISA built upon its work in this  area, and took stock of its work in the area  of CERTs in the last 8 years. The goal was  to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ through  a dialogue with relevant stakeholders, and  to draw a road map of CERT activities for  the coming years.  ◦ To support above‑mentioned action, on re- quest, tailored support capability building  for CERTs trainings were organised focus- ing on suitable exercises to technical staff  from EU Member States, EU institutions  and other appropriate audiences.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of regional, sector‑specific and national cyber  exercises, supporting EU Cyber cyber security  strategy:  ◦ In the past, the Agency has supported  national, regional and sectorial cyber ex- ercises efforts upon request (Art14 of the  ENISA regulation). This effort continued  in 2014 in line with the ENISA regulation,  the EU cyber security strategy and the EU  Member States’ needs.  ◦ Where appropriate the Agency collab- orated with and supported regional or  sectorial cyber exercises in a cost efficient  manner, for example by re-using exercise  planning and management knowledge and  tools from other exercises and efforts.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of National and European PPPs, supporting EU  Cyber Security Strategy:  ◦ ENISA continued to support Member States  in the development of their capabilities in  the area of national public‑private partner- ships (PPPs). A limited number of PPPs open- ly discussed with ENISA on the structure,  topics and procedures followed. This year  ENISA was able to engage with more than 12  Member States on the topic of NCSS, where  national PPPs are present. During the NISP  and NCSS meetings there were more than  15 private companies consulted on the topic.  • WPK 2.2. Support private sector capacity building  ▪ The objectives of this work package were to  focus on enhancing the capabilities of the pri- vate sector through cooperation with the pub- lic sector in several areas such as smart grids,  ICS‑SCADA, cloud computing, finance and elec- tronic communication networks. The work car- ried out in this context attempted to improve  the capacity of the Member States for dealing  with large-scale cyber incidents, by improving  the state of preparedness of the private sector  community. ENISA assisted Member States in  achieving this by providing assistance and ad- vice but did not engage in operational work.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution of the activ- ity leverage the NIS Platform as a tool to en‑ hance public private cooperation, as covered  by EU Cyber Security Strategy:  ◦ In 2014, ENISA supported the NIS platform,  the successor of EP3R, with the goal of en- gaging more targeted public and private  stakeholders, especially experts from small  industry players. ENISA supported the work- ing groups and their chairpersons (e.g. via  the resilience portal, conference calls), con- tributing to the outcomes of the working  groups, and ensuring its quality. The Agency  kept the working groups informed about  the latest developments in their respective  areas including deliverables published by  the Agency (e.g. art. 13 a working group).  ◦ The NIS platform community has grown ex- ponentially: Over 500 participants from all  Member States, involvement of public, pri- vate sector and academia. The NISP working  groups called for future research and evolu- tion of security practices for large and SMEs.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution of the activi- ty on Provide advice and assistance to targeted  stakeholder communities, as covered by EU cy‑ ber security strategy and CIIP action plan:  ◦ In 2014, the Agency also took stock of exist- ing initiatives on the certification of cyber se- curity skills of ICS‑SCADA experts and issued  practical recommendations to stakeholders  for the wide deployment of such schemes.  A workshop under the topic was organised,  bringing together 60 experts from this com- munity (public and private sector).  14  2 Polic y achievements  ◦ ENISA runs an expert group with 15 ex- perts from utilities manufactures vendors  and public authorities. In addition, ENISA  is supporting and contributing to the EURO  SCSIE group, a recognised WG on ICS SCA- DA security.  ◦ As an additional study, ENISA issued a re- port on ‘Smart grid certification in Europe:  challenges and recommendations’ and or- ganised a validation workshop.  ◦ In the area of Cloud Computing and in  order to support cloud certification activ- ities for the EC Cloud Strategy, ENISA col- lected the ICT security requirements for  the public sector from 12 Member States.  This study has been complemented by the  community, which has been enhanced by  the effort of ENISA to centralise the in- formation collected. This undertaking has  been greatly appreciated by the European  Commission and the community.  ◦ ENISA, under the ‘Governmental clouds’  study, created a useful ‘how-to’ guide with  a step-by-step procedure the public admin- istrators would need to follow to deploy  cloud services. This study has been validat- ed by 4 user cases of cloud computing im- plementations in the Member States.  ◦ Since 2013, ENISA runs a working group  with experts from 17 Member States on  the area of governmental Clouds, which  validates and supports ENISA’s work.  ◦ ENISA provided advice in the area of fi- nance, as covered by Network and infor- mation security in the finance sector study.  ENISA study was completed by interview- ing 12 NCBs (national central banks), and  15 industry representatives. The Agency  identified possible areas of improvement  and issued recommendations that will im- prove the security of transactions in the  finance sector.  ◦ The Electronic Communications (eComms)  reference group has grown and it now  comprises of 23 providers that support  ENISA’s work on a harmonised framework  for minimum security measures.  ◦ Under this experts’ group, the Internet In- frastructure security and resilience refer- ence group was created. This group brings  together 20 technical experts in network  operations, cyber security and contin- gency, with representatives from Internet  organisations, Internet service providers,  academia and governments from 10 dif- ferent Member States. In 2014 the con- tributions of this group to the ENISA de- liverable ‘threat landscape of the Internet  infrastructure’ and ‘Methodologies for the  identification of CIIs assets and services’  were fundamental and helped to focus the  studies.  • WPK 2.3. Raising the level of preparedness of EU  citizens  ▪ The objectives of this work package were to (a)  support awareness‑raising and training activities  in Member States to develop the security dimen- sion in the use of ICTs and (b) support the organ- ization of the cyber security month by providing  expertise related to the activities of ENISA.  ▪ Achievements and evolution in the activities  linked to raising the level of preparedness of  EU citizens, supporting ENISA objectives and  the cyber security strategy:  October is European Cyber Security Month  15  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  ◦ Through its NIS expertise, ENISA partici- pated together with different stakehold- ers in actively promoting cyber security  awareness. The 2014 activities were built  on the activities from previous years; at  the same time the 2014 results provided  the priorities and the context for growth  and development for the future years.  ◦ The agency supported the European Com- mission in preparing and running the Eu- ropean Cyber Security Month (ECSM), in  October 2014. A report was also published  assessing the impact and the development  of ECSM 2014.  ◦ ENISA maintained a webpage and support- ed ECSM by providing a new self-assess- ment tool, using the ENISA knowledge da- tabase and the agencies deliverables as raw  material. ENISA established partnerships  with academic institutions and provided  information and expertise in its core areas  in order to feed the academic curricula and  the recommendations from ENISA reports.  ◦ Furthermore ENISA cooperated with educa- tional bodies to do all the preparatory activ- ities to successfully organize a cyber‑securi- ty championship from 2015 where univer- sity students will compete in proposing NIS  solutions.  2.1.2.1 General achievements.

Support cooperation  Cooperation is a necessary prerequisite for strengthen- ing the capacities of Member States, EU institutions and  the private sector. During 2014, ENISA continued to build  upon existing collaboration in existing communities, and  to further enhance community building in Europe. ENISA  continues to provide a supporting role for these com- munities, developing tools to facilitate and improve the  international communication and interchange of securi- ty relevant information within communities sharing the  same interest in different Member States.  The following work packages constitute Work Stream 3.  For each work package the main objectives and policy  achievements are identified.  • WPK 3.1. Crisis cooperation — exercises.  ▪ The objective of this work package was to pre- pare and carry out the Cyber Europe Exercise  2014, in close collaboration with all relevant  stakeholders.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of Pan-European Cyber Exercises, supporting  EU Cyber Security Strategy, CIIP Action Plan  2009 and 2011, EU Internal Security Strategy:  ◦ In 2014, ENISA organised the third pan-Eu- ropean cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014  (CE2014). This exercise built on the experi- ence gained in previous exercises and took  account of previous recommendations.  The exercise was more ambitious than pre- vious efforts, e.g., technical depth, scenar- ios, stakeholders involved, objectives, pro- cedures to be tested, complexity etc.  ◦ The exact setup and exercise plan was  agreed upon by the EU Member States and  EFTA countries, in line with the EU cyber  security strategy.  ◦ Enhancing the capacity to support and or- ganise cyber exercises. ENISA further en- hanced its methodology, seminars, train- ings and technical capabilities on the or- ganisation and management of large‑scale  cyber crisis exercises. The Agency contin- ued enhancing its capabilities for man- aging complex, distributed exercises, by  building on previous efforts in tools and  methods and by facilitating strategic part- nerships, such as the one with DG JRC. For  example, more structural links have been  established with the European Cybercrime  Centre and the European Defence Agency.  ◦ Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises ac- tivities overview. ENISA continued to sup- port Member States in the maintenance  and training of operational procedures  for cyber crisis cooperation. This and the  activities described above including key  findings in the area of Cyber Crisis Cooper- ation and Exercises (C3E) are summarised  in a report published at the end of 2014.  This report will help ENISA to reach out to  other communities/sectors with lessons  learnt from supporting exercises (achiev- ing broader impact).  ▪ In the ENISA WP 2014, an activity was pro- posed, pending the agreement of MB, covering  a possible EU-US Cybersecurity Exercise. This  activity was not carried out, in agreement with  the European Commission and the ENISA MB.  • WPK 3.2. Implementation of EU legislation.  ▪ The objectives of this work package were two- fold, (a) the continuation of work in the area  of Incident Reporting (Article 13a) by analysing  the received data, and (b) the preparation for  the reporting for Article 4 of the ePrivacy Di- rective and Article 15 (3) of the European Com-  (3) The Article 15 referring to ‘Security requirements applicable  to trust service providers’ in the proposed eIDAS regulation  (Commission Communication (COM(2012)238 final of 4  June 2012) changed number to Article 19 in the adopted  Regulation (EU) N°910/2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market (eIDAS Regulation), published in July 2014.  Biggest EU cyber security exercise to  date Cyber Europe 2014  19  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  mission proposal for the Regulation on eID and  trusted services.  ▪ Policy achievements and evolution in the area  of analysis of incident reporting, supporting  EU Cyber Security Strategy, Article 13a of the  revised Framework Directive on electronic  communications and Articles 4 of the ePrivacy  Directive:  ◦ ENISA continued collecting and analysing  national reports of security breaches from  NRAs in accordance with Article 13a of the  Framework Directive on electronic com- munications. The annual incident report  covering incident of 2013 was published  during 2014. All the 28 Member States  plus two EFTA countries sent to ENISA and  the European Commission the annual re- ports for 2013.  ◦ All Member States use the ENISA Technical  Guideline on Article 13a Incident Report- ing in their annual reporting. More than  12 Member States and some of the larg- er European Electronic Communications  Providers use directly or refer to the ENISA  Technical Guideline on Security Measures.  ◦ The series of Article 13a expert’s group  meeting continue by having ENISA organ- ising the 14th meeting of the group in Oc- tober 2014 in Athens.  ◦ ENISA supported the creation of a joint  WG of all the competent authorities of  implementing the Article 4 (NRAs and  DPAs) under the auspices of the European  Commission.  ◦ Despite the fact that the deliverable fore- seen in the work programme 2014 called  ‘Guidelines on Incident Reporting Scheme  for Article15’ was postponed for next year,  according to WP2014 amendments, ENI- SA created a reference group of experts,  called the Article19 EG (4), with represent- atives for 14 Member States.  (4) Refers to Article 19 ‘Security requirements applicable to trust  service providers’ of the adopted Regulation (EU) N°910/2014.  ▪ Some of the activities foreseen in ENISA  WP2014 were amended during the year and  two of the activities of WPK3.2 were cancelled  due to the fact that the respective proposed  legislation was not approved as considered in  Work programme planning. The affected activ- ities are: the Guidelines on Incident Reporting  Scheme for Article 15 (5), in the context of reg- ulation on electronic identification and trusted  services, as well as the activity intended to Sup- port the implementation of the upcoming NIS  Directive.  • WPK 3.3. Regular cooperation among NIS  communities.  ▪ The objective of this work package was to fur- ther enhance the cooperation between opera- tional communities, mainly CERTs and Law En- forcement Agencies.  ▪ Achievements and evolution in the activities  linked to NIS cooperation, supporting EU Cyber  Security Strategy, Digital agenda, the commu‑ nication on EU Internal Security Strategy:  ◦ During 2014, ENISA continued to actively  support, and when appropriate, organise  common trainings with communities such  as CERTs and LEA; two workshops from the  annual series of workshops ‘CERTs in Eu- rope’ were organised in 2014, which was  the 9th annual edition.  ◦ ENISA leveraged synergies with the Euro- pean Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), through  formal and informal cooperation channels,  where appropriate respecting the respec- tive mandates.  ◦ During 2014, the Agency continued to col- lect good practices for CERTs and LEAs, and  further enhanced the ENISA exercise and  training material. ENISA took stock of exist- ing communities and cyber security chal- lenges related to the work of CERTs and  published best practices and guidelines.  (5) Refers to Article 15 of the proposed eIDAS regulation. As  explained in previous footnotes, in the adopted Regulation  (EU) N°910/2014, this is now Article 19 ‘Security requirements  applicable to trust service providers’.  20  2 Polic y achievements  2.1.3.1 General achievements. Achievement of Impact Indicators  WS3 WS3 — Support cooperation  Nr. Impact indicator (I.I.) Achieved results  WPK3.1. WPK 3.1: Crisis cooperation — exercises  I.I.3.1‑1 At least 24 EU Member States and EFTA countries  confirm their support for Cyber Europe 2014  (CE2014)  Achieved: CE 2014 involved 1400 experts and over 450 teams, with  an equal representation of public and private sector teams (n/g  CERTs, Cybersecurity Agencies, Public Sector teams, Telecom Oper- ators, Energy Sector Companies). In the different phases of Cyber  Europe 2014 there were 29 different participating countries (26 EU  Member States, 3 EFTA) and the EU Institutions. In the first phase  of CE2014 (TLEx) over 600 experts were involved, coming from  214 teams representing both private and public sector institutions  (n/g CERTs, Cybersecurity Agencies, Public sector entities, telecom  operators, energy sector companies etc.). In the second phase of  CE2014 (OLEx) we had over 800 experts. An impressive total of  over 1400 experts were involved in the exercises in some way dur- ing CE2014. Member States have declared their satisfaction to the  exercise through evaluation surveys and through communications  via the ENISA Management Board members and NLOs.  I.I.3.1‑2 At least 80 % of Member States that are in the pro- cess of establishing National Contingency Plans by  2016 are supported by ENISA.  Achieved: One of the objectives of CE2014 was to give the op- portunity to Member States to test their national capabilities and  procedures. Out of the 29 countries (EU and EFTA) that collectively  participated in the first two phases of CE2014 (TLEx and OLEx) all  have confirmed that they have tested their national contingency  plans and capabilities. Overall 29 countries (26 EU Member States,  3 EFTA) were supported.  I.I.3.1‑3 At least 24 Member States are familiar with the op- erational procedures during cyber crisis by 2016  Achieved. The second phase of CE2014 was mainly focused on test- ing the operational procedures for cyber security cooperation in  Europe. All of the 26 countries that participated in this phase were  trained to use these procedures. In addition, the countries that  did not play in this phase had access to and received the updated  version of the SOPs within the pilot SOP portal within the Cyber  Exercise Platform.  WPK3.2. WPK 3.2: Implementation of EU legislation  I.I.3.2‑1 23 Member States contribute to ENISA’s work on  the implementation of Article 13a and 12 Member  states directly use the outcomes of this work by ex- plicit references or by adopting the same approach  nationally.

As the NLO  members are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and  interaction, in terms of outreach, effective liaison in the  Member States and dissemination, the communication  covered time‑critical announcements and information on  upcoming ENISA project related tenders, requests vacan- cy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where the  Agency contributes to (for example co‑organiser, etc.).  An assessment of the NLO section page under the ENISA  home page was carried out in an effort to revise this tool  of communication between the Agency and the NLOs.  New sections were added to this area of the ENISA web- site, such as the News from the Member States and in- formation on NLO meetings (agenda, presentations, etc.)  A generic presentation about ENISA was distributed to  the network in order to aid NLOs in their role of ‘facilita- tors’ of ENISA activities in their country.  NLOs actively supported eight (8) ENISA projects in 2014  compared to three (3) in 2013. Their contribution was  instrumental in the implementation of the European  Cyber‑Security Month (ECSM), the Smart Grid security  mandates stocktaking and the National Cyber‑Security  Strategies (NCSS) workshop and working group.  2.1.4.3 Corporate communication,  dissemination activities and outreach  Following the Agency’s re‑organisation in 2013, the com- munications team now consists of the Spokesperson (or  alternate: Corporate Communication Assistant) who col- laborates and liaises closely with the Stakeholder Commu- nication Assistant from the Core Operations Department.  Cooperation with media outlets placed emphasis on the  EU and Brussels media scene. The result was increased TV  coverage, editorials in the press and articles published in  numerous media outlets for 2014. Also the communication  was tailored towards public relations campaigns for specific  events, projects, activities and deliverables. This incorpo- rated digital communications, external communications,  media and events across the EU, promoting in a dynamic  way the digital revolution and the EU single market.  In the following subsections we cover some of the activi- ties, events, and statistics associated with our communi- cation activities.  ENISA celebrates 10 years of supporting EU cyber security  with a high‑profile event on the Future of Cyber Security Challenges  25  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  2.1.4.3.1 Celebrating a decade of contribution to  the EU’s cyber security — High level Event  2014  ENISA celebrated on 1 October its 10-year Agency pres‑ ence with a high-level event ‘10 years of securing Eu- rope’s cyber security… and beyond!’ in Brussels, recap- ping the achievements of the Agency during these ten  years, and looking ahead at the future cyber challenges  for Europe. The event also included the official launch  of the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM). For the  occasion the Agency produced relevant material:  • the 2014 High‑level event — ENISA today and in the  Future publication, providing an overview of ENISA’s  work at a policy, operational and EU level  • the ENISA cyber cooperation report looks at a dec- ade of achievement, summarising the threat land- scape, the recent developments in EU policy and the  regulatory framework.  • EU Digital Security Policy (policy) paper, which looks  into the barriers for an alternative model for the EU  cyber security industry  • 7 Information Briefs with recommendations on cy- ber security topics in several EU languages  The event focused on the European Parliament and the  new Commission of the next five years, looking ahead at  the future cyber challenges for Europe. Topics discussed  included:  • Can Cybersecurity be an Economic Enabler?  • Can we Secure Future Technologies?  • Cyber Security in the EU — achievements and future  challenges  • Showcasing in a Live Hacking demonstration  2.1.4.3.2 ENISA branding of its 10-year celebration  This year ENISA’s promotional material reflected its 10‑ year celebration. The material was distributed at the  high-level event, to special events, workshops or con- ferences, as well as to ENISA visitors and for awareness  raising.  Throughout the year an anniversary banner was visual  on all Agency corporate material, featuring on the web- site, the social media outlets, stationary and all materials  produced or used. This enhanced putting across the mes- sage on cyber security and the Agency’s presence in the  field. It also enhanced overall visual identity and contrib- uted in the effort to trigger perceptions and discussion  on cyber security.  2.1.4.3.3 Publications  ENISA is active in publishing the results of its work i.e.  reports, studies, info notes and enhancing its communi- cation and reach with various stakeholders. The Agen- cy makes a point of making the Executive Director, the  Head of Core Operations and staff members available to  communicate and provide their expertise externally to  the public. Within this context, a significant number of  interviews, editorials, and feature articles are provided  to key publications and media outlets promoting cyber  security and awareness from an official EU and respected  source.  In addition, the Agency has published numerous pub- lications with 45 work programme deliverables as well  as various ad hoc technical or policy reports, papers and  studies or other publications.  2.1.4.3.4 Multilingual approach  A key challenge always remains reaching out to diverse  publics. The communications team continues its efforts  in providing tailor made, consistent messages, using the  appropriate channels. In addition the Agency publishes  its press releases in five languages — English, German,  French, Spanish and Greek — for its stakeholders and  media.  2.1.4.3.5 Media outreach  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme gives  the Agency the opportunity to extend its reach to more  stakeholders than through direct means. Following the  successful practice of the previous years, through an en- hanced media distribution and monitoring process, the  Agency enhanced the targeting and reach of its media  work. During 2014, major accomplishments include the:  • Production and release of 23 media releases  • Publication of 103 individual news items on the ENI- SA website  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/countries-aligned-for-the-deployment-of-the-european-cyber-security-month https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/2014-high-level-event-enisa-today-and-in-the-future https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/2014-high-level-event-enisa-today-and-in-the-future https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/enisa-cyber-cooperation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2014-and-ecsm-launch/eu-digital-security-policy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014/european-cyber-security-month-recommendations-for-all https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2014/european-cyber-security-month-recommendations-for-all  26  2 Polic y achievements  • Simultaneous publication of media releases and  news items in ENISA’s social media channels (Face- book, Twitter, LinkedIn)  2.1.4.3.6 Cross media impact  ENISA generated 4 346 mentions in EU media compared  to 2 500 last year, increasing significantly its reach and  impact across the EU’s 24 languages. Directly, media re- leases on the ENISA website received more than 213 000  unique page views in 2014, while individual news sto- ries on the ENISA website received more than 84 000  direct hits. Figures continue to show a clear correlation  between peaks in web visitors and the distribution of  media releases in multiple channels, thus demonstrating  the beneficial effect of the communication and media  activity.  Total readership reached 5.4 million in total, with an In- ternet reach of 3.9 billion for the year.  2.1.4.3.7 Social media  ENISA continues its successful engagement with the on- line community through its social media outlets. All of  ENISA’s activities and deliverables are communicated via  the social media channels, and generate increasing traf- fic towards them and the Agency website, activities and  deliverables. In addition, they are incorporated in the  Agency’s communication (publications, presentations,  emails, brand material etc.) Furthermore the Agency  conducted an external analysis which showed that the  channels are updated often, achieving a better impact  and reach. In particular, social media monitoring reports  have shown an increased reach of ENISA’s channels.  Main accomplishments include:  • More than 6000 followers in the ENISA Twitter channel  • More than 2800 Tweets from the Agency’s account.  In total there were 16 625 tweets placing twitter as  the Agency’s leading social media outlet.  • 3500 Followers in the ENISA LinkedIn page  • 58 videos posted to YouTube  • Hundreds of thousands of users reached by messag- es posted by ENISA  2.1.4.3.8 Digital media  ENISA’s website continues to be the Agency’s main com- munication channel. In 2014, the efforts for improve- ment were continued and several recommendations  from the usability study performed in 2013 were imple- mented. ENISA’s website received more than 3 million  unique page views in 2014.  Technical improvements in 2014 included the develop- ment of new web tools for the Agency’s website and  portals (used by specialist expert communities) and the  application of all the security patches to the infrastruc- ture used by the ENISA site.  The dedicated portal for the European Cyber Security  Month was redesigned and enhanced with new func- tionalities to better support the ECSM initiative and its  constantly growing community.  Furthermore, the structure of the Agency’s three mini  sites in Greek, German and French was further enhanced  in 2014 in a constant effort for improvement. The struc- ture has become more user friendly and news in these  three languages is presented and read with much less  effort.  ENISA created around 46 videos and clips communicat- ing its events and activities. Indicatively we mention the  CE2014 official video clip, CE2014 official launch, the ENI- SA high‑level event and ECSM launch, the Annual Privacy  Forum 2014, and the Secure Cloud 2014. Videos are of  increasing interest to various stakeholder groups and the  Agency envisages the production of more and relevant  material for a number of its activities, helping its mes- sages to be communicated in a more interactive manner.  2.1.4.3.9 Additional outreach activities  ENISA continued actively its participation to events in- creasing visibility, involvement, recognition and aware- ness at a local, national or EU level.  Increased coverage was generated regarding ENISA’s  threat landscape report, CERT training, National Cyber  Security strategies, Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014), one  of the Agency’s flagship initiatives, and the Cloud Cer- tification Schemes Metaframework, mapping security  requirements, with its first client being the EU Commis- sion. CE2014 was the biggest pan-European cyber exer- cise to date, bringing together over 50 senior represent- atives from 23 European Union and EFTA countries, with  over 600 actors across Europe.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014/cyber-europe-2014-information/visual-material-for-cyber-europe-2014/cyber-europe-2014-video-clip https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014/cyber-europe-2014-information/visual-material-for-cyber-europe-2014/cyber-europe-2014-official-launch  27  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  A particular interest was taken in bringing the Agency  and the EU closer to the local community which was re- flected through the participation in the Model European  Union (MEU) Creta 2014, between 22-26 October 2014  in Heraklion Crete; a handover ceremony for the dona‑ tion of electronic equipment in December 2014; and an  event with the regional government celebrating ENISA’s  10-year presence in Crete. In the beginning of the year,  the former EU Vice President and Commissioner for the  Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes, visited the ENISA premises  in Athens. The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  and Europe Day are two other EU activities ENISA is ac- tively involved in, encouraging and promoting the local  community participation.  The Communications team continues its close collabo- ration with the NIS experts supporting the production  of the Info Notes activity where short expert reports  provide a pragmatic analysis on trending security issues  and themes. The activity has proven to be an important  tool which stakeholders turn to for reliable information  on security issues. Themes included the ‘Heartbleed” (6)  vulnerability and the BASH Shellshock Bug (7).  A new section ‘News from the Member States’, was  added to our webpage, following a request of the com- munity. This section covers the latest technical cyber se- curity updates from the EU Member States and is aimed  to increase interaction with the specific community.

The  QMS comprises of a set of standard operating proce- dures (SOPs) and other guidance instruments that ad- dress critical business areas. A dedicated methodology  supports the generic promulgation of operational pro- cedures of the Agency based on the Deming cycle; this  methodology allows for the setting of SMART goals and  KPIs in line with standardisation requirements in quality  management.  In 2014, a set of tools and applications were launched  to improve operational performance most notably in  the area of project management; consequently a project  management methodology and a project office facility  were made available to increase operational efficiency  and productivity, while a project management tool was  further developed to improve its fitness for purpose.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-heartbleed-a-wake-up-call/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-heartbleed-a-wake-up-call/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-heartbleed-a-wake-up-call/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-the-bash-shellshock-bug/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-the-bash-shellshock-bug/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-the-bash-shellshock-bug/at_download/fullReport  28  3 Management of  resources  3  Management  of resources  29  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  3.1 Management Board The agency is governed by the Management Board (MB),  composed of one representative from each Member  State and two representatives from the European Com- mission. EEA countries are presented as observers to  the MB. In line with Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, the  MB held its ordinary meeting in October 2014. At this  meeting, the MB adopted a number of administrative,  budgetary and management decisions. For example, the  amendments to the work programme 2014 were adopt- ed to reflect the recent adoption of the Regulation on  electronic identification and trust services (Regulation  (EU) No 910/2014) and still ongoing legislative procedure  to adopt the NIS Directive (COM(2013)48 Final).  The adoption of the ENISA anti‑fraud strategy was  among the decisions taken. Minutes and decisions of  the MB are available on the ENISA website: http://www. enisa.europa.eu/about‑enisa/structure‑organization/ management-board.  In addition, the MB Chair called for an extraordinary  meeting on the extension of the term of office of the Ex- ecutive Director. The Board decided to extend the term  of office for 5 years.  3.2 Major events During 2014, there were no major events to significant- ly impact ENISA activities and delivery against its work  programme.  3.3 Management of financial  resources  3.3.1 Budget execution of EU subsidy  (C1 funds)  In terms of budget execution, the expenditure appropria- tions corresponding to the Union contribution allocated to  ENISA and the interest generated by cash at banks during  2014, i.e. the budget of ENISA of 9 091 917.98 EUR, were  committed at a rate of 100.00 % on 31.12.2014 compared to  99.72 % on 31.12.2013.  ENISA did not cancel any appropriations of the year (C1) ap- propriations by the end of the year (cancellation rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already prov- en capacity of the Agency to efficiently use the entrusted  funds, in order to implement its annual work programme  as well as manage its administrative expenditure and  investments.  The respective payment rate on EU subsidy expenditure  appropriations as included in the MFF 2014‑2020 was  85.61 % in 2014 compared to 91.32 % in 2013. The pay- ment rate of 2014 is slightly lower than 2013. However,  the ratio of payment is high and demonstrates that the  capacity of the Agency to finalise its annual activities  and to execute the relevant payments within the year  of reference was maintained. The procurement planning  which was moved forward to the end of the preceding  year (2013) and enabled the launch of projects related  to the work programme in early 2014, contributed sig- nificantly to the improvement of the payment rate of ap- propriations of the year (C1).  3.3.2 Budget execution of additional  funds received in 2013 for  Athens office refurbishment  works (C3 appropriations)  In addition to the initial EU subsidy to its budget 2013,  in November 2013 ENISA was granted the amount of  480 632.00 EUR, which resulted in the funds carried over  to 2014 for commitment (non‑automatic carry over). The  total amount of 504 934.00 EUR – related to the refur- bishment works and infrastructure investments in the  new office in Marousi, Athens – was carried over to 2014  by Decision MB/2014/02 WP of the Management Board  adopted on 7 February 2014.  Following a call for tenders for the refurbishment works,  which concluded to the award of a contract, and the sig- nature of another contract for upgrading Internet con- nectivity infrastructure (Dark Fibre), ENISA finally com- mitted 503 834.00 EUR, and the total amount of budget  2013 which remained uncommitted (and was therefore  cancelled) was 1 100.00 EUR, representing 0.01 % of the  total budget 2013 (8).  The tables below demonstrate a detailed analysis of the  commitments and payments made in 2014, including the  appropriations carried over from 2013 by decision of the  Management Board for the refurbishment works.  (8) Budget commitment validated and contract awarded for  the refurbishment project for 478.900 EUR on 17/03/2014.  Budget commitment validated and contract awarded for  upgraded Internet connectivity (Dark Fibre) for 24.934 EUR  on 07/03/2014. Total amount committed in 2014 on amounts  carried over from 2013, based on MB decision: 503.834 EUR.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board  30  3 Management of  resources  3.3.3 Amending budgets/budgetary  Transfers  The following table summarises the budget transfers and  the amending budget (AB) 1/2014 effect on the initial  budget 2014:  Table — Summary of transfers and AB 1/2014 effect:  Initial budget Transfers 1-3 B2014  approved by ED  Amending budget 1/2014  transfers  New appropriations 2014  (AB 01/2014)  Title 1 5 947 226.00 0.00 – 896.00 5 946 330.00  Title 2 875 000.00 0.00 670 000.00 1 545 000.00  Title 3 2 264 128.00 0.00 0.00 2 264 128.00  Total 9 086 354.00 0.00 669 104.00 9 755 458.00  The table below summarises the budget transfers and  the amending budget (AB) 2/2014 effect:  Table — Summary of transfers and AB 2/2014 effect:  New appropria‑ tions 2014  (AB 01/2014)  Transfers 4-7 B2014  approved by ED  Correction of allocation of  new revenue appropriations  (AB 02/2014)  Amending budget  2/2014  Transfers  New appropriations  2014 (AB 02/2014)  Title 1 5 946 330.00 – 209 836.61 0.00 – 218 518.53 5 517 973.86  Title 2 1 545 000.00 110 700.00 – 47 161.34 204 856.63 1 813 395.29  Title 3 2 264 128.00 99 136.61 0.00 13 662.90 2 376 927.51  Total 9 755 458.00 0.00 – 47 161.34 0.00 9 708 296.66  The table below summarises the effect of the budget  transfers following the adoption of the AB 02/2014 to  the final budget execution:  Table — Summary of transfers’ effect on final budget execution:  New appropriations 2014  (AB 02/2014)  Transfers 8-12 B2014  approved by ED  Final budget e  xecution 2014  Title 1 5 517 973.86 43 102.60 5 561 076.4600  Title 2 1 813 395.29 48 407.99 1 861 803.28  Title 3 2 376 927.51 – 91 510.59 2 285 416.92  Total 9 708 296.66 0.00 9 708 296.66  31  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  3.3.4 Carry forward of commitment  appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to the EU  subsidy (C1 appropriations), which were not consumed  by payments at the end of 2014, were carried forward  (automatic carry forward) to 2015 (C8 appropriations).  All commitment appropriations corresponding to the  subsidy from the Greek Government for the lease of ENI- SA premises in Greece (external assigned revenue — R0  appropriations) were paid by 31 December 2014, there- fore no commitment appropriations were automatically  carried over to 2015 (R0 appropriations).  The commitment appropriations corresponding to the  carried over amount from 2013 by a decision of the  Management Board (non‑automatic carry‑over to C3 ap- propriations 2014) which were not paid by 31 December  2014, i.e. the amount of 23 945.00 EUR payable to the  contractor that was withheld as performance guarantee,  is automatically carried forward to 2015 (C8 appropria- tions 2015).  The funds carried forward to 2015 (C8 appropriations)  are detailed below:  Title Carried forward  (to C8 2015)  EU subsidy  Carried forward  (C3 2014 to  C8 2015)  EU subsidy  Total carried  forward  to 2015  EU subsidy Title 1 —  Staff 394 950.16 0.00 384 950.16  Title 2 —  Administration 589 036.04 23 945.00 612 981.04  Title 3 —  Operations 334 489.60 0.00 334 489.60  Total 1 308 475.80 23 945.00 1 332 420.80  The total cancelled appropriations carried forward from  2013 to 2014 (C8 appropriations of 2014) but finally not  paid in 2014, was 49 460.01 EUR (representing 6.89 % of  the total appropriations carried forward to 2014).  3.3.5 Types of procurement  procedures  In 2014, a total of 29 procurement procedures were  launched, 42 contracts (18 framework service contracts  and 25 service contracts) and 236 purchase orders (95  of which were issued against pre‑existing framework ser- vice contracts) were signed.  3.3.6 Interest charged by suppliers  During 2014, the Agency had to pay no interest to its  suppliers as result of keeping the payment terms agreed  with the suppliers.  3.4 Management of human  resources  3.4.1 Human resources  At the end of 2014, 62 statutory staff were employed  in the Agency. During 2014, three staff left the Agency,  ten vacancy notices were published and seven staff were  recruited.  ENISA still experiences challenges in attracting and hold- ing suitably qualified staff to support the activities of the  Agency. This is a challenge due to several factors, how- ever one prime factor is the location, Heraklion, where  international education is a challenging factor.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members:  • a service-level agreement has been concluded with  each of the private schools being used by the chil- dren of the staff in Athens as there are no European  schools based there.  • A new mandate and service agreement has been  concluded between the Commission and ENISA  which provides the detail of the funding for Euro- pean schools being used by the children of the staff  of ENISA.  In 2014, 20 implementing rules prepared by the Commis- sion were considered by ENISA and sent to the Manage- ment Board for approval. These approved implementing  rules provide clarification and detail on the application of  the staff regulations, which provide the legal basis for the  obligations and rights of staff members.  In 2014, ENISA also engaged consultants to complete  a staff survey to report on aspects of living and work- ing at ENISA. The results were compared with a previous  staff survey carried out in 2012; significant improve- ments verified as to past results have been noted. The  results of the latest survey are being analysed with  a view to learning and improving the quality of the lives  of staff at ENISA.  32  3 Management of  resources  A number of activities with staff were held throughout  the year to improve team building and the working en- vironment. These exercise proved to be well received by  the staff and helps to bridge the barrier created from the  operation of two offices in a small agency.  The organisational chart, establishment plan and the sta- tistics for ENISA staff is attached in Annex A.1.  3.4.2 Results of screening  The Agency performed a job screening benchmarking  exercise for the first time in 2014. The result of the exer- cise, which is a snap shot of the staffing situation on end  December 2014, appears in Annex A.4. For 2014 there  are no comparative data related to the previous year. The  ‘overhead’, support functions, is only 22 % of the total  population, which is below the maximum value accepted  for the Agencies that is estimated at 25 %.  3.5 Assessment by  management  3.5.1 Effectiveness of controls for  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to en- sure the management of risks related to the legality and  regularity of underlying transactions. These control pro- cesses take into account the multi‑annual character of  programmes and the nature of the payments concerned.  In order to achieve the best control possible, the Agen- cy has focused intensively on the verification of results  before transactions are initiated (‘ex‑ante verification’).  In line with Internal Control Standard 8 (ICS 8 Processes  and Procedures), the Agency has done the ex‑post con- trol report of the 2013 financial year. The recommen- dations issued in the report were addressed during the  year.  The ex‑post controls of the financial year 2013 were quite  extensive. A total of 224 financial transactions were sam- pled and controlled representing 16,27 % of all financial  transactions of the Agency and representing 70.29 % of  the 2013 Agency’s budget.  The ex‑post controls of the financial year 2014 followed  procedures set in previous years. A total of 174 financial  transactions were sampled and controlled represent- ing 9.22 % of all financial transactions of the Agency or  70.99 % of the 2014 Agency’s budget. As a result, one  recommendation was issued in regard to the a posteriori  commitments of the Agency – the late opening of the fi- nancial tool ABAC at the beginning of the year.  Moreover, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is re- sponsible for the annual audit of the Agency, which is  concluded by the publication of an annual report accord- ing to the provisions of Article 287(1) of TFEU. For sev- eral consecutive years, the ECA reports have confirmed  improvement in the Agency’s overall internal controls  environment and performance.  3.6 Budget implementation  tasks entrusted to other  services and entities  The Agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  3.7 Assessment of audit results  and follow up of audit  recommendations  3.7.1 Internal Audit Services (IAS)  At the beginning of 2014, the Agency had 25 open rec- ommendations. During the year, the Agency closed 24 of  them. In November 2014, the IAS visited the Agency in  order to proceed with a control ‘on the spot’ to close the  remaining open recommendations. After their visit, the  Agency remains with only one open recommendation.  This open recommendation will be closed as soon as the  Agency implements a tool for e‑workflows (implementa- tion in January 2015). The Agency has an internal control  coordinator’s team.  3.7.2 European Court of Auditors  (ECA)  The annual report of ECA for 2012 ENISA contained two  important recommendations. The Court noted a weak- ness in the documentation of the fixed assets and a delay  in performance of a physical inventory count.  33  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  The first recommendation concerning the weakness in  the documentation of the fixed assets was closed by the  ECA. A lot of effort was put into the management of fixed  assets. A full physical inventory was done across both  premises (Heraklion and Athens), the retirement exer- cise was done and the reconciliation of fixed assets with  the accounts was finalised.  The second recommendation concerning the physical  inventory is a process that is still ongoing. Indeed, the  declassification exercise was done in 2014 as well as the  donation exercise. The process regarding the disposal of  the remaining declassified items, by way of destruction  and auction, will be completed by the end of the first  semester of 2015.  The ECA’s report on 2014 accounts is expected in the  third quarter of 2015. The Agency expects that the  Court’s opinion on the true and fair presentation of the  accounts as well as on the legality and regularity of the  transactions underlying the accounts will be unqualified  as it has been for the past eight years.  3.7.3 Follow up of audits plans, audits  and recommendations.  The Agency has only one open recommendation regard- ing the workflows of financial transactions.  This recommendation will be closed in the beginning of  2015, as soon as the Agency will implement an e-work- flow tool (implementation in January 2015).  3.7.4 Follow up of observations from  the discharge authority.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 3 April  2014, the Executive Director of the Agency was granted  the discharge in respect of the implementation of the  Agency’s budget for the financial year 2012.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 3 April  2014, the closure of the accounts of the Agency for the  financial year 2012 was approved.  3.7.4.1 Follow‑up of the 2011 discharge  The discharge authority acknowledged that the reduc- tion in the level of appropriations carried forward to the  next year was achieved by shifting procurement plan- ning from the first quarter of the financial year to the last  quarter of the preceding year.  The discharge authority acknowledged that the first  Agency’s inventory count was launched in April 2013 us- ing ABAC assets application and technology, whereby the  Agency verified the existence, valuation, eligibility and  correctness of fixed asset records.  The discharge authority acknowledged that the neces- sary measures were taken to address the lack of trans- parency of recruitment procedures and that the Court  of Auditors marked the issue as completed in its report.  3.7.4.2 Budget and financial management  The discharge authority noted with satisfaction that the  effective implemented budget control system during the  financial year 2012 resulted in a budget implementation  rate of 100 % and that the payment appropriations exe- cution rate was 91.45 %.  3.7.4.3 Commitments and carry overs  The discharge authority acknowledged that the Court of  Auditors’ annual audit had found no notable issues as  regards the level of carry overs in 2012 and commend- ed the Agency for adhering to the principle of annularity  and for timely execution of its budget.  3.7.4.4 Transfers  The discharge authority noted with satisfaction that  according to the annual activity report, as well as the  Court of Auditors’ audit findings, the level and nature of  transfers in 2012 had remained within the limits of the  financial rules and commended the Agency on its good  budgetary planning.  3.7.4.5 Procurement and recruitment  procedures  The discharge authority noted that for the year 2012,  neither sampled transactions nor other audit findings  had led to any comments on the Agency’s procurement  procedures in the Court of Auditors’ annual audit report  and noted that the Court of Auditors had made no com- ments in its annual audit report for 2012 with regard to  the Agency’s recruitment procedures.  3.7.4.6 Prevention and management of  conflicts of interests and transparency  The discharge authority acknowledged that the Manage- ment Board approved and signed the decision on prac- tical arrangements for implementing transparency and  confidentiality rules in October 2013 and acknowledged  34  3 Management of  resources  from the Agency that CVs, declarations of interest of the  Executive Director, the directors and the heads of de- partment were fully published on the agency’s website  as requested by the discharge authority on the agency’s  discharge 2012.  3.7.4.7 Comments on internal controls  The discharge authority noted with concern that ac- cording to the Court of Auditors’ annual audit report,  although the financial regulation and the corresponding  implementing rules provide for a physical inventory of  fixed assets at least every three years, this was not re- spected and the Agency did not carry out a comprehen- sive physical inventory in 2012, following the physical in- ventory of 2009; acknowledged that it would have been  either very difficult or even counterproductive to carry  out an inventory in 2012 because the inventory manage- ment module of the integrated budget and accounting  platform, supported by the Commission (DG BUDG), has  only been in place since that same year; it acknowledged  that this issue had been addressed with the new system  in 2013.  3.7.4.8 Internal audit  In 2012, the Commission’s Internal Audit Service (IAS)  carried out an in-depth risk assessment exercise in order  to determine the audit priorities for the coming three  years; observes that the IAS submitted its final strategic  audit plan for 2013‑2015 on 3 December 2012, defining  the prospective topics for the IAS audits of the Agency  for this period; notes that the IAS also carried out a desk  review on information provided by the Agency, which  showed that no critical recommendations were open  as of 31 December 2012; notes with concern, however,  that the implementation of four very important recom- mendations was delayed, with respect to the deadlines  defined by the Agency in the original action plans; notes  that two of those recommendations are actually closed.  3.7.4.9 Performance  The discharge authority requested the Agency to com- municate the results and impact of its work on European  citizens in an accessible way, mainly through its website.  The Agency is continually striving to improve the way in  which it interacts with its stakeholder communities. Most  of the Agency’s work is aimed at professional audienc- es in both the private and public sector, which is where  we place the emphasis on our stakeholder engagement  strategy. However, we realise the need to keep the EU  citizen informed about our work and we have there- fore recently broadened our communications approach  to include social media (notably Facebook and Twitter)  whilst also improving our presence in the national and  international press. The initial results are encouraging.  As mentioned in Section 2.1.4.3 where more details on  communication are given, ENISA generated 4 346 men- tions during 2014 in EU media, which is higher than  the outreach of 2013.. At the same time the number of  website visits increased (please refer to Section 2.1.4.3  for detailed data). The presence of the Agency on social  media is increasing, with the number of participants on  Facebook and Twitter doubling in the last year.  The Agency also makes good use of classical communi- cation tools. The annual report provides an extensive  reference to the achievements and the concrete impact  of Agency activities for any given year. The report shows  that the activities of ENISA aim at enhancing the security  infrastructure, regulations and culture of the Member  States and the NIS community and indirectly affect the  citizen’s life. ENISA has launched an internal consultation  process to identify the optimal form of report on the im- pact of its work to the EU citizen level.  35  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  4  Assessment of the  effectiveness of the  internal control systems  36  4 Assessment of  the effec tiveness of  the internal  control  systems  4.1 Risk management The Agency is actually using the risk assessment done by  the Internal Audit Service in 2012.  A revision of the risk management will be done during  2015.  In terms of fraud prevention and detection, the Man- agement Board adopted the Agency’s anti‑fraud strategy  and action plan in 2014.  4.2 Compliance and  effectiveness of internal  control standards  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  Compliance with these standards is compulsory for fi- nancial management.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational  structure and the internal control systems suited to the  achievement of policy and control objectives, in accord- ance with the standards and having due regard to the risks  associated with the environment in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopt- ed a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the  minimum requirements with which its internal control  systems need to comply. Previously developed inter- nal procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the Agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern during  the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the recom- mendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA and IAS).  During 2014, the Agency achieved compliance with the  internal control standards listed below.  4.2.1 Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in the ENI- SA Regulation. Mission statements for departments and  units were established based on the evolution of the or- ganisation in 2014. The roles and tasks of each depart- ment and unit are clearly defined.  4.2.2 Ethical and organisational values  (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place — including updates  and yearly reminders — to ensure that all staff are aware  of relevant ethical and organisational values (e.g. ethical  conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fraud pre- vention, reporting of irregularities). Specific training is  organised by the Agency for its staff every year in order  to reinforce professional behaviour, compliance with the  expected behaviour, ethics and integrity, and in order to  prevent workplace harassment.  4.2.3 Staff allocation and mobility  (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary, management aligns organisation- al structures and staff allocations with priorities and  workload.  4.2.4 Staff evaluation and  development (ICS 4)  In the context of the career development report (CDR)  process, discussions are held individually with all staff  to establish their annual objectives. Staff performance is  evaluated according to standards set by the Agency. An  annual training plan is developed at Agency level based  on needs deriving from the policy of the Agency. As part of  the CDR process, every year each staff member completes  an individual training plan. Management ensures that at  a minimum every staff member attends the compulsory  training courses defined in the annual training plan.  4.2.5 Objectives and performance  indicators (ICS 5)  The work programme and budget preparation procedures  were developed in 2009 and revised in 2014. The annu- al work programme (WP) of the Agency is developed by  the Agency services, with continuous input and guidance  from its two governing bodies, the Management Board  and the permanent stakeholders group. The WP clearly  sets out how the planned activities at each management  level contribute to the achievement of objectives, taking  into account the resources allocated and the risks identi- fied. The WP objectives are established on SMART (spe- cific, measureable, achievable, relevant, time‑bound) cri- teria and are updated during the year in order to address  significant changes in priorities and activities.  37  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  The role of the Executive Board is to assist preparing  decisions to be adopted by the Management Board on  administrative and budgetary matters only.  The Agency has based the measurement of its perfor- mance on key performance indicators (KPIs) that are ap- plied to all areas of activity. KPIs are more qualitative for  the Agency’s operational goals, whereas they are more  quantitative for the Agency’s administrative goals. The  effectiveness of key controls is assessed using relevant  KPIs, including self‑assessments that have been car- ried out in the form of progress reports and follow up  actions that seek to re‑align divergences from the work  programme.  The Agency’s work programmes are annual and multi‑an- nual. The MB and the PSG give orientation and input on  a regular basis throughout the WP development process  as well as during the year of implementation.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed again to optimise the  budget execution for 5 consecutive years. The commit- ment rate of budget appropriations available for the year  2014 (C1) reached 100 %, another consecutive year in  which the total Agency budget was consumed.  4.2.6 Risk management process  (ICS 6)  The IAS performed a risk assessment of the Agency in  2012. Risks identified as very important during the pre- vious audits were addressed by the Agency and actions  were planned and communicated to the IAS accordingly.  In 2014, effort and resources were devoted to addressing  and mitigating the risks that had been identified. This sat- isfactorily addressed the recommendations of both the  ECA and IAS, as noted in their annual reports.  4.2.7 Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned and  communicated by means of the Executive Director’s deci- sions (EDD). It conforms to regulatory requirements and is  appropriate to the level of importance of the decisions to  be taken as well as the risks involved. All delegated, author- ising officers have received and acknowledged the Charter  of the role and responsibility of the authorising officer (by  delegation) as well as the individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined, re- corded and kept up to date. It records derogations grant- ed to allow staff to remain in sensitive functions beyond  5 years along with documentation of the risk analysis  and the controls for mitigation.  Due care has been taken in order to avoid potential con- flict of interest situations. However, due to the small size  of the Agency, the mobility of staff in sensitive functions  is very limited and takes into account service needs and  available resources. Proper back‑ups are designated in  order to ensure business continuity.  4.2.8 Processes and procedures  (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen the Pro- cesses and Procedures Internal Control Standard. The  Agency created a policy on financial circuits. The roles  and responsibilities of financial actors are described in  this policy as well as existing workflows.  A code of professional conduct for ex‑ante financial ver- ification was developed. This document emphasises the  role and responsibilities of the Financial Verifying Agent.  The Agency proceeded in 2014 with the full 2013 ex‑post  control exercise and will deliver the 2014 ex‑post control  report in the first quarter of 2015.  Importantly in 2014, a quality management system was  implemented strengthening the performance manage- ment of the Agency.  4.2.9 Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The Management Team, which comprises the  Executive Director and the heads of departments and  units, meets weekly and sets priorities for the actions  to be taken in order to achieve the short- and medi- um‑term objectives of the Agency. A list of action items  is compiled. It contains all agreed actions as allocated  to specific departments or units. The list is published  on a dedicated Intranet page and regularly reviewed by  the management team. Management supervision cov- ers both legality and regularity aspects (i.e. set‑up and  compliance with applicable rules) and operational per- formance (i.e. achievement of Annual WP objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in order to  address accepted ECA and IAS audit recommendations  38  4 Assessment of  the effec tiveness of  the internal  control  systems  and monitors the implementation of these action plans  throughout the year.  The implementation of the project management tool  MATRIX, has enhanced the planning, implementation,  monitoring and reporting of operational projects, and  has enabled the establishment of a common project  management framework across different organisational  units of the Agency.  4.2.10 Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and dep- utising arrangements for relevant operational activities  and financial transactions — are in place to ensure the  continuity of all services during ‘business‑as‑usual’ inter- ruptions (such as sick leave, staff mobility, migration to  new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT business continuity plan (BCP) has been developed  and implemented. An Agency‑wide BCP, designed to cov- er crisis response and recovery arrangements with re- spect to major disruptions, has been developed and fully  implemented. The latter BCP identifies the functions,  services and infrastructure that need to be restored  within certain time limits and the resources necessary  for this purpose. Electronic and hard copy versions of  both BCPs are stored in secure and easily accessible loca- tions, which are known to relevant staff.  4.2.11 Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related pro- cedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory security  measures; (2) provisions on document management;  and (3) rules on the protection of personal data. Infor- mation security policy specific to data categorisation and  labelling is in place. As regards the exchange of informa- tion classified at the level RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED,  an administrative arrangement between the Security Di- rectorate of the European Commission and the Agency  was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets out the  conditions according to which documents need to be  registered, filed and saved using the Agency’s registra- tion and filing systems. A special, intranet‑based tool was  developed to capture the information needed to register  and retrieve documents. In addition, an incoming and  outgoing mail procedure was developed.  4.2.12 Information and communication  (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices are in  place for sharing information and monitoring activities.  These include regular management team meetings dur- ing which issues relevant to performance, audit results  and financial information are discussed, and actions are  decided upon and assigned. Regular financial reporting is  available to all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All engagements  in new projects are discussed during the implementation  of the annual work programme and decisions are docu- mented and communicated.  An external communication strategy is in place. ICT se- curity policies are in place for main systems and sub-sys- tems, and described in procedures and policies. Internal  communication is also supported through use of the in- tranet and through weekly staff meetings within units.  External communication and dissemination procedures  must be further developed and communicated to staff  accordingly.  The weekly Staff Meeting is used as platform of com- munication between all departments. Every week, staff  members can share their work with the rest of the  Agency.  4.2.13 Accounting and financial  reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are document- ed in the Internal Control Manual of the Agency. The  preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting  on budget implementation is centralised in the Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Section, within the Admin- istration and Support Department. The European Com- mission’s budget and accounting management system,  ABAC, is the main tool used for financial management. It  is compliant with applicable financial regulatory frame- works. The ABAC assets module is used for the manage- ment of ENISA’s inventory. Financial management infor- mation produced by the Agency, including financial infor- mation provided in the annual activity report, complies  with applicable financial and accounting rules.  4.2.14 Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to measure  the performance and assess the impact of the Agency’s  projects as provided for in its Annual work programmes.  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  The General Report and the Annual Activity Report are  the tools used by the Agency to report on performance  and impact. The feedback of relevant stakeholders is tak- en into account.  4.2.15 Assessment of internal control  systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the compliance  of annual activities and performance with the internal  control systems in place, as part of preparation of the  Annual Activity Report.  4.2.16 Internal audit capability (ICS 16)  The head of the Administration and Support Department  assumes the internal control coordination (ICC) function.  He is responsible for implementing internal control sys- tems in the Agency and liaising with the IAS of the Euro- pean Commission. As the Agency lacks human resources,  the role of Internal  Audit Capability (IAC) cannot be performed. Since 2005,  the Agency has relied on the IAS to carry out internal au- dits. The IAS plays a key role in auditing bodies of the  European Union.  Internal control tasks performed in ENISA include 100 %  of ex‑ante verifications, annual ex‑post controls, hierar- chical controls and outsourced engagements, coordinat- ed by the ICC.  In line with the Strategic Audit Plan 2013‑2015, the In- ternal Audit Service (IAS) carried out in 2014 a control  ‘on the spot’. Out of 25 open recommendations in 2014,  there is only one left open, which will be closed early  2015. The role of ICC was reinforced in order to comply  with all the recommendations issued by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control sys- tem, generally the Agency complies with the three as- sessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that have  the requisite knowledge and skills; (2) systems and pro- cedures designed and implemented to manage the key  risks effectively; and (3) no instances of ineffective con- trols that have exposed the Agency to substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of the con- tinuous improvement of management procedures. It  includes taking into account any control weaknesses re- ported and exceptions recorded.  40  5 Management assurance  5  Management assurance  41  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  5.1 Review of the elements  supporting assurance  The risk framework is used as a common means of clas- sifying and communicating risk across the agency. It pro- vides a common understanding and language regarding  ‘risk’, as well a structure for the assessment, reporting  and monitoring of risk. The risk framework defines the  categories, subcategories and business risks applicable at  the organisational level, for ENISA as a whole. It includes:  • Risk categories and subcategories  • Risks specific to each category (business risks)  • Risk definition  Assessment by management:  The Agency’s operations are channelled through the follow- ing activity areas that belong to administrative functions:  • Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with the annual work programme in terms of opera- tional and administrative activities.  • Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be in‑sourced  by the Agency. External agents are appointed either  through a procurement procedure or through a call  for expressions of interest for funding related to the  co‑organisation of events. Alternatively, in the case  of working group members, they may be chosen by  means of a selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its adminis- trative activities, the Agency has carried out the activities  presented in the table below:  Systemic process Activity Performance indicator  1 Follow up on auditor’s comments and rec- ommendations regarding ADM practices and  procedures as they are implemented in line  with financial regulation (FR), implementing  rules (IR) and staff regulations (SR).  Update of documents and activi- ties reporting.  Feedback by auditors in the next application period and  overall improvement of performance.  2 Opening and closing of the annual budget  and preparation of budgetary statements.  Approved budget tree opened,  appropriations posted properly.  Annual budget lines open and running by the end of the year  with the anticipated budget, economic outturn account and  supporting operations completed in time.  3 Implementation and consolidation of inter- nal controls, as appropriate.  Annual review of internal  controls.  Guidelines and checklists reviewed, annual risk assessment  done. Controls updated accordingly. Staff participation and  information.  4 Performance evaluation Organise annual performance  evaluation. Administer appeals  Number of evaluations carried out.  5 Annual training programme Draft the generic training plan of  the Agency.  Document presentation and implementation of programme.  6 Recruitment plan Execute the Agency recruitment  plan in line with the establish- ment pan.  Number of staff hired to cover new posts or make up for  resignations.  7 Internal ICT networks and systems Secure ICT networks and systems  in place.  Results of external security assessment/ audit.  8 Public procurement Regular, consistent observation  of public procurement practices  and appropriate assistance pro- vided to all departments.  Clear mandate of the procurement function established, staff  informed, forms available, number and type of procurement  processes handled, files of procurement processes organ- ised, and files for audit available. List of number of purchase  orders per supplier, number of complaints processed.  9 Contract management General support on contract  management.  Number of contracts prepared and signed by the Agency,  number of requests for support received from departments,  number of claims processed.  10 Ex‑ante controls Well developed at procedural,  operational and financial levels.  Number of transactions as compared to number of errone- ous transactions.  11 Ex‑post controls Well developed and done on an  annual basis  Number of transactions as compared to number of errone- ous transactions.  42  5 Management assurance  5.2 Exceptions In 2014, the Agency recorded 18 exceptions. Only four  are with high materiality. For three of these cases, the  root of the problem was the late opening of the financial  tool ABAC and one case is with regard to the payment of  the rent to the Greek authorities of the Athens building  (delay in receiving the funds from the Greek authorities  to pay the rent led to an ‘a posteriori’ commitment).  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors. The  results are contained in the reports listed. These reports  result from a systematic analysis of the evidence availa- ble. This approach provides sufficient guarantees on the  completeness and reliability of the information reported,  and results in complete coverage of the budget delegat- ed to the Executive Director of ENISA.  43  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  43  6  Declaration of assurance  44  6 Declaration of  assurance  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  In my capacity as authorising officer  Declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view (9).  State that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described  in this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles  of sound financial management, and that the control procedures put in place give the  necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my  disposal, such as the results of the self‑assessment, ex‑post controls, the work of the internal  audit capability, the observations of the Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the  reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year of this declaration.  Confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here which could harm the interests  of the agency.  Heraklion, 08.06.2015  [signed]  Udo Helmbrecht Executive Director  (9) True and fair in this context means a reliable, complete and correct view on the state of affairs in  the service.  45  ENISA Annual Ac tivity Repor t 2014  Annexes  46  Annexes  A.

Materiality criteria ENISA is not using any materiality criteria. Indeed 100 % of the financial transactions are submitted to the ex‑ante control  (verification before the authorisation).  In order to strengthen the controls, ENISA executes yearly the ex‑post control exercise (verification after authorisation).  The exercise methodology for sample selection is a judgmental (non‑statistical) method designed to demonstrate bias in  the selection of transactions for ex‑post control, taking into account the potential for error identified by the Agency, either  through the value of the transaction, the initiating procedure used and the Agency’s risk assessment, their documentation  or through discussion.

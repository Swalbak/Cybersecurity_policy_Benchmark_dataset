The CSA also refers to specific international organisations  (e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Organization  for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  (NATO)) that ENISA is called to develop relations with (see recital 43).  1.3  Since the entry into force of the CSA, ENISA’s exposure to partners outside the EU  has increased both quantitatively and qualitatively (2). ENISA is also often approached  by third countries directly with high expectations of mutual collaboration, and is  confronted each time on how best to react. Such welcomed developments call for  a more strategic approach to the international dimension of ENISA’s work in order  to guide the engagement of the Agency with third country partners, as well to direct  Agency’s response to third country partners seeking cooperation with ENISA.  1.4  This international strategy covers the cooperation with international organisations  and with non-EU countries. However, for those non-EU countries or regions with  which the EU has special agreements this international strategy should be read in  the light of such agreements, looking at where a closer cooperation in the area of  cybersecurity is foreseen.  1  Chapter II of Title II of the CSA covers all tasks of ENISA and thus outlines areas in which ENISA is competent. 2  The expectations of various actors inside the EU institutions and of Member States for ENISA to engage more  actively internationally have increased, as was stressed in the bilateral interviews undertaken by ENISA in spring  2021. This was also confirmed in the internal survey carried out by ENISA in early 2021.  2  ENISA’S OVERALL  INTERNATIONAL  APPROACH  The directions and provisions in this strategy will not in any way limit or hamper the provisions  laid out by Article 12 of the CSA.  The mandate of the Agency is to achieve ‘a high common level of cybersecurity across the  Union, including by actively supporting Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies in improving cybersecurity’. Under this mandate, ENISA’s strategic aim is to build  a trusted and cybersecure Europe. ENISA’s international strategy must therefore be at the  service of the Union, advance the achievement of the Agency’s mandate within the Union and  contribute to its strategy (3).  3  ENISA (2020), A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe – ENISA strategy (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ corporate-documents/enisa-strategy-a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-strategy-a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-strategy-a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe  International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity 3  This underlying premise directs the Agency to be selective in engaging with international partners  and to limit its overall approach in international cooperation to only those areas and activities  that will have high and measurable added value in achieving the Agency’s strategic objectives.  International cooperation should be resourced prudently and proportionally. This strategy  outlines three approaches that the Agency can use in terms of level of commitment of resources:  the limited, assisting and outreach approaches.  2.1 LIMITED APPROACH  ENISA’s default international approach is ‘limited’. Under this approach, ENISA will, in line with  its objectives enshrined in Article 4 of the CSA, exchange information with relevant international  partners on an ad hoc basis (4), to strengthen and develop its expertise and anticipate changes  prompted by global developments in cybersecurity. It will seek to promote the Union’s  values and to advance its strategic objectives and cybersecurity policies when engaging with  international partners in meetings, conferences and seminars. ENISA will not commit dedicated  resources to pursue this approach beyond mission or conference costs.  2.2 ASSISTING APPROACH  In line with its mandate to ‘actively support Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies in improving cybersecurity’ (Article 3(1) of the CSA), ENISA may respond to requests  for assistance – when the request is deemed to add significant value to a specific strategic  objective and is in line with the Union’s policies – namely from third countries and international  organisations with which the Union has agreements or frameworks that promote specific or  general cooperation in cybersecurity. Under this approach, ENISA may exchange and share  expertise, contribute to organising training sessions and exercises, support the Commission/ EU in building and maintaining cybersecurity dialogues and support individual cybersecurity  activities with international partners organised by the requester. To respond to such requests,  ENISA might use resources dedicated to specific strategic objectives as set out in its single  programming document (SPD).  2.3 OUTREACH APPROACH  ENISA may follow an ‘outreach’ approach for specific aims and provisions of the strategic  objectives outlined in this strategy, to proactively engage with specific international partners to  be able to advance the Agency’s strategic objectives and fulfil the objectives of the CSA. Under  this approach, ENISA may plan dedicated resources in its SPD in pursuit of this approach.  4  For principles that govern selecting and engaging with international partners, please see Section 3 of this annex:  ‘Principles governing ENISA’s international approach’.  ENISA’s overall international approach  4  PRINCIPLES  GOVERNING ENISA’S  INTERNATIONAL  APPROACH  International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity 5  1.  ENISA will focus its international cooperation on partners with which the Union has strategic  economic relationships and which share the Union’s values.  2.  When cooperation in cybersecurity between the Union and an international partner is  explicitly stated in an agreement, ENISA may follow an outreach approach, respecting  the limits of the agreement provisions.  3.  Beyond specific provisions outlined under Section 4 of this annex, ‘Specific aims and  provisions under individual strategic objectives’, ENISA can, when relevant, pursue  an outreach approach across all of its strategic objectives with European Economic  Area countries.  4.  ENISA will refrain from engaging with international actors if contacts or cooperation with  such actors would be deemed incompatible with the Union’s interests or policy goals.  5.  The Agency’s international cooperation activities should align with and add value to the  partnerships of Member States.  6.  When responding to requests under the assisting approach not explicitly covered in  this strategy, and where otherwise appropriate, ENISA will consult and coordinate  with the European External Action Service and the Commission, to ensure that the  Agency’s international engagement is in line with the Union’s policy goals. ENISA will  notify the Executive Board of requests under an assisting approach and those under  an outreach approach. ENISA will furthermore ensure that its outreach activities are in  line with the Union’s policies by regularly consulting with the Directorate-General for  Communications Networks, Content and Technology.  7.  In its SPD, ENISA will proportionally evaluate the resources needed for involvement in  any international activities with an assisting or outreach approach.  8.  ENISA will seek endorsement of the Executive Board prior to developing cooperation  frameworks or agreements with international organisations and third countries. When  such agreements place financial or legal obligations on the Agency, they must be  approved by the Management Board.  9.  In its annual activity report, ENISA will outline all international activities it has pursued  under different approaches. In particular, it will evaluate and provide assessment of  the added value of international activities under an assisting or outreach approach in  pursuit of its strategic objectives.  10.  The Agency should be able to react in an agile manner while adhering to  these principles.  Principles governing ENISA’s international approach  6  SPECIFIC AIMS  AND PROVISIONS  UNDER INDIVIDUAL  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  4.1 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘EMPOWERED AND ENGAGED COMMUNITIES  ACROSS THE CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM’  ENISA exchanges best practices and expertise and promotes international activities to  enhance the cybersecurity awareness and education of the various communities of the Union.  Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can give support in terms of expertise to the Western  Balkans as a region and/or single countries of the region and to countries belonging to the  European Eastern Partnership as a region and/or single countries of the region;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board, ENISA  can cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements to enhance  mutual cybersecurity awareness and education in line with the respective specific provisions  of such agreements.  International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity 7  Specific aims and provisions under individual strategic objectives  4.2 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘CYBERSECURITY AS AN INTEGRAL PART  OF EU POLICIES’  ENISA collects and exchanges information on best practices in cybersecurity policy development  and implementation internationally and promotes the projection of EU cybersecurity policies  to the benefit of the Union. ENISA’s connections with international organisations working on  digital security can both contribute to the promotion of EU acquis in this field and feed into EU  cybersecurity policy development. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can support Union representatives of relevant  international organisations and regulatory forums by providing expertise on cybersecurity  policies and cybersecurity aspects of Union legislation as outlined under Article 5 of the CSA;  using the assisting approach, ENISA can provide expertise on cybersecurity policy  implementation to the Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership countries;  using the outreach approach, ENISA can cooperate with the OECD (and like-minded countries  such as the Unites States) on mapping and promoting best practices in integrating cybersecurity  into various policy domains.  4.3 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘EFFECTIVE COOPERATION AMONG OPERATIONAL  ACTORS WITHIN THE UNION IN CASE OF MASSIVE CYBER INCIDENTS’  ENISA’s international cooperation should assist and contribute to the Union’s incident response  and crisis management, in particular by building a trusted network of like-minded international  partners – including major global cybersecurity companies and vendors – to contribute to the  Union’s common situational awareness and preparedness. Furthermore, ENISA – in line with  recital 43 of the CSA and using the outreach approach – can contribute to this by cooperating with  international partners such as the OSCE and NATO on joint incident response coordination (5).  4.4 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘CUTTING-EDGE COMPETENCES AND  CAPABILITIES IN CYBERSECURITY ACROSS THE UNION’  ENISA will seek to reach out to international partners to exchange information and best  practices in order to enhance and develop cybersecurity competences and capabilities within the  Union. Where appropriate, it can participate as an observer in the organisation of international  cybersecurity exercises in line with Article 12 of the CSA. Furthermore:  using the assisting approach, ENISA can contribute to building competences and capabilities  in the Western Balkans as a region and/or single countries by supporting training and exercises;  using the assisting approach, ENISA can support, with relevant expertise, countries belonging  to the Eastern Partnership as a region and/or single countries of the region or countries  benefiting from the Union’s development programmes;  in line with recital 43 of the CSA and using the assisting approach, ENISA can contribute  to the organisation of joint cybersecurity exercises with the OECD, the OSCE and NATO;  under the outreach approach, ENISA can organise international cybersecurity challenges  to promote and enhance the competitiveness of cybersecurity competences in the Union;  5  Those activities are to be carried out in full respect of the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity and the decision- making autonomy of the Union, without prejudice to the specific character of the security and defence policy of any  Member State.  8  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board, ENISA  can cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements to build and  enhance mutual cybersecurity capacities in line with the respective specific provisions of  such agreements.  4.5 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘A HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST IN SECURE  DIGITAL SOLUTIONS’  Without prejudice to possible tasks stemming from Article 12(d) of the CSA, ENISA will seek to  advance its expertise and monitor international developments in cybersecurity certification  and related standardisation areas, also in line with Article 54 of the CSA (6). It will engage with  international actors on the supply and demand sides of the cybersecurity market to promote  and advance European digital autonomy. Furthermore:  using the outreach approach, ENISA will engage with the relevant key strategic  economic partners of the Union to promote the EU’s cybersecurity certification schemes  or candidate schemes;  using the outreach approach, and in line with recital 23 of the CSA, ENISA will support the  global development and maintenance of standards that underpin the public core of the open  internet and the stability and security of its functioning.  4.6 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘FORESIGHT ON EMERGING AND FUTURE  CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES’  ENISA aims to exchange information on an ad hoc basis and participate in international forums  to increase its expertise in international developments and map global cybersecurity threats as  well as research areas and innovation trends that could address emerging challenges.  4.7 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ‘EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE CYBERSECURITY  INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT FOR EUROPE’  ENISA aims to gain a better overview and understanding of the international cybersecurity  landscape and ensure that relevant cybersecurity information and knowledge generated  internationally is shared and expanded within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem. ENISA will focus  its outreach to partners deemed like-minded (e.g. Japan). Furthermore:  using the outreach approach, ENISA will cooperate with the OECD and NATO in exchanging  expertise for the development of cybersecurity indices and benchmarks;  using the outreach approach, and with the endorsement of the Management Board,  ENISA will cooperate with third countries with which there are specific EU agreements to  enhance mutual knowledge and information in line with the respective specific provisions  of such agreements.  6  Article 54 (elements of European cybersecurity certification schemes) of the CSA states that ‘A European  cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements: […] (c) references to the international,  European or national standards applied in the evaluation or, where such standards are not available or appropriate,  to technical specifications that meet the requirements set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 or, if  such specifications are not available, to technical specifications or other cybersecurity requirements defined in the  European cybersecurity certification scheme; […] (o) the identification of national or international cybersecurity  certification schemes covering the same type or categories of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, security  requirements, evaluation criteria and methods, and assurance levels.’  International strategy of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity 4  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe. Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT products, services and  processes with cybersecurity certifi cation schemes, cooperates with Member States and EU  bodies, and helps Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge  sharing, capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with its key  stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to boost resilience of the Union’s  infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

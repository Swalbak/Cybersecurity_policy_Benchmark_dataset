The digital transformation we saw emerging in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was both unexpected  and unprecedented. The measures to contain the epidemic imposed on the world new ways to operate and  tested our efficiency and flexibility. As the dependence on digital services started to rise rapidly, cyber threats  and attacks increased proportionally in the EU and in the rest of the world, and demonstrated the need for more  cybersecurity. ENISA remained at the forefront of this battle to give the support needed to the European Union,  to the Member States and the EU citizens in these exceptional circumstances to prevent and mitigate threats and  ensure business continuity in all spheres of our society.  I am very proud to report the success of the Agency in responding to these challenges. We managed to sail the  storm, and made the most of our work programme to ensure the best possible outcomes.  In relation to Covid-19, the Agency was called upon to help coordinate the activities of the EU Member States and  bodies at the very start of the pandemic. ENISA therefore issued recommendations to the critical infrastructure  industry, and supported the EU tracing apps toolbox. The Agency also provided advice to SMEs and guidance to  the healthcare sector to enable them to respond to the increase of phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks.  Such preventive actions, although in relation to the pandemic, still fall into the mandate of the Agency to raise  the cybersecurity resilience of the EU.  It is important to underline the significant progress made in 2020 by the Agency in developing the new areas  foreseen by the Cybersecurity Act, especially in relation to the implementation of the Cybersecurity Certification  Framework. This progress included the development of a methodology to enable the implementation of key  requirements of the CSA, the candidate European Common Criteria Scheme (EUCC) on ICT products and the  candidate European Cloud services scheme (EUCS).  We also supported the EU in relation to the cybersecurity challenges of the 5G networks, and updated the  technical guidelines on security measures under the EECC and the 5G threat landscape. ENISA also contributed  to the development of the 5G toolbox in cooperation with the Commission services.  This proactive stance of ENISA is part of the new strategy established in the course of the year and adopted  by the management board in June 2020. This document sets the foundation of our strategic objectives and  priorities and serves the purpose the purpose of mapping out the annual work programme, fulfilling the  Agency’s permanent mandate and moving towards « A trusted and cybersecure Europe ».  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 7  The Management Board of ENISA also approved the amendment of the 2020 work programme made necessary  by the pandemic. The objective of this amendment was to allow us to resort to the online environment for those  activities delivered in presence before the emergence of COVID-19. In parallel, an amending budget was adopted  in August to re-direct funding to new projects as a replacement of activities which could not take place because  of the pandemic.  With the new strategy designed to integrate the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act, came the need to change  the organisational structure of the Agency. To achieve this ambitious goal, the Agency mapped its human  competences, changed or created new internal processes and formed new teams to trigger better internal  dynamics. The reorganisation was approved by the Management Board in June 2020 and was implemented as of  1st January 2021.  To strengthen the existing human resources and increase the capacity of the Agency to meet the requirements  of its extended mandate, a large-scale recruitment exercise was also launched in 2020. The widespread  promotional campaign enhanced the visibility of the vacancies resulting in the submission of more than 1200  applications coming from all Member States. Thanks to this initiative the Agency was able to use a pool of 84  shortlisted candidates to fill the open positions it had in 2020. The purpose of this pool was also to facilitate the  recruitment process for openings in the operational units in 2021 and 2022.  Highlights of ENISA’s work in the area of expertise included the 4th annual IoT security conference on operational  IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Supply Chain for IoT. Our experts developed security recommendations  addressed to the professionals of the Connected and Automated Mobility sector.  Artificial Intelligence was also under scrutiny and resulted in the AI threat landscape published in December  2020. ENISA started to cooperate with the new working group on AI as soon as it was established in May.  As for cybersecurity exercises, due to the « force majeure » of the situation, it was generally agreed to postpone  the European Cybersecurity Challenge to 2021 and to also postpone the pan-European cyber exercise,  Cyber Europe 2020.  I am proud to report that the Capture-the-Flag (CTF) event « ENISA Hackfest 2020 » went ahead in a virtual setting  and successfully attracted 250 participants from 17 EU and EFTA Member States. In addition, I am glad to report  the likewise successful digital edition of the 2020 European Cybersecurity Month campaign demonstrated by  a three-fold increase in outreach.  Other works of particular interest included the development of a cyber-threat assessment methodology and  impact assessment model designed to help the EU assess the overall impact of cyberattacks. The work allows  ENISA to support the cooperation among EU institutions on cyber crises management.  ENISA has taken on board the new Security Union Strategy released in July 2020 and included these parameters  to address digital risks.  I am glad to see that ENISA has successfully endeavoured to raise the resilience of the EU critical infrastructures and  to strengthen the EU’s capabilities while maintaining the synergies needed for an effective operational cooperation.  This of course could not have been achieved without the unrelenting support and commitment of all our  stakeholders and I seize this opportunity to thank each one of them warmly and express how grateful I remain to  our communities, to the European institutions and bodies and to all the Member States.  I understand the anxiety and pressure we all experienced in these difficult times. This is why I would like to also  express my sincere gratitude to the Agency’s staff for displaying such resilience and commitment to ENISA. Only  such collective efforts can lead to the success of our endeavours.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director, ENISA  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 91  The analyses and assessment by the Management  Board of ENISA of the consolidated annual activity  report for the year 2020 of the authorising officer  of ENISA  The Management Board takes note of the  Consolidated Annual Activity Report (CAAR) for the  financial year 2020, submitted by the Executive  Director of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in accordance with Article 48 of  the Financial Regulation applicable to ENISA.  The Executive Board received a copy of the CAAR  2020 produced by the Executive Director of  ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 1st June  2021 and the Management Board received a copy of  the 2020 AAR on the same date.  The Management Board performed the analysis of the  CAAR and completed its assessment. The conclusions  of the Management Board are the following:    The challenging circumstances which emerged  as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic led to the  adoption of a number of amendments to the  work programme 2020 and associated budget.  The amendments allowed the Agency to adjust  its meetings to the online environment. They  also made it possible to postpone some of its  deliverables requiring physical presence.    Despite these challenges, the Agency was able to  meet the objectives set in the work programme  2020 as shown by the results presented in this  report.    The CAAR presents key results of the  implementation of the ENISA work programme  2020 thus demonstrating how the Agency  successfully completed all deliverables as agreed  with the Management Board in the amended work  programme 2020.    The new strategy of ENISA was adopted by  the Management Board in June 2020. The  programming of the Agency’s work will be based  on the strategic objectives and priorities defined  in this new strategy. The activities of the Agency  will be planned accordingly using a multi-annual  framework covering the years to come.    Furthermore, the Agency embarked on the  reorganization of its internal structures, adopted  by the MB in June 2020. The new organisational  structure aligns the tasks and functions of the  Agency’s structural set-up with the Cybersecurity Act.    ENISA produced 45 reports and engaged in  various activities according to the provisions of its  mandate in the Cybersecurity Act and pertaining  to the current cybersecurity environment. These  reports provided assistance to many sectors listed  in the NIS Directive, but also in evolving areas such  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  10  as Artificial Intelligence. Impact indicators show  that the Agency's results exceeded the targets  established in the work programme 2020, against  the framework of the ENISA Strategy 2016-2020.    In 2020 the Agency began to fulfill its role in the  area of Cybersecurity certification framework,  in particular for candidate schemes on common  criteria and cloud services. This work will be  continued in 2021, by preparing candidate  schemes for other areas in response to the  requests received from the Commission services.    Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA work  programme 2020 and ENISA’s work is well aligned  with the overall European Union priorities for the  Digital Single Market. A coherent link is provided  between activities planned in the work programme  2020 and the actual achievements reached in the  reporting period.    The AAR also describes how ENISA managed its  resources and presents the budget execution of  the EU subsidy. In the course of 2020, the Agency  operated with a budget of EUR 21.6 million  equivalent to a 28 % increase compared to the  2019 budget (EUR 16.9 million). The amending  budget was adopted by the Management Board by  written procedure on 28 August 2020. The purpose  of this amending budget was to re-direct funding  made available through the cancellation of projects  and forecasted expenditures due to the COVID-19  pandemic to finance new projects and activities up  to an amount of EUR 2.5 million, from which EUR  1.6 million were under operational activities.    During 2020, ENISA committed a total amount of  EUR 20 588 320 representing 97.35 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the  year amounted to EUR 14 513 329 representing  68.62 % of the total budget. The budgetary  execution was high despite of the restrictive  circumstances imposed by COVID-19.    As compared to 2019, there has been a slight  increase in commitment execution – 97.35 % in  2020 as compared to 96.80 % in 2019, and a slight  decrease in payment execution – 68.62 % as  compared to 70.12 % in 2019. The target of 95 %  for commitment rate set by the Commission (DG  Budget) was reached.    In 2020, the Executive Director reviewed the  delegation of authorising authority powers and  on 12 February 2020 adopted a new decision  on a framework of the financial delegation  of the authorising officer and of a budgetary  management committee to ensure a sound  financial executive of the Agency’s budget.    The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2019  Discharge and control results. This section also  notes the main categories of deviation that led to  exceptions reported. In 2020 the agency recorded  31 exceptions: 28 of these were below the relevant  materiality level (less than EUR 15 000) and of  a minor administrative nature with no financial  impact.    In 2020, ENISA undertook an ex post evaluation of  2019 activities within the ENISA work programme  from Deloitte Consulting and Advisory. This  work resulted in a final report and a case study  on Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in  Hospitals. Recommendations included to revise  key performance indicators (KPIs), balancing and  tailoring the Agency’s activities and outputs, and  finally to reinforce the position of the Agency  within the cybersecurity ecosystem.    The turnover of staff was greatly reduced in 2020.  The ratio was only of 2 percent which shows  improvement in retaining staff members in the  Agency. Furthermore, a combined recruitment  procedure organised in 2020 allowed the Agency  to progress rapidly in fulfilling its establishment  plan. It is worth noting that vacant posts for  seconded national experts were fulfilled as well.    ENISA adopted the revised internal control  framework at the end of 2019. The AAR 2020  shows the adequate management of risks,  a high level of transparency, well managed data  protection rules and business continuity activities.    The Management Board notes that infringement  of the use of delegation powers and weaknesses  in internal controls framework were identified  by the European Court of Auditors. The Board  concludes that necessary actions were undertaken  to improve the overall efficiency of the agency in  abiding to its principles and congratulates ENISA  for all the efforts engaged to that end.    The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration  of assurance of the Executive Director as well as  additional information on human and financial  resources, draft annual accounts and financial  reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 11  INTRODUCTION  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the  successful achievements of ENISA in 2020. The  Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA  could deliver the work programme 2020 despite the  unforeseen conditions due to COVID -19, showing  exceptional flexibility and efficiency in challenging  circumstances. The Management Board expresses  its deep appreciation to the Executive Director and  his staff for their commitment and the excellent  performance throughout the year.  The Management Board notes the reservations made  by the Executive Director which do not affect the  validity nor the accuracy of the annual accounts for  the financial year 2020 to the discharge authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management  Board requests the Management Board Secretariat  to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to  the European Commission, the European Parliament,  the Council, the Permanent Representations of the  Member States and the Court of Auditors.  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 131  Implementation of the agency’s annual work  programme: Highlights of the year  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cyber policies.  The aim of the Agency is to strengthen trust in the  connected economy, boost resilience and trust of  the Union’s infrastructure and services and keep our  society and citizens digitally secure. ENISA aspires to  be an agile, environmentally and socially responsible  organisation focused on people.  In a world that has become hyper-connected,  cybercriminals pose a significant threat to the  internal security of the European Union and security  of its citizens online. The COVID-19 pandemic has  highlighted the need for more security in the digital  world. People have increased their presence online to  maintain personal and professional relations, while  cybercriminals have taken advantage of this situation,  targeting in particular e-commerce and e-payment  businesses, as well as the healthcare system. At the  same time, the Agency also needed to deal with the  challenges of the pandemic and remote working.  THE YEAR IN BRIEF  In June 2019 the new Cybersecurity Act (CSA) came  into force giving ENISA a new and permanent  mandate. The tasks assigned to ENISA under this  regulation are meant to help achieve achieve a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union,  including actively supporting Member States, Union  institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies in improving  cybersecurity.  Such were the circumstances presiding over  the implementation of  the ENISA Programming  Document 2020- 2022, the first programming year  falling under the full scope of the new mandate.  The strengthened and expanded tasks of the Agency  in the field of operational cooperation were tested  in 2020 because of the need to ensure adequate  cybersecurity throughout the corona virus (COVID-19)  crisis. The Agency faced multiple challenges as  a consequence. Acting in the context of Article 7 of  the CSA, ENISA engaged in a number of activities1 that  played an important role in helping EU Member States  1 Including initiating contacts with the European Commission,  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement  Cooperation’s (Europol) European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU  (CERT-EU) to establish an information exchange network,  which subsequently attracted the participation of the  European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Council of  the European Union; contributing to the technical annex of  the Commission’s recommendation on contact tracing apps.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  14  and bodies coordinate their activities throughout  the initial phases of the pandemic and in raising the  resilience of the EU. These practical steps and actions  are not expected to be one-off endeavours, but will  continue to be pursued through the evolving Blueprint  and future operational cooperation activities.  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YEAR  The Agency took a very proactive stance in the CSA  and made significant progress in developing the new  areas of work foreseen by the act. In this respect,  ENISA laid the groundwork to fully implement the  Cybersecurity Certification Framework. In parallel, the  Agency supported the European Union to respond to  cybersecurity challenges connected to 5G. Additionally,  ENISA engaged additional efforts to integrate the  concepts of the ‘blueprint’ into the cyber-crisis  management approach by unveiling an innovative tool  for knowledge management in this area.  In addition 2020 marked the establishing of the In  addition, 2020 marked the establishiment of the  new strategy of ENISA, adopted by the management  board in June 2020 and used as a baseline to set the  strategic objectives and priorities for programming  the Agency’s work using a multiannual framework,  for the years to come. The new strategy outlines  the Agency’s strengthened path in view of achieving  a high common level of cybersecurity across the  Union. The strategy was developed to fulfil the  Agency’s permanent mandate and takes on the  vision of ‘A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe’ and  enhanced mission: ‘to achieve a high common level of  cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation with the  wider community.’’  In parallel, the Agency was the object of  a reorganisation engaged in order to align its structure  and organisational capabilities with the needs of  the CSA. The Management Board agreed with the  principles guiding the reorganisation in February 2020.  The new organisational structure was adopted in June  2020 and was implemented on 1 January 2021.  The CSA provides for a framework for European  cybersecurity certification schemes with a view to  creating a digital single market for ICT products,  services and processes. The Agency began to fully  execute this function  in 2020, in particular for  candidate schemes for common criteria and cloud  services. In 2021, the Agency will initiate the work  meant to raise the competitiveness of the European  cybersecurity market and industry. This work includes  advising and assisting EU bodies (including the  Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network2  in setting cybersecurity research and innovation  priorities, as well as by providing regular insights into  how both the supply side and the demand side of  the market function. Such activities will remain in the  years to come and are expected to grow.  The Agency continued to support EU decision-making  institutions in relation to the EU Cybersecurity  Strategy and the announced review of the security  of networks and information systems (NIS) directive.  This renewal and strengthening of a key pillar of  the EU’s regulatory framework. It underpins the  cybersecurity of critical sectors across our society.  It could also further make use of the expanded and  permanent mandate given to the Agency and is  expected to influence the development of the ENISA  work programme in the years to come as a result.  Finally, ENISA negotiated a lease agreement for a new  building in Athens and startedpreparations to move  into the new premises during the summer of 2021.  While being in full telework regime since March 2020  in response to restrictions due to the pandemic, the  Agency remained operational and implemented its  work programme, recruitment, procurement, and  managed to ensure staff wellbeing. Following the duty  of care principle, the Agency allowed staff to carry out  their duties remotely, and from outside their place of  assignment as appropriate, with regular information  being provided to the Executive Board and the  Management Board.  2 In September 2018, the European Commission proposed  a regulation setting up a European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and Network. The (draft) regulation  ensures cooperation and complementarity with ENISA. In  particular, ENISA will have an important role in contributing  to the Centre’s strategic role in coordinating cybersecurity  technology-related investments by the EU, Member States  and industry. The Council agreed its negotiating position in  June 2020 and the trilogies with the European Parliament  began in summer 2020.

It analysed the  different stages of the IoT supply chain and explored  all the important security considerations to be taken  into account in each stage. The guidelines issued  included input and validation from IoTSec EG4, EICS  EG5, NLOs6 and other industry stakeholders.  The 4th annual IoT Security Conference series  raised awareness on the security challenges facing  the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem across the  European Union. The series spanned three weeks,  with each week exploring a different cybersecurity  topic: Operational IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  Supply Chain for IoT, respectively.  In 2020, bilateral discussions took place with relevant  stakeholders on IoT security. ENISA also engaged in  the topic during related events.  4 ENISA Internet of Things (IoT) Security (IoTSEC) Experts Group 5 ENISA Industry 4.0 Cyber Security (EICS) Experts Group 6 National Liaison Officers Network (https://www.enisa.europa.  eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office)  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YEAR  18  O.1.1.2. Building knowledge on Connected and  Automated Mobility (CAM)  Main achievements:    Reports on the security of CAM and on CAM  ecosystem  The ENISA Deliverable: ‘Recommendations for the  security of CAM’ is a report providing a high-level  overview of the cybersecurity challenges in the CAM  sector. It defines both the concerned CAM actors and  introduces associated recommendations. The report  benefited from the input and validation from CAMSEC  EG7, and other industry stakeholders.  Additionally, ENISA produced another report  providing a comprehensive understanding of the CAM  cybersecurity ecosystem. In particular, it includes  the mapping of the key stakeholders and relevant  bodies and organisations in the European Union,  and provides an overview of the critical services and  systems and infrastructures.  O.1.1.3. Building knowledge on Artificial  Intelligence security  Main achievements:    Report on AI Cybersecurity Challenges and Threat  Landscape    AI security webinar co-hosted with MEP Kaili    Report ‘Cybersecurity Challenges in the Uptake  of Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous Driving’ in  collaboration with Commission services (DG JRC)  ENISA published the deliverable ‘AI: Cybersecurity  Challenges – AI Threat Landscape’ in December  2020. This was a seminal piece of work mapping  the AI Threat Landscape. This report presents the  Agency’s active mapping of the AI cybersecurity  ecosystem and its Threat Landscape, realised with  the support of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Artificial  Intelligence Cybersecurity. The ENISA AI Threat  Landscape not only laid the foundation for upcoming  cybersecurity policy initiatives and technical  guidelines, but also stressed relevant challenges.  In October 2020, ENISA hosted an AI security webinar  together with MEP Kaili to explore the cybersecurity  challenges of AI. Speakers and panellists discussed  the current risks and offered ways forward in view  of  establishing a secure ecosystem for AI across  the Union. The event – attended by more than 550  7 ENISA Connected and Automated Mobility Security (CAMSec)  Informal Expert Group  stakeholders – highlighted the role of cybersecurity in  establishing the reliable and trustworthy deployment  of AI – a principal area of work by the EU Agency for  Cybersecurity.  In May 2020, ENISA formed an ad hoc Working Group  (AI WG) composed of 15 members and 6 observers (EU  institutions) in order to best satisfy the objectives of  this Output. Together with the Working Group, ENISA  mapped the threat landscape concerning AI, provided  support to the Commission services on relevant policy  initiatives, and held events to raise awareness on AI  cybersecurity. The ENISA ad hoc Working Group on AI  held 5 plenary sessions throughout the year, as well as  a validation plenary session to discuss and validate the  results presented in the study.  Together with the Commission services (DG JRC),  ENISA worked on a report titled ‘Cybersecurity  Challenges in the Uptake of Artificial Intelligence  in Autonomous Driving’. The report was published  in February 2021 and looks at cybersecurity risks  connected to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in autonomous  vehicles and provides recommendations for  mitigating them.  O.1.1.4. Building knowledge on the security of  healthcare services  Main achievements:   Report on ‘Cloud security for Healthcare services’  Tool development for procurement in hospitals   Online sessions of the annual eHealth Security  Conference    Toolkit development in collaboration with  Commission services (DG CNECT and DG Health  and Food Safety)  ENISA published the report ‘Cloud security for  Healthcare services’. This report identified the  cybersecurity and data protection challenges that  healthcare organisations faced when trying to move  services to the cloud and detailed the key aspects  that should be considered when conducting the  relevant risk assessment. The report focused on three  relevant case studies and detailed a set of 17 security  measures to support healthcare organisations in  addressing the relevant challenges. It was validated  by the eHealth Security Experts Group and additional  stakeholders from the healthcare sector.  ENISA also developed an online tool for procurement  in hospitals. Based on the procurement guidelines  deliverable published by ENISA in February 2020, the  tool provides a simple way for hospitals to identify  good practices of relevance to them based on context  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 19  PART I. Achievements of the year  (e.g. type of procurement, cybersecurity threats/ challenges etc.).  Furthermore, ENISA organised three online sessions  of the annual eHealth Security Conference. The  Danish Health Data Authority, co-organiser of this  year’s conference, together with ENISA redesigned  the eHealth Security Conference this year to focus  on three areas of healthcare’s most pressing cyber  challenges with in-depth online sessions taking place  over a period of three months.  By working closely with Commission services (DG  CNECT and DG Health and Food Safety) ENISA  supported the COVID-19 tracing and monitoring  mobile apps Toolkit development.  Finally, ENISA also supported the creation of the NIS  Cooperation Group Work stream for Healthcare.  O.1.1.5. Building knowledge on maritime security  Main achievements:    ‘Cyber risk management for ports’ report    Support to SafeSeaNet project   Contribution to the development of a Transport  Cybersecurity Toolkit for Commission services (DG  Mobility and Transport)  ENISA published the deliverable: ‘Cyber risk  management for ports’. This report intends to provide  port operators with guidelines and good practices to  tackle the oft-cited issue of cyber risk management.  Port operators are meant to find in the report the  support they need in adopting the risk assessment  methodology of their choice. The maritime work  stream of the TRANSSEC Experts Group, Commission  services (DG Mobility and Transport) and additional  stakeholders from the maritime sector all validated  the report.  Moreover, ENISA provided support to EMSA as  an opinion for the security requirements of the  SafeSeaNet project.  ENISA contributed to the development of the  “Transport Cybersecurity Toolkit” for the Commission  services (DG Mobility and Transport) and provided  input on the sectorial specificities in maritime. ENISA  supported the creation of a Cyber Work Group in the  European Coastguard Function Forum (ECGFF) and  took part in the activities of the work group as member.  ENISA contributed also to the ongoing project  of CESNI/TI on Cybersecurity for Inland Ports as  a member of the informal Advisory Board.  O.1.1.6. Building knowledge on cryptographic  algorithms  Main achievements:    Set of the Ad hoc stakeholders group on  cryptographic algorithms    Research on ‘Post-Quantum Cryptography: Current  state and quantum mitigation’    Study on ‘Crypto Assets: Introduction to Digital  Currencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies’  The Agency set up an ad hoc stakeholders group  on cryptographic algorithms, comprised of EU  institutions. The group met only once physically in  2020 because of the Covid crisis. Further interactions  (i.e. review of outputs, requests for support, feedback)  happened in an asynchronous mode.  Research on Post-Quantum or Quantum-safe  Cryptography were conducted with top experts in the  field. ENISA presented the outputs in a publication,  ‘Post-Quantum Cryptography: Current state and quantum  mitigation’ study. The study provides a concise overview  of the current progress of the standardisation process  of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes. It  introduces a framework to analyse existing quantum- safe solutions, classifying them into families and  discussing their advantages and shortcomings. With  contributions from top experts in the field, it helps  readers navigate an overly complex but also fascinating  topic for the future of cybersecurity. The study aims to  help decision-makers and system designers to take up  actions as soon as possible. It includes useful quantum  resistant techniques that can be implemented  in today’s systems until PQC algorithms become  standardised and generally available. NLO & the  stakeholders’ group reviewed the output and issued  no negative comments. As an exceptional summary of  the current PQC landscape, this deliverable is regarded  as a useful mapping of the current situation. This is  substantiated by the high-level information included on  the ideas behind the algorithms and on the mitigation  instructions for the transition period to actual  standardised PQC algorithms.  ENISA performed an extensive research in  cryptographic building blocks of crypto-assets. The  outputs were presented in thepublication: ‘Crypto  Assets: Introduction to Digital Currencies and Distributed  Ledger Technologies’ (DLTs). The study aimed to  further increase the understanding of theunderlying  cryptographic components. Such components are  the ones forming the blockchain. and by extension  are also part of crypto-assets, digital currencies  and of a host of other possible applications. As  a continuation of an earlier report on the security and  20  challenges of DLTs, this report provides an in-depth  explanation of the technical components involved  and illustrated their uses in popular deployed  instances. By focusing on crypto-assets, it intends to  support policymakers by explaining the underling  cryptographic mechanics used and thus raised  awareness on foreseen security, financial, legal and  data protection issues.  1.1.2 Objective 2: Cybersecurity threat landscape  and analysis – outputs  O.1.2.1. Annual ENISA threat landscape report  Main achievements:    22 reports on new visual and digital e-book format  of Threat Landscape  This year’s ENISA Threat Landscape Report  summarises top cyber threats assessed for the  period covering 2019 to April 2020. Divided into  22 different reports, ENISA released it in an e-Book  form. The provided material presents the assessed  changes of the threat landscape from the 2018  report, further to the transformation of the digital  environment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Moreover, it provides information on various aspects  of cyberthreats, major incidents, advancements in  Cyberthreat Intelligence, sectoral threat analysis,  research issues and threat trends.  ENISA introduced a new visual and a digital e-book  format., The new threat landscape includes seven  strategic reports, along with 15 in-depth reports on  the top cyber threats:    The Year in Review report provided a general  overview of the threat landscape, including the  most important topics, and the top 15 threats,  conclusions and recommendations.    Cyberthreat Intelligence Overview summarised  the most important topics relevant to the  cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) community.    Sectoral and Thematic Threat Analysis reviewed  the threat landscape for specific sectors and  technologies, including specifically ENISA’s work on  5G, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cars.    Major Incidents in the EU and Worldwide  provided an overview of major cybersecurity  incidents happening in the EU and worldwide, and  highlighted the lessons we can learn from them.    Research Topics presented key aspects related  to the research and innovation in cybersecurity  focused in the Cyberthreat Intelligence domain.    Emerging Trends focused on the challenges and  opportunities for the future in the cybersecurity  domain.  A List of the top 15 Threats was followed by a series  of reports describing each of the top 15 threats.  The  threat reports, of technical nature, include findings,  major incidents, and statistics.  Last but not least, ENISA organised the annual event  on Cyberthreat Intelligence EU (CTI EU), which took  place in Brussels in January 2020.  O.1.2.2. Restricted and public info notes on  cybersecurity  Main achievements:  For the year 2020, this deliverable was reprioritised to  support the collaboration with CERT EU. The work was  partially covered through Output 0.1.2.1.  O.1.2.3. Support for incident-reporting activities  in the EU  Main achievements:    Brussels' one-day workshop of telecom security  authorities group    Report on good practices in telecom sector:  ‘Telecom Security during a Pandemic’    Annual incident report of EU’s trust services sector  ENISA supported the Member States with  implementing EU Incident Reporting, by working with  the following working groups.  The European Competent Authorities for Secure  Electronic Communications (ECASEC) is the group  of telecom security authorities from 32 countries,  formerly known as the Article 13a group. ENISA  provided the secretariat and organised one physical  workshops and 2 online ones.    The first ECASEC group of the year was combined  with an open day for industry, gathering  160 telecom security experts in Brussels for  a one-day workshop on a wide range of topics  related to telecom security (including talks on  quantum crypto, zero trust networks, emergency  communications, and the impact of solar flares on  telecom equipment).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 21  PART I. Achievements of the year    ENISA also published a short paper on ‘Telecom  Security during a Pandemic’ giving an overview of  the initiatives and good practices of the telecom  sector to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.  The report highlights the resilience of telecom  networks and services during the pandemic,  which sustained major fluctuations in usage and  traffic, but also points to the need for increased  cooperation between the public and private sector.  The ENISA Article 19 expert group is the group of  supervisory bodies for eIDAS trust services. ENISA  organised one online and one physical workshop and  published the annual incident report aggregating  incidents from 27 EU countries and 2 EFTA countries.  This report was the fourth annual report for the  EU’s trust services sector. The group also delivered  a position paper with input for the upcoming  eIDAS review, including several suggestions for  improvements regarding the supervision of security  requirements in Article 19 of the eIDAS.  For the NIS Cooperation group Work Stream 3, on  NIS Directive incident reporting, ENISA compiled  2 reports, published in 20208. These papers focused  on synergies in incident reporting and on the  first NISD annual report. ENISA adapted its CIRAS  reporting tool for the NISD reporing. It is important  to note that, the group decided to use this NISD  reporting tool in the future.  Such successful outcome  shows the efficiency of the work ENISA performed in  the area in 2020 it will speed up and improve incident  reporting and analysis going forward.  O.1.2.4. Supporting PSIRTs and NIS sectoral  incident response expertise  Main achievements:  This activity was postponed because of the  pandemic.

In order to address these two issues,  ENISA compiled a study by:    Conducting a stock taking exercise with  35 stakeholders from the sector during  a workshop. Key findings and recommendations  in order to establish an EU maturity framework  are provided in the final report.    Mapping the widely used US ES-C2M2 to well- known standards (including ISO 27001). This  outcome is planned to be further consulted and  be published as a joint product with key energy  stakeholders such as ENTSO-E, ACER and E.DSO.  2.  Electricity network code on cybersecurity:  According to Article 59(3) of the Electricity  Regulation (EU) 2019/943 the Commission has  to establish a priority list (every three years in  electricity) identifying the areas to be included in  the development of network codes for electricity.  Cybersecurity has been identified as one of the  key areas in which network codes and guidelines  could be developed. ENISA contributed to this  consultation by providing a position paper  which identifies key challenges and provides  recommendations in six main areas: governance,  security measures, supply chain security,  coordination and crisis management, early  warning capability and situational awareness as  well as cross border risks and dependencies.  Railway sector  ENISA issued the report on ‘Railway Cybersecurity:  Security measures in the Railway Transport Sector’. This  ENISA study assesses the level of implementation  of cybersecurity measures in the railway sector,  within the context of the enforcement of the  NIS Directive in each European Member State. It  presents a thorough list of essential railway services  accompanied by a high-level overview of the railway  systems they support. Finally, the European Railway  Traffic Management System was presented together  with some key cybersecurity considerations and  recommendations.  In November 2020, ENISA and the European Agency  for Railways jointly organised an online webinar  on rail cybersecurity. The webinar showcased the  agencies’ joint activities on rail cybersecurity and  stressed the importance of cybersecurity to railway  stakeholders.  Finance sector  In the finance sector, ENISA developed an EU map  of European cybersecurity policy initiatives in the  finance sector. It was a first depiction of the complex  landscape of initiatives related to cybersecurity at an  EU level. The document was created in an effort to  shed light to the initiatives and to guide interested  parties in engaging with them and benefit from their  produced results. Furthermore, it aimed to make the  cooperation between the initiatives and their different  groups work more seamless.  Additionally, ENISA contributed to a consultation by  the European Commission on the digital resilience  Act (DORA) by providing a position paper to the  consultation. The paper identified key challenges and  provided recommendations in three main areas: risk  management and resilience, information sharing and  cooperation, and on interaction with the NIS directive.  26  2.1.2 Objective 2: Supporting EU policy  implementation – outputs  O.2.2.1. Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  Main achievements:    Six reports on the implementation of Electronic  Identification and Trust Services    Annual Trust Services Forum co-organised with  Commission services  In 2020 the Agency completed a package of six  reports to boost the implementation of the eIDAS  regulation and to promote the uptake of Electronic  Identification and Trust Services.  ENISA published a set of four reports to provide  technical guidance and security recommendations for  the implementation of trust services. These reports  provide a conformity assessment framework for  Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), security  recommendations for QTSPs based on standards,  a security framework for trust service providers  and also a security framework for QTSPs in order  to achieve compliance with Article 19 of the eIDAS  Regulation.  ENISA also published a report on the analysis of  methods used to carry out remote identity proofing.  The report provides an overview of the most common  methods for identity proofing. ENISA illustrated  this using examples received from the different  stakeholders. The report also includes a presentation  of the supporting standards at the international  and EU level and provided the current status quo  in the EU Member States in relation to their identity  proofing laws, regulations and practices. Besides, the  report also includes a preliminary gap analysis on  existing standards and regulations followed by legal  and technical recommendations.  In implementing the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA  supported the eID efforts of the Member States  and the Commission  services in 2020 by working  towards the formulation of an eID maturity model  (MM), focusing on the security of eID schemes, in  the form of a questionnaire. It was envisaged that  the model would allow stakeholders to indicatively  measure the maturity level of security of eID schemes  on multiple topics, as well as the maturity of Member  States in this area. Besides, ENISA organised the  6th annual Trust Services Forum in collaboration  with the Commission services. The forum served  as a platform for stakeholders to share their good  practices on the implementation of trust services,  stood as an opportunity to review the standards,  implementing acts and technical guidelines within  the eIDAS. It also allowed to to discuss strategies  to promote the adoption of qualified trust services.  The event attracted more than 500 participants and  brought together trust service providers, conformity  assessment bodies, supervisory bodies and experts to  discuss the practical and emerging issues under the  eIDAS Regulation across Europe.  O.2.2.2. Supporting the implementation of the  work programme of the Cooperation Group under  the NIS Directive  Main achievements:    Support to Commission services (DG CNECT) with  the review of the NISD    Gap analysis report on the existing national  security measures    Knowledge building session on auditing  frameworks for the energy sector national  competent authorities    Study on good security practices for Digital  Infrastructures    Technical deep dive report on ‘Security of Country  Code Domains in Europe’    Participation to the activities of the group of  national health competent authorities    Report on NIS investments  In 2020, ENISA supported Commission services  (DG CNECT) with the review of the NISD via:    Internal interviews, a survey for the CSIRT network  and drafting of an ENISA position paper which was  submitted to COM as input to the consultation  process.    Input to the consultations through e.g. interviews,  organising meetings with experts from COM, or  active participation to workshops and conferences.    Telecommunication security review after an  extraordinary request by COM.  ENISA also provided support to the Member States  and the COM by taking stock of the existing national  security measures and drafting a gap analysis  report. The purpose of this activity was to analyse  the different national approaches to the security  measures adopted by the Cooperation Group, identify  gaps as well as common good practices.  This year ENISA launched a series of knowledge  building sessions with the purpose of increasing the  awareness as well as the knowledge of the energy  sector competent authorities concerning energy and  industrial control systems cybersecurity.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 27  PART I. Achievements of the year  Furthermore, ENISA supported the NIS Cooperation  group WS10, authorities for Digital infrastructure,  with a wide-ranging security analysis of the Digital  Infrastructure sector, assessing criticality, threats and  good practices. This security analysis was used by the  Commission services as input for the NIS2 proposal,  which proposes to extend the scope of this sector.  The security analysis also helps the authorities with  developing guidelines, by providing the high priorities,  and giving an overview of industry good practices.  ENISA  supported the creation of the NIS Cooperation  Group Work Stream for Healthcare as well. This  group includes the participation of members of the  eHealth Network (national competent authorities for  eHealth).The Agency contributed to the discussions for  determining the priorities and initial deliverables of the  work stream (security measures, incident reporting).  Lastly, ENISA published a report on NIS investments  Lastly, ENISA published a report on NIS investments  in order to document how Operators of Essential  Services (OES)/Digital Service Providers (DSPs) invest  in cybersecurity. The report also provides insights on  how the NIS Directive influenced this investment, and  provides useful data for policymakers to reflect upon  and identify future policy initiatives. This report aims  to serve as a reference point offering policymakers  at an EU and National level sufficient data to better  understand the investments across the sectors in  scope of the NIS Directive as well as the relevant  impact of the NIS Directive and its implementation.

O.2.2.4. Guidelines for the European  standardisation in ICT security  Main achievements:    ENISA co-organised the Annual Standardisation  Conference 2020 and prepared the conference  edition of 2021  ENISA co-organised the Annual Cybersecurity  Standardisation Conference 2020, together with its  partners – the European Standards Organisations  – the European Committee for Standardization  (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardization (CENELEC) and the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The  conference aimed to foster the dialogue among  policymakers, industry, research, standardisation  organisations, certification organisations and those  involved in the development of the ICT certification  framework in Europe, in view of an effective  implementation of the Cybersecurity Act.  ENISA also prepared in 2020 the 2021 edition of the  Conference (online event).  10 http://www.springer.com/computer/ lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-pseudonymisation-advanced-techniques-and-use-cases https://2020.privacyforum.eu/ https://2020.privacyforum.eu/ http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0 http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0  28  O.2.2.5. Supporting the implementation of the  European Electronic Communications Code  Main achievements:    Security analysis of the Over-The-Top services   Development of new reporting guidelines for the  European Electronic Communications Code    Open day event with telecom stakeholders in  Brussels  ENISA supported the group of national telecom  security authorities, namely the European Competent  Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications  (ECASEC) with the transposition of the European  Electronic Communications Code (EECC). This support  translated into the performance of a security analysis  of the so-called Over-The-Top (OTT) services. This set  of services was new in the scope of the EU telecom  security legislation. This work was partly background  material (criticality, risks) and partly input for the OTT  security profile (measures) which would be developed  by the group.  ENISA also developed new reporting guidelines for  the EECC. The new reporting thresholds were needed  because the EECC extended the scope of reporting  to new services and new types of incidents. The  EECC reporting guideline, together with the EECC  security measures guideline (see O.2.2.5), formed  the minimum basis for implementing the security  provisions in the EECC. ENISA will continue supporting  the group with transposition by analysing specific  new EECC topics.  To facilitate the discussions with the industry, ENISA  organised an open day event at the start of 2020  inviting telecom providers, suppliers, and also the  new OTT providers like Facebook and Microsoft.  This (yearly) open day was a success  The open  day – which takes place yearly - was considered  an important action in order to create mutual  understanding and enable the exchanging of views  between the authorities and the sector. With a total of  160 participants attending in Brussels, the event was  therefore considered a success.  O.2.2.6. Support the MS in improving the  cybersecurity of 5G networks  Main achievements:    Update the technical guideline on security  measures under the EECC    Updated version of the 5G Threat Landscape report   Study on security controls in 3GPP and other 5G  specifications    Knowledge building webinar on 5G security   Toolbox implementation progress report  In 2020; ENISA continued to provide an active support  in the area of cybersecurity of European 5G networks,  in particular to assist Member States in implementing  provisions from the EU 5G Toolbox on risk mitigation  measures. Two key achievements in this domain  were the new Guideline on Security Measures  under the EECC11 (with the added 5G supplement12),  aligned with the Toolbox and with the new European  Electronic Communication Code that came into force  in December 2020, and a new version of ENISA Threat  Landscape for 5G networks13.  In addition, jointly with the Commission services  (DG CNECT) ENISA actively supported the work of  the NIS Cooperation Group Works Stream on 5G  cybersecurity, and was one of the key contributors  in preparation and publication of the 5G Toolbox  implementation report14, published in July 2020.  The Agency had also regular discussions with BEREC  on 5G security (also in the context of ECASEC group)  and co-organised a major workshop on 5G security  with the participation of the private sector.  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on- security-measures-under-the-eecc  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement- security-measures-under-eecc  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat- landscape-report-for-5g-networks  14 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report- member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g- cybersecurity  ENISA supported European  Competent Authorities  for Secure Electronic  Communications  (ECASEC), the group  of national telecom  security authorities with  the transposition of the  European Electronic  Communications Code  (EECC).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g-cybersecurity https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g-cybersecurity https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g-cybersecurity  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 29  PART I. Achievements of the year  2.2 Outputs and performance indicators15 for Activity 2: POLICY  Summary of outputs from Activity 2: POLICY – Promote NIS as an EU policy priority  Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 2.1.

ENISA updated the technical training material and  developed two new trainings sessions in 2020.  ENISA added two  elaborate use cases to the training  that was developed the year before(Orchestration of  CSIRT Tools). The two use cases are: a ransomware  scenario and a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The  focus was on using the set of orchestrated tools for  investigation and mitigation of incidents, emphasising  aspects of automation and information sharing. The  initial modular approached to the ‘Orchestration of  CSIRT Tools ‘allowed to integrate these new use case  scenarios with little extra effort.  The other training developed had a very high focus  on supporting operational practices. The training  was called: ‘Defending Against Adversary Actions’  and the scenario was an Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT) intrusion on a victim network. Both the  attacker and victim infrastructure were emulated  and the training was developed and delivered in  an online virtual lab environment. It aimed more  experienced CSIRT members and could be considered  as an ENISA flagship technical/operational training.  ENISA presented the training in a near final version  to the CSIRTs Network (CNW) members, to whom  an advanced demo/dry-run and access to all the  documentation and manuals were given. The  feedback was very positive and some comments were  taken into account and integrated in the final version.  O.3.1.2. Support EU Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies  Main achievements:    A National Capabilities Assessment Framework  (NCAF) was produced    NCSS workshop to validate the results of the NCAF  study  ENISA produced a National Capabilities Assessment  Framework (NCAF) to measure the level of maturity  of MS cybersecurity capabilities. This framework was  developed to serve as a self-assessment, it used the  national strategy as a starting point and covered 5  maturity levels for 17 strategic objectives that are  structured around four main clusters.  The Agency organised the annual National Cyber  Security Strategies (NCSS) workshop that took  place on the 6th of October to validate the results of  the study on the NCAF. In this workshop 60 experts  from 26 EU Member States participated and  provided feedback.  ENISA started a study to increase the resilience  of SMEs against cybersecurity risks and threats in  http://intraenisa/cod/del/DeliverablesLibrary/WP2020 - O.2.2.4 - Taxonomy of Cybersecurity.docx https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/updated-enisa-5g-threat-landscape-report-to-enhance-5g-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-in-5g-specifications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  32  case of crisis such as COVID19. The results will be  published in 2021.  Furthermore, a workshop took place on the 17th of  November in collaboration with EASME to present  the preliminary results on the study performed on  Cybersecurity for SMEs. Participants from 120 private  and public sector organisations coming from all EU  Member States and several other countries attended  the online workshop.  ENISA supported Greece in the evaluation of their  NCSS by providing guidance, support and input  and by sharing of good practices. This led to the  development of the new GR NCSS (2020 – 2025) that  was published in December 2020.  O.3.1.3. Support EU Member States in their  incident response development  Main achievements:    Study conducted on ‘How to set up CSIRT and SOC’   Report on Sectoral CSIRT Capabilities – Energy and  Air Transport  ENISA conducted a study that was a results-driven  guidance for establishing a computer security incident  response team (CSIRT) and a security operations  centre (SOC). The study includes a guidance on  possible improvements for different types of CSIRTs  and SOCs currently active.  ENISA also developed and published a report  focusingon trends in Energy and Air Transport  Incident Response Capabilities, procedures, processes  and tools., This report also includes insights on  current challenges and gaps facing IR communities.  The CSIRT inventory was updated in June and  December 2020. Currently, there are 583 teams in  the inventory.  The development of the online tool for ENISA CSIRT  maturity assessment started in 2020 and was made  available online in 202116.  O.3.1.4. ISACs for the NISD sectors in the EU and  Member States  Main achievements:    Toolkit for ISACs  16 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt- capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-survey    Supported 5 EU ISACS, Financial ISAC, Rail ISAC,  Maritime ISAC, Healthcare ISAC and Energy ISAC  Specification for a toolkit17 for ISACs – ENISA  developed the comprehensive toolkit “ISAC in a BOX”,  following studies on the ISAC concept, to address  the need to facilitate community building and  collaboration across ISACs. The toolkit is intended to  providepractical guidance and the means to empower  industry for the creation of new ISACs and to further  develop existing ones.  ENISA supported the Financial ISAC, RAIL ISAC,  Maritime IS AC, Healthcare ISAC and the Energy ISAC.  In the Finance ISAC, ENISA hosted two meetings  virtually.  The meetings engaged an average of 25  participants, and included the participation of the  European Central Bank (ECB), and Europol. In the  Railway ISAC, ENISA hosted two meetings virtually  hosted  , engaging an average of 50 participants,  including the European Railway Agency (ERA). In the  Energy ISAC, ENISA supported three meetings with  an average of 25 participants. Additionally, ENISA  organised three webinars based on the interest of the  ISAC members.  In February 2020 the Maritime ISAC was founded.  ENISA participated in 4 meetings with an average of  10 participants and contributed to the formalising of  the ISAC. Finally, ENISA supported the inception and  inaugural discussion of the European Healthcare ISAC.  3.1.2 Objective 2: Support EU institutions in  capacity building – outputs  O.3.2.1. Liaison with the EU agencies on  operational issues related to CERT-EU’s services  Main achievements:    Workshop between CERT-EU and ENISA  CERT-EU and ENISA organised a workshop in February  2020 which concluded  that information sharing  between staff of both entities need to be further  strengthened. In addition it became clear thatboth  entities should cooperate in building synergies on  various areas of activities to contribute to cybersecurity  incident response or event response in the European  Union. ENISA established a task force which mandate  is to strengthen the structural cooperation with CERT- EU, in order to benefit from synergies and to avoid the  duplication of activities.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/isac-in-a-box  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-survey https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-survey https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/isac-in-a-box  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 33  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA attended the CERT-EU Steering Board meetings  in 2020.

O.3.2.2. Cooperation with relevant EU institutions,  agencies and other bodies on cybersecurity  initiatives  Main achievements:    ENISA participation in the EU Cyber Forum  At the September 2020 second edition of the EU Cyber  Forum, the Executive Director of ENISA participated  in the panel ‘Digital society after COVID-19: building  a global cyber resilience regime’. ENISA also co- organised and moderated the working session  ‘Cybersecurity certification: EU and global outlook’.  3.1.3 Objective 3: Awaren ess raising– outputs  O.3.3.1. European Cyber Security Challenges  Main achievements:    Launched the International Cybersecurity  Challenge activity    Planning and execution of ‘ENISA Hackfest 2020’  ENISA launched the International Cybersecurity  Challenge activity. This decision was based  on the success of the European Cybersecurity  Challenge, and it involved the help of other  regional and international organisations, decided  to design and host the International Cyber  Security Challenge (ICSC). To that end, a steering  committee was formed in 2020. Formed by  government, regional institutions, universities and  research centres, the steering committee started  to design  a competition between teams from  different regions.  Teams from as far as South  East Asia, Oceania, US, Latin America and Africa  started to express vivid interest in participating.  ENISA completed the setting up of the steering  committee early in the year.  The Agency planned and executed the ‘ENISA  Hackfest 2020’ on the 16-18th of November.  This was a Capture the Flag (CTF) event between  cybersecurity professionals and students in order  to connect and train the teams taking part in the  2021 European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC).  O.3.3.2. European Cyber Security Month  deployment  Main achievements:    ESCM went fully digital and online with 6 more  Members States participating  In 2020 the ECSM went fully digital and online with  no in-person meetings due to the circumstances  of the COVID-19 outbreak. Notwithstanding these  circumstances, metrics built into the ECSM show  a three-fold increase in outreach, from 2.7 million  citizens that the campaign had reached in 2019, to 9.8  million in 2020.  The 2020 campaign followed the same format  as in 2019. The activities were developed around  two themes: digital skills and cyber-scams. The  overwhelming majority of partners gave ECSM  a rating from good to excellent and believed that the  campaign supported, added value and improved their  national campaigns and that it  promoted sharing  ideas between Member States. Another important  improvement compared to previous years was the  fact that Member States’ participation increased by 22  %, with six more Member Sates actively engaging in  the campaign compared to 2019. Moreover, the ECSM  team received very positive feedback with respect to  the provision of promotional and security awareness  materials translated in all official EU languages,  especially forthose Member States having limited  resources for such production.  O.3.3.3. Support EU Member States in  cybersecurity skills development  Main achievements:    Policy recommendations for the implementation  of ECSC roadmap  ENISA performed an analysis of the key factors  enabling the success of a national cybersecurity  competition and gave a snapshot of the current  situation in the European Union and European Cyber  Security Challenge (ECSC) partner countries. This  analysis helped provide policy recommendations  for both the short-term and the long-term  implementation of this common ECSC roadmap,  with the goal to place the ECSC in a primary position  to support the objectives of the EU Security Union  Strategy for the period 2020–2025.  34  3.2 Outputs and performance indicators18 for Activity 3: CAPACITY  Summary of outputs in Activity 3: CAPACITY – Support Europe in maintaining state- of-the-art NIS capacities  Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 3.1.

O.4.1.2. Support activities for cyber exercises  Main achievements:    Updates and security assessment exercise on the  CEP platform    Support Netherlands and eu-LISA on exercises  ENISA has been developing the cyber exercise  platform (CEP) since 2014.  CEP hosts a number of services ENISA offers to  Member States and EU institutions, such as: exercise  organisation and management, technical incidents.  During 2020, ENISA performed major updates  to the  platform, redesigning for instance the Regeneration  Logic and user interface.  The CEP platform opened new opportunities for  ENISA to enlarge the user base and thus to offer  to the operational cybersecurity communities  opportunities to exercise and to gain experience and  http://intraenisa/cod/del/DeliverablesLibrary/WP2020 - O.3.1.1 - Update of CSIRT training material in the area of operational trainings.docx https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/how-to-set-up-csirt-and-soc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/isac-in-a-box https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsc-2020-analysis-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsm-deployment-report-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-a-common-ecsc-roadmap  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 37  PART I. Achievements of the year  knowledge. An in-depth security assessment including  a penetration testing took place (as per yearly  schedule) to ensure the security of the platform.  ENISA didn’t identify any major issues and used the  results to further improve the infrastructure..  In 2020, ENISA was asked to support the  Netherlands with the scenario of the BlueOLEX  exercise. The exercise consisted in a discussion-based  table top exercise held online. ENISA supported  eu-LISA in organising and executing a cyber-exercise  together with participating Member States.  O.4.1.3. Support activities for cybersecurity  collaboration with other EU institutions and bodies  Main achievements:    Organised a tabletop exercise for the 36th meeting  of ITAC    Development of cyber threat assessment  methodology    Development of an impact assessment model  In 2020, the EU Agencies ICT Advisory Committee  (ICTAC) asked ENISA to organise a tabletop exercise  for the 36th meeting of ICTAC. The mission of ICTAC  is to promote inter-agency cooperation on issues  of common interest in the area of Information and  Communication Technologies, through knowledge  and experience sharing and exchange of good  practice. ENISA co-organised the tabletop cyber  exercise with the ICTAC and CERT-EU.    Furthermore, ENISA  produced a draft on a new  threat assessment methodology. This methodology  was to be mainly used by Blueprint stakeholders, but  could also be employed by any related bodies who  wanted to take advantage of it. It is based loosely  on an existing approach by the NATO Cyber Threat  Assessment Cell (CTAC). The new methodology  is based more on a reproducible mathematical  approach with less ‘wiggle room’ for the quantitative  assessments to facilitate comparisons of assessment  results by different organisations.  Lastly, ENISA designed a model EU institutions  can use to assess the impact of cyberattacks. The  model was designed based on relevant existing  literature, on input from various experts, and on  current practices within theEU institutions. The final  result provided the basis for a fully functional and  operational framework to be developed in 2021.  This work will support collaboration between EU  Institutions regarding cyber crises management as  described in the Blueprint recommendation.  O.4.1.4. Supporting the implementation of the  information hub  Main achievements:    Development of new functionalities of OpenCSAM  ENISA launched the Open Cyber Situational  Awareness Machine (OpenCSAM) 3rd round of  development in 2020 and will be concluded in 2021.  The development of new functionalities for the tool  was based on stakeholders inputs gathered in May  2020. Among those new functionalities are included  the integration with SHODAN and Twitter enterprise  APIs and a collaboration capability based on user- defined circles of trust. As a result, the tool is now  used by over 90 analysts from EUIs, CSIRTs and other  Member States’ Agencies/Organisations.  O.4.1.5. Supporting the EU Cyber Crisis  Cooperation Blueprint  Main achievements:    Support the EU Cyber Crisis Cooperation Blueprint    Development of a cooperation portal for the Cyber  Crises Liaison Network (CyCLONe)  To support the EU Cyber Crisis Cooperation Blueprint,  ENISA developed a Standard Operating Procedures  document for the Operational level cooperation  of EU Institutions. The document integrated into  a joint SOP document of the Commission services  (DG CNECT) and is currently under discussion by  relative stakeholders from EUIs in two separate  working groups.  ENISA also developed and maintained a cooperation  portal for the Cyber Crises Liaison Network  (CyCLONe) in June 2020, following its appointment as  the Secretariat of this group.  4.1.2 Objective 2: Community building and  operational cooperation – outputs  O.4.2.1. EU CSIRTs Network support  Main achievements:    Weekly report during pandemic on cyber threats  to EU Member States    CSIRTs Network Secretariat support    Annual trust exercise  38  Second Report to the Cooperation Group in line with  the NIS Directive requirements  The NIS Directive established the CSIRTs Network  ‘to contribute to developing confidence and trust  between the Member States and to promote swift  and effective operational cooperation’. To date, there  are 39 appointed Members to the CSIRTs Network  covering all Member States and CERT-EU. ENISA  supported the operations of the Network as the  Secretariat and the Commission services participated  as an observer. The COVID-19 related cybersecurity  situation of the significant general security event was  a pivotal moment for the growth of the Network.  The CSIRTs Network moved to remote escalated  cooperation and, at the same time, the ENISA CSIRTs  Network Secretariat strengthened the underlying  infrastructure to support this new normal operational  mode. The Network is ready to respond to COVID-19  related cyber threats. From March to May 2020, the  Network issued a weekly report to the EU and MS  higher levels/and their constituencies, providing  summaries and recommendations on how to face the  cyber threats related to the outbreak.  The CSIRTs Network Secretariat supported the  functioning of the Network in full virtual mode since  March 2020. This included supporting the governance  in the Trio handover, from Romania, Finland, Croatia  to Germany, Portugal and Slovenia; and change  of the Chair in July 2020, from Finland to Slovenia.  Moreover, the CSIRTs Network Secretariat facilitated  the update of the Network’s Work Programme for  2020-2023, the NIS Directive review process initiated  by the Commission services, the Working Groups  cooperation and dedicated ad hoc calls.  Furthermore, the CSIRTs Network managed to have  the 11th meeting in Stockholm in February but moved  to virtual for the 11th under Croatian Presidency  including a shared session with the Cooperation  Group (CG) and 12th under German Presidency. The  annual trust / team building exercise took place online  in parallel with the 12th meeting and tested the CSIRTs  Network members’ technical skills and knowledge of  the Terms of reference (ToR), Rules of Procedure (RoP)  and Standard operating procedure (SOP).  The CSIRTs Network also successfully completed the  second Report to the Cooperation Group in line with  the NIS Directive requirements. The report covers the  period from 1st of July 2018 to 1st of February 2020.  During the reporting period, the CSIRTs Network  held four meetings (Vienna, Brussels, Bucharest and  Helsinki), three of the meetings also provided the  opportunity ofa shared session with the Cooperation  Group (CG). Activity of the Working Groups is  detailed in the report as well as the infrastructure  and tools usage. The report assesses the experience  gained with the operational cooperation, including  conclusions and recommendations.  O.4.2.2. Support the fight against cybercrime and  collaboration across CSIRTs, Law Enforcement  Agency and other operational communities  Main achievements:    2020 Report on CSIRT-Law Enforcement  Cooperation    Training material on CSIRT-Law Enforcement  Cooperation    Annual ENISA-EC3 Workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs and their LEA counterparts  ENISA compiled and published the 2020  Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation20. The report  proposes a methodology to analyse the legal and  organisational framework shaping the CSIRTs and  law enforcement (LE) cooperation as well as their  interaction with the judiciary. It also identifies  synergies and potential interferences.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/2020-report-on- csirt-le-cooperation  The NIS Directive  established the CSIRTs  Network ‘to contribute to  developing confidence and  trust between the Member  States and to promote  swift and effective  operational cooperation’.

ENISA also carried out its tasks as co-chair  with the Commission of the SCCG, and provided  secretariat services.  O.5.1.2. Research and analysis of the market as  an enabler for certification    Proposed set of methodological steps to allow for  a market analysis  Main achievements:  A study was undertaken on identifying an initial  set of methodological steps to allow for a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products,  ICT services, and ICT processes. The performance  of a market analysis on cybersecurity certification  aimed at contributing to the EU cybersecurity  certification framework and the planning activities of  the Commission services, the ECCG and the SCCG by  identifying future areas for cybersecurity certification.  The proposed steps identified in the study cover:    the identification of the context of the market  analysis;    the scope of the target of analysis;   an assessment of the impact of a cybersecurity  certification initiative;    the identification of the available options and  possible initiatives.  O.5.1.3. Set-up and maintenance of a certification  portal and associated services  Main achievements:    Development of public cybersecurity certification  website  ENISA opted for a CIRCA BC solution, offered by DIGIT,  in order to establish a certification management of  IT system (CerMIT) to provide securely a cooperation  platform for its certification stakeholder community,  including the ad hoc Working Groups.  The Agency also launched the development of a public  cybersecurity certification website in accordance with  article 50 of the CSA in 2020 and reached the phase  of initial process definition, technical set up, and  consultations with Member States.  Objective 2: Developing candidate  cybersecurity certification schemes –  outputs  O.5.2.1. Hands on tasks in cybersecurity  certification of products, services and processes  Main achievements:    The Risk Assessment and Assurance Level definition  project (RA&AL)  ENISA drew a ‘Methodology for consistent, risk  based definition of cybersecurity certifications  schemes’, (hereinafter called, ‘Methodology’)  to determineassurance levels in cybersecurity  certification particularly in sectoral schemes.  Examples ofsuch sectoral systems are mobile  networks and services, health telematics, payment or  mobility infrastructures.  This Methodology can be combined with common  ISO/IEC 27005-conformant risk assessment tools and  can generate a sound understanding of the sectoral  system concerning cybersecurity at business process  and at component level.  The Methodology enables the implementation of key  requirements of the EU Cybersecurity Act and has  the potential to promote the market acceptance of  cybersecurity certification. This methodology was  presented to CEN CENELEC in relation to European  standardisation activities.  44  ENISA organised the Cybersecurity Certification  Conference virtually and from Brussels on  18 December 2020.  O.5.2.2. Tasks related to specific candidate  schemes and ad hoc working groups  Main achievements:    The candidate European Common Criteria Scheme  (EUCC)    The candidate European Cloud Services Scheme  (EUCS)  Following the Commission request ref  ARES(2019)4895286 dated 20/07/2019, ENISA  prepared the candidate EUCC scheme on ICT  products, to serve as a successor of the Senior  Officials Group on Information Systems Security  Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOG-IS MRA). This  candidate European cybersecurity certification  scheme focuses on certification of ICT products.  ENISA, and the dedicated Ad Hoc Working Group of  experts and stakeholders, in close collaboration with  the ECCG, worked on finalising the first draft.  This draft version was made public for consultation  in July 2020. ENISA invited all relevant stakeholders  to bring forward their recommendations, remarks,  or share their concerns in an open, transparent and  inclusive consultation process. Both the ECCG and the  SCCG participated in the public consultation as well.  Based on the ECCG Opinion finalised in December  2020, ENISA will transfer the candidate scheme to  the Commission, as to serve as a reference for the  Implementing Act for the scheme.  ENISA continued providing its support to the  Commission for follow up activities. Such activities  include the  development of the the necessary  guidance to facilitate transition between current  SOG-IS practices and the new rules set by the scheme,  and the contribution to the work related to the  establishment of a scheme maintenance organisation.  Following the Commission request ARES  (2019)7197658, dated 21/11/2019, ENISA also  prepared a candidate European cybersecurity  certification scheme on cloud services (EUCS).  The work on this candidate scheme started in the  beginning of 2020 after the Ad Hoc Working Group of  experts and stakeholders was constituted.  Together with the Ad Hoc Working Group, ENISA  drafted the first version of the EUCS candidate  scheme following the advice and close cooperation  of the ECCG members. The draft EUCS candidate  scheme produces a coherent approach on the  security of cloud services taking into account the EU  regulatory framework, international standards, best  industrial practices, as well as with existing (national)  certification schemes in EU Member States.  The diverse set of market players, complex systems  and constantly evolving landscape of cloud services,  along with different schemes in Member States,  represent challenges to the development of cloud  services in general. The draft EUCS candidate scheme  tackles these challenges by calling for cybersecurity  best practices across three levels of assurance and  by allowing for a transition from current national  schemes to the EU-level. By defining a security  baseline for every assurance level, the draft EUCS  candidate scheme is a horizontal and technological  scheme that intends to provide cybersecurity  assurance throughout the cloud supply chain, and  forms a sound basis for sectoral schemes. The  structuring principles of the scheme were submitted  to the SCCG members and to a limited pool of  experts over the summer, and the first consolidated  version was presented for public consultation in  December 2020.  Following the  Commission request,  ENISA prepared  a  candidate European  cybersecurity  certification scheme on  cloud services (EUCS).  This candidate scheme  started its work in the  beginning of 2020 after  an Ad Hoc Working  Group of experts  and stakeholders  was appointed.

The Resources Department  The Resources Department administered a range  of services across finance and procurement, ICT,  facilities management, health and safety physical  security, and liaison with local authorities.  TheOut of a total of 24 posts assigned to the Resource  Department, 15 staff members contributed to the  tasks of internal controls and risk management  (including Head of department), Finance and  Procurement Unit, and Corporate support services.  The Accounting and compliance officer acted as Head  of Finance and Procurement unit and not calculated  in the total number of staff members.  Also, as of March 2020 Human Resources reported  directly to the Executive Director. The Unit was managed  by the Head of Data Security and Standardisation as  acting Head of Unit. The unit had 4 staff members.  ENISA resorted to external staff to allow for the  full execution of tasks of the department. A total of  10 interim agents was assigned to the Resources  department and 5 interim agents assigned to Human  Resources to cover vacant posts and extra workload.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-certification-eucc-candidate-scheme  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 47  PART I. Achievements of the year  In March 2020 the Executive Director established  the Executive Director’s support team to strengthen  internal coordination capacity at ENISA, among other  tasks previously in Resources Department’s remit.  As a result of the problem analysis endorsed by  the Management Board in February , the Agency  started a reorganisation process coordinated by  the Executive Director’s support team and the  Human Resources unit, both reporting directly to the  Executive Director.  The objective of the Resources Department is to  equip the agency with state-of-the-art strategies,  programmes and tools to optimise the use of  resources across ENISA, enabling it to deliver on the  work programme and statutory commitments.  The  department initiated specific projects to support the  delivery of the work programme, such as the update  of the Business Continuity Plan and ENISA internal IT  Strategy but the agency could not provide them.  The Core Operations Department  The Core Operations Department coordinated the  delivery of ENISA’s core activities. As such, its main  role is to deliver the work pertaining to Activities A1– A5 of the work programme. The Policy Office and the  Public Affairs Team also reported to the Department.  The support The Core Operations Department also  supported the ENISA Advisory Group and the National  Liaison Officers (NLO) Network.  With 61 staff members and 11 posts unfilled in 2020,  the Core Operations Department counted a total of  72 posts. In addition, the department had the support of  16 external staff, covering the functions of vacant posts  and extra workload.  b) POLICY OFFICE  The Policy Office reported to the Head of Core  Operations Department. Through the Policy Office,  the Agency initiated and developed strategic  cooperation with active relevant stakeholders from  the cybersecurity community, and managed Public  Access to Documents (PAD) requests pursuant to  Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.  The Public Affairs Team (PAT) reported to the Head of  the Policy Office and coordinated all communication  activities, including media and press activities such as  press releases, news items and interviews to enhance  the reputation, visibility and the public image of the  Agency. It supported the entire Agency regarding  publications, social media promotion, website  management, public affairs activities and awareness  campaigns. PAT was also responsible for establishing  ENISA’s corporate visual identity and branding.  Due to pandemic in 2020, limited number of physical  events took place, however the team supported  events taking place online. PAT also managed the  ENISA website.  Besides, additional information on the activities  delivered by the Policy Unit and Public Affairs  team are listed in Objective 6.2 Engagement with  stakeholders and international activities.  In March 2020 the Executive Director established  the Executive Director’s support team to strengthen  internal coordination at ENISA, and perform other  tasks previously in the Policy Office's remit.  c) INTERNAL CONTROL  This topic is covered in Part III – ‘Assessment of the  effectiveness of the internal control systems’.  d) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  TheAgency migrated to a new fully operating  datacentre in the course of the year and, in  cooperation with another EU Agency it synergised  to use the latter as a Disaster Recovery (DR) site for  some of its critical corporate IT services.  TheAgency followed up with actions to strengthen  its own cybersecurity standing in the CIA triad  (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The Agency  upgraded its entire email system to the latest  version, provisioning for load balancing to enhance  availability and removal of older protocols. The  Agency also successfully reinforced its directory  services and strengthenedits security filtering and  antispam polices.  In 2020, ENISA  successfully hosted  and evolved the central  component of MeliCERTes.  MeliCERTes is the primary  collaboration platform for  the CSIRTs of participating  Member States.  48  Task Objective Level of completion in 2020  Keep ENISA systems safe from cybersecurity incidents (from  exterior) – detect, prevent, react and recover from threats Security 100 %  ENISA IT managed servers patched in time Security 100 %  Exchange server availability Efficiency 100 %  Availability of internal applications Availability 95%  Help desk, reply with success to all service requests Efficiency 99 %  e) FINANCE AND PROCUREMENT  This topic is covered in Part II.3, ‘Budgetary and  financial management’.  f) LEGAL AFFAIRS, DATA PROTECTION AND  INFORMATION SECURITY COORDINATION  Legal Affairs  Legal affairs continued supporting the legal aspects  associated with the operation of the Agency;  thus ensured the efficient legal support within  the spectrum of activities of ENISA. This included  dealing with matters such as (indicatively) contracts,  procurement, employment related matters, data  protection in collaboration with the Data Protection  Officer, access to documents and corporate  governance matters. The Legal Affairs function also  included dealing with complaints to the European  Ombudsman. In general the Legal Affairs ensured  also the interpretation and implementation of  primary and secondary legislation to ENISA activities,  provided legal advice and drafted reports on ad hoc  legal issues. ENISA resorted to external Legal counsel  only to assist in the resolution of staff matters.  Data Protection Compliance tasks and Data  protection Office  ENISA is subject to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on  the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data by EU institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies (EUDPR)25. A Data Protection  Officer was appointed according to EUDPR and  relevant ENISA implementing rules26.  Within 2020, ENISA complied with all requests  for information/reporting, as well as relevant  recommendations of the European Data Protection  Supervisor (EDPS), including in particular:    EDPS monitoring exercise on registers under Art.  31(5) EUDPR, which involved the publication of  ENISA’s online register of data processing activities27.    EDPS Strategy to comply with Schrems II ruling,  which encompassed an Agency-wide stock taking  exercise and reporting on cases of transfers of  personal data to third countries (following CJEU  Schrems II Judgment)28.  25 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection  of natural persons with regard to the processing of  personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies and on the free movement of such data,  and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision  No 1247/2002, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.

Due to the pandemic, the Agency’s methods had to  extend to new services; to address such shortcomings  as identified in terms of electronic signatures  orvideoconferencing for large conferences for  instance. Mitigation measures were proposed and  started being implemented in late 2020, allowing the  Agency to continue operating remotely.  ENISA successfully hosted and developed the  central component of MeliCERTes. MeliCERTes  was the primary collaboration platform for CSIRTs  of participating Member States. The platform  standsas a means to improve EU Member States  preparedness, cooperation and coordination to  improve cyber threat and cross-border incident  response. ENISA IT incorporated the MeliCERTes  support service delivery structure into its own  on-premises JIRA ticketing system, creating a solid  structure for incident response.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 49  PART I. Achievements of the year  In this context, the DPO’s activities within 2020  included:    Provision of various data protection opinions and  advice in accordance with EUDPR and on different  topics across the Agency, including on records  of processing activities, Data Protection Impact  Assessments and security of processing;    Maintenance of the ENISA’s central register of data  processing activities;    Data protection compliance monitoring, especially  through contract monitoring and monitoring of  international transfers of personal data;    Awareness raising through the provision of data  protection training to ENISA’s staff members;    Collaboration with the EDPS and the EU  Institutions and Agencies (EUIs) DPOs network,  including the co-chairing of the joint EUIs DPOs- ICTAC Working Group and participation in the  DPOs Working Group on procurement;    Provision of data protection advice to CEDEFOP, in  the context of the standing co-operation between  ENISA and CEDEFOP and the relevant SLA that has  been established between the two Agencies.  Information Security coordination  The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  coordinates the Information Security Management  System on behalf of the Authorising Officer. In  particular, the CISO advises the ICT Unit to develop  and implement information security policies,  standards, guidelines and baselines that seek to  secure the confidentiality, integrity and availability  of the information systems of the Agency. The CISO  is instrumental in incident handling and incident  response and security event monitoring. The CISO  also leads the security training for the Agency’s staff  and he provides security guidance on all IT projects,  including the evaluation and recommendation of  technical controls. For the referenced year, the ENISA  CISO contributed to the following activities and  objectives:    Conducting an annual risk assessment exercise  and follow-up actions.  -  Monitoring and reporting the following to ENISA  Internal IT Advisory Committee (ITAC).  -  Performed regular vulnerability assessments and  penetrations tests.  -  Network security monitoring and incident  response.  -  Implemented the security awareness policy and  improved the IT Security training    Non-compliances with policy identified and  addressed  -  Advising on security policies and updating  existing ones in line with the evolution of threats  and risks  -  Implementing new systems and tools that  can support improvements on Information  Security. All these activities where conducted  in the context of a re-organisation process that  eventually changed the governance model and  implicitly the roles and responsibilities.  6.3.2 Objective 2: Engagement with stakeholders  and international activities  a) STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION AND  DISSEMINATION OF ENISA’S DELIVERABLES29.  In 2020, ENISA maintained its efforts to improve its  focus on key activities and to engage the highest  possible number of stakeholders. This includes  the different groups of stakeholders from Member  States, EU Institutions, bodies and agencies as well as  academia, industry, the public, etc. In its engagement  with the stakeholders, ENISA is guided by principles  such as balanced representation, openness,  transparency and inclusiveness. This is evidenced  by organising open calls for expression of interest  for various groups that contribute to ENISA work  programme implementation.  Anew strategy was adopted for the Agency in 2020.  The first objective of this strategy is to achieve  ‘Empowered and Engaged Communities across the  Cybersecurity Ecosystem’ striving for a cross sectoral,  all-inclusive cooperation with our stakeholders.  The Management Board appointed the Advisory  group in the course of the year. The appointment  was based on a proposal of the Executive Director,  with balanced numbers between female and male  representatives. The group represents 14 countries  with a mixture of old and new EU Members.  29 Work delivered by ENISA such as reports, recommendations,  info notes, opinion papers, tools, platforms, training material  or contents, etc.  50  Dissemination and outreach  ENISA further engaged in developing tools and using  channels, including its website, for the dissemination  of ENISA’s deliverables and for outreach, with a strong  emphasis on social media. ENISA saw an increase in all  relevant social media metrics: The Agency’s audience  (followers) increased by 33% compared to 2019. In  addition, there was a 27.4% increase in published  posts, a 59.4% increase in post impressions and  a 121% increase in engagements. ENISA’s website also  received 12% more visits compared to 2019 while the  number of downloads of ENISA’s publications was  increased by 30%.  Early on in 2020, ENISA conducted regular press  interviews during events. In January 2020, ENISA gave  5 interviews organised at the FIC conference in France  and 3 interviews organised at the DLD conference in  Germany. This trend was interrupted by the pandemic  and the total number of spokesperson interviews in  2020 for ENISA ENISA dropped to 15, a total lower  thank in 2019. In addition, ENISA was mentioned  around 30 times in top-tier, Brussels-based and  national media outlets.  During the initial phases of the pandemic, ENISA also  provided tips and recommendations for cyber secure  teleworking, videoconferencing and selling online  etc. A Covid-19 information hub was created on the  website to facilitate the outreach of this information  to a wider audience.  Two other awareness and outreach activities  were organised to reach stakeholders online.  ENISA’s campaign to generate awareness (1)  about different types of online threats and (2) the  promotion of ENISA Threat Landscape, achieved more  than 1.2 million impressions in Twitter and LinkedIn.  The campaign for the promotion of ENISA’s work  related to the EU Cybersecurity Package generated  more than 1.5 million Twitter impressions and more  than 16 thousand engagements.  Internal communications    In 2020, ENISA took a step forward to enhance  staff engagement and to exploit opportunities  for pooling and sharing resources. The scope of  this activity was limited on organisational and  prioritisation grounds; main activities followed  the pattern described hereinafter:    Regular updates to staff by internal  announcements on aspects concerning staff;  particular attention was paid to aspects related  to the pandemic in an effort to keep cohesion  across the Agency staff.    Regular sessions regarding the evolving  reorganisation of recourses that were carried  out at all layers of hierarchy and levels of  involvement.    Launching and utilising specific instruments  such as staff interviews, to allow quicker  integration of incoming staff.    Adapting organisational frameworks to the  Agency’s corporate culture and practices,  by shaping appropriately the competences  framework.    A staff survey activity in relation to the  reorganisation in 2020 also took place.  With regards to the reorganisation, the Executive  Director’s Support Team supported a number of  internal communications activities. In January 2020,  a staff day was held to kick off the reorganisation  with a staff consultation process. As of 15 April  a weekly Question and Answer session (remotely)  was also organised on various topics related to  the reorganisation, to give staff the opportunity to  ask questions. A new webpage was created on the  Intraenisa to provide information to staff on the  reorganisation.  The Executive Director sent regular emails and videos  to all staff with updates on the reorganisation and  other activities of relevance to staff.  Because of the pandemic, a number of events  and team activities were cancelled or postponed .  A few units still managed however to organise team  building activities during the summer.  ENISA’s internal communications objectives for 2020.  Task Objective Level of  completion 2020  Maintain staff  informed on  ENISA Activities  (internal  communications)  Hold 10 staff  meetings  per year  27 Q&As30and  3 staff seminars  meetings took  place  Team-building  activities  Events with  participation  of all staff  Impacted by  the pandemic  COVID-19  30 Due to the process of reorganisation of the Agency in 2020,  Questions and Answers sessions were arranged online to all  ENISA staff.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 51  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA Advisory Group  The ENISA Advisory Group was established by the  new CSA. It replaces the Permanent Stakeholder  Group. ENISA published a call for expression of  interest for the selection of the current Advisory  Group early in 2020. Further to the call,ENISA  proceeded with the selection and nomination  of experts from all sectors specified in the CSA.  The current group took office on 1 July 2020 with  a mandate of two and a half years.  This group, composed of industry, academia and  consumer organisation experts, continues to advise  ENISA on drawing up a major part of the annual work  programme except regarding the provisions of Title III  (‘Certification’), on the performance of its tasks and to  engage effectively with stakeholder communities.  Two virtual meetings took place in July and  November. New rules of procedure for the AG were  adopted and activities where the group can assist  ENISA with its work programme were identified as  planned. ENISA ran a pilot with the Advisory Group  to provide feedback on output finalisations. ENISA  proposed three different outputs for feedback;  output O.1.1.3, Output O.1.2.131 and Output O.2.2.432.  The result of the feedback received led to a number  of changes within the outputs including clarifications  and editorial changes, but it also provided valuable  input on how to improve specific outputs in 2021.  National Liaison Officers Network  Set up in 2004 as a series of informal points of  communications in the Member States, the NLO  Network became a statutory body of the Agency via  the 2019 Cybersecurity Act.  The NLO Network had 3 virtual meetings in the  course of the year: in May, October and December.  ENISA also developed, consulted and adopted new  rules of procedure for the Network ENISA organised  a training for NLOs interested in cloud security in  December, after the NLO meeting.  A pilot was run with the NLO Network to provide  feedback on output finalisations. Input was provided  to 8 outputs of work programme 2020. The result of  the input received led to a number of changes within  the output and the outreach of the outputs.  31 Output 0.1.1.3 and 0.1.2.1 is listed in the table 1.2. Outputs  and performance indicators for Activity 1: EXPERTISE  32  Output 0.2.2.4 is reflected in the table 2.2. Outputs and  performance indicators for Activity 2: POLICY  b) INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS  Under the Executive Director’s guidance and  initiative and in line with the approach agreed by the  Management Board, ENISA’s main focus in 2020 was  the implementation of its mandate in relation to the  EU internal market. Some activities were carried out  to strengthened contacts at an international level,  in particular with the US partners to exchange on  lessons learned in response to the pandemic.  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 53  1 MANAGEMENT BOARD  The Management Board had two ordinary meetings  in the course of the year plus one extraordinary  meeting. The extraordinary meeting took place to  endorse the draft single programming document  2021-2023, the statement of estimates 2021 and the  establishment plan 2021, among other decisions.  In total, the Management Board made 22 decisions  during the year, which include the Agency’s new  strategy, the establishment of ENISA internal  structures, as well as the setting up of the Advisory  Group for the period 2020-2023.  In addition, the work programme 2020 was  amended in response to the COVID -19 pandemic  to shift to online environment for implementing the  work programme outputs.  As part of its functions, the Management Board  adopted its analysis and assessment of the 2019  annual activity report in which it commended the  agency on the very high standard achieved in the  delivery of its work. The Management Board also  expressed its opinion on the final annual accounts for  2019 and adopted the ENISA Programming Document  2021–2023, including the 2021 budget and the 2021  establishment plan.  Sharing information with the Management Board  regularly, ENISA reported on the work programme,  budget implementation, and audit and evaluation  activities (by e.g. ECA, IAS), among other pertinent  matters.  The Management Board endorsed the proposed  reorganisation of the Agency’s structure. The risks  and/or issues identified in the Agency to potentially  impact internal and quality controls in addition  to the results of the problem analysis performed  substantiated the endorsement by the Management  Board. The board members remained committed to  declaring their interests in order to avoid any conflicts  of interest at meetings by providing their annual  declarations of commitment and providing updated  declarations of interest.  In addition, the Management Board, in agreement  with the Commission, continued to engage in the  adoption of the necessary implementing measures  under the arrangements provided for in Article 110  of the Staff Regulations, namely on procedure for  dealing with professional incompetence (MB 2020_10)  and on the conduct of administrative inquiries and  disciplinary proceedings (MB 2020_13).  The Management Board decisions were prepared  by the Executive Board and adopted by the  Management Board.  The Executive Board had one formal meeting per  quarter.  PART II (A) MANAGEMENT  53  5454  2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS  The ENISA strategy, adopted by the Management  Board in June 2020, sets concrete strategic objectives  for the Agency and will guide the multiannual  programming of the Agency in the coming years.  These strategic objectives are as follows:  1.  Empowered and engaged communities across the  cybersecurity ecosystem;  2.  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU polices;  3.  Effective cooperation amongst operational  actors within the Union in case of massive cyber  incidents;  4.  Cutting-edge competences and capabilities in  cybersecurity across the Union;  5.  A high level of trust in secure digital solutions;  6.  Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity  challenges;  7.  Efficient and effective cybersecurity information  and knowledge management for Europe.  The strategy’s high-level objectives are directed at  shaping a more digitally secure environment for  Member States, EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies,  SMEs, academia and all of Europe’s citizens. The  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity will use the  new strategy to map out its annual work programme  to improve the level of cybersecurity across the  Union, and specifically to:    Direct the allocation of its human and financial  resources;    Develop the necessary capabilities under Article  3(4) of the CSA to maintain competitiveness and  preparedness.    Build on the Agency’s trusted relationships  with stakeholders and communities within the  cybersecurity ecosystem across Europe.    Guide ENISA communications within and beyond  the Union, to non-EU countries and international  organisations.    Deepen the knowledge and information sharing  of ENISA expertise to reach larger audiences and  increase awareness of digital security.    Provide cybersecurity stakeholders a clear  understanding of the Agency’s priorities and  actions.    Shape the future outlook of cybersecurity across  the Union.  The strategy is both an aggregation of the tasks  identified by the  Cybersecurity Act and the developed  synergies within Articles 5-12 of the CSA.  COVID-19  The second significant development that framed the  2020 work programme was the Agency’s response to  the global COVID-19 pandemic.  ENISA was called upon to support during these  testing times by making recommendations to the  critical infrastructure industry, supporting the EU  Tracing Apps Toolbox, providing cybersecurity advice  to SMEs and guidance to the healthcare sector against  the increase of phishing campaigns and ransomware  attacks. ENISA raised awareness of cybersecurity risks  and recommendations on a variety of topics such  as working remotely, shopping online and e-health;  and with the support of its partners issued weekly  situation reports of on-going cyber incidents. In  addition, the CSIRTs Network was placed on high alert  requiring increased support by the Agency. Through  protecting critical infrastructure, public outreach and  creating a common situational awareness, ENISA  played a key role in preventing malicious cyber actors  from taking advantage of the health pandemic and  turning it into a large scale cyber pandemic.  Reorganisation  ENISA embarked on a journey to reorganise the  organisation in light of the new strategy and the new  mandate of the Agency under the Cybersecurity Act  and on the basis of the problem analysis endorsed  by its Management Board.  The Management  Board set out principles for preparing, deciding and  implementing all the steps necessary for reorganising  the Agency and establishing the new internal  structures. The following principles guided the  Executive Director in preparing and implementing the  new organisation:  Purpose: the new organisation (including proposals  regarding the Agency’s internal structures) will be  implementing the Agency’s mandate, tasks and  functions as outlined by Union law and the values and  objectives as set by its Strategy.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 55  PART II. Management  Proportionality: the new organisation will ensure  the Agency’s continuous functioning, will aim to limit  disruption to the Agency fulfilling its mandate, and  will not go beyond what is necessary to address  agreed problems and aims.  Synergies: the new organisation will aim to  strengthen internal synergies and enhance  cooperation with the Agency’s strategic European  partners as defined by the CSA.  Efficiency: the new organisation will aim to  enhance the organisation’s performance, the  impact of ENISA and budgetary efficiency and  sound budgetary management.  Agility: the new organisation should facilitate the  Agency’s potential flexibility in terms of its human  and budgetary resources, as well as take into  account the ever growing and changing nature of the  cybersecurity ecosystem.  Transparency: all steps toward modifying or  reforming the Agency’s internal structure and  the steps leading to the implementation of the  reorganisation will be executed in an inclusive  manner, discussed and consulted with the  Agency’s Executive and Management Board and staff.  Predictability: the new organisation will be  implemented in a stage-by-stage approach allowing  staff and partners to anticipate and adjust to changes.  Competences: development of staff will be based on  their preferences, expertise, competences and talent,  whilst taking due account of their current functions  and career goals and the needs of the Agency.  Openness: new functions and posts within the  Agency will be filled through open competitions or  internal mobility organised on the basis of open  calls and through a transparent assessment of  merits and talent.  The Agency took different actions to initiate the  changes needed. The first step consisted in identifying  the problems of the current structure and look at how  employees function together as a team and how they  are equipped and empowered to deliver against the  work programme. ENISA organised a 2-day workshop  for staff to engage in the discussions.  The main problems identified were a) the  imbalance between the talent, functions and aims of  the two then departments, b) the limited synergies  between both the departments and within the  departments; c) weaknesses in internal controls  framework. This problem analysis was endorsed by  the Management Board.  In addition, ENISA created a competency framework  to measure the future state of competencies needed  for the new organisation. These competencies were  grouped into four categories; Corporate DNA, Next  Generation, Managerial and Functional competencies.  The competency framework provided a profile based  on specific sets of competencies and set levels of  proficiency levels for each competency.  Interviews were arranged with a third party to assess  the staff motivation and to give staff an opportunity  to express their interest in transferring to a new job  profile within the new organisation.  The Management Board established ENISA’s new  internal structure in June. The new organisational  architecture introduced a number of structural  elements to strengthen the Agency’s ability to build  internal and external synergies by introducing cross  structural teams to lead the work on horizontal tasks  (CSA Art 9-12) which require contributions from all  vertical units and could not be efficiently managed  within a unit. In addition, the role of the Management  Team is to coordinate the activities of the constituent  parts of the Agency in order to ensure efficient and  effective implementation of the Work Programme (Art  20d) and sound budgetary management.  Four operational units were created:  the Policy Development and Implementation  Unit ensuring the performance of the tasks of the  Agency as set out in Art. 5 of the CSA;  the Capacity Building Unit ensuring the  performance of the tasks of the Agency as set out  in Art. 6 and Art 7(5) of the CSA;  the Operational Cooperation Unit ensuring the  performance of the tasks of the Agency as set out  in Art. 7 (except for Art 7(5)) of the CSA;  the Market, Certification and Standardization  unit ensuring the performance of the tasks of the  Agency as set out in Art. 8 and 22 and under Title  III of the CSA.  Two internal new structural units were created  (Corporate Support Service and Executive  Director’s Office) to ensure sound budgetary  management and effective and efficient management  of all its other resources, as well as compliance  with the Agency’s work and the regulatory and  programming framework. The culmination of these  5656  changes saw the ratio of administrative / neutral staff  (40%) to operational staff (60%) that had historically  been high at the Agency shift towards a greater  balance in favour of operational activities.  A process was set in place to guide the transfer of  staff into the new structure and to ensure a smooth  and effective transition to the new organisation. This  process included the creation of a Joint Committee,  an advisory body to facilitate the decision-making of  the Appointing Authority according to the principles  outlined in Annex II Art 2 and 3 of the Staff Regulations.  Using an established methodology, the Joint  Committee’s final final assessment concluded  whether a staff member’s current tasks and/or job  description matched to a great extent (e.g. at least  75% to the tasks of a new structural unit), then an  offer letter was proposed for an automatic transfer  to the new unit. Dedicated consultations were held  with any staff member who refused the automatic  transfer offer.  All staff members were transferred to the new  structure by 01.01.2021 via individual ‘transfer  decisions’ by the Appointing Authority acting solely in  the interest of the service according to Article 7 of the  Staff Regulations. All transfer decisions were prepared  in a transparent and open manner towards staff  members, taking into account their current functions  and tasks, motivation, experiences and competences.  For managerial positions, the managers of units  which managed at least 75% of the operational tasks  (as outlined in Art 5-12 of Title I chapter II in the CSA)  of a new structural unit, were offered a transfer to  a new managerial position through internal mobility.  Three managerial positions were transferred via  internal mobility via this process. All other new  managerial posts were fulfilled via open competitions.  In order to inform all staff on the various processes of  the competency framework and staff transfers, since  15 April a weekly Questions and Answers session  was organised by the Executive Director. Every week,  a different aspect of the reorganisation would be  discussed and staff could request information and  provide feedback and input. A staff survey in June  2020 found that 89% of staff indicated that the  amount of information received was just about right  and that 94% of staff indicated that the timing of  information was just about right.  The new organisational structure came into effect as  from 1st January 2021.  Recruitment  In the beginning of 2020 the Agency embarked  on a large-scale recruitment exercise to create  a sufficiently diverse and broad reserve shortlist of  75 candidates with more transversal competences  and skills. This reserve list was intended to be used  to recruit staff into grades AD6–AD8 and functions  and thus fill the gaps in the current establishment  plan, as well as serve as a pool of candidates for the  establishment plan of 2021 and 2022 if necessary, in  line with the needs of the new organization. The TA  call, which was supported by a widespread promotion  campaign, attracted 1 235 candidates (who submitted  more than 1 600 applications) across all Member  States). This resulted in a reserve shortlist of 69  candidates. In addition, this selection came along with  another call for  contract agents , which attracted over  600 applications and resulted in a reserve shortlist of  15 candidates33.  3 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  a) FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  The Agency operated with the budget of EUR  21.6 million equivalent to a 28 % increase in 2020  compared to the 2019 budget (EUR 16.9 million).  The amending budget 1/2020 wasadopted by  the Management Board by written procedure on  28 August 2020. The purpose of this amending  budget was to re-direct funding made available  through the cancellation of projects and forecasted  expenditures due to the COVID-19 pandemic to  finance new projects and activities up to an amount  of EUR 2.5 million, from which EUR 1.6 million are  under operational activities.  ENISA concluded a total of 35 public procurement  procedures (two of which have been jointly done with  Cedefop)  1.  18 were done through re-opening of competition  under framework contract (51 %);  2.  10 were done through negotiated procedure for  middle and low-value contracts (29 %); and  3.  7 were done through open procedure (20 %)  No interest was paid in 2020 to suppliers for  late payments.  33 The establishment plan projected a staff increase over the  period from 111 staff members in 2020 to 121 in 2023.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 57  PART II. Management  The table below shows ENISA’s budget implementation targets and achievements in 2020, which remained high  under restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  Area Objective Target 2020 Level of completion 2020  Budget implementation (appropriations  committed through the year)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 99 % 97.35 %  Payments against appropriations of the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 85 % 68.62 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from previous year (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 95 % 95.86 %  b) BUDGET EXECUTION OF EU SUBSIDY (C1 FUNDS  OF CURRENT YEAR 2020)  During 2020, ENISA committed an amount of  EUR 20 588 320 representing 97.35 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the year  amounted to EUR 14 513 329 representing 68.62 % of  the total budget.  The budgetary execution was high despite the  restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  As compared to 2019, there was a slight increase  in commitment execution – 97.35 % in 2020 as  compared to 96.80 % in 2019, and a slight decrease in  payment execution – 68.62 % as compared to 70.12 %  in 2019. The target of 95 % for commitment rate set  by the Commission (DG Budget) was thus reached.  The payment rate was lower than expected but can  be explained by the new challenges and priorities  stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and by the  renewal of annual IT software licenses. Approved mid- year, the related commitments were therefore only  concluded late in the year. Moreover, ENISA’s budget  increased by almost a third from 2019 to 2020 which  required operational and administrative adjustments  to absorb the substantial difference.  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not paid  at the end of 2020 were carried forward to 2021.  Table below summarises the execution of the budget in 2020.  2020 budget (C1)  2020 area  of budget  allocation  Appropriation  amount (in  EUR)  (1)  Commitment  amount (in  EUR)  (2)  Percentage  committed  (2)/(1)  Payment  amount (in  EUR)  (3)  Percentage  paid  (3)/(1)  Amount  carried  forward to  2021 (in EUR)  Title I (*) 10 753 483 10 488 532 97.54 % 9 278 773 86.29 % 1 209 759  Title II (**) 3 538 031 3 426 650 96.85 % 1 663 918 47.03 % 1 762 732  Title III 6 857 606 6 673 138 97.31 % 3 570 638 52.07 % 3 102 500  TOTAL 21 149 120 20 588 320 97.35 % 14 513 329 68.62 % 6 074 991  (*) Title I does not include revenue of EUR 97 920 from eu-LISA for provision of services (**) Title II does not include the subsidy of up to EUR 640 000 from Hellenic Authorities for the rent of the building  Further details on budget execution are provided in Annex II.  5858  c) AMENDING BUDGET / BUDGETARY TRANSFERS  According to Article 26 of ENISA’s applicable  financial rules, the Executive Director may transfer  appropriations from one title to another of up to  a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the  financial year allocated to the title from which the  transfer is made. Transfers within the same title are  also permitted, without limit.  Beyond the limit referred to above, the executive  director may propose transfers of appropriations  from one title to another to the Management Board.  The Management Board has 2 weeks to oppose  the proposed transfers. After that time limit, the  proposed transfers are deemed to be adopted.  The Agency made three transfers in the reported year  by the decision of the Executive Director (hereinafter  – ED) on the initial budget, and four transfers by the  decision of the Executive Director on the amended  budget (in comparison,  the Executive Director made  four transfers on the initial budget and six transfers  on the amended budget in 2019). The three transfers  on the initial budget included only transfers within  the title. The four transfers on the amended budget  included two transfers within title and two transfers  between titles. Because of COVID-19 restrictions  funds were mainly redirected from salaries, meetings,  conferences, other events and missions to support  ICT projects, translations and interim services.  The table below summarises the changes to the budget in 2020.  2020 budget (C1) (in EUR)  2020 area of  budget allocation  Initial budget Amended budget Transfers approved by  the executive director  Final budget  Title I 12 041 486 11 105 414 (*) – 351 931 10 753 483 (*)  Title II (**) 2 346 000 2 714 724 823 306 3 538 031  Title III 6 761 633 7 328 981 – 471 375 6 857 606  TOTAL 21 149 120 21 149 120 0 21 149 120  (*) Title I does not include revenue of EUR 97 920 from eu-LISA for provision of services (**) Title II does not include the subsidy of up to EUR 640 000 from Hellenic Authorities for the rent of the building  d)  CARRY-FORWARD OF COMMITMENT  APPROPRIATIONS  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not fully  paid at the end of 2019 were carried forward to 2020  (C8 appropriations).  As compared to 2019, there was a 1 % increase in  commitment execution (96.01 % in 2020 compared  to 94.93 % in 2019) as well as a 1 % increase in  payment execution (95.86 % in 2020 compared to  94.93 % in 2019) showing an improvement in financial  management in this regard.  The following table shows the commitment execution and payment execution in 2020.  2020 budget (C8)  2020 area of budget  allocation  Appropriations carried forward  from 2019 to 2020 (in EUR)  Payment  amount (IN EUR)  Percentage  paid  Amount cancelled  (in EUR)  Title I 357 936 321 924 89.94 % 36 012  Title II 2 884 042 2 836 694 98.36 % 47 348  Title III 1 105 354 1 008 690 91.25 % 96 664  TOTAL 4 347 332 4 167 309 95.86 % 180 023  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 59  PART II. Management  4 DELEGATION AND SUB DELEGATION  In the very beginning of 2020, the Executive Director  reviewed the delegation of authorising authority  powers and on 12 February 2020 adopted a new  decision on a framework of the financial delegation  of the authorising officer and of a budgetary  management committee to ensure a sound financial  execution of the Agency’s budget.  This decision confirmed the overarching principle  of financial delegations applicable to heads of  department and heads of unit with a respective limit of  EUR 500 000 and EUR 100 000 per transaction. ENISA  didn’t implement any further sub-delegations in 2020.  Controls on these delegation rights are done through  a periodical revision of the rights granted in the main  financial system, ‘ABAC 34’. ENISA set time limits to  indicate the termination of the respective financial  delegations.  In October 2020, the ECA identified a weakness in  the delegation of financial rights whereas financial  transactions were authorised without having proper  financial delegation rights over the period prior to  12 February 2020.  The Agency took all the necessary steps to address  this  weakness  properly: the Executive Director  set up an independent task force to look into  these transactions and concluded they were free  of conflict of interest and did not jeopardise the  Agency’s financial interests. Moreover, a revision of  the financial delegations, the related financial circuit  and relevant internal controls took place in the last  quarter of 2020 (see also section 2.7.2 European  Court of Auditors).  5 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  ENISA HR took decisive targeted actions prior to the  lockdown imposed by the Greek government, further  to the COVID-19 outbreak, e.g. continuing to ensure  high health and safety measures in place for its staff  (ample supplies of disinfectants, disposable gloves,  masks, basic medicine, and hand disinfectant).  Staff guidelines were drawn up and teleworking was  authorised in lieu of working in the office for all staff  34 ABAC (Accrual Based Accounting): the acronym of the  European Commission’s project to switch from cash-based  to accrual accounting, and of the new accounting system  introduced. https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/ publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_ en.pdf  as of March 11th 2020. Missions and public events  were halted.  Since March 2020, 23% of staff teleworked outside  the place of assignment for longer than 6 months. 6%  of staff teleworked outside the place of assignment  for less than 6 months. The Agency implemented this  duty of care measure in order to allow staff members  to take precautious measures based of numbers of  available intensive care units per member state.  The management of the Agency processed a phased  Return to the Office plan based on: the perception  of the threat to the Agency staff, the assessment of  risk by management, and the mitigation measures  intended to keep staff from aggregating in the office.  Staff safety was and still remains the guiding principle  regarding the implementation of this plan.  During the pandemic, daily updates were sent to all  staff members via a designated functional mailbox,  detailing the number of cases and the most recent  developments in the world, so as to keep staff  abreast. The Agency also authorised reimbursement  of all COVID-19 related tests (PCR, anti-gen, anti- body) for work-related reasons and for travel back  to the place of employment. Human Resources also  revised the core working hours, so as to provide for  greater flexibility for colleagues working from various  locations across Europe. A total of 5 Administrative  Notices were published, as well as 17 intranet  announcements, in addition to the bi-weekly updates  from the Management Team meetings.  The Human Resources unit supported the operational  and administrative goals of the agency in terms of  staff acquisition and development. The planning of,  execution of and accounting for the long- and short- term needs of the agency form the majority of the  unit’s regular activities. In this regard, the Human  Resources unit carries out its tasks in relation to the  management of ENISA’s statutory staff along with  its external staff (e.g. trainees) in line with the staff  regulations / conditions of employment of other  servants of the European Union, as appropriate.  In 2020, ENISA carried out tasks to support the  deployment of the Commission’s information  management system for human resources (‘Sysper’).  Compliance remained a priority for the Human  Resources both in terms of meeting audit and  internal control recommendations and in terms of  meeting statutory requirements such as in the area of  personal data protection.  https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf  6060  As previously mentioned, theAgency embarked  on a large-scale call for expression of interest for  temporary agents (TA) and contract agents (CA)  following an adapted approach, to replenish its  reserve lists with suitable candidates at various levels.  This resulted in a reserve shortlist of 69 candidates  for TA posts and for CA posts 15 in reserve shortlist,  giving ample choice to the Appointing Authority.  The table below shows ENISA’s planned recruitment goals for 2020 to 2021.  Area Objective 2020 target 2021 target  Efficient  management  of selection  procedures  Reduction of time taken to hire (in line with the standard EU  human resources definition, this is the timeframe set from the  deadline of the vacancy for candidates to submit applications  until the signing of the reserve list by the executive director)  ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months  Turnover of staff Reduced turnover rate of statutory staff  (temporary agents and contract agents)  < 15 % < 15 %  Staff performance  management  Implementation and monitoring of the appraisal and  reclassification exercises (launching and completion  of the exercises)  100 % 100 %  6 STRATEGY FOR EFFICIENCY GAINS  ENISA is committed to continuously implementing  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  For this purpose, the agency launched coordinated  initiatives notably with other EU institutions and  bodies, namely CEDEFOP to create synergies and seek  to rationalise its internal processes to improve its  overall efficiency and to follow the benchmark best  practices in the EU agencies. Such initiatives resulted  in signing a contract with Cedefop.  In 2020 ENISA also engaged with EU LISA to seek  such synergies as well. The process was concluded in  early 2021.  ENISA also supported BEREC Office by providing back  up services for storing BEREC’s Office electronically  data as per SLA agreement.  Similarly, in response to tasks provided for in Article  7 of the CSA, ENISA initiated the establishment of  a structured dialogue with CERT EU (Commission  services). The process was endorsed by the The  Management Board of ENISA endorsed the process in  a  emorandum of Understanding.  In addition, further efficiency gains are planned  for the future, based on the deployment and  enhancing of IT tools and internal procedures (such  as Sysper, the Missions Integrated Processing System,  e-recruitment, etc.).  7 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT AND EX-POST  EVALUATION RESULTS DURING THE  REPORTING YEAR  7.1 Internal Audit Service (IAS)  The IAS issued an audit report on  stakeholder’s involvement in the production  of deliverables in June 2018. Five audit  recommendations, two assessed as very important  and three as important, were issued during this  audit. ENISA set up a specific task force to ensure the  adequate implementation of the action plan agreed  with the IAS.  As of end of 2020, four recommendations were  considered closed by the IAS. As for the pending  important recommendation, the few remaining  actions were carried out by the Agency in 2020 by  strengthening its reporting process, notably on the  information to be provided in the Annual Activity  Report. The supporting documents were provided  to the IAS to review its correct implementation in  early 2021. Following its review, the IAS considered in  May 2021 the controls put in place by the Agency as  sufficient to close this recommendation.  Altogether, all five recommendations issued during the  2018 audit are now fully addressed by ENISA.  The IAS audit report on human resources  management and ethics was issued in September  2019. Three very important and four important  and recommendations were issued in this audit.  An action plan was devised and agreed with the  IAS. In the second half of 2020, one very important  recommendation was considered as implemented  and was closed by the IAS. Corrective actions  were consequently implemented by ENISA for the  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 61  PART II. Management  remaining six recommendations in 2020 and were  submitted for IAS review in early 2021. Following its  review, the IAS considered in May 2021 the sufficient  the controls put in place by the Agency to further  close another three recommendations.  Altogether, four audit recommendations were closed  by the IAS while 3 recommendations remain open as  further actions are required to be implemented by  ENISA in 2021.  7.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  In October 2020, the ECA identified a weakness in  the delegation financial rights whereas financial  transactions had been authorised without proper  financial delegation rights in place. The Agency  welcomed this finding and a corrective action plan  was immediately devised to address this legal issue  and to reinforce relevant internal controls. A task  force was constituted to evaluate whether these  transactions jeopardised the Agency’s financial  interests. It is important to note that these financial  transactions did not impact the reliability of the  financial records: these transactions would have been  processed by the Agency anyway as all of these were  completed in the pursuance of the Agency’s objectives  and for its official use.  The corrective action plan also triggered an  immediate revision of the financial delegation  rights as well as of the financial circuit which took  place in the last quarter of 2020 for effective  implementation as from 1st January 2021. This also  follows the recommendation issued by the task  force in its January 2020 report on assessment on  the Agency’s organisational structure and internal  control systems (see also Part III – Assessment of the  effectiveness of the internal control systems).  The ECA issued in 2020 its report on the 2019 annual  accounts of the Agency35. In their audit opinion, all  revenue and payments underlying the accounts  for the year ended 2019 are legal and regular in all  material aspects. Moreover, ‘the accounts of the  Agency for the year ended 31 December 2019 present  fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of the Agency at 31 December 2019, the results of  its operations, its cash flows, and the changes in net  assets for the year then ended’.  The ECA nevertheless identified non-critical  weaknesses on the Agency’s public procurement  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/accounting-finance/ files/enisa-2019-annual-accounts-2013-eca-report  procedures36. In particular, selection and award  criteria in the procurement notice could be improved  and respect of publishing within the deadlines should  be better monitored.  Acknowledging and welcoming these audit  observations, the Agency immediately addressed  these concerns by implementing corrective action  through a reconsideration of its internal processes.  The ECA also observed an increase to the use of  temporary workers and commented on specific legal  provisions governing the use of interim staff37. As  ENISA’s activities are growing, the Agency does rely on  interim staff to perform some of its tasks but only in  case of unfilled vacant posts and of heavy workloads.  To mitigate risks linked to vacant posts, ENISA re- defined its recruitment strategy. The Agency  indeed  launched in 2020 two combined vacancy notices  for Temporary Agents and for Contract Agents  respectively likely to yield a large number of new  recruits expected to reach the staff employment  levels required under the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA  therefore should see It the number of temporary  workers significantly drop in.  To ensure that specific legal provisions governing the  use of interim staff were complied with, the Agency  updated the basic terms of employment in order to  justify the category under which the interim worker is  hired by among other adding a job description to the  contract. ENISA also revised the  extra-legal benefits  granted to staff and the categories of staff who can  benefit from them. This allowed the Agency to ensure  that interim workers enjoyed the same working  conditions as statutory staff.  In response to the Court recommendations and by  following the above mentioned approach, the Agency  is likely to remain a fairly attractive place to work,  while mitigating any legal concerns of its interim  agents and duly motivating its decision to dispense its  appropriations accordingly.  All ECA’s observations stemming from the previous  years were duly addressed except for the adoption  36 See paragraph 17 to 19 of ECA’s Report on the annual  accounts of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) for the financial year 2019 – link to the report is  disclosed in the footnote 31  37 See paragraph 20 to 21 of ECA’s Report on the annual  accounts of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) for the financial year 2019 – link to the report is  disclosed in the footnote 31  6262  by the Agency of a policy on sensitive functions  tobe  made in 202138.  7.3 Ex-post evaluation results  ENISA performed ex post controls, as part of  the internal control framework, for the 2019  financial year. A total of 266 financial transactions  were scrutinised, representing 11.26 % of all the  agency’s financial transactions and 66.66 % of the  agency’s 2019 budget. As a result, recommendations  were issued as follows.  Five recommendations were made pertaining to  observations on administrative procedures for which  corrective measures had already been implemented.  One recommendation was related to financial  management, revealing a weakness in forecasting  expenditures for non-fixed costs.  The final recommendation related to the late  payment of the rent subsidy by the Hellenic  authorities, as it delayed the payment from the  agency to the property owner.  The agency recorded 31 exceptions in the reporting  year: 28 of these were below the relevant materiality  level (less than EUR 15 000). Two exceptions were  linked to a posteriori commitments and the one  remaining exception linked to a consumption that  exceeded the available C8 funds. Reminders and  additional information/training were delivered to the  respective project managers and authorising officers  by delegation on the applicable financial rules and  ENISA will look into the accountability procedure for  future events. In relation to the above, controls for  the 2021 carry-forward will be improved.  8 FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  ISSUED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS BY  THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE  One recommendation issued by OLAF was resolved  in 2020.  submitted to ENISA a report in December  with recommendations to be addressed in the course  of 2021.  38 See Annex of ECA’s Report on the annual accounts of the  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) for the  financial year 2019 – link to the report is disclosed in the  footnote 31  9 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  In relation to the 2019 discharge39, as decided by  the European Parliament, the Executive Director  of the agency was granted discharge regarding the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the 2019  financial year. The closure of the agency’s accounts  for the 2019 financial year was also approved by the  discharge authority.  10 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  The normal activities of the Agency were materially  affected by the fallout related to COVID-19 for the  majority of the 2020 year, ENISA continued to implement  its established greening measures such as; recycling of  office materials, reduction in electricity usage for lighting  and heating/cooling. ENISA also actively implements the  EU GPP (green public procurement) award criteria in  its tendering documentation, with relevant procedures  launched in 2020 such as; Provision of Stationery and  printing supplies; Laptop Computers and Docking  Stations; and Production and supply of branded  promotional material.  The restrictions imposed from March and for the  best part of 2020, such as imposed teleworking and  heavily restricted travel for work related missions, led  to a number of benefits for the environment. With the  majority of staff teleworking from home, the carbon  footprint was significantly reduced per staff member as  they did not drive their vehicles to the workplace; they  replaced EU wide mission travel for video conference  meetings instead; paper based printing at the office  39 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/ document/A-9-2021-0085_EN.html  ENISA continued  to implement its  established greening  measures such as;  recycling of office  materials, reduction  in electricity usage for  lighting and heating/ cooling.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 63  PART II. Management  was substantially reduced, and heating/cooling/lighting  of office space was largely not required.  Whilst it could be argued that the magnitude of  these gains are not sustainable once life goes back  to normal and staff return to their offices, there is  a strong indication, backed by management, that the  ‘new normal’ for staff working conditions will include  a much higher level of voluntary teleworking, and  an ongoing significant reduction in mission related  travel. Furthermore, a carbon neutrality objective  was introduced in the Single Programming document  2022-2024 targeting full implementation by 2030.  It is important to note that in consultation with ENISA,  Hellenic Authorities ENISA found new headquarters  building for ENISA in the reporting year. This will  provide further impetus for implementation of  measures which could not be undertaken in the  current building due to the shared arrangement.  11 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2020 was a challenging year for ENISA for two  reasons: the COVID-19 pandemic and fundamental  changes in modus operandi.  Despite such circumstances, the report  demonstrates that ENISA delivered as expected  with the flexibility needed to reshuffle priorities in  relation to its work programme.  Essential changes were implemented to reshape the  organisational structure of ENISA from top to bottom  and the way the Agency operates. In the transition  actions deemed necessary were taken in order  to increase the efficiency of the Agency including  fulfilling its operational mandate, and address urgent  shortcomings and needs.  Changes included the revision of the role of the  Management Team. The practice of inceptions for  every individual project undertaken to implement the  work programme was introduced at the beginning  of the year, to ensure better coordination within the  Agency and guarantee more targeted and effective  resource management.  The Agency also implemented a new system to  validate the work programme deliverables piloted  in 2020, which consisted in consulting the Advisory  Group (AG), the National Liaison Officers network  (NLO) and other statutory bodies.  Another essential development was the process  engaged in view of the reorganisation of the structure  of the Agency. This reorganisation also applied to  the way ENISA’s internal controls are now set up and  addressed, and in relation to the work programme:  the setting of key performance indicators and the  implementation of new processes.  In addition, the Agency initiated the setting-up of the  structured cooperation with CERT-EU, a statutory  obligation foreseen in the CSA.  Besides, ENISA also launched a process to allow  the handling of a higher level of the EU Classified  Information and engaged in the administrative  processes required for the set-up of the local office in  Brussels, Belgium.  PART II (B) EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS  ENISA contracted the services of Deloitte Consulting and Advisory to perform an ex-post evaluation of the activities  of the Agency implementing the work programme of 2019. This work resulted in a final report and a case study on  Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals. Deloitte aggregated the key findings of the report aggregated  under the following criteria; effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and coordination, relevance, and EU added  value). The contractor submitted  an action plan composed of concrete recommendations to adjust and improve  ENISA’s activities. Recommendations included to redefine key performance indicators (KPIs), to balance and tailor the  Agency’s activities and outputs, and finally to reinforce the position of the Agency within the cybersecurity ecosystem.  64  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 65  1 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  ENISA adopted the revised internal control framework  end of 2019. The revised framework follows  the framework of the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations40 of the Treadway Commission  as adopted by the European Commission, and  comprises five internal control components and 17  internal control principles.  The internal control system is designed to provide  reasonable assurance of achieving effectiveness,  efficiency and economy of operations, reliability of  reporting, safeguarding of assets and information,  and prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of  fraud and irregularities.  In November 2019, the Executive Director created  a task force to assess the Agency’s organisational  structure and internal control systems. A report  was submitted by the task force in January  2020. One of the findings was that the previous  Agency’s organisation was not adequate to  independently implement the principles of the  internal control framework. This led to the re- organisation of the internal control function and  underlying processes.  40 COSO  In order to assess all the components and principles  of the Internal Control Framework, a set of 57 KPIs  was designed and annexed to the MB Decision  MB/2019/1241. All these KPIs are assessed individually  using relevant supporting documents as evidence of  the assessment.  1.1 Assessment of control environment  component  The control environment component consists in five  principles.  Principle 1: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  integrity and ethical values.  The Management strongly encourages all staff to  follow annual mandatory trainings related to integrity  and ethics (which is obligatory for all management  team members).  To that purpose, a training on “Ethics and Integrity” was  given by the European Commission to ENISA’s staff  during 2020. Moreover, different types of material are  at disposal of the staff such as the training content and  the most updated IDOC reports42.  41 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/management-board- decisions/MB%20Decision%202019-12%20on%20internal%20 controls%20framework.pdf  42 Commission’s Investigation and Disciplinary Office  PART III ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  https://www.coso.org/Pages/default.aspx  66  Principle 2: ENISA’s Management exercises  oversight responsibility of development and  performance of internal control.  The Declaration of assurance of the Executive  Director is included in the Annual Activity Report (Part  V). All Authorising Officers by delegation signed their  own declaration of assurance covering their areas.  As a result of the assessment on the  Agency’s organisational structure and internal  control systems by the task force initiated by  the Executive Director, a revision of the internal  controls function took place in 2020 to ensure its  independency and to increase its effectiveness.  Moreover,ENISA fully re-assessed the financial circuit  and financial delegation in 2020. The ECA preliminary  finding (section 2.7.2.) further confirmed the need  to review the financial delegations. ENISA fully  implemented the revised financial circuit and financial  delegation as from 1st January 2021. In particular,  the financial processes were reviewed as well as the  delegations and ceilings of each financial actor.  Principle 3: ENISA’s Management establishes  structures, reporting lines, and appropriate  authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit of  objectives.  To ensure the comprehensive structure and clear  reporting lines are communicated to all staff, the  updated organisational chart is published every  month on the ENISA intranet.  The task force set up by the Executive Director in  November 2019 assessed  ENISA’s organisational  structure, internal processes and internal controls  systems. In this report issued in January 2020,  recommendations included:  1.  to fit ENISA’s organisational structure to its  purposes by better reflecting the new challenges  arising from the Cybersecurity Act; and  2.  to review the internal control function.  As a result, the Agency:    reviewed the overall framework of financial  delegation in February 2020, limiting the number  of authorised officers and created a separate  independent oversight body (Budget Management  Committee) to monitor, among other tasks, the  exercise of sub-delegated powers, with a more  independent setup established in 2021 after  reorganisation;    started to design a new organisational structure  (effective as of 01.01.2021), where the tasks  of budgetary execution and internal controls  (including monitoring) are structurally and  functionally firm and well segregated, with a new  ‘compliance and control’ section within the  Executive Director’s Office with 4 FTEs, separated  from budgetary monitoring and execution (with  the Finance and Procurement Section within the  Corporate Support Service);    in March 2020, further decisions restricted the  financial impact of authorised expenditures to the  Head of Resources Department and in November  2020 suspended the delegation of financial  authority initially given to the Head of Resources  Department,  since the post was disbanded within  the new organisation of the Agency;  As from the 1st January 2021, a single executive  director decision covers all delegations of financial  transactions streamlining the profiles and enhancing  efficiency and effectiveness. Importantly, the new  decision also includes a sunset clause to end all sub- delegated authority automatically 3 months after the  change of the person of the Executive Director, unless  the new Executive Director explicitly confirms the  delegations in place.  To ensure that  the Agency has  a comprehensive  structure and clear  reporting lines and  that this structure  is communicated to  all staff, the updated  organisational chart is  published every month  on ENISA intranet.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 67  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Principle 4: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  attracting, developing and retaining competent  individuals in alignment with objectives.  The Agency made an enormous effort in the reporting  year to widely disseminateENISA’s vacancies using  different channels. Vacancies were advertised  internally through email and Intranet publications  and externally through ENISA website, EPSO and  social media. The extensive communication plan  around these publications partly results from  the  new organisational structure and efforts done in the  strategy on resources needed based on the priorities  of the objectives of the Agency.  The agency managed to significantly reduce t staff  turnover in 2020. The ratio was only of 2 percent  which shows improvement in retaining staff members  in the Agency  All staff performed their Career Development Report.  The internal deadlines were respected and the  exercise was successful.  In order to develop and retain competent individuals,  a Learning and Developing policy is adopted every  year. This policy is detailed and includes the training  plan for the agency wide trainings, as well as the  budgetary resources available for individual trainings.  Internal mobility was exercised during the  reorganisation process in 2020.  Principle 5: ENISA holds accountable for their  internal control responsibilities in the pursuit  of objectives  The Agency defines clear roles and responsibilities  for its staff members as well as sets annual  objectives through annual appraisal exercise. Each  of them are entrusted and accountable for the  performance of the internal control at their level  and based on their functions.  In order to pursue its objectives and to follow up on  the actions taken, a mid-term review is performed by  the Agency in order to evaluate the progress of the  objectives (and their budgetary implementation). In  2020 this exercise led to amendments of the work  programme 2020 and of the associated budget. Such  exercise ensures that corrective actions can be taken  in order to achieve the overall objectives.  The staff efficiency, abilities and conduct in the  service are assessed annually against the expected  standards of conducts and set objectives for each  staff member. Promotion of staff is decided after  consideration of the merits of eligible staff taking into  account their appraisal reports.  1.2 Assessment of Risk Assessment  component  The Risk Assessment component consists in  4  principles.  Principle 6: ENISA specifies objectives with  sufficient clarity to enable the identification and  assessment of risks relating to objectives.  ENISA embarked on defining a new strategy with  objectives allowing for the implementation of the  mandate of the Cybersecurity Act and its mission  statement..  The objectives of the work programme 2020  were  based on the previous organisational structure and  on the previous strategy. Also, the Agency established  a template to incept the implementation of outputs.  This template also includes a risk assessment.  ENISA also prepared an amending work programme  to suggest several changes to the Management Board  and the amended Single Programming Document  (SPD) was approved by the Management Board on  the 16th June 2020 by written procedure (MB/2020/7).  ENISA uses the objectives as basis for allocating  resources to achieve policy, operational and  financial performance goals.  The Agency submitted  its Amending Budget to the Management Board  adjusting its financial resources allocation in response  to the pandemic. The Management Board adopter  the Agency amending budget on the 28 August 2020  (MB/2020/18).  Principle 7: ENISA identifies risks to the  achievement of its objectives across the  organisation and analyses risk as a basis for  determining how the risks should be managed.  ENISA identifies and assesses risks at the various  organisational levels analysing internal and external  factors. Both management and staff are involved  through a process at the level of the Management  team. Every output of the work programme requires  an inception and a finalisation. The template of this  process require a risk assessment for each output.  ENISA estimates the significance of the risks identified  and determines how to respond to significant risks  considering how each one should be managed and  whether to accept, avoid, reduce or share the risk.  68  Nevertheless, Risk Management in 2020 was not  centralised and didn’t have a holistic approach yet.  This created a weakness in the management of risks.  In order to minimise this issue, the Agency created  a Compliance and Control Sector in the course of the  reorganisation to centralise all risks of the Agency in  order to address them correctly and efficiently.  Principle 8: ENISA considers the potential for  fraud in assessing risks to the achievement of  objectives  ENISA renewed its anti-fraud strategy and action plan,  both adopted by the Management Board in February.  Principle 9: ENISA identifies and analyses  significant change  The risk identification process considers changes  in the internal and external environment. The  mitigation actions engaged as early as March when  the COVID-19 crisis emerged are clear examples of  this process. These measures included teleworking,  access to premises with prior approval. Response to  this  As a result, a review of annual work programme  and associated budget took place. Coordination  between departments could have been organised  in a smoother way to allow earlier approval of  the amending budget by the Management Board.  This was rectified by introducing new budgetary  monitoring and reporting framework – establishment  of internal Budget Management Committee  and including specific KPI’s in relation to budget  implementation for middle managers.  Besides, the Executive Director established several  task forces to initiate the changes needed by the  Agency. Different mitigation measures were taken  such as the change of the organisational structure  to adapt it to the objectives of the CSA; the analysis  of internal synergies to improve ; the revision of the  financial circuits and actors.  The Agency will be relocated to a new headquarter  mid-2021 is expected to stir up a significant change.  ENISA launched the relocation process in the  reporting year. This is expected to allow for a smooth  transition from the old building to the new one. The  Executive Director created a dedicated task force and  relocation team  to support this change.  1.3 Assessment of control activities  component  The control activities component consists in 3  principles.  Principle 10: ENISA selects and develops control  activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks  to the achievement of objectives to an acceptable  level  Results of control and performance indicators are  monitored as to ensure achieving related objectives.  These controls take place twice a year (mid-term  review and end of year report).  In order to ensure a high level of control, the Agency  applies ex ante verification on 100 % of its financial  transactions. In order to complete this control, an ex  post control verification is performed every year.  The Business Continuity Plan is being revised and will  be finalised by the end of 2021.  There was no map of critical and sensitive posts  established in 2020. Such mapping is expected to be  carried out in the course of 2021.  Principle 11: ENISA selects and develops  general control over technology to support the  achievement of objectives  ENISA applies appropriate controls to ensure the  security of the main IT systems which the Agency is  the system owner of. It is done in accordance with  the IT security governance principles, in particular  as regards data protection, professional secrecy,  availability, confidentiality and integrity.  A dedicated staff member acts as Information security  officer. Regular vulnerability assessments and  penetrations tests were performed. ENISA provided  to all staff its the security awareness policy and an  improved IT Security training. Non-compliances with  policy were identified and addressed.  In order to reinforce these controls, an IT risk  assessment was conducted in 2020. The new IT  Management Committee set up in Q4 of 2020 is  currently revising the IT strategy and the IT security  policy. The Agency keeps a complete recording of  security breaches and addresses them properly.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 69  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Principle 12: ENISA deploys control activities  through policies that establish what is expected  and in procedures that put policies into action  Internal control activities were deployed thanks to  the revision of objectives and deliverables by Head of  Units and Department, to the measurement of results  against the forecasted expectations; and the validation  of deliverables by expert communities, including the  reorganisation process. The Agency performed an  external ex-post evaluation of its activities based on  effectiveness; efficiency; coherence; coordination and  added value of its activities.  The Agency regularly updates its Register of  Exceptions as needed. The contents of the 2020  Register of exceptions  are detailed in paragraph 2.7.3  on ex-post controls and evaluations.  1.4 Assessment of information and  communication component  Principle 13: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  ENISA has the information required to support the  functioning of the internal control system and the  achievement of its objectives.  The Agency uses a centralised external  communication tool for incoming/outgoing  documents. Official documents (outgoing and  incoming) are registered, numbered and archived.  The fact that Agency can retrieve 100 % of the  documents requested by the IAS/ECA is an excellent  indicator. All documents are archived on ENISA’s  intranet; paperless and requests for financial reports  can be processed on the spot using Business Object  and ABAC.  Principle 14: ENISA communicates information  internally, including objectives and  responsibilities for internal control, necessary to  support the functioning of internal control  ENISA and the management communicate internally  about their objectives, challenges, actions taken  and results achieved. Internal communication is  performed using different channels. Communication  to staff is enabled through Staff Meetings; Unit  meetings, Minutes of Management Team meetings  distributed the same day to all staff via email and  published on the Intranet.  The Agency uses different tools for internal  communications. Most common tools are the ENISA’s  intranet; email; Skype for Business and WebEx. The  Agency carried out all internal communications  remotely and through online meetings as of mid  March 2020.  Mid-term reviews of the budget are also used as an  opportunity to communicate on objectives achieved and  ongoing projects  or on changes needed as well as the  strategy to be followed to deliver the Agency’s outputs.  There is a separate communication line for  whistleblowing arrangements. The basic principles,  definitions and reporting mechanism are described in  the whistleblowing policy.  Principle 15: ENISA communicates with external  parties about matters affecting the functioning of  internal control  The Agency communicates on its Internal Controls  through the Annual Activity Report and regularly at  Management level.  Also, regular reporting on IAS and ECA  recommendations and their follow up is provided  to the Executive Board and through the discharge  procedure.  1.5 Assessment of monitoring activities  component  Principle 16: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  ENISA continuously monitors the performance of  the internal control system with tools designed  to  identify internal control deficiencies, to register and  assess the results of controls, and identify control  deviations and exceptions.  The Agency performed  an external ex post  evaluation of its activities  based on effectiveness;  efficiency; coherence;  coordination and added  value of its activities.  70  The Agency follows up, in a timely manner, the  recommendations of auditors as well as risks  identified in the ex-ante, ex post controls and  evaluations. The status of these recommendations  is communicated twice (mid-term review and Annual  Activity Report).  ENISA did not perform any change in relation to these  processes in the reporting year.  Principle 17: ENISA assesses and communicates  internal control deficiencies in a timely manner  to those parties responsible for taking corrective  action, including senior management as  appropriate  Internal control deficiencies identified are  communicated to the parties responsible and to  the Management team. Mitigation measures are  addressed immediately. They are planned and have  a date for implementation. The Agency follows up  closely these deadlines as well as the result of the  mitigation measures proposed.  2 CONCLUSIONS OF ASSESSMENT OF  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  ENISA carried out an internal controls assessment  exercise late 2019 which concluded that the  structures supporting internal controls and  compliance appear to be spread out and hence weak.  The report for a dedicated task force that carried  Issued by the dedicated task force who carried  out such assessment, the report suggests the  implementation of  an independent quality control  system to reinforce the monitoring of performance  assessment. The task force also advised to  restructure  horizontal tasks such as internal controls,  ex ante verification, ISO, budget monitoring and  quality controls.  Those issues were addressed through the  reorganisation and overhaul of internal processes  undertaken in 2020 and in force as of 01.01.2021. The  improvements will be assessed at the next mid-term  review of the Agency.  3 STATEMENT OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL COORDINATOR IN CHARGE  OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL  CONTROL  I, the undersigned,  manager in charge of risk management and internal  control within the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA),  in my capacity as manager in charge of risk  management and internal control, declare that, in  2020 risk management and internal controls was  responsibility of the Resources Department and this  area was identified in problem analysis that led to  reorganisation of ENISA in 2020. In accordance with  ENISA’s internal control framework, I have reported  my advice and recommendations on the overall state  of internal control in the agency to the executive  director.  I hereby certify that the information provided in the  present consolidated annual activity report and in its  annexes is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate,  reliable and complete.  Athens, 30 June 2021  Ingrida TAURINA  Head of Executive Director's Office  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 71  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  72  IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 73  1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The declaration of assurance, provided by the  authorising officer, is mainly based on the following  three pillars:  1.  regular monitoring of the KPIs set for operational,  administrative and financial tasks through the  formal periodical management reporting;  2.  effectiveness of the internal controls and  processes to detect weaknesses and to identify  areas for improvement;  3.  assessment and reports from independent bodies  (external evaluators, financial auditors (ECA,  complemented by a private audit firm), internal  auditors (IAS), etc.).  As highlighted in the previous sections, by the  operational, administrative and financial KPIs, and  by the positive opinion of the ECA on the reliability  of the accounts and on the legality and regularity of  the transactions underlying the accounts, and as no  critical observations have been formulated by the IAS,  management has sufficient assurance that ENISA is  adequately managed so as to safeguard its financial  resources and to pursue the tasks with which it has  been entrusted.  The management declares having sufficient  assurance that ENISA is adequately managed so as to  safeguard its financial resources and to pursue the  tasks it was entrusted with in 2020.  This assurance is substantiated by the operational,  administrative and financial KPIs, and by the positive  opinion of the ECA on the reliability of the accounts  and on the legality and regularity of the transactions  underlying the accounts. This assurance is further  justified considering that the IAS did not formulate  new critical observations.  2 RESERVATIONS  Considering the results of the 2020 annual audits  performed by the ECA and the IAS, the 2020 results  of the internal controls (ex post controls and review  of the register of exceptions) and the 2020 results  of the key financial and operational indicators, the  authorising officer can conclude that ENISA operated  in 2020 in such a way as to manage appropriately the  risks to a large extent.  However, the internal controls and compliance  framework applied by the organisation and  which to a large extent (except for some urgent  modifications in 2020) existed until 31.12.2020,  also demonstrated weaknesses, in particular in  relation to the unauthorised use of financial rights  by staff members in early 2020. Though this incident  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  74  represents a breach of trust from the point of view of  the authorising officer (Executive Director), it was the  inability of internal controls framework to: (1) stop  the unauthorised use of the European Commission's  corporate financial management system ABAC; (2)  restrict the use of financial delegation without prior  acceptance of such delegation; and (3) notify the  authorising officer on such infringements; which  gave rise to the outlined reservations. Though  actions were taken, foremost in the framework of the  reorganisation in 2020, to address deficiencies and  ensure more efficient and effective management of  risks, the performance of the internal controls in 2020  was not fully in line with the required standards.  Nevertheless, and after undertaking additional  steps in 2020, the authorising officer has reasonable  assurance that the allocated resources were used for  their intended purposes, in compliance with the legal  framework and in accordance with the principle of  sound financial management.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 75  PART IV. Management assurance  76  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 77  I, the undersigned,  Juhan LEPASSAAR,  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair (43) view of the state of the  agency’s affairs, and state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities  described in this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of  sound financial management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees  concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year  of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the agency.  Athens,  Juhan LEPASSAAR  Executive Director  43 True and fair in this context means reliable, complete and accurate.

Human resources statistics  On 31 December 2020, the agency had a total of 79 statutory staff in-house (45).  Most represented nationality (46) 2015 2020  Number  % Number  %  Greek 18 (out of 63) 28.6 31 (out of 79) 39.2  Looking back in 2019 and 2020 positive measures to improve the diversity of nationalities included broad  outreach campaigns on popular media across the European Union, closer consideration on the nationality spread  in relation to competencies requested, and specific provisions on the vacancy notices have been continued.  45 The data does not include the additional 9 AD appointments as per footnote 15. 46 The imbalance in the most represented nationality at ENISA is related to several factors, such as the level of posts and related salaries,  which may be perceived as less appealing for job seekers from relatively more advanced Member State economies; the fact that  ENISA is considered to offer better working conditions than the average conditions offered in the Greek job market; the small job  market in Greece for cybersecurity professionals; and historical decisions taken by previous Appointing Authority powers delegated  to the Executive Director (AIPNs). Other reasons that may be cited are the need for stability during the start-up phase of the Agency,  with staff members from the hosting Member State (Greece) being less likely to resign (resulting in lower turnover), which, because of  the relatively young age of the Agency, is still having an impact; the relatively better academic profile of Greek candidates applying for  lower level posts; the relatively smaller payroll cost for Greek staff who are better qualified than average and who do not require an  expatriation allowance; and the general tendency for people to remain in lower level positions in the home country.

The digital transformation we saw emerging in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was both unexpected  and unprecedented. The measures to contain the epidemic imposed on the world new ways to operate and  tested our efficiency and flexibility. As the dependence on digital services started to rise rapidly, cyber threats  and attacks increased proportionally in the EU and in the rest of the world, and demonstrated the need for more  cybersecurity. ENISA remained at the forefront of this battle to give the support needed to the European Union,  to the Member States and the EU citizens in these exceptional circumstances to prevent and mitigate threats and  ensure business continuity in all spheres of our society.  I am very proud to report the success of the Agency in responding to these challenges. We managed to sail the  storm, and made the most of our work programme to ensure the best possible outcomes.  In relation to Covid-19, the Agency was called upon to help coordinate the activities of the EU Member States and  bodies at the very start of the pandemic. ENISA therefore issued recommendations to the critical infrastructure  industry, and supported the EU tracing apps toolbox. The Agency also provided advice to SMEs and guidance to  the healthcare sector to enable them to respond to the increase of phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks.  Such preventive actions, although in relation to the pandemic, still fall into the mandate of the Agency to raise  the cybersecurity resilience of the EU.  It is important to underline the significant progress made in 2020 by the Agency in developing the new areas  foreseen by the Cybersecurity Act, especially in relation to the implementation of the Cybersecurity Certification  Framework. This progress included the development of a methodology to enable the implementation of key  requirements of the CSA, the candidate European Common Criteria Scheme (EUCC) on ICT products and the  candidate European Cloud services scheme (EUCS).  We also supported the EU in relation to the cybersecurity challenges of the 5G networks, and updated the  technical guidelines on security measures under the EECC and the 5G threat landscape. ENISA also contributed  to the development of the 5G toolbox in cooperation with the Commission services.  This proactive stance of ENISA is part of the new strategy established in the course of the year and adopted  by the management board in June 2020. This document sets the foundation of our strategic objectives and  priorities and serves the purpose the purpose of mapping out the annual work programme, fulfilling the  Agency’s permanent mandate and moving towards « A trusted and cybersecure Europe ».  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 7  The Management Board of ENISA also approved the amendment of the 2020 work programme made necessary  by the pandemic. The objective of this amendment was to allow us to resort to the online environment for those  activities delivered in presence before the emergence of COVID-19. In parallel, an amending budget was adopted  in August to re-direct funding to new projects as a replacement of activities which could not take place because  of the pandemic.  With the new strategy designed to integrate the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act, came the need to change  the organisational structure of the Agency. To achieve this ambitious goal, the Agency mapped its human  competences, changed or created new internal processes and formed new teams to trigger better internal  dynamics. The reorganisation was approved by the Management Board in June 2020 and was implemented as of  1st January 2021.  To strengthen the existing human resources and increase the capacity of the Agency to meet the requirements  of its extended mandate, a large-scale recruitment exercise was also launched in 2020. The widespread  promotional campaign enhanced the visibility of the vacancies resulting in the submission of more than 1200  applications coming from all Member States. Thanks to this initiative the Agency was able to use a pool of 84  shortlisted candidates to fill the open positions it had in 2020. The purpose of this pool was also to facilitate the  recruitment process for openings in the operational units in 2021 and 2022.  Highlights of ENISA’s work in the area of expertise included the 4th annual IoT security conference on operational  IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Supply Chain for IoT. Our experts developed security recommendations  addressed to the professionals of the Connected and Automated Mobility sector.  Artificial Intelligence was also under scrutiny and resulted in the AI threat landscape published in December  2020. ENISA started to cooperate with the new working group on AI as soon as it was established in May.  As for cybersecurity exercises, due to the « force majeure » of the situation, it was generally agreed to postpone  the European Cybersecurity Challenge to 2021 and to also postpone the pan-European cyber exercise,  Cyber Europe 2020.  I am proud to report that the Capture-the-Flag (CTF) event « ENISA Hackfest 2020 » went ahead in a virtual setting  and successfully attracted 250 participants from 17 EU and EFTA Member States. In addition, I am glad to report  the likewise successful digital edition of the 2020 European Cybersecurity Month campaign demonstrated by  a three-fold increase in outreach.  Other works of particular interest included the development of a cyber-threat assessment methodology and  impact assessment model designed to help the EU assess the overall impact of cyberattacks. The work allows  ENISA to support the cooperation among EU institutions on cyber crises management.  ENISA has taken on board the new Security Union Strategy released in July 2020 and included these parameters  to address digital risks.  I am glad to see that ENISA has successfully endeavoured to raise the resilience of the EU critical infrastructures and  to strengthen the EU’s capabilities while maintaining the synergies needed for an effective operational cooperation.  This of course could not have been achieved without the unrelenting support and commitment of all our  stakeholders and I seize this opportunity to thank each one of them warmly and express how grateful I remain to  our communities, to the European institutions and bodies and to all the Member States.  I understand the anxiety and pressure we all experienced in these difficult times. This is why I would like to also  express my sincere gratitude to the Agency’s staff for displaying such resilience and commitment to ENISA. Only  such collective efforts can lead to the success of our endeavours.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director, ENISA  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 91  The analyses and assessment by the Management  Board of ENISA of the consolidated annual activity  report for the year 2020 of the authorising officer  of ENISA  The Management Board takes note of the  Consolidated Annual Activity Report (CAAR) for the  financial year 2020, submitted by the Executive  Director of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in accordance with Article 48 of  the Financial Regulation applicable to ENISA.  The Executive Board received a copy of the CAAR  2020 produced by the Executive Director of  ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 1st June  2021 and the Management Board received a copy of  the 2020 AAR on the same date.  The Management Board performed the analysis of the  CAAR and completed its assessment. The conclusions  of the Management Board are the following:    The challenging circumstances which emerged  as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic led to the  adoption of a number of amendments to the  work programme 2020 and associated budget.  The amendments allowed the Agency to adjust  its meetings to the online environment. They  also made it possible to postpone some of its  deliverables requiring physical presence.    Despite these challenges, the Agency was able to  meet the objectives set in the work programme  2020 as shown by the results presented in this  report.    The CAAR presents key results of the  implementation of the ENISA work programme  2020 thus demonstrating how the Agency  successfully completed all deliverables as agreed  with the Management Board in the amended work  programme 2020.    The new strategy of ENISA was adopted by  the Management Board in June 2020. The  programming of the Agency’s work will be based  on the strategic objectives and priorities defined  in this new strategy. The activities of the Agency  will be planned accordingly using a multi-annual  framework covering the years to come.    Furthermore, the Agency embarked on the  reorganization of its internal structures, adopted  by the MB in June 2020. The new organisational  structure aligns the tasks and functions of the  Agency’s structural set-up with the Cybersecurity Act.    ENISA produced 45 reports and engaged in  various activities according to the provisions of its  mandate in the Cybersecurity Act and pertaining  to the current cybersecurity environment. These  reports provided assistance to many sectors listed  in the NIS Directive, but also in evolving areas such  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  10  as Artificial Intelligence. Impact indicators show  that the Agency's results exceeded the targets  established in the work programme 2020, against  the framework of the ENISA Strategy 2016-2020.    In 2020 the Agency began to fulfill its role in the  area of Cybersecurity certification framework,  in particular for candidate schemes on common  criteria and cloud services. This work will be  continued in 2021, by preparing candidate  schemes for other areas in response to the  requests received from the Commission services.    Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA work  programme 2020 and ENISA’s work is well aligned  with the overall European Union priorities for the  Digital Single Market. A coherent link is provided  between activities planned in the work programme  2020 and the actual achievements reached in the  reporting period.    The AAR also describes how ENISA managed its  resources and presents the budget execution of  the EU subsidy. In the course of 2020, the Agency  operated with a budget of EUR 21.6 million  equivalent to a 28 % increase compared to the  2019 budget (EUR 16.9 million). The amending  budget was adopted by the Management Board by  written procedure on 28 August 2020. The purpose  of this amending budget was to re-direct funding  made available through the cancellation of projects  and forecasted expenditures due to the COVID-19  pandemic to finance new projects and activities up  to an amount of EUR 2.5 million, from which EUR  1.6 million were under operational activities.    During 2020, ENISA committed a total amount of  EUR 20 588 320 representing 97.35 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the  year amounted to EUR 14 513 329 representing  68.62 % of the total budget. The budgetary  execution was high despite of the restrictive  circumstances imposed by COVID-19.    As compared to 2019, there has been a slight  increase in commitment execution – 97.35 % in  2020 as compared to 96.80 % in 2019, and a slight  decrease in payment execution – 68.62 % as  compared to 70.12 % in 2019. The target of 95 %  for commitment rate set by the Commission (DG  Budget) was reached.    In 2020, the Executive Director reviewed the  delegation of authorising authority powers and  on 12 February 2020 adopted a new decision  on a framework of the financial delegation  of the authorising officer and of a budgetary  management committee to ensure a sound  financial executive of the Agency’s budget.    The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2019  Discharge and control results. This section also  notes the main categories of deviation that led to  exceptions reported. In 2020 the agency recorded  31 exceptions: 28 of these were below the relevant  materiality level (less than EUR 15 000) and of  a minor administrative nature with no financial  impact.    In 2020, ENISA undertook an ex post evaluation of  2019 activities within the ENISA work programme  from Deloitte Consulting and Advisory. This  work resulted in a final report and a case study  on Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in  Hospitals. Recommendations included to revise  key performance indicators (KPIs), balancing and  tailoring the Agency’s activities and outputs, and  finally to reinforce the position of the Agency  within the cybersecurity ecosystem.    The turnover of staff was greatly reduced in 2020.  The ratio was only of 2 percent which shows  improvement in retaining staff members in the  Agency. Furthermore, a combined recruitment  procedure organised in 2020 allowed the Agency  to progress rapidly in fulfilling its establishment  plan. It is worth noting that vacant posts for  seconded national experts were fulfilled as well.    ENISA adopted the revised internal control  framework at the end of 2019. The AAR 2020  shows the adequate management of risks,  a high level of transparency, well managed data  protection rules and business continuity activities.    The Management Board notes that infringement  of the use of delegation powers and weaknesses  in internal controls framework were identified  by the European Court of Auditors. The Board  concludes that necessary actions were undertaken  to improve the overall efficiency of the agency in  abiding to its principles and congratulates ENISA  for all the efforts engaged to that end.    The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration  of assurance of the Executive Director as well as  additional information on human and financial  resources, draft annual accounts and financial  reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 11  INTRODUCTION  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the  successful achievements of ENISA in 2020. The  Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA  could deliver the work programme 2020 despite the  unforeseen conditions due to COVID -19, showing  exceptional flexibility and efficiency in challenging  circumstances. The Management Board expresses  its deep appreciation to the Executive Director and  his staff for their commitment and the excellent  performance throughout the year.  The Management Board notes the reservations made  by the Executive Director which do not affect the  validity nor the accuracy of the annual accounts for  the financial year 2020 to the discharge authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management  Board requests the Management Board Secretariat  to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to  the European Commission, the European Parliament,  the Council, the Permanent Representations of the  Member States and the Court of Auditors.  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 131  Implementation of the agency’s annual work  programme: Highlights of the year  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing  and implementing the Union’s cyber policies.  The aim of the Agency is to strengthen trust in the  connected economy, boost resilience and trust of  the Union’s infrastructure and services and keep our  society and citizens digitally secure. ENISA aspires to  be an agile, environmentally and socially responsible  organisation focused on people.  In a world that has become hyper-connected,  cybercriminals pose a significant threat to the  internal security of the European Union and security  of its citizens online. The COVID-19 pandemic has  highlighted the need for more security in the digital  world. People have increased their presence online to  maintain personal and professional relations, while  cybercriminals have taken advantage of this situation,  targeting in particular e-commerce and e-payment  businesses, as well as the healthcare system. At the  same time, the Agency also needed to deal with the  challenges of the pandemic and remote working.  THE YEAR IN BRIEF  In June 2019 the new Cybersecurity Act (CSA) came  into force giving ENISA a new and permanent  mandate. The tasks assigned to ENISA under this  regulation are meant to help achieve achieve a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union,  including actively supporting Member States, Union  institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies in improving  cybersecurity.  Such were the circumstances presiding over  the implementation of  the ENISA Programming  Document 2020- 2022, the first programming year  falling under the full scope of the new mandate.  The strengthened and expanded tasks of the Agency  in the field of operational cooperation were tested  in 2020 because of the need to ensure adequate  cybersecurity throughout the corona virus (COVID-19)  crisis. The Agency faced multiple challenges as  a consequence. Acting in the context of Article 7 of  the CSA, ENISA engaged in a number of activities1 that  played an important role in helping EU Member States  1 Including initiating contacts with the European Commission,  the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement  Cooperation’s (Europol) European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU  (CERT-EU) to establish an information exchange network,  which subsequently attracted the participation of the  European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Council of  the European Union; contributing to the technical annex of  the Commission’s recommendation on contact tracing apps.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  14  and bodies coordinate their activities throughout  the initial phases of the pandemic and in raising the  resilience of the EU. These practical steps and actions  are not expected to be one-off endeavours, but will  continue to be pursued through the evolving Blueprint  and future operational cooperation activities.  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YEAR  The Agency took a very proactive stance in the CSA  and made significant progress in developing the new  areas of work foreseen by the act. In this respect,  ENISA laid the groundwork to fully implement the  Cybersecurity Certification Framework. In parallel, the  Agency supported the European Union to respond to  cybersecurity challenges connected to 5G. Additionally,  ENISA engaged additional efforts to integrate the  concepts of the ‘blueprint’ into the cyber-crisis  management approach by unveiling an innovative tool  for knowledge management in this area.  In addition 2020 marked the establishing of the In  addition, 2020 marked the establishiment of the  new strategy of ENISA, adopted by the management  board in June 2020 and used as a baseline to set the  strategic objectives and priorities for programming  the Agency’s work using a multiannual framework,  for the years to come. The new strategy outlines  the Agency’s strengthened path in view of achieving  a high common level of cybersecurity across the  Union. The strategy was developed to fulfil the  Agency’s permanent mandate and takes on the  vision of ‘A Trusted and Cyber Secure Europe’ and  enhanced mission: ‘to achieve a high common level of  cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation with the  wider community.’’  In parallel, the Agency was the object of  a reorganisation engaged in order to align its structure  and organisational capabilities with the needs of  the CSA. The Management Board agreed with the  principles guiding the reorganisation in February 2020.  The new organisational structure was adopted in June  2020 and was implemented on 1 January 2021.  The CSA provides for a framework for European  cybersecurity certification schemes with a view to  creating a digital single market for ICT products,  services and processes. The Agency began to fully  execute this function  in 2020, in particular for  candidate schemes for common criteria and cloud  services. In 2021, the Agency will initiate the work  meant to raise the competitiveness of the European  cybersecurity market and industry. This work includes  advising and assisting EU bodies (including the  Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network2  in setting cybersecurity research and innovation  priorities, as well as by providing regular insights into  how both the supply side and the demand side of  the market function. Such activities will remain in the  years to come and are expected to grow.  The Agency continued to support EU decision-making  institutions in relation to the EU Cybersecurity  Strategy and the announced review of the security  of networks and information systems (NIS) directive.  This renewal and strengthening of a key pillar of  the EU’s regulatory framework. It underpins the  cybersecurity of critical sectors across our society.  It could also further make use of the expanded and  permanent mandate given to the Agency and is  expected to influence the development of the ENISA  work programme in the years to come as a result.  Finally, ENISA negotiated a lease agreement for a new  building in Athens and startedpreparations to move  into the new premises during the summer of 2021.  While being in full telework regime since March 2020  in response to restrictions due to the pandemic, the  Agency remained operational and implemented its  work programme, recruitment, procurement, and  managed to ensure staff wellbeing. Following the duty  of care principle, the Agency allowed staff to carry out  their duties remotely, and from outside their place of  assignment as appropriate, with regular information  being provided to the Executive Board and the  Management Board.  2 In September 2018, the European Commission proposed  a regulation setting up a European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and Network. The (draft) regulation  ensures cooperation and complementarity with ENISA. In  particular, ENISA will have an important role in contributing  to the Centre’s strategic role in coordinating cybersecurity  technology-related investments by the EU, Member States  and industry. The Council agreed its negotiating position in  June 2020 and the trilogies with the European Parliament  began in summer 2020.

This was a seminal piece of work mapping  the AI Threat Landscape. This report presents the  Agency’s active mapping of the AI cybersecurity  ecosystem and its Threat Landscape, realised with  the support of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Artificial  Intelligence Cybersecurity. The ENISA AI Threat  Landscape not only laid the foundation for upcoming  cybersecurity policy initiatives and technical  guidelines, but also stressed relevant challenges.  In October 2020, ENISA hosted an AI security webinar  together with MEP Kaili to explore the cybersecurity  challenges of AI. Speakers and panellists discussed  the current risks and offered ways forward in view  of  establishing a secure ecosystem for AI across  the Union. The event – attended by more than 550  7 ENISA Connected and Automated Mobility Security (CAMSec)  Informal Expert Group  stakeholders – highlighted the role of cybersecurity in  establishing the reliable and trustworthy deployment  of AI – a principal area of work by the EU Agency for  Cybersecurity.  In May 2020, ENISA formed an ad hoc Working Group  (AI WG) composed of 15 members and 6 observers (EU  institutions) in order to best satisfy the objectives of  this Output. Together with the Working Group, ENISA  mapped the threat landscape concerning AI, provided  support to the Commission services on relevant policy  initiatives, and held events to raise awareness on AI  cybersecurity. The ENISA ad hoc Working Group on AI  held 5 plenary sessions throughout the year, as well as  a validation plenary session to discuss and validate the  results presented in the study.  Together with the Commission services (DG JRC),  ENISA worked on a report titled ‘Cybersecurity  Challenges in the Uptake of Artificial Intelligence  in Autonomous Driving’. The report was published  in February 2021 and looks at cybersecurity risks  connected to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in autonomous  vehicles and provides recommendations for  mitigating them.  O.1.1.4. Building knowledge on the security of  healthcare services  Main achievements:   Report on ‘Cloud security for Healthcare services’  Tool development for procurement in hospitals   Online sessions of the annual eHealth Security  Conference    Toolkit development in collaboration with  Commission services (DG CNECT and DG Health  and Food Safety)  ENISA published the report ‘Cloud security for  Healthcare services’. This report identified the  cybersecurity and data protection challenges that  healthcare organisations faced when trying to move  services to the cloud and detailed the key aspects  that should be considered when conducting the  relevant risk assessment. The report focused on three  relevant case studies and detailed a set of 17 security  measures to support healthcare organisations in  addressing the relevant challenges. It was validated  by the eHealth Security Experts Group and additional  stakeholders from the healthcare sector.  ENISA also developed an online tool for procurement  in hospitals. Based on the procurement guidelines  deliverable published by ENISA in February 2020, the  tool provides a simple way for hospitals to identify  good practices of relevance to them based on context  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 19  PART I. Achievements of the year  (e.g. type of procurement, cybersecurity threats/ challenges etc.).  Furthermore, ENISA organised three online sessions  of the annual eHealth Security Conference. The  Danish Health Data Authority, co-organiser of this  year’s conference, together with ENISA redesigned  the eHealth Security Conference this year to focus  on three areas of healthcare’s most pressing cyber  challenges with in-depth online sessions taking place  over a period of three months.  By working closely with Commission services (DG  CNECT and DG Health and Food Safety) ENISA  supported the COVID-19 tracing and monitoring  mobile apps Toolkit development.  Finally, ENISA also supported the creation of the NIS  Cooperation Group Work stream for Healthcare.  O.1.1.5. Building knowledge on maritime security  Main achievements:    ‘Cyber risk management for ports’ report    Support to SafeSeaNet project   Contribution to the development of a Transport  Cybersecurity Toolkit for Commission services (DG  Mobility and Transport)  ENISA published the deliverable: ‘Cyber risk  management for ports’. This report intends to provide  port operators with guidelines and good practices to  tackle the oft-cited issue of cyber risk management.  Port operators are meant to find in the report the  support they need in adopting the risk assessment  methodology of their choice. The maritime work  stream of the TRANSSEC Experts Group, Commission  services (DG Mobility and Transport) and additional  stakeholders from the maritime sector all validated  the report.  Moreover, ENISA provided support to EMSA as  an opinion for the security requirements of the  SafeSeaNet project.  ENISA contributed to the development of the  “Transport Cybersecurity Toolkit” for the Commission  services (DG Mobility and Transport) and provided  input on the sectorial specificities in maritime. ENISA  supported the creation of a Cyber Work Group in the  European Coastguard Function Forum (ECGFF) and  took part in the activities of the work group as member.  ENISA contributed also to the ongoing project  of CESNI/TI on Cybersecurity for Inland Ports as  a member of the informal Advisory Board.  O.1.1.6. Building knowledge on cryptographic  algorithms  Main achievements:    Set of the Ad hoc stakeholders group on  cryptographic algorithms    Research on ‘Post-Quantum Cryptography: Current  state and quantum mitigation’    Study on ‘Crypto Assets: Introduction to Digital  Currencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies’  The Agency set up an ad hoc stakeholders group  on cryptographic algorithms, comprised of EU  institutions. The group met only once physically in  2020 because of the Covid crisis. Further interactions  (i.e. review of outputs, requests for support, feedback)  happened in an asynchronous mode.  Research on Post-Quantum or Quantum-safe  Cryptography were conducted with top experts in the  field. ENISA presented the outputs in a publication,  ‘Post-Quantum Cryptography: Current state and quantum  mitigation’ study. The study provides a concise overview  of the current progress of the standardisation process  of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes. It  introduces a framework to analyse existing quantum- safe solutions, classifying them into families and  discussing their advantages and shortcomings. With  contributions from top experts in the field, it helps  readers navigate an overly complex but also fascinating  topic for the future of cybersecurity. The study aims to  help decision-makers and system designers to take up  actions as soon as possible. It includes useful quantum  resistant techniques that can be implemented  in today’s systems until PQC algorithms become  standardised and generally available. NLO & the  stakeholders’ group reviewed the output and issued  no negative comments. As an exceptional summary of  the current PQC landscape, this deliverable is regarded  as a useful mapping of the current situation. This is  substantiated by the high-level information included on  the ideas behind the algorithms and on the mitigation  instructions for the transition period to actual  standardised PQC algorithms.  ENISA performed an extensive research in  cryptographic building blocks of crypto-assets. The  outputs were presented in thepublication: ‘Crypto  Assets: Introduction to Digital Currencies and Distributed  Ledger Technologies’ (DLTs). The study aimed to  further increase the understanding of theunderlying  cryptographic components. Such components are  the ones forming the blockchain. and by extension  are also part of crypto-assets, digital currencies  and of a host of other possible applications. As  a continuation of an earlier report on the security and  20  challenges of DLTs, this report provides an in-depth  explanation of the technical components involved  and illustrated their uses in popular deployed  instances. By focusing on crypto-assets, it intends to  support policymakers by explaining the underling  cryptographic mechanics used and thus raised  awareness on foreseen security, financial, legal and  data protection issues.  1.1.2 Objective 2: Cybersecurity threat landscape  and analysis – outputs  O.1.2.1. Annual ENISA threat landscape report  Main achievements:    22 reports on new visual and digital e-book format  of Threat Landscape  This year’s ENISA Threat Landscape Report  summarises top cyber threats assessed for the  period covering 2019 to April 2020.

In order to address these two issues,  ENISA compiled a study by:    Conducting a stock taking exercise with  35 stakeholders from the sector during  a workshop. Key findings and recommendations  in order to establish an EU maturity framework  are provided in the final report.    Mapping the widely used US ES-C2M2 to well- known standards (including ISO 27001). This  outcome is planned to be further consulted and  be published as a joint product with key energy  stakeholders such as ENTSO-E, ACER and E.DSO.  2.  Electricity network code on cybersecurity:  According to Article 59(3) of the Electricity  Regulation (EU) 2019/943 the Commission has  to establish a priority list (every three years in  electricity) identifying the areas to be included in  the development of network codes for electricity.  Cybersecurity has been identified as one of the  key areas in which network codes and guidelines  could be developed. ENISA contributed to this  consultation by providing a position paper  which identifies key challenges and provides  recommendations in six main areas: governance,  security measures, supply chain security,  coordination and crisis management, early  warning capability and situational awareness as  well as cross border risks and dependencies.  Railway sector  ENISA issued the report on ‘Railway Cybersecurity:  Security measures in the Railway Transport Sector’. This  ENISA study assesses the level of implementation  of cybersecurity measures in the railway sector,  within the context of the enforcement of the  NIS Directive in each European Member State. It  presents a thorough list of essential railway services  accompanied by a high-level overview of the railway  systems they support. Finally, the European Railway  Traffic Management System was presented together  with some key cybersecurity considerations and  recommendations.  In November 2020, ENISA and the European Agency  for Railways jointly organised an online webinar  on rail cybersecurity. The webinar showcased the  agencies’ joint activities on rail cybersecurity and  stressed the importance of cybersecurity to railway  stakeholders.  Finance sector  In the finance sector, ENISA developed an EU map  of European cybersecurity policy initiatives in the  finance sector. It was a first depiction of the complex  landscape of initiatives related to cybersecurity at an  EU level. The document was created in an effort to  shed light to the initiatives and to guide interested  parties in engaging with them and benefit from their  produced results. Furthermore, it aimed to make the  cooperation between the initiatives and their different  groups work more seamless.  Additionally, ENISA contributed to a consultation by  the European Commission on the digital resilience  Act (DORA) by providing a position paper to the  consultation. The paper identified key challenges and  provided recommendations in three main areas: risk  management and resilience, information sharing and  cooperation, and on interaction with the NIS directive.  26  2.1.2 Objective 2: Supporting EU policy  implementation – outputs  O.2.2.1. Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  Main achievements:    Six reports on the implementation of Electronic  Identification and Trust Services    Annual Trust Services Forum co-organised with  Commission services  In 2020 the Agency completed a package of six  reports to boost the implementation of the eIDAS  regulation and to promote the uptake of Electronic  Identification and Trust Services.  ENISA published a set of four reports to provide  technical guidance and security recommendations for  the implementation of trust services. These reports  provide a conformity assessment framework for  Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), security  recommendations for QTSPs based on standards,  a security framework for trust service providers  and also a security framework for QTSPs in order  to achieve compliance with Article 19 of the eIDAS  Regulation.  ENISA also published a report on the analysis of  methods used to carry out remote identity proofing.  The report provides an overview of the most common  methods for identity proofing. ENISA illustrated  this using examples received from the different  stakeholders. The report also includes a presentation  of the supporting standards at the international  and EU level and provided the current status quo  in the EU Member States in relation to their identity  proofing laws, regulations and practices. Besides, the  report also includes a preliminary gap analysis on  existing standards and regulations followed by legal  and technical recommendations.  In implementing the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA  supported the eID efforts of the Member States  and the Commission  services in 2020 by working  towards the formulation of an eID maturity model  (MM), focusing on the security of eID schemes, in  the form of a questionnaire. It was envisaged that  the model would allow stakeholders to indicatively  measure the maturity level of security of eID schemes  on multiple topics, as well as the maturity of Member  States in this area. Besides, ENISA organised the  6th annual Trust Services Forum in collaboration  with the Commission services. The forum served  as a platform for stakeholders to share their good  practices on the implementation of trust services,  stood as an opportunity to review the standards,  implementing acts and technical guidelines within  the eIDAS. It also allowed to to discuss strategies  to promote the adoption of qualified trust services.  The event attracted more than 500 participants and  brought together trust service providers, conformity  assessment bodies, supervisory bodies and experts to  discuss the practical and emerging issues under the  eIDAS Regulation across Europe.  O.2.2.2. Supporting the implementation of the  work programme of the Cooperation Group under  the NIS Directive  Main achievements:    Support to Commission services (DG CNECT) with  the review of the NISD    Gap analysis report on the existing national  security measures    Knowledge building session on auditing  frameworks for the energy sector national  competent authorities    Study on good security practices for Digital  Infrastructures    Technical deep dive report on ‘Security of Country  Code Domains in Europe’    Participation to the activities of the group of  national health competent authorities    Report on NIS investments  In 2020, ENISA supported Commission services  (DG CNECT) with the review of the NISD via:    Internal interviews, a survey for the CSIRT network  and drafting of an ENISA position paper which was  submitted to COM as input to the consultation  process.    Input to the consultations through e.g. interviews,  organising meetings with experts from COM, or  active participation to workshops and conferences.    Telecommunication security review after an  extraordinary request by COM.  ENISA also provided support to the Member States  and the COM by taking stock of the existing national  security measures and drafting a gap analysis  report. The purpose of this activity was to analyse  the different national approaches to the security  measures adopted by the Cooperation Group, identify  gaps as well as common good practices.  This year ENISA launched a series of knowledge  building sessions with the purpose of increasing the  awareness as well as the knowledge of the energy  sector competent authorities concerning energy and  industrial control systems cybersecurity.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 27  PART I. Achievements of the year  Furthermore, ENISA supported the NIS Cooperation  group WS10, authorities for Digital infrastructure,  with a wide-ranging security analysis of the Digital  Infrastructure sector, assessing criticality, threats and  good practices. This security analysis was used by the  Commission services as input for the NIS2 proposal,  which proposes to extend the scope of this sector.  The security analysis also helps the authorities with  developing guidelines, by providing the high priorities,  and giving an overview of industry good practices.  ENISA  supported the creation of the NIS Cooperation  Group Work Stream for Healthcare as well. This  group includes the participation of members of the  eHealth Network (national competent authorities for  eHealth).The Agency contributed to the discussions for  determining the priorities and initial deliverables of the  work stream (security measures, incident reporting).  Lastly, ENISA published a report on NIS investments  Lastly, ENISA published a report on NIS investments  in order to document how Operators of Essential  Services (OES)/Digital Service Providers (DSPs) invest  in cybersecurity. The report also provides insights on  how the NIS Directive influenced this investment, and  provides useful data for policymakers to reflect upon  and identify future policy initiatives. This report aims  to serve as a reference point offering policymakers  at an EU and National level sufficient data to better  understand the investments across the sectors in  scope of the NIS Directive as well as the relevant  impact of the NIS Directive and its implementation.  O.2.2.3. Contribute to the EU policy in privacy  and data protection with technical input on  cybersecurity related measures  Main achievements:    Report on pseudonymisation techniques and  advanced use cases    ENISA co-organised online the 8th edition of the  Annual Privacy Forum  In 2020, the Agency published a report on  pseudonymisation techniques and advanced uses  cases. The report aims to support data controllers  and processors in implementing pseudonymisation  by providing possible techniques and use cases that  could fit different scenarios. It was a continuation  of the work conducted in the area since 2018 and  provided an analysis of state-of-the-art solutions in  the field of data pseudonymisation, as new research  and business models broke new ground.. ENISA also  published a report on the analysis of methods used  to carry out remote identity proofing. The report  provides an overview of the most common methods  for identity proofing. ENISA illustrated this using  examples received from the different stakeholders.  The report also includes a presentation of the  supporting standards at the international and EU  level and provided the current status quo in the EU  Member States in relation to their identity proofing  laws, regulations and practices.  Furthermore, ENISA organised the 8th edition of  the Annual Privacy Forum (APF), in order to bring  together research and policy practitioners in  the cutting edge of privacy, data protection and  information security. The event was co-organised  with the Commission services (DG CNECT), Catolica  University of Lisbon with the support of the  European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  the Portuguese Data Protection Authority. The  two-day event took place online and welcomed  renowned policymakers and speakers fromindustry,  research and academia. The event attracted over 650  participants. Dedicated panel sessions covered the  work of the Agency in the area of pseudonymisation  as well as challenges in the area of tracking. The  proceedings were published with Springer Lecture  Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)10.  O.2.2.4. Guidelines for the European  standardisation in ICT security  Main achievements:    ENISA co-organised the Annual Standardisation  Conference 2020 and prepared the conference  edition of 2021  ENISA co-organised the Annual Cybersecurity  Standardisation Conference 2020, together with its  partners – the European Standards Organisations  – the European Committee for Standardization  (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardization (CENELEC) and the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The  conference aimed to foster the dialogue among  policymakers, industry, research, standardisation  organisations, certification organisations and those  involved in the development of the ICT certification  framework in Europe, in view of an effective  implementation of the Cybersecurity Act.  ENISA also prepared in 2020 the 2021 edition of the  Conference (online event).  10 http://www.springer.com/computer/ lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-pseudonymisation-advanced-techniques-and-use-cases https://2020.privacyforum.eu/ https://2020.privacyforum.eu/ http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0 http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0  28  O.2.2.5. Supporting the implementation of the  European Electronic Communications Code  Main achievements:    Security analysis of the Over-The-Top services   Development of new reporting guidelines for the  European Electronic Communications Code    Open day event with telecom stakeholders in  Brussels  ENISA supported the group of national telecom  security authorities, namely the European Competent  Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications  (ECASEC) with the transposition of the European  Electronic Communications Code (EECC). This support  translated into the performance of a security analysis  of the so-called Over-The-Top (OTT) services. This set  of services was new in the scope of the EU telecom  security legislation. This work was partly background  material (criticality, risks) and partly input for the OTT  security profile (measures) which would be developed  by the group.  ENISA also developed new reporting guidelines for  the EECC. The new reporting thresholds were needed  because the EECC extended the scope of reporting  to new services and new types of incidents. The  EECC reporting guideline, together with the EECC  security measures guideline (see O.2.2.5), formed  the minimum basis for implementing the security  provisions in the EECC. ENISA will continue supporting  the group with transposition by analysing specific  new EECC topics.  To facilitate the discussions with the industry, ENISA  organised an open day event at the start of 2020  inviting telecom providers, suppliers, and also the  new OTT providers like Facebook and Microsoft.  This (yearly) open day was a success  The open  day – which takes place yearly - was considered  an important action in order to create mutual  understanding and enable the exchanging of views  between the authorities and the sector. With a total of  160 participants attending in Brussels, the event was  therefore considered a success.  O.2.2.6. Support the MS in improving the  cybersecurity of 5G networks  Main achievements:    Update the technical guideline on security  measures under the EECC    Updated version of the 5G Threat Landscape report   Study on security controls in 3GPP and other 5G  specifications    Knowledge building webinar on 5G security   Toolbox implementation progress report  In 2020; ENISA continued to provide an active support  in the area of cybersecurity of European 5G networks,  in particular to assist Member States in implementing  provisions from the EU 5G Toolbox on risk mitigation  measures. Two key achievements in this domain  were the new Guideline on Security Measures  under the EECC11 (with the added 5G supplement12),  aligned with the Toolbox and with the new European  Electronic Communication Code that came into force  in December 2020, and a new version of ENISA Threat  Landscape for 5G networks13.  In addition, jointly with the Commission services  (DG CNECT) ENISA actively supported the work of  the NIS Cooperation Group Works Stream on 5G  cybersecurity, and was one of the key contributors  in preparation and publication of the 5G Toolbox  implementation report14, published in July 2020.  The Agency had also regular discussions with BEREC  on 5G security (also in the context of ECASEC group)  and co-organised a major workshop on 5G security  with the participation of the private sector.  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on- security-measures-under-the-eecc  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement- security-measures-under-eecc  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat- landscape-report-for-5g-networks  14 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report- member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g- cybersecurity  ENISA supported European  Competent Authorities  for Secure Electronic  Communications  (ECASEC), the group  of national telecom  security authorities with  the transposition of the  European Electronic  Communications Code  (EECC).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g-cybersecurity https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g-cybersecurity https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-member-states-progress-implementing-eu-toolbox-5g-cybersecurity  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 29  PART I. Achievements of the year  2.2 Outputs and performance indicators15 for Activity 2: POLICY  Summary of outputs from Activity 2: POLICY – Promote NIS as an EU policy priority  Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 2.1.

ENISA updated the technical training material and  developed two new trainings sessions in 2020.  ENISA added two  elaborate use cases to the training  that was developed the year before(Orchestration of  CSIRT Tools). The two use cases are: a ransomware  scenario and a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The  focus was on using the set of orchestrated tools for  investigation and mitigation of incidents, emphasising  aspects of automation and information sharing. The  initial modular approached to the ‘Orchestration of  CSIRT Tools ‘allowed to integrate these new use case  scenarios with little extra effort.  The other training developed had a very high focus  on supporting operational practices. The training  was called: ‘Defending Against Adversary Actions’  and the scenario was an Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT) intrusion on a victim network. Both the  attacker and victim infrastructure were emulated  and the training was developed and delivered in  an online virtual lab environment. It aimed more  experienced CSIRT members and could be considered  as an ENISA flagship technical/operational training.  ENISA presented the training in a near final version  to the CSIRTs Network (CNW) members, to whom  an advanced demo/dry-run and access to all the  documentation and manuals were given. The  feedback was very positive and some comments were  taken into account and integrated in the final version.  O.3.1.2. Support EU Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies  Main achievements:    A National Capabilities Assessment Framework  (NCAF) was produced    NCSS workshop to validate the results of the NCAF  study  ENISA produced a National Capabilities Assessment  Framework (NCAF) to measure the level of maturity  of MS cybersecurity capabilities. This framework was  developed to serve as a self-assessment, it used the  national strategy as a starting point and covered 5  maturity levels for 17 strategic objectives that are  structured around four main clusters.  The Agency organised the annual National Cyber  Security Strategies (NCSS) workshop that took  place on the 6th of October to validate the results of  the study on the NCAF. In this workshop 60 experts  from 26 EU Member States participated and  provided feedback.  ENISA started a study to increase the resilience  of SMEs against cybersecurity risks and threats in  http://intraenisa/cod/del/DeliverablesLibrary/WP2020 - O.2.2.4 - Taxonomy of Cybersecurity.docx https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/updated-enisa-5g-threat-landscape-report-to-enhance-5g-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-in-5g-specifications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  32  case of crisis such as COVID19. The results will be  published in 2021.  Furthermore, a workshop took place on the 17th of  November in collaboration with EASME to present  the preliminary results on the study performed on  Cybersecurity for SMEs. Participants from 120 private  and public sector organisations coming from all EU  Member States and several other countries attended  the online workshop.  ENISA supported Greece in the evaluation of their  NCSS by providing guidance, support and input  and by sharing of good practices. This led to the  development of the new GR NCSS (2020 – 2025) that  was published in December 2020.  O.3.1.3. Support EU Member States in their  incident response development  Main achievements:    Study conducted on ‘How to set up CSIRT and SOC’   Report on Sectoral CSIRT Capabilities – Energy and  Air Transport  ENISA conducted a study that was a results-driven  guidance for establishing a computer security incident  response team (CSIRT) and a security operations  centre (SOC). The study includes a guidance on  possible improvements for different types of CSIRTs  and SOCs currently active.  ENISA also developed and published a report  focusingon trends in Energy and Air Transport  Incident Response Capabilities, procedures, processes  and tools., This report also includes insights on  current challenges and gaps facing IR communities.  The CSIRT inventory was updated in June and  December 2020. Currently, there are 583 teams in  the inventory.  The development of the online tool for ENISA CSIRT  maturity assessment started in 2020 and was made  available online in 202116.  O.3.1.4. ISACs for the NISD sectors in the EU and  Member States  Main achievements:    Toolkit for ISACs  16 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt- capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-survey    Supported 5 EU ISACS, Financial ISAC, Rail ISAC,  Maritime ISAC, Healthcare ISAC and Energy ISAC  Specification for a toolkit17 for ISACs – ENISA  developed the comprehensive toolkit “ISAC in a BOX”,  following studies on the ISAC concept, to address  the need to facilitate community building and  collaboration across ISACs. The toolkit is intended to  providepractical guidance and the means to empower  industry for the creation of new ISACs and to further  develop existing ones.

This decision was based  on the success of the European Cybersecurity  Challenge, and it involved the help of other  regional and international organisations, decided  to design and host the International Cyber  Security Challenge (ICSC). To that end, a steering  committee was formed in 2020. Formed by  government, regional institutions, universities and  research centres, the steering committee started  to design  a competition between teams from  different regions.  Teams from as far as South  East Asia, Oceania, US, Latin America and Africa  started to express vivid interest in participating.  ENISA completed the setting up of the steering  committee early in the year.  The Agency planned and executed the ‘ENISA  Hackfest 2020’ on the 16-18th of November.  This was a Capture the Flag (CTF) event between  cybersecurity professionals and students in order  to connect and train the teams taking part in the  2021 European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC).  O.3.3.2. European Cyber Security Month  deployment  Main achievements:    ESCM went fully digital and online with 6 more  Members States participating  In 2020 the ECSM went fully digital and online with  no in-person meetings due to the circumstances  of the COVID-19 outbreak. Notwithstanding these  circumstances, metrics built into the ECSM show  a three-fold increase in outreach, from 2.7 million  citizens that the campaign had reached in 2019, to 9.8  million in 2020.  The 2020 campaign followed the same format  as in 2019. The activities were developed around  two themes: digital skills and cyber-scams. The  overwhelming majority of partners gave ECSM  a rating from good to excellent and believed that the  campaign supported, added value and improved their  national campaigns and that it  promoted sharing  ideas between Member States. Another important  improvement compared to previous years was the  fact that Member States’ participation increased by 22  %, with six more Member Sates actively engaging in  the campaign compared to 2019. Moreover, the ECSM  team received very positive feedback with respect to  the provision of promotional and security awareness  materials translated in all official EU languages,  especially forthose Member States having limited  resources for such production.  O.3.3.3. Support EU Member States in  cybersecurity skills development  Main achievements:    Policy recommendations for the implementation  of ECSC roadmap  ENISA performed an analysis of the key factors  enabling the success of a national cybersecurity  competition and gave a snapshot of the current  situation in the European Union and European Cyber  Security Challenge (ECSC) partner countries. This  analysis helped provide policy recommendations  for both the short-term and the long-term  implementation of this common ECSC roadmap,  with the goal to place the ECSC in a primary position  to support the objectives of the EU Security Union  Strategy for the period 2020–2025.  34  3.2 Outputs and performance indicators18 for Activity 3: CAPACITY  Summary of outputs in Activity 3: CAPACITY – Support Europe in maintaining state- of-the-art NIS capacities  Outputs Performance indicator Results achieved  Objective 3.1.

O.4.1.2. Support activities for cyber exercises  Main achievements:    Updates and security assessment exercise on the  CEP platform    Support Netherlands and eu-LISA on exercises  ENISA has been developing the cyber exercise  platform (CEP) since 2014.  CEP hosts a number of services ENISA offers to  Member States and EU institutions, such as: exercise  organisation and management, technical incidents.  During 2020, ENISA performed major updates  to the  platform, redesigning for instance the Regeneration  Logic and user interface.  The CEP platform opened new opportunities for  ENISA to enlarge the user base and thus to offer  to the operational cybersecurity communities  opportunities to exercise and to gain experience and  http://intraenisa/cod/del/DeliverablesLibrary/WP2020 - O.3.1.1 - Update of CSIRT training material in the area of operational trainings.docx https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sectoral-csirt-capabilities-energy-and-air-transport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/how-to-set-up-csirt-and-soc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/isac-in-a-box https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsc-2020-analysis-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsm-deployment-report-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-a-common-ecsc-roadmap  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 37  PART I. Achievements of the year  knowledge. An in-depth security assessment including  a penetration testing took place (as per yearly  schedule) to ensure the security of the platform.  ENISA didn’t identify any major issues and used the  results to further improve the infrastructure..  In 2020, ENISA was asked to support the  Netherlands with the scenario of the BlueOLEX  exercise. The exercise consisted in a discussion-based  table top exercise held online. ENISA supported  eu-LISA in organising and executing a cyber-exercise  together with participating Member States.  O.4.1.3. Support activities for cybersecurity  collaboration with other EU institutions and bodies  Main achievements:    Organised a tabletop exercise for the 36th meeting  of ITAC    Development of cyber threat assessment  methodology    Development of an impact assessment model  In 2020, the EU Agencies ICT Advisory Committee  (ICTAC) asked ENISA to organise a tabletop exercise  for the 36th meeting of ICTAC. The mission of ICTAC  is to promote inter-agency cooperation on issues  of common interest in the area of Information and  Communication Technologies, through knowledge  and experience sharing and exchange of good  practice. ENISA co-organised the tabletop cyber  exercise with the ICTAC and CERT-EU.    Furthermore, ENISA  produced a draft on a new  threat assessment methodology. This methodology  was to be mainly used by Blueprint stakeholders, but  could also be employed by any related bodies who  wanted to take advantage of it. It is based loosely  on an existing approach by the NATO Cyber Threat  Assessment Cell (CTAC). The new methodology  is based more on a reproducible mathematical  approach with less ‘wiggle room’ for the quantitative  assessments to facilitate comparisons of assessment  results by different organisations.  Lastly, ENISA designed a model EU institutions  can use to assess the impact of cyberattacks. The  model was designed based on relevant existing  literature, on input from various experts, and on  current practices within theEU institutions. The final  result provided the basis for a fully functional and  operational framework to be developed in 2021.  This work will support collaboration between EU  Institutions regarding cyber crises management as  described in the Blueprint recommendation.  O.4.1.4. Supporting the implementation of the  information hub  Main achievements:    Development of new functionalities of OpenCSAM  ENISA launched the Open Cyber Situational  Awareness Machine (OpenCSAM) 3rd round of  development in 2020 and will be concluded in 2021.  The development of new functionalities for the tool  was based on stakeholders inputs gathered in May  2020. Among those new functionalities are included  the integration with SHODAN and Twitter enterprise  APIs and a collaboration capability based on user- defined circles of trust. As a result, the tool is now  used by over 90 analysts from EUIs, CSIRTs and other  Member States’ Agencies/Organisations.  O.4.1.5. Supporting the EU Cyber Crisis  Cooperation Blueprint  Main achievements:    Support the EU Cyber Crisis Cooperation Blueprint    Development of a cooperation portal for the Cyber  Crises Liaison Network (CyCLONe)  To support the EU Cyber Crisis Cooperation Blueprint,  ENISA developed a Standard Operating Procedures  document for the Operational level cooperation  of EU Institutions. The document integrated into  a joint SOP document of the Commission services  (DG CNECT) and is currently under discussion by  relative stakeholders from EUIs in two separate  working groups.  ENISA also developed and maintained a cooperation  portal for the Cyber Crises Liaison Network  (CyCLONe) in June 2020, following its appointment as  the Secretariat of this group.  4.1.2 Objective 2: Community building and  operational cooperation – outputs  O.4.2.1. EU CSIRTs Network support  Main achievements:    Weekly report during pandemic on cyber threats  to EU Member States    CSIRTs Network Secretariat support    Annual trust exercise  38  Second Report to the Cooperation Group in line with  the NIS Directive requirements  The NIS Directive established the CSIRTs Network  ‘to contribute to developing confidence and trust  between the Member States and to promote swift  and effective operational cooperation’. To date, there  are 39 appointed Members to the CSIRTs Network  covering all Member States and CERT-EU. ENISA  supported the operations of the Network as the  Secretariat and the Commission services participated  as an observer. The COVID-19 related cybersecurity  situation of the significant general security event was  a pivotal moment for the growth of the Network.  The CSIRTs Network moved to remote escalated  cooperation and, at the same time, the ENISA CSIRTs  Network Secretariat strengthened the underlying  infrastructure to support this new normal operational  mode. The Network is ready to respond to COVID-19  related cyber threats. From March to May 2020, the  Network issued a weekly report to the EU and MS  higher levels/and their constituencies, providing  summaries and recommendations on how to face the  cyber threats related to the outbreak.  The CSIRTs Network Secretariat supported the  functioning of the Network in full virtual mode since  March 2020. This included supporting the governance  in the Trio handover, from Romania, Finland, Croatia  to Germany, Portugal and Slovenia; and change  of the Chair in July 2020, from Finland to Slovenia.  Moreover, the CSIRTs Network Secretariat facilitated  the update of the Network’s Work Programme for  2020-2023, the NIS Directive review process initiated  by the Commission services, the Working Groups  cooperation and dedicated ad hoc calls.  Furthermore, the CSIRTs Network managed to have  the 11th meeting in Stockholm in February but moved  to virtual for the 11th under Croatian Presidency  including a shared session with the Cooperation  Group (CG) and 12th under German Presidency. The  annual trust / team building exercise took place online  in parallel with the 12th meeting and tested the CSIRTs  Network members’ technical skills and knowledge of  the Terms of reference (ToR), Rules of Procedure (RoP)  and Standard operating procedure (SOP).  The CSIRTs Network also successfully completed the  second Report to the Cooperation Group in line with  the NIS Directive requirements. The report covers the  period from 1st of July 2018 to 1st of February 2020.  During the reporting period, the CSIRTs Network  held four meetings (Vienna, Brussels, Bucharest and  Helsinki), three of the meetings also provided the  opportunity ofa shared session with the Cooperation  Group (CG). Activity of the Working Groups is  detailed in the report as well as the infrastructure  and tools usage. The report assesses the experience  gained with the operational cooperation, including  conclusions and recommendations.  O.4.2.2. Support the fight against cybercrime and  collaboration across CSIRTs, Law Enforcement  Agency and other operational communities  Main achievements:    2020 Report on CSIRT-Law Enforcement  Cooperation    Training material on CSIRT-Law Enforcement  Cooperation    Annual ENISA-EC3 Workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs and their LEA counterparts  ENISA compiled and published the 2020  Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation20. The report  proposes a methodology to analyse the legal and  organisational framework shaping the CSIRTs and  law enforcement (LE) cooperation as well as their  interaction with the judiciary. It also identifies  synergies and potential interferences.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/2020-report-on- csirt-le-cooperation  The NIS Directive  established the CSIRTs  Network ‘to contribute to  developing confidence and  trust between the Member  States and to promote  swift and effective  operational cooperation’.

O.5.1.2. Research and analysis of the market as  an enabler for certification    Proposed set of methodological steps to allow for  a market analysis  Main achievements:  A study was undertaken on identifying an initial  set of methodological steps to allow for a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products,  ICT services, and ICT processes. The performance  of a market analysis on cybersecurity certification  aimed at contributing to the EU cybersecurity  certification framework and the planning activities of  the Commission services, the ECCG and the SCCG by  identifying future areas for cybersecurity certification.  The proposed steps identified in the study cover:    the identification of the context of the market  analysis;    the scope of the target of analysis;   an assessment of the impact of a cybersecurity  certification initiative;    the identification of the available options and  possible initiatives.  O.5.1.3. Set-up and maintenance of a certification  portal and associated services  Main achievements:    Development of public cybersecurity certification  website  ENISA opted for a CIRCA BC solution, offered by DIGIT,  in order to establish a certification management of  IT system (CerMIT) to provide securely a cooperation  platform for its certification stakeholder community,  including the ad hoc Working Groups.  The Agency also launched the development of a public  cybersecurity certification website in accordance with  article 50 of the CSA in 2020 and reached the phase  of initial process definition, technical set up, and  consultations with Member States.  Objective 2: Developing candidate  cybersecurity certification schemes –  outputs  O.5.2.1. Hands on tasks in cybersecurity  certification of products, services and processes  Main achievements:    The Risk Assessment and Assurance Level definition  project (RA&AL)  ENISA drew a ‘Methodology for consistent, risk  based definition of cybersecurity certifications  schemes’, (hereinafter called, ‘Methodology’)  to determineassurance levels in cybersecurity  certification particularly in sectoral schemes.  Examples ofsuch sectoral systems are mobile  networks and services, health telematics, payment or  mobility infrastructures.  This Methodology can be combined with common  ISO/IEC 27005-conformant risk assessment tools and  can generate a sound understanding of the sectoral  system concerning cybersecurity at business process  and at component level.  The Methodology enables the implementation of key  requirements of the EU Cybersecurity Act and has  the potential to promote the market acceptance of  cybersecurity certification. This methodology was  presented to CEN CENELEC in relation to European  standardisation activities.  44  ENISA organised the Cybersecurity Certification  Conference virtually and from Brussels on  18 December 2020.  O.5.2.2. Tasks related to specific candidate  schemes and ad hoc working groups  Main achievements:    The candidate European Common Criteria Scheme  (EUCC)    The candidate European Cloud Services Scheme  (EUCS)  Following the Commission request ref  ARES(2019)4895286 dated 20/07/2019, ENISA  prepared the candidate EUCC scheme on ICT  products, to serve as a successor of the Senior  Officials Group on Information Systems Security  Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOG-IS MRA). This  candidate European cybersecurity certification  scheme focuses on certification of ICT products.  ENISA, and the dedicated Ad Hoc Working Group of  experts and stakeholders, in close collaboration with  the ECCG, worked on finalising the first draft.  This draft version was made public for consultation  in July 2020. ENISA invited all relevant stakeholders  to bring forward their recommendations, remarks,  or share their concerns in an open, transparent and  inclusive consultation process. Both the ECCG and the  SCCG participated in the public consultation as well.  Based on the ECCG Opinion finalised in December  2020, ENISA will transfer the candidate scheme to  the Commission, as to serve as a reference for the  Implementing Act for the scheme.  ENISA continued providing its support to the  Commission for follow up activities. Such activities  include the  development of the the necessary  guidance to facilitate transition between current  SOG-IS practices and the new rules set by the scheme,  and the contribution to the work related to the  establishment of a scheme maintenance organisation.  Following the Commission request ARES  (2019)7197658, dated 21/11/2019, ENISA also  prepared a candidate European cybersecurity  certification scheme on cloud services (EUCS).  The work on this candidate scheme started in the  beginning of 2020 after the Ad Hoc Working Group of  experts and stakeholders was constituted.  Together with the Ad Hoc Working Group, ENISA  drafted the first version of the EUCS candidate  scheme following the advice and close cooperation  of the ECCG members. The draft EUCS candidate  scheme produces a coherent approach on the  security of cloud services taking into account the EU  regulatory framework, international standards, best  industrial practices, as well as with existing (national)  certification schemes in EU Member States.  The diverse set of market players, complex systems  and constantly evolving landscape of cloud services,  along with different schemes in Member States,  represent challenges to the development of cloud  services in general. The draft EUCS candidate scheme  tackles these challenges by calling for cybersecurity  best practices across three levels of assurance and  by allowing for a transition from current national  schemes to the EU-level. By defining a security  baseline for every assurance level, the draft EUCS  candidate scheme is a horizontal and technological  scheme that intends to provide cybersecurity  assurance throughout the cloud supply chain, and  forms a sound basis for sectoral schemes. The  structuring principles of the scheme were submitted  to the SCCG members and to a limited pool of  experts over the summer, and the first consolidated  version was presented for public consultation in  December 2020.  Following the  Commission request,  ENISA prepared  a  candidate European  cybersecurity  certification scheme on  cloud services (EUCS).  This candidate scheme  started its work in the  beginning of 2020 after  an Ad Hoc Working  Group of experts  and stakeholders  was appointed.

The Resources Department  The Resources Department administered a range  of services across finance and procurement, ICT,  facilities management, health and safety physical  security, and liaison with local authorities.  TheOut of a total of 24 posts assigned to the Resource  Department, 15 staff members contributed to the  tasks of internal controls and risk management  (including Head of department), Finance and  Procurement Unit, and Corporate support services.  The Accounting and compliance officer acted as Head  of Finance and Procurement unit and not calculated  in the total number of staff members.  Also, as of March 2020 Human Resources reported  directly to the Executive Director. The Unit was managed  by the Head of Data Security and Standardisation as  acting Head of Unit. The unit had 4 staff members.  ENISA resorted to external staff to allow for the  full execution of tasks of the department. A total of  10 interim agents was assigned to the Resources  department and 5 interim agents assigned to Human  Resources to cover vacant posts and extra workload.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-certification-eucc-candidate-scheme  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 47  PART I. Achievements of the year  In March 2020 the Executive Director established  the Executive Director’s support team to strengthen  internal coordination capacity at ENISA, among other  tasks previously in Resources Department’s remit.  As a result of the problem analysis endorsed by  the Management Board in February , the Agency  started a reorganisation process coordinated by  the Executive Director’s support team and the  Human Resources unit, both reporting directly to the  Executive Director.  The objective of the Resources Department is to  equip the agency with state-of-the-art strategies,  programmes and tools to optimise the use of  resources across ENISA, enabling it to deliver on the  work programme and statutory commitments.  The  department initiated specific projects to support the  delivery of the work programme, such as the update  of the Business Continuity Plan and ENISA internal IT  Strategy but the agency could not provide them.  The Core Operations Department  The Core Operations Department coordinated the  delivery of ENISA’s core activities. As such, its main  role is to deliver the work pertaining to Activities A1– A5 of the work programme. The Policy Office and the  Public Affairs Team also reported to the Department.  The support The Core Operations Department also  supported the ENISA Advisory Group and the National  Liaison Officers (NLO) Network.  With 61 staff members and 11 posts unfilled in 2020,  the Core Operations Department counted a total of  72 posts. In addition, the department had the support of  16 external staff, covering the functions of vacant posts  and extra workload.  b) POLICY OFFICE  The Policy Office reported to the Head of Core  Operations Department. Through the Policy Office,  the Agency initiated and developed strategic  cooperation with active relevant stakeholders from  the cybersecurity community, and managed Public  Access to Documents (PAD) requests pursuant to  Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.  The Public Affairs Team (PAT) reported to the Head of  the Policy Office and coordinated all communication  activities, including media and press activities such as  press releases, news items and interviews to enhance  the reputation, visibility and the public image of the  Agency. It supported the entire Agency regarding  publications, social media promotion, website  management, public affairs activities and awareness  campaigns. PAT was also responsible for establishing  ENISA’s corporate visual identity and branding.  Due to pandemic in 2020, limited number of physical  events took place, however the team supported  events taking place online. PAT also managed the  ENISA website.  Besides, additional information on the activities  delivered by the Policy Unit and Public Affairs  team are listed in Objective 6.2 Engagement with  stakeholders and international activities.  In March 2020 the Executive Director established  the Executive Director’s support team to strengthen  internal coordination at ENISA, and perform other  tasks previously in the Policy Office's remit.  c) INTERNAL CONTROL  This topic is covered in Part III – ‘Assessment of the  effectiveness of the internal control systems’.  d) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  TheAgency migrated to a new fully operating  datacentre in the course of the year and, in  cooperation with another EU Agency it synergised  to use the latter as a Disaster Recovery (DR) site for  some of its critical corporate IT services.  TheAgency followed up with actions to strengthen  its own cybersecurity standing in the CIA triad  (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The Agency  upgraded its entire email system to the latest  version, provisioning for load balancing to enhance  availability and removal of older protocols. The  Agency also successfully reinforced its directory  services and strengthenedits security filtering and  antispam polices.  In 2020, ENISA  successfully hosted  and evolved the central  component of MeliCERTes.  MeliCERTes is the primary  collaboration platform for  the CSIRTs of participating  Member States.  48  Task Objective Level of completion in 2020  Keep ENISA systems safe from cybersecurity incidents (from  exterior) – detect, prevent, react and recover from threats Security 100 %  ENISA IT managed servers patched in time Security 100 %  Exchange server availability Efficiency 100 %  Availability of internal applications Availability 95%  Help desk, reply with success to all service requests Efficiency 99 %  e) FINANCE AND PROCUREMENT  This topic is covered in Part II.3, ‘Budgetary and  financial management’.  f) LEGAL AFFAIRS, DATA PROTECTION AND  INFORMATION SECURITY COORDINATION  Legal Affairs  Legal affairs continued supporting the legal aspects  associated with the operation of the Agency;  thus ensured the efficient legal support within  the spectrum of activities of ENISA. This included  dealing with matters such as (indicatively) contracts,  procurement, employment related matters, data  protection in collaboration with the Data Protection  Officer, access to documents and corporate  governance matters. The Legal Affairs function also  included dealing with complaints to the European  Ombudsman. In general the Legal Affairs ensured  also the interpretation and implementation of  primary and secondary legislation to ENISA activities,  provided legal advice and drafted reports on ad hoc  legal issues. ENISA resorted to external Legal counsel  only to assist in the resolution of staff matters.  Data Protection Compliance tasks and Data  protection Office  ENISA is subject to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on  the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data by EU institutions, bodies,  offices and agencies (EUDPR)25. A Data Protection  Officer was appointed according to EUDPR and  relevant ENISA implementing rules26.  Within 2020, ENISA complied with all requests  for information/reporting, as well as relevant  recommendations of the European Data Protection  Supervisor (EDPS), including in particular:    EDPS monitoring exercise on registers under Art.  31(5) EUDPR, which involved the publication of  ENISA’s online register of data processing activities27.    EDPS Strategy to comply with Schrems II ruling,  which encompassed an Agency-wide stock taking  exercise and reporting on cases of transfers of  personal data to third countries (following CJEU  Schrems II Judgment)28.  25 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection  of natural persons with regard to the processing of  personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies and on the free movement of such data,  and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision  No 1247/2002, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.

Due to the pandemic, the Agency’s methods had to  extend to new services; to address such shortcomings  as identified in terms of electronic signatures  orvideoconferencing for large conferences for  instance. Mitigation measures were proposed and  started being implemented in late 2020, allowing the  Agency to continue operating remotely.  ENISA successfully hosted and developed the  central component of MeliCERTes. MeliCERTes  was the primary collaboration platform for CSIRTs  of participating Member States. The platform  standsas a means to improve EU Member States  preparedness, cooperation and coordination to  improve cyber threat and cross-border incident  response. ENISA IT incorporated the MeliCERTes  support service delivery structure into its own  on-premises JIRA ticketing system, creating a solid  structure for incident response.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/management-board-decisions/MB Decision MB_2019_2_implementing data protection regulation.pdf/view  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 49  PART I. Achievements of the year  In this context, the DPO’s activities within 2020  included:    Provision of various data protection opinions and  advice in accordance with EUDPR and on different  topics across the Agency, including on records  of processing activities, Data Protection Impact  Assessments and security of processing;    Maintenance of the ENISA’s central register of data  processing activities;    Data protection compliance monitoring, especially  through contract monitoring and monitoring of  international transfers of personal data;    Awareness raising through the provision of data  protection training to ENISA’s staff members;    Collaboration with the EDPS and the EU  Institutions and Agencies (EUIs) DPOs network,  including the co-chairing of the joint EUIs DPOs- ICTAC Working Group and participation in the  DPOs Working Group on procurement;    Provision of data protection advice to CEDEFOP, in  the context of the standing co-operation between  ENISA and CEDEFOP and the relevant SLA that has  been established between the two Agencies.  Information Security coordination  The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  coordinates the Information Security Management  System on behalf of the Authorising Officer. In  particular, the CISO advises the ICT Unit to develop  and implement information security policies,  standards, guidelines and baselines that seek to  secure the confidentiality, integrity and availability  of the information systems of the Agency. The CISO  is instrumental in incident handling and incident  response and security event monitoring. The CISO  also leads the security training for the Agency’s staff  and he provides security guidance on all IT projects,  including the evaluation and recommendation of  technical controls. For the referenced year, the ENISA  CISO contributed to the following activities and  objectives:    Conducting an annual risk assessment exercise  and follow-up actions.  -  Monitoring and reporting the following to ENISA  Internal IT Advisory Committee (ITAC).  -  Performed regular vulnerability assessments and  penetrations tests.  -  Network security monitoring and incident  response.  -  Implemented the security awareness policy and  improved the IT Security training    Non-compliances with policy identified and  addressed  -  Advising on security policies and updating  existing ones in line with the evolution of threats  and risks  -  Implementing new systems and tools that  can support improvements on Information  Security. All these activities where conducted  in the context of a re-organisation process that  eventually changed the governance model and  implicitly the roles and responsibilities.  6.3.2 Objective 2: Engagement with stakeholders  and international activities  a) STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION AND  DISSEMINATION OF ENISA’S DELIVERABLES29.  In 2020, ENISA maintained its efforts to improve its  focus on key activities and to engage the highest  possible number of stakeholders. This includes  the different groups of stakeholders from Member  States, EU Institutions, bodies and agencies as well as  academia, industry, the public, etc. In its engagement  with the stakeholders, ENISA is guided by principles  such as balanced representation, openness,  transparency and inclusiveness. This is evidenced  by organising open calls for expression of interest  for various groups that contribute to ENISA work  programme implementation.  Anew strategy was adopted for the Agency in 2020.  The first objective of this strategy is to achieve  ‘Empowered and Engaged Communities across the  Cybersecurity Ecosystem’ striving for a cross sectoral,  all-inclusive cooperation with our stakeholders.  The Management Board appointed the Advisory  group in the course of the year. The appointment  was based on a proposal of the Executive Director,  with balanced numbers between female and male  representatives. The group represents 14 countries  with a mixture of old and new EU Members.  29 Work delivered by ENISA such as reports, recommendations,  info notes, opinion papers, tools, platforms, training material  or contents, etc.  50  Dissemination and outreach  ENISA further engaged in developing tools and using  channels, including its website, for the dissemination  of ENISA’s deliverables and for outreach, with a strong  emphasis on social media. ENISA saw an increase in all  relevant social media metrics: The Agency’s audience  (followers) increased by 33% compared to 2019. In  addition, there was a 27.4% increase in published  posts, a 59.4% increase in post impressions and  a 121% increase in engagements. ENISA’s website also  received 12% more visits compared to 2019 while the  number of downloads of ENISA’s publications was  increased by 30%.  Early on in 2020, ENISA conducted regular press  interviews during events. In January 2020, ENISA gave  5 interviews organised at the FIC conference in France  and 3 interviews organised at the DLD conference in  Germany. This trend was interrupted by the pandemic  and the total number of spokesperson interviews in  2020 for ENISA ENISA dropped to 15, a total lower  thank in 2019. In addition, ENISA was mentioned  around 30 times in top-tier, Brussels-based and  national media outlets.  During the initial phases of the pandemic, ENISA also  provided tips and recommendations for cyber secure  teleworking, videoconferencing and selling online  etc. A Covid-19 information hub was created on the  website to facilitate the outreach of this information  to a wider audience.  Two other awareness and outreach activities  were organised to reach stakeholders online.  ENISA’s campaign to generate awareness (1)  about different types of online threats and (2) the  promotion of ENISA Threat Landscape, achieved more  than 1.2 million impressions in Twitter and LinkedIn.  The campaign for the promotion of ENISA’s work  related to the EU Cybersecurity Package generated  more than 1.5 million Twitter impressions and more  than 16 thousand engagements.  Internal communications    In 2020, ENISA took a step forward to enhance  staff engagement and to exploit opportunities  for pooling and sharing resources. The scope of  this activity was limited on organisational and  prioritisation grounds; main activities followed  the pattern described hereinafter:    Regular updates to staff by internal  announcements on aspects concerning staff;  particular attention was paid to aspects related  to the pandemic in an effort to keep cohesion  across the Agency staff.    Regular sessions regarding the evolving  reorganisation of recourses that were carried  out at all layers of hierarchy and levels of  involvement.    Launching and utilising specific instruments  such as staff interviews, to allow quicker  integration of incoming staff.    Adapting organisational frameworks to the  Agency’s corporate culture and practices,  by shaping appropriately the competences  framework.    A staff survey activity in relation to the  reorganisation in 2020 also took place.  With regards to the reorganisation, the Executive  Director’s Support Team supported a number of  internal communications activities. In January 2020,  a staff day was held to kick off the reorganisation  with a staff consultation process. As of 15 April  a weekly Question and Answer session (remotely)  was also organised on various topics related to  the reorganisation, to give staff the opportunity to  ask questions. A new webpage was created on the  Intraenisa to provide information to staff on the  reorganisation.  The Executive Director sent regular emails and videos  to all staff with updates on the reorganisation and  other activities of relevance to staff.  Because of the pandemic, a number of events  and team activities were cancelled or postponed .  A few units still managed however to organise team  building activities during the summer.  ENISA’s internal communications objectives for 2020.  Task Objective Level of  completion 2020  Maintain staff  informed on  ENISA Activities  (internal  communications)  Hold 10 staff  meetings  per year  27 Q&As30and  3 staff seminars  meetings took  place  Team-building  activities  Events with  participation  of all staff  Impacted by  the pandemic  COVID-19  30 Due to the process of reorganisation of the Agency in 2020,  Questions and Answers sessions were arranged online to all  ENISA staff.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 51  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA Advisory Group  The ENISA Advisory Group was established by the  new CSA. It replaces the Permanent Stakeholder  Group. ENISA published a call for expression of  interest for the selection of the current Advisory  Group early in 2020. Further to the call,ENISA  proceeded with the selection and nomination  of experts from all sectors specified in the CSA.  The current group took office on 1 July 2020 with  a mandate of two and a half years.  This group, composed of industry, academia and  consumer organisation experts, continues to advise  ENISA on drawing up a major part of the annual work  programme except regarding the provisions of Title III  (‘Certification’), on the performance of its tasks and to  engage effectively with stakeholder communities.  Two virtual meetings took place in July and  November. New rules of procedure for the AG were  adopted and activities where the group can assist  ENISA with its work programme were identified as  planned. ENISA ran a pilot with the Advisory Group  to provide feedback on output finalisations. ENISA  proposed three different outputs for feedback;  output O.1.1.3, Output O.1.2.131 and Output O.2.2.432.  The result of the feedback received led to a number  of changes within the outputs including clarifications  and editorial changes, but it also provided valuable  input on how to improve specific outputs in 2021.  National Liaison Officers Network  Set up in 2004 as a series of informal points of  communications in the Member States, the NLO  Network became a statutory body of the Agency via  the 2019 Cybersecurity Act.  The NLO Network had 3 virtual meetings in the  course of the year: in May, October and December.  ENISA also developed, consulted and adopted new  rules of procedure for the Network ENISA organised  a training for NLOs interested in cloud security in  December, after the NLO meeting.  A pilot was run with the NLO Network to provide  feedback on output finalisations. Input was provided  to 8 outputs of work programme 2020. The result of  the input received led to a number of changes within  the output and the outreach of the outputs.  31 Output 0.1.1.3 and 0.1.2.1 is listed in the table 1.2. Outputs  and performance indicators for Activity 1: EXPERTISE  32  Output 0.2.2.4 is reflected in the table 2.2. Outputs and  performance indicators for Activity 2: POLICY  b) INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS  Under the Executive Director’s guidance and  initiative and in line with the approach agreed by the  Management Board, ENISA’s main focus in 2020 was  the implementation of its mandate in relation to the  EU internal market. Some activities were carried out  to strengthened contacts at an international level,  in particular with the US partners to exchange on  lessons learned in response to the pandemic.  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 53  1 MANAGEMENT BOARD  The Management Board had two ordinary meetings  in the course of the year plus one extraordinary  meeting. The extraordinary meeting took place to  endorse the draft single programming document  2021-2023, the statement of estimates 2021 and the  establishment plan 2021, among other decisions.  In total, the Management Board made 22 decisions  during the year, which include the Agency’s new  strategy, the establishment of ENISA internal  structures, as well as the setting up of the Advisory  Group for the period 2020-2023.  In addition, the work programme 2020 was  amended in response to the COVID -19 pandemic  to shift to online environment for implementing the  work programme outputs.  As part of its functions, the Management Board  adopted its analysis and assessment of the 2019  annual activity report in which it commended the  agency on the very high standard achieved in the  delivery of its work. The Management Board also  expressed its opinion on the final annual accounts for  2019 and adopted the ENISA Programming Document  2021–2023, including the 2021 budget and the 2021  establishment plan.  Sharing information with the Management Board  regularly, ENISA reported on the work programme,  budget implementation, and audit and evaluation  activities (by e.g. ECA, IAS), among other pertinent  matters.  The Management Board endorsed the proposed  reorganisation of the Agency’s structure. The risks  and/or issues identified in the Agency to potentially  impact internal and quality controls in addition  to the results of the problem analysis performed  substantiated the endorsement by the Management  Board. The board members remained committed to  declaring their interests in order to avoid any conflicts  of interest at meetings by providing their annual  declarations of commitment and providing updated  declarations of interest.  In addition, the Management Board, in agreement  with the Commission, continued to engage in the  adoption of the necessary implementing measures  under the arrangements provided for in Article 110  of the Staff Regulations, namely on procedure for  dealing with professional incompetence (MB 2020_10)  and on the conduct of administrative inquiries and  disciplinary proceedings (MB 2020_13).  The Management Board decisions were prepared  by the Executive Board and adopted by the  Management Board.  The Executive Board had one formal meeting per  quarter.  PART II (A) MANAGEMENT  53  5454  2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS  The ENISA strategy, adopted by the Management  Board in June 2020, sets concrete strategic objectives  for the Agency and will guide the multiannual  programming of the Agency in the coming years.  These strategic objectives are as follows:  1.  Empowered and engaged communities across the  cybersecurity ecosystem;  2.  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU polices;  3.  Effective cooperation amongst operational  actors within the Union in case of massive cyber  incidents;  4.  Cutting-edge competences and capabilities in  cybersecurity across the Union;  5.  A high level of trust in secure digital solutions;  6.  Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity  challenges;  7.  Efficient and effective cybersecurity information  and knowledge management for Europe.  The strategy’s high-level objectives are directed at  shaping a more digitally secure environment for  Member States, EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies,  SMEs, academia and all of Europe’s citizens. The  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity will use the  new strategy to map out its annual work programme  to improve the level of cybersecurity across the  Union, and specifically to:    Direct the allocation of its human and financial  resources;    Develop the necessary capabilities under Article  3(4) of the CSA to maintain competitiveness and  preparedness.    Build on the Agency’s trusted relationships  with stakeholders and communities within the  cybersecurity ecosystem across Europe.    Guide ENISA communications within and beyond  the Union, to non-EU countries and international  organisations.    Deepen the knowledge and information sharing  of ENISA expertise to reach larger audiences and  increase awareness of digital security.    Provide cybersecurity stakeholders a clear  understanding of the Agency’s priorities and  actions.    Shape the future outlook of cybersecurity across  the Union.  The strategy is both an aggregation of the tasks  identified by the  Cybersecurity Act and the developed  synergies within Articles 5-12 of the CSA.  COVID-19  The second significant development that framed the  2020 work programme was the Agency’s response to  the global COVID-19 pandemic.  ENISA was called upon to support during these  testing times by making recommendations to the  critical infrastructure industry, supporting the EU  Tracing Apps Toolbox, providing cybersecurity advice  to SMEs and guidance to the healthcare sector against  the increase of phishing campaigns and ransomware  attacks. ENISA raised awareness of cybersecurity risks  and recommendations on a variety of topics such  as working remotely, shopping online and e-health;  and with the support of its partners issued weekly  situation reports of on-going cyber incidents. In  addition, the CSIRTs Network was placed on high alert  requiring increased support by the Agency. Through  protecting critical infrastructure, public outreach and  creating a common situational awareness, ENISA  played a key role in preventing malicious cyber actors  from taking advantage of the health pandemic and  turning it into a large scale cyber pandemic.  Reorganisation  ENISA embarked on a journey to reorganise the  organisation in light of the new strategy and the new  mandate of the Agency under the Cybersecurity Act  and on the basis of the problem analysis endorsed  by its Management Board.  The Management  Board set out principles for preparing, deciding and  implementing all the steps necessary for reorganising  the Agency and establishing the new internal  structures. The following principles guided the  Executive Director in preparing and implementing the  new organisation:  Purpose: the new organisation (including proposals  regarding the Agency’s internal structures) will be  implementing the Agency’s mandate, tasks and  functions as outlined by Union law and the values and  objectives as set by its Strategy.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 55  PART II. Management  Proportionality: the new organisation will ensure  the Agency’s continuous functioning, will aim to limit  disruption to the Agency fulfilling its mandate, and  will not go beyond what is necessary to address  agreed problems and aims.  Synergies: the new organisation will aim to  strengthen internal synergies and enhance  cooperation with the Agency’s strategic European  partners as defined by the CSA.  Efficiency: the new organisation will aim to  enhance the organisation’s performance, the  impact of ENISA and budgetary efficiency and  sound budgetary management.  Agility: the new organisation should facilitate the  Agency’s potential flexibility in terms of its human  and budgetary resources, as well as take into  account the ever growing and changing nature of the  cybersecurity ecosystem.  Transparency: all steps toward modifying or  reforming the Agency’s internal structure and  the steps leading to the implementation of the  reorganisation will be executed in an inclusive  manner, discussed and consulted with the  Agency’s Executive and Management Board and staff.  Predictability: the new organisation will be  implemented in a stage-by-stage approach allowing  staff and partners to anticipate and adjust to changes.  Competences: development of staff will be based on  their preferences, expertise, competences and talent,  whilst taking due account of their current functions  and career goals and the needs of the Agency.  Openness: new functions and posts within the  Agency will be filled through open competitions or  internal mobility organised on the basis of open  calls and through a transparent assessment of  merits and talent.  The Agency took different actions to initiate the  changes needed. The first step consisted in identifying  the problems of the current structure and look at how  employees function together as a team and how they  are equipped and empowered to deliver against the  work programme. ENISA organised a 2-day workshop  for staff to engage in the discussions.  The main problems identified were a) the  imbalance between the talent, functions and aims of  the two then departments, b) the limited synergies  between both the departments and within the  departments; c) weaknesses in internal controls  framework. This problem analysis was endorsed by  the Management Board.  In addition, ENISA created a competency framework  to measure the future state of competencies needed  for the new organisation. These competencies were  grouped into four categories; Corporate DNA, Next  Generation, Managerial and Functional competencies.  The competency framework provided a profile based  on specific sets of competencies and set levels of  proficiency levels for each competency.  Interviews were arranged with a third party to assess  the staff motivation and to give staff an opportunity  to express their interest in transferring to a new job  profile within the new organisation.  The Management Board established ENISA’s new  internal structure in June. The new organisational  architecture introduced a number of structural  elements to strengthen the Agency’s ability to build  internal and external synergies by introducing cross  structural teams to lead the work on horizontal tasks  (CSA Art 9-12) which require contributions from all  vertical units and could not be efficiently managed  within a unit. In addition, the role of the Management  Team is to coordinate the activities of the constituent  parts of the Agency in order to ensure efficient and  effective implementation of the Work Programme (Art  20d) and sound budgetary management.  Four operational units were created:  the Policy Development and Implementation  Unit ensuring the performance of the tasks of the  Agency as set out in Art. 5 of the CSA;  the Capacity Building Unit ensuring the  performance of the tasks of the Agency as set out  in Art. 6 and Art 7(5) of the CSA;  the Operational Cooperation Unit ensuring the  performance of the tasks of the Agency as set out  in Art. 7 (except for Art 7(5)) of the CSA;  the Market, Certification and Standardization  unit ensuring the performance of the tasks of the  Agency as set out in Art. 8 and 22 and under Title  III of the CSA.  Two internal new structural units were created  (Corporate Support Service and Executive  Director’s Office) to ensure sound budgetary  management and effective and efficient management  of all its other resources, as well as compliance  with the Agency’s work and the regulatory and  programming framework. The culmination of these  5656  changes saw the ratio of administrative / neutral staff  (40%) to operational staff (60%) that had historically  been high at the Agency shift towards a greater  balance in favour of operational activities.  A process was set in place to guide the transfer of  staff into the new structure and to ensure a smooth  and effective transition to the new organisation. This  process included the creation of a Joint Committee,  an advisory body to facilitate the decision-making of  the Appointing Authority according to the principles  outlined in Annex II Art 2 and 3 of the Staff Regulations.  Using an established methodology, the Joint  Committee’s final final assessment concluded  whether a staff member’s current tasks and/or job  description matched to a great extent (e.g. at least  75% to the tasks of a new structural unit), then an  offer letter was proposed for an automatic transfer  to the new unit. Dedicated consultations were held  with any staff member who refused the automatic  transfer offer.  All staff members were transferred to the new  structure by 01.01.2021 via individual ‘transfer  decisions’ by the Appointing Authority acting solely in  the interest of the service according to Article 7 of the  Staff Regulations. All transfer decisions were prepared  in a transparent and open manner towards staff  members, taking into account their current functions  and tasks, motivation, experiences and competences.  For managerial positions, the managers of units  which managed at least 75% of the operational tasks  (as outlined in Art 5-12 of Title I chapter II in the CSA)  of a new structural unit, were offered a transfer to  a new managerial position through internal mobility.  Three managerial positions were transferred via  internal mobility via this process. All other new  managerial posts were fulfilled via open competitions.  In order to inform all staff on the various processes of  the competency framework and staff transfers, since  15 April a weekly Questions and Answers session  was organised by the Executive Director. Every week,  a different aspect of the reorganisation would be  discussed and staff could request information and  provide feedback and input. A staff survey in June  2020 found that 89% of staff indicated that the  amount of information received was just about right  and that 94% of staff indicated that the timing of  information was just about right.  The new organisational structure came into effect as  from 1st January 2021.  Recruitment  In the beginning of 2020 the Agency embarked  on a large-scale recruitment exercise to create  a sufficiently diverse and broad reserve shortlist of  75 candidates with more transversal competences  and skills. This reserve list was intended to be used  to recruit staff into grades AD6–AD8 and functions  and thus fill the gaps in the current establishment  plan, as well as serve as a pool of candidates for the  establishment plan of 2021 and 2022 if necessary, in  line with the needs of the new organization. The TA  call, which was supported by a widespread promotion  campaign, attracted 1 235 candidates (who submitted  more than 1 600 applications) across all Member  States). This resulted in a reserve shortlist of 69  candidates. In addition, this selection came along with  another call for  contract agents , which attracted over  600 applications and resulted in a reserve shortlist of  15 candidates33.  3 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  a) FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  The Agency operated with the budget of EUR  21.6 million equivalent to a 28 % increase in 2020  compared to the 2019 budget (EUR 16.9 million).  The amending budget 1/2020 wasadopted by  the Management Board by written procedure on  28 August 2020. The purpose of this amending  budget was to re-direct funding made available  through the cancellation of projects and forecasted  expenditures due to the COVID-19 pandemic to  finance new projects and activities up to an amount  of EUR 2.5 million, from which EUR 1.6 million are  under operational activities.  ENISA concluded a total of 35 public procurement  procedures (two of which have been jointly done with  Cedefop)  1.  18 were done through re-opening of competition  under framework contract (51 %);  2.  10 were done through negotiated procedure for  middle and low-value contracts (29 %); and  3.  7 were done through open procedure (20 %)  No interest was paid in 2020 to suppliers for  late payments.  33 The establishment plan projected a staff increase over the  period from 111 staff members in 2020 to 121 in 2023.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 57  PART II. Management  The table below shows ENISA’s budget implementation targets and achievements in 2020, which remained high  under restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  Area Objective Target 2020 Level of completion 2020  Budget implementation (appropriations  committed through the year)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 99 % 97.35 %  Payments against appropriations of the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 85 % 68.62 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from previous year (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 95 % 95.86 %  b) BUDGET EXECUTION OF EU SUBSIDY (C1 FUNDS  OF CURRENT YEAR 2020)  During 2020, ENISA committed an amount of  EUR 20 588 320 representing 97.35 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the year  amounted to EUR 14 513 329 representing 68.62 % of  the total budget.  The budgetary execution was high despite the  restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  As compared to 2019, there was a slight increase  in commitment execution – 97.35 % in 2020 as  compared to 96.80 % in 2019, and a slight decrease in  payment execution – 68.62 % as compared to 70.12 %  in 2019. The target of 95 % for commitment rate set  by the Commission (DG Budget) was thus reached.  The payment rate was lower than expected but can  be explained by the new challenges and priorities  stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and by the  renewal of annual IT software licenses. Approved mid- year, the related commitments were therefore only  concluded late in the year. Moreover, ENISA’s budget  increased by almost a third from 2019 to 2020 which  required operational and administrative adjustments  to absorb the substantial difference.  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not paid  at the end of 2020 were carried forward to 2021.  Table below summarises the execution of the budget in 2020.  2020 budget (C1)  2020 area  of budget  allocation  Appropriation  amount (in  EUR)  (1)  Commitment  amount (in  EUR)  (2)  Percentage  committed  (2)/(1)  Payment  amount (in  EUR)  (3)  Percentage  paid  (3)/(1)  Amount  carried  forward to  2021 (in EUR)  Title I (*) 10 753 483 10 488 532 97.54 % 9 278 773 86.29 % 1 209 759  Title II (**) 3 538 031 3 426 650 96.85 % 1 663 918 47.03 % 1 762 732  Title III 6 857 606 6 673 138 97.31 % 3 570 638 52.07 % 3 102 500  TOTAL 21 149 120 20 588 320 97.35 % 14 513 329 68.62 % 6 074 991  (*) Title I does not include revenue of EUR 97 920 from eu-LISA for provision of services (**) Title II does not include the subsidy of up to EUR 640 000 from Hellenic Authorities for the rent of the building  Further details on budget execution are provided in Annex II.  5858  c) AMENDING BUDGET / BUDGETARY TRANSFERS  According to Article 26 of ENISA’s applicable  financial rules, the Executive Director may transfer  appropriations from one title to another of up to  a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the  financial year allocated to the title from which the  transfer is made. Transfers within the same title are  also permitted, without limit.  Beyond the limit referred to above, the executive  director may propose transfers of appropriations  from one title to another to the Management Board.  The Management Board has 2 weeks to oppose  the proposed transfers. After that time limit, the  proposed transfers are deemed to be adopted.  The Agency made three transfers in the reported year  by the decision of the Executive Director (hereinafter  – ED) on the initial budget, and four transfers by the  decision of the Executive Director on the amended  budget (in comparison,  the Executive Director made  four transfers on the initial budget and six transfers  on the amended budget in 2019). The three transfers  on the initial budget included only transfers within  the title. The four transfers on the amended budget  included two transfers within title and two transfers  between titles. Because of COVID-19 restrictions  funds were mainly redirected from salaries, meetings,  conferences, other events and missions to support  ICT projects, translations and interim services.  The table below summarises the changes to the budget in 2020.  2020 budget (C1) (in EUR)  2020 area of  budget allocation  Initial budget Amended budget Transfers approved by  the executive director  Final budget  Title I 12 041 486 11 105 414 (*) – 351 931 10 753 483 (*)  Title II (**) 2 346 000 2 714 724 823 306 3 538 031  Title III 6 761 633 7 328 981 – 471 375 6 857 606  TOTAL 21 149 120 21 149 120 0 21 149 120  (*) Title I does not include revenue of EUR 97 920 from eu-LISA for provision of services (**) Title II does not include the subsidy of up to EUR 640 000 from Hellenic Authorities for the rent of the building  d)  CARRY-FORWARD OF COMMITMENT  APPROPRIATIONS  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not fully  paid at the end of 2019 were carried forward to 2020  (C8 appropriations).  As compared to 2019, there was a 1 % increase in  commitment execution (96.01 % in 2020 compared  to 94.93 % in 2019) as well as a 1 % increase in  payment execution (95.86 % in 2020 compared to  94.93 % in 2019) showing an improvement in financial  management in this regard.  The following table shows the commitment execution and payment execution in 2020.  2020 budget (C8)  2020 area of budget  allocation  Appropriations carried forward  from 2019 to 2020 (in EUR)  Payment  amount (IN EUR)  Percentage  paid  Amount cancelled  (in EUR)  Title I 357 936 321 924 89.94 % 36 012  Title II 2 884 042 2 836 694 98.36 % 47 348  Title III 1 105 354 1 008 690 91.25 % 96 664  TOTAL 4 347 332 4 167 309 95.86 % 180 023  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 59  PART II. Management  4 DELEGATION AND SUB DELEGATION  In the very beginning of 2020, the Executive Director  reviewed the delegation of authorising authority  powers and on 12 February 2020 adopted a new  decision on a framework of the financial delegation  of the authorising officer and of a budgetary  management committee to ensure a sound financial  execution of the Agency’s budget.  This decision confirmed the overarching principle  of financial delegations applicable to heads of  department and heads of unit with a respective limit of  EUR 500 000 and EUR 100 000 per transaction. ENISA  didn’t implement any further sub-delegations in 2020.  Controls on these delegation rights are done through  a periodical revision of the rights granted in the main  financial system, ‘ABAC 34’. ENISA set time limits to  indicate the termination of the respective financial  delegations.  In October 2020, the ECA identified a weakness in  the delegation of financial rights whereas financial  transactions were authorised without having proper  financial delegation rights over the period prior to  12 February 2020.  The Agency took all the necessary steps to address  this  weakness  properly: the Executive Director  set up an independent task force to look into  these transactions and concluded they were free  of conflict of interest and did not jeopardise the  Agency’s financial interests. Moreover, a revision of  the financial delegations, the related financial circuit  and relevant internal controls took place in the last  quarter of 2020 (see also section 2.7.2 European  Court of Auditors).  5 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  ENISA HR took decisive targeted actions prior to the  lockdown imposed by the Greek government, further  to the COVID-19 outbreak, e.g. continuing to ensure  high health and safety measures in place for its staff  (ample supplies of disinfectants, disposable gloves,  masks, basic medicine, and hand disinfectant).  Staff guidelines were drawn up and teleworking was  authorised in lieu of working in the office for all staff  34 ABAC (Accrual Based Accounting): the acronym of the  European Commission’s project to switch from cash-based  to accrual accounting, and of the new accounting system  introduced. https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/ publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_ en.pdf  as of March 11th 2020. Missions and public events  were halted.  Since March 2020, 23% of staff teleworked outside  the place of assignment for longer than 6 months. 6%  of staff teleworked outside the place of assignment  for less than 6 months. The Agency implemented this  duty of care measure in order to allow staff members  to take precautious measures based of numbers of  available intensive care units per member state.  The management of the Agency processed a phased  Return to the Office plan based on: the perception  of the threat to the Agency staff, the assessment of  risk by management, and the mitigation measures  intended to keep staff from aggregating in the office.  Staff safety was and still remains the guiding principle  regarding the implementation of this plan.  During the pandemic, daily updates were sent to all  staff members via a designated functional mailbox,  detailing the number of cases and the most recent  developments in the world, so as to keep staff  abreast. The Agency also authorised reimbursement  of all COVID-19 related tests (PCR, anti-gen, anti- body) for work-related reasons and for travel back  to the place of employment. Human Resources also  revised the core working hours, so as to provide for  greater flexibility for colleagues working from various  locations across Europe. A total of 5 Administrative  Notices were published, as well as 17 intranet  announcements, in addition to the bi-weekly updates  from the Management Team meetings.  The Human Resources unit supported the operational  and administrative goals of the agency in terms of  staff acquisition and development. The planning of,  execution of and accounting for the long- and short- term needs of the agency form the majority of the  unit’s regular activities. In this regard, the Human  Resources unit carries out its tasks in relation to the  management of ENISA’s statutory staff along with  its external staff (e.g. trainees) in line with the staff  regulations / conditions of employment of other  servants of the European Union, as appropriate.  In 2020, ENISA carried out tasks to support the  deployment of the Commission’s information  management system for human resources (‘Sysper’).  Compliance remained a priority for the Human  Resources both in terms of meeting audit and  internal control recommendations and in terms of  meeting statutory requirements such as in the area of  personal data protection.  https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/budget/library/biblio/publications/modern_accounts/modernising_EU_accounts_en.pdf  6060  As previously mentioned, theAgency embarked  on a large-scale call for expression of interest for  temporary agents (TA) and contract agents (CA)  following an adapted approach, to replenish its  reserve lists with suitable candidates at various levels.  This resulted in a reserve shortlist of 69 candidates  for TA posts and for CA posts 15 in reserve shortlist,  giving ample choice to the Appointing Authority.  The table below shows ENISA’s planned recruitment goals for 2020 to 2021.  Area Objective 2020 target 2021 target  Efficient  management  of selection  procedures  Reduction of time taken to hire (in line with the standard EU  human resources definition, this is the timeframe set from the  deadline of the vacancy for candidates to submit applications  until the signing of the reserve list by the executive director)  ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months  Turnover of staff Reduced turnover rate of statutory staff  (temporary agents and contract agents)  < 15 % < 15 %  Staff performance  management  Implementation and monitoring of the appraisal and  reclassification exercises (launching and completion  of the exercises)  100 % 100 %  6 STRATEGY FOR EFFICIENCY GAINS  ENISA is committed to continuously implementing  measures to obtain efficiency gains in all activities.  For this purpose, the agency launched coordinated  initiatives notably with other EU institutions and  bodies, namely CEDEFOP to create synergies and seek  to rationalise its internal processes to improve its  overall efficiency and to follow the benchmark best  practices in the EU agencies. Such initiatives resulted  in signing a contract with Cedefop.  In 2020 ENISA also engaged with EU LISA to seek  such synergies as well. The process was concluded in  early 2021.  ENISA also supported BEREC Office by providing back  up services for storing BEREC’s Office electronically  data as per SLA agreement.  Similarly, in response to tasks provided for in Article  7 of the CSA, ENISA initiated the establishment of  a structured dialogue with CERT EU (Commission  services). The process was endorsed by the The  Management Board of ENISA endorsed the process in  a  emorandum of Understanding.  In addition, further efficiency gains are planned  for the future, based on the deployment and  enhancing of IT tools and internal procedures (such  as Sysper, the Missions Integrated Processing System,  e-recruitment, etc.).  7 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT AND EX-POST  EVALUATION RESULTS DURING THE  REPORTING YEAR  7.1 Internal Audit Service (IAS)  The IAS issued an audit report on  stakeholder’s involvement in the production  of deliverables in June 2018. Five audit  recommendations, two assessed as very important  and three as important, were issued during this  audit. ENISA set up a specific task force to ensure the  adequate implementation of the action plan agreed  with the IAS.  As of end of 2020, four recommendations were  considered closed by the IAS. As for the pending  important recommendation, the few remaining  actions were carried out by the Agency in 2020 by  strengthening its reporting process, notably on the  information to be provided in the Annual Activity  Report. The supporting documents were provided  to the IAS to review its correct implementation in  early 2021. Following its review, the IAS considered in  May 2021 the controls put in place by the Agency as  sufficient to close this recommendation.  Altogether, all five recommendations issued during the  2018 audit are now fully addressed by ENISA.  The IAS audit report on human resources  management and ethics was issued in September  2019. Three very important and four important  and recommendations were issued in this audit.  An action plan was devised and agreed with the  IAS. In the second half of 2020, one very important  recommendation was considered as implemented  and was closed by the IAS. Corrective actions  were consequently implemented by ENISA for the  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 61  PART II. Management  remaining six recommendations in 2020 and were  submitted for IAS review in early 2021. Following its  review, the IAS considered in May 2021 the sufficient  the controls put in place by the Agency to further  close another three recommendations.  Altogether, four audit recommendations were closed  by the IAS while 3 recommendations remain open as  further actions are required to be implemented by  ENISA in 2021.  7.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  In October 2020, the ECA identified a weakness in  the delegation financial rights whereas financial  transactions had been authorised without proper  financial delegation rights in place. The Agency  welcomed this finding and a corrective action plan  was immediately devised to address this legal issue  and to reinforce relevant internal controls. A task  force was constituted to evaluate whether these  transactions jeopardised the Agency’s financial  interests. It is important to note that these financial  transactions did not impact the reliability of the  financial records: these transactions would have been  processed by the Agency anyway as all of these were  completed in the pursuance of the Agency’s objectives  and for its official use.  The corrective action plan also triggered an  immediate revision of the financial delegation  rights as well as of the financial circuit which took  place in the last quarter of 2020 for effective  implementation as from 1st January 2021. This also  follows the recommendation issued by the task  force in its January 2020 report on assessment on  the Agency’s organisational structure and internal  control systems (see also Part III – Assessment of the  effectiveness of the internal control systems).  The ECA issued in 2020 its report on the 2019 annual  accounts of the Agency35. In their audit opinion, all  revenue and payments underlying the accounts  for the year ended 2019 are legal and regular in all  material aspects. Moreover, ‘the accounts of the  Agency for the year ended 31 December 2019 present  fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of the Agency at 31 December 2019, the results of  its operations, its cash flows, and the changes in net  assets for the year then ended’.  The ECA nevertheless identified non-critical  weaknesses on the Agency’s public procurement  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/accounting-finance/ files/enisa-2019-annual-accounts-2013-eca-report  procedures36. In particular, selection and award  criteria in the procurement notice could be improved  and respect of publishing within the deadlines should  be better monitored.  Acknowledging and welcoming these audit  observations, the Agency immediately addressed  these concerns by implementing corrective action  through a reconsideration of its internal processes.  The ECA also observed an increase to the use of  temporary workers and commented on specific legal  provisions governing the use of interim staff37. As  ENISA’s activities are growing, the Agency does rely on  interim staff to perform some of its tasks but only in  case of unfilled vacant posts and of heavy workloads.  To mitigate risks linked to vacant posts, ENISA re- defined its recruitment strategy. The Agency  indeed  launched in 2020 two combined vacancy notices  for Temporary Agents and for Contract Agents  respectively likely to yield a large number of new  recruits expected to reach the staff employment  levels required under the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA  therefore should see It the number of temporary  workers significantly drop in.  To ensure that specific legal provisions governing the  use of interim staff were complied with, the Agency  updated the basic terms of employment in order to  justify the category under which the interim worker is  hired by among other adding a job description to the  contract. ENISA also revised the  extra-legal benefits  granted to staff and the categories of staff who can  benefit from them. This allowed the Agency to ensure  that interim workers enjoyed the same working  conditions as statutory staff.  In response to the Court recommendations and by  following the above mentioned approach, the Agency  is likely to remain a fairly attractive place to work,  while mitigating any legal concerns of its interim  agents and duly motivating its decision to dispense its  appropriations accordingly.  All ECA’s observations stemming from the previous  years were duly addressed except for the adoption  36 See paragraph 17 to 19 of ECA’s Report on the annual  accounts of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) for the financial year 2019 – link to the report is  disclosed in the footnote 31  37 See paragraph 20 to 21 of ECA’s Report on the annual  accounts of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) for the financial year 2019 – link to the report is  disclosed in the footnote 31  6262  by the Agency of a policy on sensitive functions  tobe  made in 202138.  7.3 Ex-post evaluation results  ENISA performed ex post controls, as part of  the internal control framework, for the 2019  financial year. A total of 266 financial transactions  were scrutinised, representing 11.26 % of all the  agency’s financial transactions and 66.66 % of the  agency’s 2019 budget. As a result, recommendations  were issued as follows.  Five recommendations were made pertaining to  observations on administrative procedures for which  corrective measures had already been implemented.  One recommendation was related to financial  management, revealing a weakness in forecasting  expenditures for non-fixed costs.  The final recommendation related to the late  payment of the rent subsidy by the Hellenic  authorities, as it delayed the payment from the  agency to the property owner.  The agency recorded 31 exceptions in the reporting  year: 28 of these were below the relevant materiality  level (less than EUR 15 000). Two exceptions were  linked to a posteriori commitments and the one  remaining exception linked to a consumption that  exceeded the available C8 funds. Reminders and  additional information/training were delivered to the  respective project managers and authorising officers  by delegation on the applicable financial rules and  ENISA will look into the accountability procedure for  future events. In relation to the above, controls for  the 2021 carry-forward will be improved.  8 FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  ISSUED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS BY  THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE  One recommendation issued by OLAF was resolved  in 2020.  submitted to ENISA a report in December  with recommendations to be addressed in the course  of 2021.  38 See Annex of ECA’s Report on the annual accounts of the  European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) for the  financial year 2019 – link to the report is disclosed in the  footnote 31  9 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  In relation to the 2019 discharge39, as decided by  the European Parliament, the Executive Director  of the agency was granted discharge regarding the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the 2019  financial year. The closure of the agency’s accounts  for the 2019 financial year was also approved by the  discharge authority.  10 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  The normal activities of the Agency were materially  affected by the fallout related to COVID-19 for the  majority of the 2020 year, ENISA continued to implement  its established greening measures such as; recycling of  office materials, reduction in electricity usage for lighting  and heating/cooling. ENISA also actively implements the  EU GPP (green public procurement) award criteria in  its tendering documentation, with relevant procedures  launched in 2020 such as; Provision of Stationery and  printing supplies; Laptop Computers and Docking  Stations; and Production and supply of branded  promotional material.  The restrictions imposed from March and for the  best part of 2020, such as imposed teleworking and  heavily restricted travel for work related missions, led  to a number of benefits for the environment. With the  majority of staff teleworking from home, the carbon  footprint was significantly reduced per staff member as  they did not drive their vehicles to the workplace; they  replaced EU wide mission travel for video conference  meetings instead; paper based printing at the office  39 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/ document/A-9-2021-0085_EN.html  ENISA continued  to implement its  established greening  measures such as;  recycling of office  materials, reduction  in electricity usage for  lighting and heating/ cooling.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 63  PART II. Management  was substantially reduced, and heating/cooling/lighting  of office space was largely not required.  Whilst it could be argued that the magnitude of  these gains are not sustainable once life goes back  to normal and staff return to their offices, there is  a strong indication, backed by management, that the  ‘new normal’ for staff working conditions will include  a much higher level of voluntary teleworking, and  an ongoing significant reduction in mission related  travel. Furthermore, a carbon neutrality objective  was introduced in the Single Programming document  2022-2024 targeting full implementation by 2030.  It is important to note that in consultation with ENISA,  Hellenic Authorities ENISA found new headquarters  building for ENISA in the reporting year. This will  provide further impetus for implementation of  measures which could not be undertaken in the  current building due to the shared arrangement.  11 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2020 was a challenging year for ENISA for two  reasons: the COVID-19 pandemic and fundamental  changes in modus operandi.  Despite such circumstances, the report  demonstrates that ENISA delivered as expected  with the flexibility needed to reshuffle priorities in  relation to its work programme.  Essential changes were implemented to reshape the  organisational structure of ENISA from top to bottom  and the way the Agency operates. In the transition  actions deemed necessary were taken in order  to increase the efficiency of the Agency including  fulfilling its operational mandate, and address urgent  shortcomings and needs.  Changes included the revision of the role of the  Management Team. The practice of inceptions for  every individual project undertaken to implement the  work programme was introduced at the beginning  of the year, to ensure better coordination within the  Agency and guarantee more targeted and effective  resource management.  The Agency also implemented a new system to  validate the work programme deliverables piloted  in 2020, which consisted in consulting the Advisory  Group (AG), the National Liaison Officers network  (NLO) and other statutory bodies.  Another essential development was the process  engaged in view of the reorganisation of the structure  of the Agency. This reorganisation also applied to  the way ENISA’s internal controls are now set up and  addressed, and in relation to the work programme:  the setting of key performance indicators and the  implementation of new processes.  In addition, the Agency initiated the setting-up of the  structured cooperation with CERT-EU, a statutory  obligation foreseen in the CSA.  Besides, ENISA also launched a process to allow  the handling of a higher level of the EU Classified  Information and engaged in the administrative  processes required for the set-up of the local office in  Brussels, Belgium.  PART II (B) EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS  ENISA contracted the services of Deloitte Consulting and Advisory to perform an ex-post evaluation of the activities  of the Agency implementing the work programme of 2019. This work resulted in a final report and a case study on  Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals. Deloitte aggregated the key findings of the report aggregated  under the following criteria; effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and coordination, relevance, and EU added  value). The contractor submitted  an action plan composed of concrete recommendations to adjust and improve  ENISA’s activities. Recommendations included to redefine key performance indicators (KPIs), to balance and tailor the  Agency’s activities and outputs, and finally to reinforce the position of the Agency within the cybersecurity ecosystem.  64  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 65  1 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  ENISA adopted the revised internal control framework  end of 2019. The revised framework follows  the framework of the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations40 of the Treadway Commission  as adopted by the European Commission, and  comprises five internal control components and 17  internal control principles.  The internal control system is designed to provide  reasonable assurance of achieving effectiveness,  efficiency and economy of operations, reliability of  reporting, safeguarding of assets and information,  and prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of  fraud and irregularities.  In November 2019, the Executive Director created  a task force to assess the Agency’s organisational  structure and internal control systems. A report  was submitted by the task force in January  2020. One of the findings was that the previous  Agency’s organisation was not adequate to  independently implement the principles of the  internal control framework. This led to the re- organisation of the internal control function and  underlying processes.  40 COSO  In order to assess all the components and principles  of the Internal Control Framework, a set of 57 KPIs  was designed and annexed to the MB Decision  MB/2019/1241. All these KPIs are assessed individually  using relevant supporting documents as evidence of  the assessment.  1.1 Assessment of control environment  component  The control environment component consists in five  principles.  Principle 1: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  integrity and ethical values.  The Management strongly encourages all staff to  follow annual mandatory trainings related to integrity  and ethics (which is obligatory for all management  team members).  To that purpose, a training on “Ethics and Integrity” was  given by the European Commission to ENISA’s staff  during 2020. Moreover, different types of material are  at disposal of the staff such as the training content and  the most updated IDOC reports42.  41 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/management-board- decisions/MB%20Decision%202019-12%20on%20internal%20 controls%20framework.pdf  42 Commission’s Investigation and Disciplinary Office  PART III ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  https://www.coso.org/Pages/default.aspx  66  Principle 2: ENISA’s Management exercises  oversight responsibility of development and  performance of internal control.  The Declaration of assurance of the Executive  Director is included in the Annual Activity Report (Part  V). All Authorising Officers by delegation signed their  own declaration of assurance covering their areas.  As a result of the assessment on the  Agency’s organisational structure and internal  control systems by the task force initiated by  the Executive Director, a revision of the internal  controls function took place in 2020 to ensure its  independency and to increase its effectiveness.  Moreover,ENISA fully re-assessed the financial circuit  and financial delegation in 2020. The ECA preliminary  finding (section 2.7.2.) further confirmed the need  to review the financial delegations. ENISA fully  implemented the revised financial circuit and financial  delegation as from 1st January 2021. In particular,  the financial processes were reviewed as well as the  delegations and ceilings of each financial actor.  Principle 3: ENISA’s Management establishes  structures, reporting lines, and appropriate  authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit of  objectives.  To ensure the comprehensive structure and clear  reporting lines are communicated to all staff, the  updated organisational chart is published every  month on the ENISA intranet.  The task force set up by the Executive Director in  November 2019 assessed  ENISA’s organisational  structure, internal processes and internal controls  systems. In this report issued in January 2020,  recommendations included:  1.  to fit ENISA’s organisational structure to its  purposes by better reflecting the new challenges  arising from the Cybersecurity Act; and  2.  to review the internal control function.  As a result, the Agency:    reviewed the overall framework of financial  delegation in February 2020, limiting the number  of authorised officers and created a separate  independent oversight body (Budget Management  Committee) to monitor, among other tasks, the  exercise of sub-delegated powers, with a more  independent setup established in 2021 after  reorganisation;    started to design a new organisational structure  (effective as of 01.01.2021), where the tasks  of budgetary execution and internal controls  (including monitoring) are structurally and  functionally firm and well segregated, with a new  ‘compliance and control’ section within the  Executive Director’s Office with 4 FTEs, separated  from budgetary monitoring and execution (with  the Finance and Procurement Section within the  Corporate Support Service);    in March 2020, further decisions restricted the  financial impact of authorised expenditures to the  Head of Resources Department and in November  2020 suspended the delegation of financial  authority initially given to the Head of Resources  Department,  since the post was disbanded within  the new organisation of the Agency;  As from the 1st January 2021, a single executive  director decision covers all delegations of financial  transactions streamlining the profiles and enhancing  efficiency and effectiveness. Importantly, the new  decision also includes a sunset clause to end all sub- delegated authority automatically 3 months after the  change of the person of the Executive Director, unless  the new Executive Director explicitly confirms the  delegations in place.  To ensure that  the Agency has  a comprehensive  structure and clear  reporting lines and  that this structure  is communicated to  all staff, the updated  organisational chart is  published every month  on ENISA intranet.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 67  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Principle 4: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  attracting, developing and retaining competent  individuals in alignment with objectives.  The Agency made an enormous effort in the reporting  year to widely disseminateENISA’s vacancies using  different channels. Vacancies were advertised  internally through email and Intranet publications  and externally through ENISA website, EPSO and  social media. The extensive communication plan  around these publications partly results from  the  new organisational structure and efforts done in the  strategy on resources needed based on the priorities  of the objectives of the Agency.  The agency managed to significantly reduce t staff  turnover in 2020. The ratio was only of 2 percent  which shows improvement in retaining staff members  in the Agency  All staff performed their Career Development Report.  The internal deadlines were respected and the  exercise was successful.  In order to develop and retain competent individuals,  a Learning and Developing policy is adopted every  year. This policy is detailed and includes the training  plan for the agency wide trainings, as well as the  budgetary resources available for individual trainings.  Internal mobility was exercised during the  reorganisation process in 2020.  Principle 5: ENISA holds accountable for their  internal control responsibilities in the pursuit  of objectives  The Agency defines clear roles and responsibilities  for its staff members as well as sets annual  objectives through annual appraisal exercise. Each  of them are entrusted and accountable for the  performance of the internal control at their level  and based on their functions.  In order to pursue its objectives and to follow up on  the actions taken, a mid-term review is performed by  the Agency in order to evaluate the progress of the  objectives (and their budgetary implementation). In  2020 this exercise led to amendments of the work  programme 2020 and of the associated budget. Such  exercise ensures that corrective actions can be taken  in order to achieve the overall objectives.  The staff efficiency, abilities and conduct in the  service are assessed annually against the expected  standards of conducts and set objectives for each  staff member. Promotion of staff is decided after  consideration of the merits of eligible staff taking into  account their appraisal reports.  1.2 Assessment of Risk Assessment  component  The Risk Assessment component consists in  4  principles.  Principle 6: ENISA specifies objectives with  sufficient clarity to enable the identification and  assessment of risks relating to objectives.  ENISA embarked on defining a new strategy with  objectives allowing for the implementation of the  mandate of the Cybersecurity Act and its mission  statement..  The objectives of the work programme 2020  were  based on the previous organisational structure and  on the previous strategy. Also, the Agency established  a template to incept the implementation of outputs.  This template also includes a risk assessment.  ENISA also prepared an amending work programme  to suggest several changes to the Management Board  and the amended Single Programming Document  (SPD) was approved by the Management Board on  the 16th June 2020 by written procedure (MB/2020/7).  ENISA uses the objectives as basis for allocating  resources to achieve policy, operational and  financial performance goals.  The Agency submitted  its Amending Budget to the Management Board  adjusting its financial resources allocation in response  to the pandemic. The Management Board adopter  the Agency amending budget on the 28 August 2020  (MB/2020/18).  Principle 7: ENISA identifies risks to the  achievement of its objectives across the  organisation and analyses risk as a basis for  determining how the risks should be managed.  ENISA identifies and assesses risks at the various  organisational levels analysing internal and external  factors. Both management and staff are involved  through a process at the level of the Management  team. Every output of the work programme requires  an inception and a finalisation. The template of this  process require a risk assessment for each output.  ENISA estimates the significance of the risks identified  and determines how to respond to significant risks  considering how each one should be managed and  whether to accept, avoid, reduce or share the risk.  68  Nevertheless, Risk Management in 2020 was not  centralised and didn’t have a holistic approach yet.  This created a weakness in the management of risks.  In order to minimise this issue, the Agency created  a Compliance and Control Sector in the course of the  reorganisation to centralise all risks of the Agency in  order to address them correctly and efficiently.  Principle 8: ENISA considers the potential for  fraud in assessing risks to the achievement of  objectives  ENISA renewed its anti-fraud strategy and action plan,  both adopted by the Management Board in February.  Principle 9: ENISA identifies and analyses  significant change  The risk identification process considers changes  in the internal and external environment. The  mitigation actions engaged as early as March when  the COVID-19 crisis emerged are clear examples of  this process. These measures included teleworking,  access to premises with prior approval. Response to  this  As a result, a review of annual work programme  and associated budget took place. Coordination  between departments could have been organised  in a smoother way to allow earlier approval of  the amending budget by the Management Board.  This was rectified by introducing new budgetary  monitoring and reporting framework – establishment  of internal Budget Management Committee  and including specific KPI’s in relation to budget  implementation for middle managers.  Besides, the Executive Director established several  task forces to initiate the changes needed by the  Agency. Different mitigation measures were taken  such as the change of the organisational structure  to adapt it to the objectives of the CSA; the analysis  of internal synergies to improve ; the revision of the  financial circuits and actors.  The Agency will be relocated to a new headquarter  mid-2021 is expected to stir up a significant change.  ENISA launched the relocation process in the  reporting year. This is expected to allow for a smooth  transition from the old building to the new one. The  Executive Director created a dedicated task force and  relocation team  to support this change.  1.3 Assessment of control activities  component  The control activities component consists in 3  principles.  Principle 10: ENISA selects and develops control  activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks  to the achievement of objectives to an acceptable  level  Results of control and performance indicators are  monitored as to ensure achieving related objectives.  These controls take place twice a year (mid-term  review and end of year report).  In order to ensure a high level of control, the Agency  applies ex ante verification on 100 % of its financial  transactions. In order to complete this control, an ex  post control verification is performed every year.  The Business Continuity Plan is being revised and will  be finalised by the end of 2021.  There was no map of critical and sensitive posts  established in 2020. Such mapping is expected to be  carried out in the course of 2021.  Principle 11: ENISA selects and develops  general control over technology to support the  achievement of objectives  ENISA applies appropriate controls to ensure the  security of the main IT systems which the Agency is  the system owner of. It is done in accordance with  the IT security governance principles, in particular  as regards data protection, professional secrecy,  availability, confidentiality and integrity.  A dedicated staff member acts as Information security  officer. Regular vulnerability assessments and  penetrations tests were performed. ENISA provided  to all staff its the security awareness policy and an  improved IT Security training. Non-compliances with  policy were identified and addressed.  In order to reinforce these controls, an IT risk  assessment was conducted in 2020. The new IT  Management Committee set up in Q4 of 2020 is  currently revising the IT strategy and the IT security  policy. The Agency keeps a complete recording of  security breaches and addresses them properly.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 69  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Principle 12: ENISA deploys control activities  through policies that establish what is expected  and in procedures that put policies into action  Internal control activities were deployed thanks to  the revision of objectives and deliverables by Head of  Units and Department, to the measurement of results  against the forecasted expectations; and the validation  of deliverables by expert communities, including the  reorganisation process. The Agency performed an  external ex-post evaluation of its activities based on  effectiveness; efficiency; coherence; coordination and  added value of its activities.  The Agency regularly updates its Register of  Exceptions as needed. The contents of the 2020  Register of exceptions  are detailed in paragraph 2.7.3  on ex-post controls and evaluations.  1.4 Assessment of information and  communication component  Principle 13: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  ENISA has the information required to support the  functioning of the internal control system and the  achievement of its objectives.  The Agency uses a centralised external  communication tool for incoming/outgoing  documents. Official documents (outgoing and  incoming) are registered, numbered and archived.  The fact that Agency can retrieve 100 % of the  documents requested by the IAS/ECA is an excellent  indicator. All documents are archived on ENISA’s  intranet; paperless and requests for financial reports  can be processed on the spot using Business Object  and ABAC.  Principle 14: ENISA communicates information  internally, including objectives and  responsibilities for internal control, necessary to  support the functioning of internal control  ENISA and the management communicate internally  about their objectives, challenges, actions taken  and results achieved. Internal communication is  performed using different channels. Communication  to staff is enabled through Staff Meetings; Unit  meetings, Minutes of Management Team meetings  distributed the same day to all staff via email and  published on the Intranet.  The Agency uses different tools for internal  communications. Most common tools are the ENISA’s  intranet; email; Skype for Business and WebEx. The  Agency carried out all internal communications  remotely and through online meetings as of mid  March 2020.  Mid-term reviews of the budget are also used as an  opportunity to communicate on objectives achieved and  ongoing projects  or on changes needed as well as the  strategy to be followed to deliver the Agency’s outputs.  There is a separate communication line for  whistleblowing arrangements. The basic principles,  definitions and reporting mechanism are described in  the whistleblowing policy.  Principle 15: ENISA communicates with external  parties about matters affecting the functioning of  internal control  The Agency communicates on its Internal Controls  through the Annual Activity Report and regularly at  Management level.  Also, regular reporting on IAS and ECA  recommendations and their follow up is provided  to the Executive Board and through the discharge  procedure.  1.5 Assessment of monitoring activities  component  Principle 16: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  ENISA continuously monitors the performance of  the internal control system with tools designed  to  identify internal control deficiencies, to register and  assess the results of controls, and identify control  deviations and exceptions.  The Agency performed  an external ex post  evaluation of its activities  based on effectiveness;  efficiency; coherence;  coordination and added  value of its activities.  70  The Agency follows up, in a timely manner, the  recommendations of auditors as well as risks  identified in the ex-ante, ex post controls and  evaluations. The status of these recommendations  is communicated twice (mid-term review and Annual  Activity Report).  ENISA did not perform any change in relation to these  processes in the reporting year.  Principle 17: ENISA assesses and communicates  internal control deficiencies in a timely manner  to those parties responsible for taking corrective  action, including senior management as  appropriate  Internal control deficiencies identified are  communicated to the parties responsible and to  the Management team. Mitigation measures are  addressed immediately. They are planned and have  a date for implementation. The Agency follows up  closely these deadlines as well as the result of the  mitigation measures proposed.  2 CONCLUSIONS OF ASSESSMENT OF  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  ENISA carried out an internal controls assessment  exercise late 2019 which concluded that the  structures supporting internal controls and  compliance appear to be spread out and hence weak.  The report for a dedicated task force that carried  Issued by the dedicated task force who carried  out such assessment, the report suggests the  implementation of  an independent quality control  system to reinforce the monitoring of performance  assessment. The task force also advised to  restructure  horizontal tasks such as internal controls,  ex ante verification, ISO, budget monitoring and  quality controls.  Those issues were addressed through the  reorganisation and overhaul of internal processes  undertaken in 2020 and in force as of 01.01.2021. The  improvements will be assessed at the next mid-term  review of the Agency.  3 STATEMENT OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL COORDINATOR IN CHARGE  OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL  CONTROL  I, the undersigned,  manager in charge of risk management and internal  control within the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA),  in my capacity as manager in charge of risk  management and internal control, declare that, in  2020 risk management and internal controls was  responsibility of the Resources Department and this  area was identified in problem analysis that led to  reorganisation of ENISA in 2020. In accordance with  ENISA’s internal control framework, I have reported  my advice and recommendations on the overall state  of internal control in the agency to the executive  director.  I hereby certify that the information provided in the  present consolidated annual activity report and in its  annexes is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate,  reliable and complete.  Athens, 30 June 2021  Ingrida TAURINA  Head of Executive Director's Office  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 71  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  72  IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 73  1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The declaration of assurance, provided by the  authorising officer, is mainly based on the following  three pillars:  1.  regular monitoring of the KPIs set for operational,  administrative and financial tasks through the  formal periodical management reporting;  2.  effectiveness of the internal controls and  processes to detect weaknesses and to identify  areas for improvement;  3.  assessment and reports from independent bodies  (external evaluators, financial auditors (ECA,  complemented by a private audit firm), internal  auditors (IAS), etc.).  As highlighted in the previous sections, by the  operational, administrative and financial KPIs, and  by the positive opinion of the ECA on the reliability  of the accounts and on the legality and regularity of  the transactions underlying the accounts, and as no  critical observations have been formulated by the IAS,  management has sufficient assurance that ENISA is  adequately managed so as to safeguard its financial  resources and to pursue the tasks with which it has  been entrusted.  The management declares having sufficient  assurance that ENISA is adequately managed so as to  safeguard its financial resources and to pursue the  tasks it was entrusted with in 2020.  This assurance is substantiated by the operational,  administrative and financial KPIs, and by the positive  opinion of the ECA on the reliability of the accounts  and on the legality and regularity of the transactions  underlying the accounts. This assurance is further  justified considering that the IAS did not formulate  new critical observations.  2 RESERVATIONS  Considering the results of the 2020 annual audits  performed by the ECA and the IAS, the 2020 results  of the internal controls (ex post controls and review  of the register of exceptions) and the 2020 results  of the key financial and operational indicators, the  authorising officer can conclude that ENISA operated  in 2020 in such a way as to manage appropriately the  risks to a large extent.  However, the internal controls and compliance  framework applied by the organisation and  which to a large extent (except for some urgent  modifications in 2020) existed until 31.12.2020,  also demonstrated weaknesses, in particular in  relation to the unauthorised use of financial rights  by staff members in early 2020. Though this incident  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  74  represents a breach of trust from the point of view of  the authorising officer (Executive Director), it was the  inability of internal controls framework to: (1) stop  the unauthorised use of the European Commission's  corporate financial management system ABAC; (2)  restrict the use of financial delegation without prior  acceptance of such delegation; and (3) notify the  authorising officer on such infringements; which  gave rise to the outlined reservations. Though  actions were taken, foremost in the framework of the  reorganisation in 2020, to address deficiencies and  ensure more efficient and effective management of  risks, the performance of the internal controls in 2020  was not fully in line with the required standards.  Nevertheless, and after undertaking additional  steps in 2020, the authorising officer has reasonable  assurance that the allocated resources were used for  their intended purposes, in compliance with the legal  framework and in accordance with the principle of  sound financial management.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 75  PART IV. Management assurance  76  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2020 77  I, the undersigned,  Juhan LEPASSAAR,  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair (43) view of the state of the  agency’s affairs, and state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities  described in this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of  sound financial management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees  concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year  of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the agency.  Athens,  Juhan LEPASSAAR  Executive Director  43 True and fair in this context means reliable, complete and accurate.

Human resources statistics  On 31 December 2020, the agency had a total of 79 statutory staff in-house (45).  Most represented nationality (46) 2015 2020  Number  % Number  %  Greek 18 (out of 63) 28.6 31 (out of 79) 39.2  Looking back in 2019 and 2020 positive measures to improve the diversity of nationalities included broad  outreach campaigns on popular media across the European Union, closer consideration on the nationality spread  in relation to competencies requested, and specific provisions on the vacancy notices have been continued.  45 The data does not include the additional 9 AD appointments as per footnote 15. 46 The imbalance in the most represented nationality at ENISA is related to several factors, such as the level of posts and related salaries,  which may be perceived as less appealing for job seekers from relatively more advanced Member State economies; the fact that  ENISA is considered to offer better working conditions than the average conditions offered in the Greek job market; the small job  market in Greece for cybersecurity professionals; and historical decisions taken by previous Appointing Authority powers delegated  to the Executive Director (AIPNs). Other reasons that may be cited are the need for stability during the start-up phase of the Agency,  with staff members from the hosting Member State (Greece) being less likely to resign (resulting in lower turnover), which, because of  the relatively young age of the Agency, is still having an impact; the relatively better academic profile of Greek candidates applying for  lower level posts; the relatively smaller payroll cost for Greek staff who are better qualified than average and who do not require an  expatriation allowance; and the general tendency for people to remain in lower level positions in the home country.

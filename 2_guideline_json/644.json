For an  agency that deals with the ever-changing world of cyber  security, however, success will always be determined by  how we manage future challenges, rather than how we  performed in the past.  Information technology now supports every aspect of  our modern lives, and the borders between the virtual  and real worlds are dissolving, as new technologies,  services and business models push existing concepts  and regulation to their limits. The organisational  structures and physical barriers that ensured security  in the past are now being tested, and in some cases,  breached by cyber threats that are continually evolving.  Dealing with these challenges requires cooperation  between everyone involved with the cyber world – the  IT industry, policy makers, politicians and, not least,  citizens. In 2012, ENISA focused on ways to strengthen  cyber cooperation across all sectors. This cooperation  includes coordination throughout Europe as well as  worldwide in both the public and private sectors.  Our starting point was to ask ourselves: what are  the next steps for building stronger bridges and  establishing common ground amidst the ever-evolving  cyber scenarios? In responding to destructive digital  attacks, what are the new challenges for EU institutions,  the private sector and citizens?  Providing answers to these questions in 2012 has been  challenging yet rewarding. One of the highlights in 2012  was ENISA’s successful management of Europe’s biggest  ever cyber security exercise, Cyber Europe 2012. The  exercise involved all EU Member States and countries  from the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) as well as  private sector organisations (a fi rst for Europe). We also  responded swiftly and professionally to Member States’  requests for assistance, through ENISA’s Athens-based  mobile team.  In terms of the development  of ENISA’s activities, the  Agency took up a formal  role in Europe’s Cyber Incident  Reporting framework, under Article 13a of the  EU’s Telecommunications Framework Regulation, and  assisted with the setup of new Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) in Malta, Romania, Cyprus and  Ireland, while providing ongoing support to established  teams. ENISA was also closely involved in the CERT-EU  pre-confi guration team, and, in cooperation with the  European Commission, organised the pilot for the fi rst  ever European Cyber Security Month, with activities  across eight European countries throughout October.  In addition, the agency continued to strengthen its  collaboration with Europol, part of which has included  having a member on the board of the new European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague.  This year has also seen the new ENISA Regulation  progressing towards the fi nal stages of approval within  the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  We look forward to a new mandate for ENISA, so that  the Agency can proactively and effi  ciently support the  Member States.  Although there is still a signifi cant amount of work  to be done to achieve the vision of a harmonised  approach to cyber security across the EU, it is clear that  great progress has been made in collaborating across  communities and across national boundaries.  In this new inter-dependent world we must act as one,  and develop a cohesive online ethos: the next chapters  of cyber security depend on it. It is crucial that the  Internet is safeguarded as an arena for commercial,  governmental, cultural and leisure activity. Therefore  all eff orts and strategies dedicated to securing Europe’s  cyber cooperation must remain coherent, consistent  and unifi ed.  I hope that you fi nd our 2012 General Report useful and  informative.

Such  technologies present us, however, with a double- edged sword: greater bene its invariably come with  new threats. All of us depend inextricably on cyber- space, yet very few of us are in a position to fully  appreciate the magnitude of damaging activity that  occurs online every day.  The number and sophistication of cyber-attacks  affecting public and private information systems  has increased dramatically over the past year, and is  expected to continue to grow at a fast pace. Moreover,  in today’s world, geographically separated societies  are interconnected by information technology – and  are irreversibly dependent on it. New threats thus  re lect the global nature of the systems they target  and their mitigation often requires international  collaboration. The propagation and implications of  threats such as malware (and botnets in particular)  mean they are no longer just an issue for individuals,  but are increasingly a social and civic responsibility  that affects all sectors of our digital society. VIRTUAL VS. REAL:  BORDERS BLUR  The borders between virtual and real worlds are  dissolving. New technologies, services and business  models push existing concepts and regulation to  their limits. The organisational structures and physical  barriers that have stood for centuries are being severely  put to the test by cyber threats that are continually  evolving. Even national borders may hinder us more  than protect us against challenges which are global  in nature and which require responses that are  coordinated across sectors, organisations and national  borders. The leading role that information technologies  play in modern society has made cyber security  essential to the worldwide economy. Moreover, the EU’s  competitiveness and prosperity are closely connected  to the safety and security of critical infrastructures.  Hence, we need to cooperate closely in order to ensure  that the EU as a whole is equipped with appropriate  protection and defence mechanisms, including an  overview of major cyber incidents.  “The organisational structures  and physical barriers that have  stood for centuries are being  severely put to the test by cyber  threats that are continually  evolving.”  INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION  TECHNOLOGIES (ICT): A “DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD”  INTRODUCTION  7  THE DIGITAL AGENDA European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes has  put forward the Digital Agenda for Europe, with the  objective of improving citizens’ quality of life through,  for example, better healthcare, safer and more effi  cient  transport solutions, a cleaner environment, new media  opportunities and easier access to public services  and cultural content.1 This is a major step towards the  creation of the Digital Society. Cyber-attacks, however,  complicate the deployment of ICT solutions used by  citizens in their day-to-day lives, such as online payment  and e-government services. According to the Special  Eurobarometer 390 on Cyber Security (published in July  2012), 29% of EU citizens do not feel confi dent in using  the Internet for banking or purchases and 12% said they  had already fallen victim to online fraud.2 Moreover, the  Special Eurobarometer 371 on Internal Security found  that eight out of ten Europeans consider cybercrime to  be an important challenge to EU security.3  THE IMPORTANCE  OF CROSS-BORDER  COOPERATION  Any future approach to securing Europe’s ICT systems  must be coherent across geographical borders and  pursued with consistency over time. This is not yet the  case, as approaches vary in diff erent Member States and  communities. Without a coordinated global strategy for  combatting major incidents on the Internet, Member  States could fi nd themselves in a situation where local  systems cannot function eff ectively because of issues  that are beyond their control. The EU institutions and  bodies play an important role in improving cyber  security by providing support for collaboration and  a policy framework for Member States to achieve a  coordinated global approach.  1  1 COM(2010) 245 fi nal/2  2  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_390_en.pdf  3  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_371_en.pdf  ENISA’S ROLE Since its launch in 2004, ENISA has endeavoured to  build bridges between communities by promoting  cooperation across the EU and beyond. The Agency  has successfully done so through activities such as  supporting the CERT community (including the newly  formed EU CERT), organising the Cyber Europe and  Cyber Atlantic exercises, assisting the Member States  in implementing the requirements of security breach  notifi cation legislation, responding quickly and  effi  ciently to Member States’ requests for Assistance  through ENISA’s Athens-based Mobile Assistance  Team (MAT) and in helping to establish new Computer  Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Malta, Romania,  Cyprus and Ireland. ENISA aims to support communities  that are striving to improve the level of EU cyber security,  by improving the resilience of critical information  infrastructures and services, in both the public and  private sectors.  There are a number of areas where the current  approach to improving cyber security in the EU could  sensibly be extended. For example, there is a clear  need to collect and analyse data relating to information  security in a cross-border context which could reveal  trends that are not visible at present. This is already  under way with cyber incident reporting under Article  13a of the EU’s Telecommunications directive4, but  there is scope for this to be done across more areas.  In addition, a new ENISA Regulation is progressing  towards its fi nal stages within the European Parliament  and the Council of Ministers. The coming into force of  the Lisbon Treaty off ers an unparalleled opportunity to  improve the level of dialogue between communities  in the area of Network and Information Security.  A proactive approach to building these new cross-  border communities will bring great benefi ts, both in  terms of eff ectiveness of approach and effi  ciency in the  use of resources.  At a time in which the importance of cyber security is  recognised by all, it is important that eff orts to protect  and facilitate the development and prosperity of the  European Information Society do not lose momentum.  We need to prepare for a range of security-related  incidents that threaten large-scale disruption. ENISA  is assisting the Commission and the Member States  in identifying and preparing for such incidents and is  4  Telecommunications Regulatory Package (article 13a. amended  Directive 2002/21/EC Framework Directive) http://www.enisa.  europa.eu/media/news-items/agency-initiative-to-implement-  art.-13-of-telecom-package  INTRODUCTION  8  actively collaborating with a wide-range of stakeholder  communities as part of this eff ort. It is important that  ENISA is fully supported and further developed so that  the Agency can continue to respond to these challenges  and provide support and expertise to stakeholders  across Europe.  ABOUT ENISA The European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for Network  and Information Security (NIS). ENISA bridges the gap  between citizens, industry and governments by acting  as a knowledge broker in NIS matters and as a promoter  of good NIS practices within EU Member States.  ENISA is a de-centralised agency of the European Union.  It was established in 2004 and is based in Heraklion,  Greece with a branch offi  ce in Athens.  ENISA’s objectives are to:  • Secure Europe’s information infrastructure  • Promote information security standards,  guidelines and certifi cation schemes  • Educate the wider public on ICT  The main contributions of ENISA to enhancing cyber  security are in the following areas:  • Identifi cation and analysis of emerging trends and  threats  • Awareness of network and information security  risks and challenges  • Early warning and response  • Critical information infrastructure protection  • Adequate and consistent policy implementation  • Supporting other community actors in actions  against cybercrime  • International cooperation  • Information exchange  • Building communities  INTRODUCTION  9  EU AGENCIES  From Helsinki to Crete and from Lisbon to Vilnius,  specialised agencies have been established to  carry out specifi c legal, technical or scientifi c  tasks within the European Union. The agencies  were set up to help implement EU policies more  effi  ciently, and to respond to particular needs  identifi ed by the EU institutions and Member  States. They provide advice, facilitate exchanges  of best practice among Member States, and  support consensus-building through networks  and exchanges. All agencies work in the public  interest, and as they are spread throughout  the EU, they can facilitate outreach to EU  citizens. The EU agencies are involved in varied  activities: safeguarding freedom, justice and  security; improving health, safety and the  environment; supporting education, business  and innovation; and developing transport and  satellite infrastructure. Today the agencies play  a key role in implementing EU policies and are  making a valuable contribution to the EU 2020  strategic objectives.  In 2012, ENISA published numerous reports and  studies on a range of NIS issues, including:  • Minimum security measures and reporting  incidents  • Cyber incident reporting in the EU  • Assessing cloud computing security risks  • Minimum security requirements for smart grids  • Protecting Industrial Control Systems  • National cyber security strategies  • Incentives and barriers in the cyber insurance  market in Europe  • National and international cyber security exercises  • Good practice for national cyber contingency  plans  • Cyber exercise scenario modelling  • Cooperation between n/g CERTs and other  stakeholders  • Proactive detection of security incidents using  honeypots  • The right to be forgotten  • Privacy considerations of online behavioural  tracking  • ICT supply chain risks and challenges  • Electronic identifi cation and trusted services for  electronic transactions  • Consumerization of IT  • Involving intermediaries in cyber security  awareness raising  • Collaborative solutions for Network Information  Security in education  ENISA co-organises conferences, runs workshops and  publishes position papers.  As a European agency, ENISA is uniquely positioned to  bring together a wide range of key players in network  and information security, by acting as a neutral and  independent adviser. With its technical expertise, its  central position and its independence, the Agency is  well placed to provide expert advice on current issues, as  well as ring the alarm bells on emerging and future risks.  ENISA OPERATIONAL  ACTIVITIES  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  12  CRITICAL INFORMATION  INFRASTRUCTURE  PROTECTION (CIIP) AND  RESILIENCE Reliable communications networks and services are  now critical to public welfare and economic stability.  Attacks on the Internet, disruptions due to physical  phenomena, software and hardware failures, and  human error all aff ect the proper functioning of public  e-communications networks. Such disruptions reveal  the increased dependence of our society on these  networks and their services. Moreover, experience  has shown that neither single providers nor a country  alone can eff ectively detect, prevent and respond to  threats. Offi  cial Communications from the European  Commission have highlighted the importance of  network and information security and resilience for the  creation of a single European information space. They  have stressed the importance of dialogue, partnership  and the empowerment of all stakeholders to properly  address these threats. Fully recognising this need,  ENISA is engaged in several activities with the ultimate  objective of collectively evaluating and improving the  resilience of public e-communication networks and  services in Europe.  For 2012, the Resilience activities and tasks were defi ned  within the ENISA Work Programme 2012 – Improving  Information Security Through Collaboration. The  Resilience activities were included within Work Stream  (WS) 2: Improving Pan-European CIIP & Resilience  and Work Stream (WS) 3: Supporting the CERT and  other Operational Communities. The work packages  dedicated to Resilience were Work Package (WPK) 2.1:  Further Securing EU’s Critical Information Infrastructure  and Services; Work Package (WPK) 2.2: Cyber Exercises;  Work Package (WPK) 2.3: European Public Private  Partnership for Resilience (EP3R); and Work Package  (WPK) 2.4: Implementing article 13a.  Article 13a: Incident reporting and  security measures in the electronic  communications sector  The 2009 reform of the EU Regulatory Framework for  electronic communications added Article 13a to the  Framework Directive. Article 13a requires operators to  take technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of networks and services, as  well as to report security incidents to competent National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). Article 13a asks NRAs in turn  to send an annual report to the European Commission and  ENISA that summarises the reported incidents.  In 2010, ENISA formed a working group to work together  with NRAs to achieve a harmonised implementation of  Article 13a across the EU and to establish a process for  reporting incidents to the European Commission and  ENISA. In 2011, the Article 13a Working Group agreed  on two technical guidelines, a Technical Guideline for  Minimum Security Measures and a Technical Guideline  on Reporting Incidents.  In 2012, NRAs reported on the 2011 security incidents  to the European Commission and ENISA, and later  that year ENISA published a summary and aggregate  analysis of the incidents in 2011 that were reported to  regulators across the EU. This marked the fi rst time that  security incidents from across the EU were collected and  analysed. ENISA also took a snapshot of existing and  future EU legislation on security measures and incident  reporting. In its fi ndings, published in Cyber Incident  Reporting in the EU, ENISA underlined the important  steps that have been taken, but also pointed out gaps  and the fact that most security incidents fall outside  the scope of incident reporting legislation and are not  reported to authorities. ENISA is currently completing  the creation of an online incident reporting tool for  reporting security incidents.  The Annual Incident Reports 2011 is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-  and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-  incident-reports-2011  The report Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU is  available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  Resil ience -and- CIIP/Incidents-repor ting/c yber-  incident-reporting-in-the-eu  The Technical Guideline for Minimum Security  Measures is available at:  h t t p : / / w w w . e n i s a . e u r o p a . e u / a c t i v i t i e s /  R e s i l i e n c e - a n d - C I I P/ I n c i d e n t s - r e p o r t i n g /  m i n i m u m - s e c u r i t y - r e q u i r e m e n t s /c o p y _ o f _  minimum-security-requirements/technical-guideline-  on-minimum-security-measures  “…experience has shown that  neither single providers nor a  country alone can eff ectively detect,  prevent and respond to threats.”  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  13  The Technical Guideline on Reporting Incidents is  available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-  CIIP/Incidents-reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20  on%20Incident%20Reporting/incidents-reporting-to-  enisa/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting  Cloud computing: from individual  contracts to EU governance  In 2009, when cloud computing was still a relatively  new concept, ENISA published Cloud Computing  Security Risk Assessment, an assessment of the risks  and opportunities for SMEs considering adopting  cloud computing. The risk assessment became one of  the most widely quoted papers on cloud computing  security. In the paper, ENISA stressed the enormous  potential of cloud computing, particularly in terms of  security. Cloud computing allows diff erent customers  to join forces and in this way, with little investment, get  access to state-of-the-art technology and resources,  such as a 24/7 security team, a thorough software  development process with extensive security testing,  or geographically redundant data centres.  In a cloud computing environment, the work of the  organisation’s IT offi  cer changes as well: instead of  setting up hardware and installing software, IT offi  cers in  a cloud computing environment have to manage service  contracts with IT service providers. In December 2011,  ENISA surveyed IT offi  cers across the EU’s public sector  to analyse security parameters in cloud Service Level  Agreements (SLAs). The cloud SLA survey showed that  many key aspects of service delivery are not adequately  monitored by customers and that as a result customers  may fi nd out about issues too late. To remedy this  situation, in 2012 ENISA published a guide on monitoring  key security parameters in cloud service contracts.  With many private and public sector organisations  switching to cloud computing, IT resources are no  longer distributed across a large number of remote  locations but instead concentrated in a few large data  centres. From a security perspective this concentration  is a ‘double edged sword’. On the plus side, large  cloud providers can deploy state of the art security  and business continuity measures and spread the  associated costs across many customers. On the minus  side, if an outage or a security breach occurs then the  consequences could be more widespread, aff ecting a  large amount of data, many organisations and a large  number of citizens. In 2012, ENISA fi nalised an analysis  of the key security issues to consider from a national  and CIIP perspective regarding the uptake of cloud  computing. That year, ENISA also examined cloud  computing from a national CIIP perspective and began  work on an update of the 2009 cloud computing risk  assessment for small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs). Both documents are open for consultation and  they are currently being validated by a working group  of cloud computing experts from industry and the  public sector.  Towards the end of 2012 the European Commission  worked on two initiatives which will have an important  bearing on ENISA’s future work in the area of cloud  computing. First of all, the Commission issued a cloud  computing strategy that would have ENISA work with  the European Telecommunications Standards Institute  (ETSI). The two institutions would map the standards  relevant to the security and privacy of cloud computing  services, and take stock of existing security governance  and auditing schemes that could be used for governing  cloud computing services. Secondly, the European  Commission is working on a cyber security strategy that  will focus on critical services including cloud services.  The report Cloud Computing Security Risk  Assessment is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/  fi les/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  The report Procure Secure: A guide to monitoring of  security service levels in cloud contracts is available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-  CIIP/cloud-computing/procure-secure-a-guide-to-  monitoring-of-security-service-levels-in-cloud-contracts  “From a security perspective, the  concentration of IT resources in a  few large data centres is a ‘double  edged sword’.”  centre  is a ‘d  cloud  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  14  Emergency Communications  Crisis events like the terrorist attacks in New York,  London, Madrid, and Mumbai, industrial accidents  like the ones that happened in Enschede or Toulouse,  and natural disasters such as the Elbe fl oods in Saxony,  the Tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and Japan, and the  Katrina and Sandy storms in the US, have highlighted  the importance of maintaining communications during  emergencies. Crisis managers need to maintain an  accurate picture of the current situation, effi  ciently  deploy and command the available resources and relay  important information to the public.  A common observation in the analyses made after  some of the above disasters is that communications  were often a weakness in the response operations. In  many cases, communications networks failed or were  overloaded. One of the needs identifi ed during the  studies covering technical and economic aspects of  the underlying communications infrastructure in 2010  (Inter-X: Resilience of the Internet Interconnection  Ecosystem) and 2011 (Resilience of Interconnections)  was the need for a broad understanding of current  communication practices used during a crisis.  ENISA addressed this key topic in 2012 by taking stock of  existing practices in this area. The goal was to understand  the mechanisms, policies and legal frameworks used  in Europe and in selected third countries to facilitate  emergency communication including voice and data  (wireless, wired, and satellite) during a crisis. The  study used a comprehensive methodology of primary  research and interviews with relevant stakeholders in  the regulatory, service provision and crisis response  sectors. On the basis of the report fi ndings, three key  objectives were identifi ed:  • Develop improved inter-agency crisis  communications technology and procedures  • Defi ne standards in crisis communications  technology and procedures  • Encourage the uptake of data services in  emergency communications, particularly in the  area of public interaction  A series of recommendations have been made to  Member State Governments, Competent Authorities,  Service Providers and the Institutions of the European  Union.  Securing European Smart Grids  The smart grid can be defi ned as an upgraded electricity  network to which two-way digital communication  between supplier and consumer, intelligent metering  and monitoring systems have been added. Smart grids  will be able to effi  ciently integrate the behaviour and  actions of all users connected to them — generators,  consumers and those that do both — in order to  ensure an economically effi  cient, sustainable power  system with low losses and a supply that is safe, secure  and of high quality. Information and Communication  Technologies (ICT) are the platform underpinning smart  grids.  Achieving a secure smart grid will not be an easy task.  Assessing risks, securing processes as well as identifying  technological gaps and organisational problems are  some of the main challenges that the smart grid will face  in the years to come. Recognising the importance of  Smart Grids for the functioning of the EU economy and  society, ENISA has launched a series of new activities or  actively participated in existing ones.  The Agency has published two relevant studies and  is conducting another one on the Minimum security  requirements for smart grids. The studies recommend  that the European Commission and Member States  take measures such as bolstering research in smart grid  cyber security, improving the regulatory and policy  framework, fostering awareness raising, training and  test bed initiatives and promoting the development of  security certifi cation schemes for the components and  products of smart grid infrastructure.  Apart from these activities, ENISA has taken the fi rst  steps towards defi ning a common model for the  security and resilience of smart grids. Such a model  would be used by regulators and operators, or by other  stakeholders.

ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  15  National Cyber Security Strategies:  Practical Guide on development and  execution  Cooperation at the pan-European level is necessary to  eff ectively prepare for and respond to cyber-attacks.  Comprehensive national cyber security strategies are  the fi rst step in this direction. In 2012, ENISA published  a practical guide that identifi es the most common  elements and practices of National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS), in the EU and non-EU countries. The  guide also proposes a national cyber security strategy  lifecycle, with a special emphasis on the development  and execution phase. For each component of the  strategy a list of possible KPIs is described. The report  includes specifi c recommendations for policymakers.  The report on National Cyber Security Strategies  is available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-  ncsss/cyber-security-strategies-paper  Incentives and barriers in the cyber  insurance market in Europe  Cyber-insurance has captured the imagination of many  involved in cyber-security at the policy and research  level as a means of transferring cyber security-related  fi nancial risks to third parties. The coverage in traditional  insurance policies may not fully address the risks faced  by an organisation that is part of the digital economy.  To address this gap, ENISA has conducted a study to  identify what may be inhibiting the cyber-insurance  market and ways to kick start its development.  The report on Incentives and barriers of the cyber  insurance market in Europe is available at: http://  www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/  national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/incentives-  and-barriers-of-the-cyber-insurance-market-in-europe  Cyber crises exercises and  cooperation  Cyber Europe 2012  On 4 October 2012, nearly 600 cyber-  security professionals across Europe participated  in Cyber Europe 2012, the second pan-European Cyber  Exercise. The exercise built on extensive activities at  both the national and European level to improve the  resilience of critical information infrastructures. Cyber  Europe 2012 was a milestone in the eff orts to strengthen  cyber-crisis cooperation, preparedness and response  across Europe.  Cyber Europe 2012 had three objectives:  1. Test the eff ectiveness and scalability of mechanisms,  procedures and information fl ow for public  authorities’ cooperation in Europe.  2. Explore the cooperation between public and private  stakeholders in Europe.  3. Identify gaps and challenges to see how large-scale  cyber-incidents can be handled more eff ectively in  Europe.  Twenty-nine EU Member States and EFTA countries  were involved in the exercise of which 25 countries  participated actively in the exercise, while four countries  were involved as observers. Overall, 571 individuals from  339 organisations – including several EU institutions –  participated. Following up on a key recommendation  of Cyber Europe 2010, the private sector took part in  this exercise. Cooperation between public and private  players took place at the national level, while public  authorities also cooperated across borders.  In 2013, ENISA plans to initiate discussions with the EU  Member States on the future objectives and scope of  the upcoming Pan-European Cyber Exercise, Cyber  Europe 2014.  The exercise report is available upon request.  icipated  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  16  Status report on national and  international CIIP Exercises  Cyber exercises are an important tool for assessing  the preparedness of a community against cyber  crises, technology failures and critical information  infrastructure incidents. ENISA supports the  stakeholders involved in EU cyber exercises.  This report aims to support European and international  bodies involved in cyber exercises with lessons  learned from cyber exercises. The report presents the  results of research and analysis conducted by ENISA  in 2012. ENISA examined 85 exercises covering the  period between 2002 and 2012. In total, 84 countries  worldwide participated in the multinational exercises  analysed in this report. A total of 22 European countries  have conducted national cyber-exercises over the past  several years. In 2013, ENISA will follow-up with a 2nd  International Conference on Cyber Crisis Exercises and  Cooperation.  The report on National and International  Cyber Security Exercises: Survey, Analysis and  Recommendations is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-  CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-exercises/exercise-  survey2012  Cyber exercises in Europe  The results of several cyber exercises in Europe – Cyber  Europe 2010 and 2012, and Cyber Atlantic 20115 – have  confi rmed the need for and signifi cance of cyber-  crisis cooperation.6 Other eff orts such as the European  Cyber Crisis Cooperation Framework (ECCCF) and the  European Standard Operating Procedures for cross-  country cyber-crisis mitigation (EU-SOPs)7 are currently  under development by Member States. This ENISA  report covers current and past eff orts in the area of  cyber exercises. It provides an overview of the role and  objectives of cyber exercises, potential stakeholders,  international and regional cooperation and a summary  of the exercises themselves. It complements the results  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-  crisis-cooperation/cyber-atlantic/cyber-atlantic-2011.  6  Cyber Europe 2010 Final Report (2010), http://www.enisa.europa.  eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-  europe/ce2010/ce2010report  7  The ECCCF report and the draft EU-SOPs are both available at  ENISA’s resilience portal at: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/  eu-exercises/sops  and recommendations of the recently published ENISA  report on over 80 cyber exercises.8  The document is available upon request.  ENISA Report on National Contingency  Plans for Critical Information  Infrastructures  National Cyber Contingency Plans (NCPs) are the  interim structures and measures needed to respond  and recover services following major incidents that  involve Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). CIIs,  used synonymously with ‘cyber’ hereafter, are the  Information and Communication Technology systems,  services, networks and other infrastructures, such  as embedded processors and controllers in critical  industries, which form a vital part of the European  economy and society. An NCP helps a nation make its  CII more resilient by establishing a response framework  before incidents occur.  ENISA’s Good Practice Guide on National Cyber  Contingency Plans shows how a nation can plan,  develop, test, improve and maintain a good and well-  functioning NCP for Critical Information Infrastructures.  In 2013, ENISA will follow-up this work with a project  that focuses on a single element of the NCP lifecycle,  National Risk Assessment for Critical Information  Infrastructures.  The Good Practice Guide on National Cyber  Contingency Plans is available upon request.  Regional cyber security exercises:  EuroSOPEx 1 & 2  In 2012, ENISA organised two distributed table-top  regional exercises, called EuroSOPEx, in order to  familiarise Member States with the EU Standard  Operating Procedures (EU-SOPs)9, as part of preparing  for Cyber Europe 2012. The fi rst EuroSOPEx exercise was  organised on 30 May 2012 with Cyprus, Estonia, Greece,  Iceland and Malta. The second EuroSOPEx exercise was  organised on 6 June 2012 with Belgium, Denmark, Ireland,  Italy, Netherlands, Romania, and Spain. In 2013, ENISA will  continue to foster and facilitate regional cyber exercises  by organising two similar EuroSOPEx exercises based on  the specifi c fi ndings of the Cyber Europe 2012 report.  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-  crisis-cooperation/cyber-exercises/exercise-survey2012.  9  Available at ENISA’s resilience portal: https://resilience.enisa.  europa.eu  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  1 7  The EuroSOPEx 1&2 exercise report is available  upon request.  Cyber Exercise Scenario Modelling  (CESMO)  The aim of this work was to identify a model that can  help designers of cyber exercises to develop and model  their scenarios. The report defi nes the basic blocks that  make up cyber incidents such as the type of actor that  initiates and carries out the event, the threats that exist,  or the outcome of a cyber-incident. These basic building  blocks are then connected together in a logical fashion  that clarifi es the dependencies that exist between them.  For example, an incident aff ects a resource; an actor has  a motive. At a high-level, the model represents cyber-  incident scenarios as a sequence of events that can be  combined to form any type of scenario. At a low-level,  the model focuses on two major concepts, incidents  and impact. Incidents may be either intentional, such  as a malicious attack, or unintentional, such as a natural  disaster. Impact comes as the result of an incident and  may have virtual consequences, like loss of data or  privacy, as well as physical consequences, such as loss of  money or life.  To validate the eff ectiveness of the model and modelling  process, six sample scenarios involving cyber incidents  were modelled. In each scenario, the parameters of that  scenario were mapped onto the model, to demonstrate  its fl exibility and capability in representing cyber  incidents. Guidance is given on how the model and  modelling process may be instantiated using a simple  data base system.  Based on the fi ndings of this report, ENISA has developed  a pilot application for creating cyber exercise scenarios.  In 2013, ENISA experts will work on a more advanced  project that will use the existing CESMO prototype as  a starting point.  The report on Cyber Exercise Scenario Modelling is  available upon request.  EP3R - European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience  The European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience  (EP3R) was continued in 2012, to address the three  main areas established by the EP3R Non-Paper (the  memorandum that defi nes the initial establishment of  EP3R) in June 2010:  • Area 1: Key assets, resources and functions for the  continuous and secure provisioning of electronic  communications across countries.10  • Area 2: Baseline requirements for the security and  resilience of electronic communications.11  • Area 3: Coordination and cooperation needs  and mechanisms to prepare for and respond  to large-scale disruptions aff ecting electronic  communications.12  Four working groups were established to address these  areas with area 3 divided specifi cally between exercises  and botnets. Each working group reached a number  of conclusions in June 2012, and prepared for the new  cycle beginning in 2013. In 2012, ENISA also developed  an agile working model together with an enhanced  governance proposal for EP3R, and established task  forces. Task forces are smaller groups of 5-6 experts that  focus solely on 1-2 work packages. Each task force will  deliver their initial conclusions before the end of May  2013, and in June 2013, an EP3R plenary will vote on  each recommendation issued by the task forces.  All the work of EP3R experts (whether working groups  or task forces) is documented on the EP3R web portal13,  along with the EP3R publications to be delivered by the  end of December 2012.  10  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_  docs/ep3r_tor_area1.pdf  11  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_  docs/ep3r_tor_area2.pdf  12  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_  docs/ep3r_tor_area3.pdf  13  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ep3r/  (a login is requested to see this content)  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  18  SUPPORTING CERTS  AND OTHER NIS  COMMUNITIES  National/governmental Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) are responsible for supporting  the management of security incidents for systems and  networks within their country’s borders, as well as for  the protection of critical information infrastructure.  They act as an offi  cial national point of contact for their  counterparts in other Member States.  From the very beginning of ENISA’s existence, the  Agency has provided intensive support to this group  of stakeholders. Our aim is to continuously support the  establishment and operations of CERT teams, as they are  considered by Member States to be an indispensable  means for ensuring the resilience and stability of vital  ICT infrastructure.  Figure 1: national/governmental CERTs in Europe 2012  National/governmental CERTs –  Situation in Europe in 2012  The 2011 Progress Report on the CIIP Action Plan14 noted  that a minimum set of baseline capabilities and related  policy recommendations for a well-functioning network  of national/governmental Computer Emergency  Response Teams (n/g CERTs) in all Member States has  been developed. These developments encompass  preparedness, information sharing, co-ordination and  response. ENISA addressed this topic in detail and  presented a status report in 2012 on the deployment of  baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs in Europe.  14  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:201  1:0163:FIN:EN:PDF  The report describes the current situation in Europe  regarding n/g CERTs’ capabilities, and how they are  deployed. The current situation was assessed according  to four baseline capabilities previously defi ned by  ENISA and accepted by the CERT community.15 As the  report notes, the role of n/g CERTs is usually supported  by an offi  cial mandate. There are many variations  concerning the hosting organisations of n/g CERTs,  however. Several Member States have followed the  trend in creating national cyber-security centres. These  will ultimately be responsible for the implementation of  cyber-security strategies that integrate the functionality  of n/g CERTs. Key constituents such as governmental  bodies receive the complete menu of services, while  a subset of services is available for other constituents,  including end-users. More than 80% of n/g CERTs  employ 6–8 or more full-time equivalents, which is the  minimal staffi  ng level considered necessary to provide  an acceptable level of service.

In particular,  based on our experience to date, we have assisted  several Member States with the process of setting up  an n/g CERT. Our proactive attitude towards brokering  relationships between those Member States with a  particular requirement and those willing to share their  experience helped with this process in Ireland and  Romania this year.  Ireland  The Irish National Cyber Security Centre (INCSC) built on  existing emergency planning in Ireland and is focusing  on protecting the energy, communications and fi nance  sectors. INCSC is itself divided into three sections  covering computer security (CSG), critical national  infrastructure (CNIPF), and incident response (CSIRT-IE).  CSIRT-IE focuses on helping government departments  to protect their ICT infrastructure and data against  attack and misuse.  Romania  CERT-RO16 was established in response to the EU  action calling for n/g CERTs to be established in all  Member States, and was created by a law passed by the  Romanian Parliament in May 2011. The goals of CERT-RO  are to analyse and respond to cyber-security incidents  in Romania, and to develop national IT security policies  16  http://www.cert-ro.eu/index.php?lang=en  and strategies in conjunction with other public bodies. It  also acts as a national contact point for the international  community.  Figure 3: CERTs by Country – n/g CERTs in Ireland and Romania  ENISA’s updated recommendations  on gaps in the baseline capabilities of  national/governmental CERTs  Despite progress in the deployment of baseline  capabilities by n/g CERTs across Europe, there are  still several challenges which need to be addressed  by interested parties such as legislators, CERT teams  themselves, cooperation partners, international  initiatives and – last but not least – ordinary citizens.  That is why in 2012 ENISA presented an updated set of  recommendations on n/g CERTs’ baseline capabilities.  The gaps identifi ed and addressed in the report  are mainly legal and political. There are a number  of actions that need to be taken by policymakers  in the Member States to support n/g CERTs in their  work, especially regarding the protection of critical  information infrastructure and the coordination of  incident handling. This will require the clarifi cation  of n/g CERTs’ mandates, as well as incorporating the  provisions on n/g CERTs into national cyber-security  strategies. More concretely, the n/g CERTs should be  empowered to require the exchange of information  with telecommunication operators, Internet service  providers and law enforcement authorities.  Although the n/g CERTs cannot infl uence many of the  above-mentioned items on their own, they can take  action. For example, in a time of economic crisis and  with a perceived lack of funding for their activities, n/g  CERTs should actively look for additional resources such  as EU funds, consulting engagements with the private  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  20  sector, and research projects. It is also crucial that they  increase their transparency and visibility by publishing  general statistics on incidents and other activities  or by raising awareness of their actions among their  constituencies.

Seventh annual CERT workshop “CERTs  in Europe”  Part I: Technical training for national/ governmental CERTs  Every year ENISA organises the workshop “CERTs  in Europe” for national and governmental CERTs in  Europe. The workshop is one of the most effi  cient and  indispensable tools ENISA has for supporting CERT  teams in their daily work and for continuously improving  their capabilities.  The 7th annual workshop (Part I) took place on 14-15  June 2012 in Valletta, Malta. Last year the workshop  focused on addressing NIS aspects of cybercrime,  particularly the operational and technical aspects of the  collaboration between national/governmental CERTs  and the Law Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) in the EU  Member States. This year, the fi rst part of the workshop  focused on hands-on technical training for national/  governmental CERTs in Europe. ENISA enhanced CERTs’  capabilities in the EU Member States by providing  information on good operational practice and  facilitating suitable training and exercises. Hands-on  training for CERT team members on operational topics  is essential for improving the capabilities of the team as  a whole. ENISA, supported by the well-known Internet  security research fi rm Team Cymru, off ered two days  of deep technical information on topics like botnets  and mobile malware. The workshop was hosted by the  University of Malta.  Part II:  ENISA and EUROPOL joint forces on  fi ght against cybercrime  ENISA and Europol jointly organised the 7th annual  CERT Workshop, Part II, as a follow up event to the very  successful 6th Annual CERT workshop held last year  in Prague, Czech Republic. This year the workshop  was held at the Europol premises in The Hague, The  Netherlands on 16-17 October 2012. The focus remained  on cooperation between national/governmental  CERTs (n/g CERTs) in Europe and their national Law  Enforcement Authority counterparts (LEAs). Out of a  total number of 44 participants 15 represented n/g CERTs  and 12 represented national LEAs (usually the high tech  crime units). The other participants were experts from  industry as well as from international organisations.  Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece,  Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovenia,  Spain, United Kingdom were the EU Member States  that participated along with non-EU countries Norway  and Switzerland. Emphasis was placed on how to  increase the exchange of information on cybercrime  threats as well as cooperation between the n/g CERT  and LEA communities on a practical working level,  both nationally and across borders. There is an urgent  need for these two communities to collaborate because  of their complementary responsibilities. Currently,  however, in many cases this collaboration is very limited  and sometimes even non-existent. The workshop aimed  to identify synergies and gaps and practically address  these obstacles to cooperation. It was also a forum for  discussing the next steps that need to be taken in order  to improve collaboration in the short-term.  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  21  The fi ght against cybercrime  One of the key elements in the fi ght against cybercrime  is cooperation between diff erent actors involved  in this fi ght. While a lot of work has been done in  this area in some Member States, there is still room  for improvement. ENISA, therefore, has focused on  the cooperation between n/g CERTs and their LEA  counterparts.  ENISA started its support for operational collaboration  between CERTs and LEAs in 2010. Various activities,  including the workshops mentioned above, have since  been launched. In addition, in 2012 ENISA published a  Good Practice Guide concerning cooperation between  n/g CERTs and other stakeholders, primarily LEAs within  Europe.  The guide provides a snapshot of ENISAs  support for CERTs and LEAs, and includes good practices  and recommendations for both communities. Fostering  collaboration between CERTs and LEAs is, however, a  process of trust building, tackling obstacles together,  discussion and fi nally working together which will need  time and the active, continuous support of ENISA.  Figure 5: CERT / LEA interests17  CERT exercises – learning by doing  ENISA CERT exercises and training material were  introduced in 2008. In 2012 these were complemented  with new exercise scenarios containing essential  material for success in the CERT community and in  the fi eld of information security. ENISA CERT exercise  material consists of a handbook for teachers, a toolset  for students and a virtual image to support hands-on  training sessions. The complete set of material can be  found at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/  support/exercise  17  Adapted from presentation given at the Octopus Conference  of the Council of Europe Convention Against Cybercrime 21-23  November 2011, Strasbourg  The exercise and training material have been prepared  in great detail so that teachers can, with minimal eff ort,  prepare and conduct high quality training sessions that  are enjoyable for both teachers and students.  The exercise material covers operational, organisational,  and technical areas in the fi eld of CERT activities, and  supports the economically effi  cient training of CERT  teams or any relevant and interested target audience.  The training suite, for example, challenges students to  identify a malware infection inside a mobile device or  in a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  network and proposes the most effi  cient methodologies  for mitigating the incidents. From the management  point of view it off ers a solution for calculating the cost  of information security incidents that have occurred  within an organisation. It also suggests an economically  effi  cient method for mitigating the identifi ed risks  using calculations explained in the exercise “Cost of ICT  incident”  Those who are more interested in understanding  the organisational aspects of running a CERT might  be attracted to exercises that improve and develop  the communication skills and critical thinking in a  CERT team. Exercises such as “Cooperation with Law  Enforcement agencies” and “Assessing and Testing  Communication Channels with CERTs and all their  stakeholders” develop and improve such skills.  The whole exercise suite consists of 23 exercises,  ranging from technical hands-on training to training on  organisational aspects. The exercises meet the needs of  target audiences with diff erent skills and expectations.  The exercises available for immediate use are:  • Triage and basic incident handling  • Incident handling procedure testing  • Recruitment of CERT staff  • Developing CERT infrastructure  • Vulnerability handling  • Writing security advisories  • Network forensics  • Establishing external contacts  • Large-scale incident handling  • Automation in incident handling  • Incident handling in live role playing  • Cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies  • Incident handling during an attack on Critical  Information Infrastructure  • Proactive incident detection  • Cost of ICT incident calculation  • Mobile incident handling  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  22  • Incident handling in the cloud  • Advanced persistent threat incident handling  • CERT participation in incident handling related to  the Article 13a obligations  • CERT participation in incident handling related to  Article 4 obligations  • Assessing and testing communication channels  between CERTs and all their stakeholders  • Social networks used as an attack vector for  targeted attacks  • Honeypots  Investing in training and exercises leads to a win-win  situation in which the CERT team’s skills are improved  and developed further. It may also indicate the gaps  where further training may be needed for improvement  of overall awareness and the security posture.  Honeypots – powerful tools for the  detection of incidents  In order to cope with the increasing number of complex  cyber-attacks, CERTs, the digital fi re brigades, need to  improve their operational capabilities in the proactive  detection of attacks.  The most common approach used by CERTs to handle  security incidents, is to wait for incoming incident  reports, then try to ‘treat’ the eff ects of the attacks but  not necessarily the ‘cause’. In such cases the incident  has already occurred and potentially had an impact on  production environments.  Another approach is possible, however, when dealing  with security incidents, and that is to be proactive  in detecting attacks by using honeypots to collect  attack information. This ‘threat intelligence’ includes  information such as the attack source and attack  technique. It may be used to block further attacks.  Honeypots are ‘digital traps’. They can be a service, an  application, a system or a piece of information whose  sole task is to be probed, attacked, compromised, used  or accessed in any unauthorized way. Honeypots are  core components of Early Warning Systems used in  attack detection.  The Proactive detection of security incidents: Honeypots  study that ENISA ran in 2012 was initiated to investigate  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  23  ‘digital traps’, or honeypot technologies, in-depth. The  goal was to identify technologies that can be used by  CERTs in general and national/governmental (n/g) CERTs  in particular to proactively detect and capture network  attacks directed at their constituencies. The core of  the document is an investigation of existing honeypot  and related technologies, with a focus on open-source  solutions, including online honeypots and sandboxes,  and other early warning systems or initiatives. One  of the study’s fi ndings was that while honeypots are  recognised by CERTs as useful tools that can be utilised  to detect and study attacks, their usage in the CERT  community is not as widespread as would be expected.  This implies that barriers exist to their deployment.  The Proactive detection of security incidents:  Honeypots study is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/  proactive-detection-of-security-incidents-II-honeypots  EISAS Pilot: a collaborative approach to  reach out to EU citizens and small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  No fi rewall or security policy can effi  ciently protect  users if they are not suffi  ciently aware of the risks they  are facing. As European Commissioner Neelie Kroes has  said, “Cyber security is also about ensuring ordinary  computer users are ‘Web Wise’”.  Introduced by the European Commission in 2006, EISAS,  the European Information Sharing and Alert System,  aims to enhance the cooperation of Member States in  reaching out to citizens and small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) with relevant security information.  This year ENISA ran the EISAS Pilot project. National/  governmental CERTs and other communities in  Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Norway, Spain and Poland  participated in a collaborative cross-border awareness  raising eff ort. Innovative awareness raising materials  were obtained from major public and private actors  at a national level. An international team was set up to  process and adapt the materials to the particularities of  each stakeholder’s population. These materials were  then disseminated to EU citizens and SMEs through  social networks and other communication channels.  In due course, this large-scale pilot reached more  than 1,700 people. Citizens and SMEs across Europe  were empowered with security knowledge to protect  themselves against some of today’s most critical cyber  threats. However, the achievement of this pilot project  goes beyond raising citizens’ awareness; it also shows  that European collaboration in awareness raising works  and off ers a cost-eff ective solution to better prepare EU  citizens facing ever-evolving cyber threats.  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  24  SECURE SERVICES  The work performed within the framework of Secure  Services includes areas of privacy and trust, security  governance and electronic identities/trust services.  Projects in the area of privacy and trust started in 2010  and were very well received by many stakeholders,  which led to the extension of this topic in the following  years. The Agency performed numerous studies on  topics such as trustmarks, the right to be forgotten,  and behavioural tracking. At the same time, ENISA  continued its work on the implementation of the data  breach notifi cation obligation in the EU, becoming a  centre of expertise in this area.  For 2012, the Secure Services activities and tasks are  defi ned within the ENISA Work Programme 2012 –  Improving Information Security Through Collaboration.  The activities are included within Work Stream (WS)  4: Securing the Digital Economy. The work packages  dedicated to Secure Services are Work Package WPK  4.2: Secure governance; and WP 4.3: Supporting the  development of secure, interoperable services.  Privacy and trust  Trustmarks  As online users, we increasingly face the decision of  whether or not to trust specifi c applications or services.  One way we deal with this situation is by taking  decisions based on recommendations made by our  family, friends, colleagues or other trusted sources. In  addition, an increasing number of trust indicators, such  as trustmarks and seals, are becoming available to assist  us in our decision-making. These labels are issued by  national, international or commercial bodies, most of  which use standardised methodologies for assessing  and certifying products, processes, or persons. The EU  data protection legislation framework is also under  revision and further work is being carried out in the  area of privacy seals by bodies such as the European  Commission’s Directorate General for Justice (DG  JUST) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). This work  complements that of other initiatives and provides  a good starting point for further work by other  stakeholders.  Deliverable: Developing recommendations for an EU  approach on certifi cation schemes. Identifying criteria  and certifi cation levels for trustmarks – delayed, due to  postponement of the EC project on seals.  The right to be forgotten  The right to be forgotten is included in the proposed  Regulation on data protection published by the  European Commission in January 2012. The Regulation  remains to be adopted by the European Parliament  before entering into force. The diff erent legal aspects of  the right to be forgotten, such as the right to erasure  or the right to oblivion, have been debated in diff erent  contexts and are beyond the scope of this paper.  Instead, with this paper we focus on the technical  means to enforce or support the right to be forgotten  in information systems. The paper shows that there are  technical limitations as well as the need to clearly defi ne  terminology and legal aspects.  The report The Right to be forgotten - between  expectations and practice is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/the-right-to-be-forgotten  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  25  Privacy considerations of online  behavioural tracking  Internet users are being increasingly tracked and  profi led and their personal data are used extensively as  currency in exchange for services. It is important that  this new reality is better understood by all stakeholders  in order to support and respect the right to privacy.  The report Privacy considerations of online  behavioural tracking is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/privacy-considerations-of-  online-behavioural-tracking  Annual Privacy Forum 2012  Privacy is an area that is multidisciplinary by its  nature. Regulations, legal frameworks, technology,  user adoption, and economic considerations are all  necessary for elevating privacy to the status of an  accepted societal norm. A crucial element of individual  protection and autonomy is also individuals’ ability  to understand and act on their context, assisted by  appropriate and intuitive tools.  Against this backdrop, the fi rst Annual Privacy Forum  (APF’12) was held in Limassol, Cyprus from 10-11  October 2012. The Forum was co-organised by ENISA  and the European Commission’s Directorate General for  Communications Networks, Content and Technology  (DG CONNECT), with the support of the Department  of Computer Science of the University of Cyprus.  APF’12 was endorsed as an offi  cial event of the Cyprus  Presidency of the Council of the European Union. At the  Forum, 20 papers were presented and four technical  sessions and three panel sessions were held. In addition,  keynote speakers representing the Council Presidency,  the European Commission, industry and research  participated in the event. APF’2012 was attended by  71 researchers, academics, industry representatives  and policy makers from 12 countries (including several  non-EU countries), exceeding the objectives set.  Moreover, the Forum website has had more than 1,000  visitors, over 1,700 visits and over 5,500 page views.  The main objective of the Commission and ENISA is for the  Forum to evolve into an annual event that will foster dialogue  between the policy, research and industrial communities,  thus “closing the loop from research to policy”.  The report of the Annual Privacy Forum is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/report-on-annual-privacy-  forum-2012  Security governance  Supply chain integrity  Supply Chain Integrity (SCI) in the ICT industry is a topic  receiving attention from both the public and private  sectors – including vendors, infrastructure owners,  operators, and others – as part of a wider review of supply  chain management. Understanding supply chains is critical  to business success and thus to the economy of nation  states. ENISA focused on supply chain integrity in 2012  with a view to providing guidance to EU Member States.  One of the many aims of this work was to identify what  SCI means in the ICT context and to propose means for  ensuring SCI, primarily by taking the telecommunications  sub-sector as a model for ICT in general.  The report An overview of the ICT supply chain risks  and challenges, and vision for the way forward is  available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/sci  Methodology for severity assessment of  data breaches  In 2011, the Agency developed specifi c technical  recommendations for the implementation of Article 4  of the e-Privacy Directive, these included:  • Criteria for determining when a data breach has occurred  • Identifying and assessing security controls that help  determine when a breach has occurred  • Identifying and assessing the risks regarding data  breaches  • Developing procedures for notifi cation when data  breaches occur, in either the private or public sector  As a continuation of this work, in 2012 ENISA  collaborated very closely with the national Data  Protection Authorities participating in the Technology  Subgroup of the Art. 29 Working Party on developing a  specifi c methodology for assessing the severity of data  breaches. In view of the need for extensive discussions  among multiple national Data Protection Authorities,  this work was not fi nalised in 2012 and will continue in  the fi rst quarter of 2013.  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  26  Electronic identities and trust services  Notifi cations of security breaches at trust  service providers  E-Government services have signifi cant potential to  make public services more effi  cient for the benefi t of  citizens and businesses in terms of time and money,  and while these benefi ts are increasingly being realised  at the national level, e-Government services still face  administrative and legal barriers at the cross-border  level. In order to remove existing barriers to cross-border  e-ID based services, the European Commission has  proposed a draft Regulation on electronic identifi cation  and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market, which will replace the existing  Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC. Article 15  of the proposed Regulation requires that trust service  providers undertake extensive security measures and  notify competent bodies of any breach of security and  loss of integrity that could have a signifi cant impact on  the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein. ENISA has reviewed the feasibility  of implementing this article and provided guidelines  for such implementation.  The report Implementation of article 15 of the draft  Regulation on electronic identifi cation and trusted  services for electronic transactions in the internal  market is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/implementation-of-article-15  IDENTIFYING AND  RESPONDING TO THE  EVOLVING THREAT  ENVIRONMENT Information Security is about managing risks and  threats linked to the security of information and  information systems. ENISA’s objective in this work is to  provide stakeholders with information on how risks and  threats are evolving. More specifi cally, the aim is to link  particular trends to particular stakeholder communities,  thereby helping such communities to recognise and  respond to changes in the threat landscape that are  particularly relevant to their activities. In addition,  suitable mitigation strategies have been proposed and  recommendations and implementation options for  dealing with the identifi ed risks have been identifi ed.  The emphasis is on the provision of non-technical  information regarding all the components of risks.  ENISA emerging threat landscape  As with information security, the ability to respond to  the evolving cyber-threat environment is a journey  rather than a destination. There is and will always be  an “arms race” in cyber space between attackers and  defenders. The bad news is that currently attackers are  one step ahead. In this race, it is impossible to know  your opponents without understanding their methods  of attack. Hence, analysing threats is essential for  protecting cyber assets. It needs to be within the focus  of information security professionals.  The ENISA Threat Landscape is based on publicly  available data and provides an independent view on  threats, threat agents and threat trends observed.  The current top cyber threats have been identifi ed. In  addition, current threat trends have been derived by  comparing current threat information with that from  previous years. Finally, a number of threat trends for  emerging areas of information technology have been  identifi ed. The emerging areas taken into account  were: Mobile Computing, Social Technology, Critical  Infrastructures, Trust Infrastructures, Cloud Computing  and Big Data. An overview of the ENISA Threat  Landscape is shown in Table 1.  The ENISA Threat Landscape is available at:  h t t p s : // w w w. e n is a . e u r o p a . e u /a c t i v i t i e s /r i s k-  management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_  Threat_Landscape  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  27  Given the specifi c trends towards Mobile Computing,  shown in Table 1, ENISA has delivered detailed  assessments in the areas of “Consumerization of IT” and  “Bring Your Own Device”. This work covers risks as well  as opportunities emerging from mobile computing. A  set of security policies for the mitigation of these risks  has been developed.  The report Consumerization of IT: Risk Assessment  and Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices is  available at:  h t t p s : // w w w. e n i s a . e u r o p a . e u /a c t i v i t i e s /r i s k-  management/evolving-threat-environment/COIT_  Risk_Mitigation_Strategies  The ENISA Threat Landscape is a contribution towards  understanding the ‘cyber enemy’. Many steps need  to follow, however, to collect the intelligence and  knowledge needed to defeat cyber-attacks. Some of  those steps are:  • Collect and develop better evidence about attack  vectors  • Collect and develop better evidence about impact  achieved by adversaries  • Collect and maintain more qualitative information  about threat agents  • Use common terminology within threat reports  • Include the user perspective  • Develop use cases for threat landscapes  • Collect security intelligence that covers incidents  in an end-to-end manner  • Perform a shift in security controls to  accommodate emerging threat trends  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  28  Key fi ndings regarding the threat landscape  Top Threats Current  Trends  Top Emerging Trends  Mobile  Computing  Social  Technology  Critical  Infrastr.

Rogue Certifi cates  Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 1: Overview of Threats and Trends of the ENISA Landscape  Consumerization of IT and Bring Your  Own Device  The risk environment is evolving rapidly, yet we lack of an  overall knowledge base for mitigating risks in the areas  of Consumerization of IT (COIT) and Bring Your Own  Device (BYOD). To address this issue, ENISA conducted  an assessment. The assessment provides guidance  on developing eff ective strategies and policies for  mitigating the underlying risks. The analysis examines  three areas of mitigation that should be considered in  concert: technical considerations, governance aspects  and the prevailing regulatory environment. Each  organisation should create an eff ective blend of the  three areas in their mitigation strategies.  The analysis also identifi es relevant security controls  that could facilitate the eff orts of stakeholders to  develop and implement a combination of controls in  their risk mitigation plans. While there is no “one size fi ts  all” solution, a combination of controls can be chosen  which suits a stakeholder’s particular operational  setting, strategy and policy requirements.  Identifying Consumerization of IT (COIT)  risks  It is important to identify which COIT risks need to be  mitigated within your organisation while the window  of opportunity still remains open (see opportunity  assessment in Consumerization of IT: Top Risks and  Opportunities, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/  consumerization-of-it-top-risks-and-opportunities/  at_download/fullReport)  29  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  5 key messages for decision makers  Five key messages for decision makers, such as  Chief Information Offi  cers and Chief Executives,  have been derived from this report:  • Ensure that governance aspects are  derived from business processes and  protection requirements and are defi ned  before dealing with technology.  • End-user involvement can eff ectively  mitigate risks. Awareness raising on COIT  programmes is highly eff ective for the  enforcement of security policies.  • Periodic risk assessment on COIT  programmes should be undertaken  to ensure that security policies remain  compatible with evolving technologies.  • Keep in mind that encryption  complements, but does not replace,  strategic risk management within a COIT  programme.  • Perform small steps initially and proceed  with more complex policies when  suffi  cient experience has been gained.  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  Citizens are increasingly relying on the Internet in their  everyday lives for banking, shopping, education and  a number of other services. It is, therefore, important  that they are able to use the Internet in a secure and  confi dent manner.  Making the Internet a better place for all citizens is a  shared responsibility, at both the European and global  level. The EU Cyber Security Strategy, due for release  in the near future, will set out just how important this  is, with concrete proposals to improve digital security.  Moreover, the European Union has been working with  the US, and at last year’s EU-US Summit, several steps  were agreed upon to help make the online world  secure, on both sides of the Atlantic.  For the fi rst time, last October, a European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) took place as a pilot project across  Europe. The ECSM campaign raised awareness about  Network and Information Security (NIS). It was planned  in the EU-US Summit fi nal report and in the roadmap  produced by the awareness-raising sub-group of the  EU-US Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-  crime in December 2011. The project was supported by  ENISA and the European Commission.  The main objectives of the European Cyber Security  Month were to:  • Generate general awareness about Network and  Information Security  • Promote safer use of the Internet for all users  • Build a strong track record to raise awareness  through the ECSM  • Involve relevant stakeholders  • Increase national media interest through the  European and international dimension of the  project  • Enhance attention and interest with regard to  information security through political and media  coordination  This year, eight countries participated in the fi rst  European Cyber Security Month: the Czech Republic,  Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia,  Spain and the United Kingdom. These countries replied  positively either to a call for expressions of interest  to organise ‘Security week’ pilot projects sent to all  members of the awareness-raising sub-group of the  EU-US Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-  crime, or to a communication campaign on the project  initiated by ENISA.  Latvia, together with the Council of the European Union,  offi  cially supported the project. Each pilot country  decided upon the scope and number of activities and  events to be organised.  Over the course of the month of October, a range of  local activities and events were held across Europe to  raise the security awareness of diff erent target groups.  These included, among others:  • Conferences and workshops in Norway, Portugal  and Spain  • Media and social media campaigns in Norway and  Slovenia  • Non-governmental organisation (NGO) round  tables in the Czech Republic  • Competitions and quizzes in Luxembourg, Norway  and Slovenia  • Roadshows in the United Kingdom  30  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  Each country built on its own existing activities and  experience for maximum impact. The private sector was  involved in almost all pilot countries. The proportion  of campaigns encompassing general users versus  those targeting business users was almost the same.  A wide variety of key messages were promoted across  the diff erent European countries by using a variety of  techniques that were fun, exciting and motivating. The  wide variety of delivery channels used made it possible  to match diff erent messages to diff erent media and  opportunities across all sectors and countries.  ENISA supported the organisation of the European  Cyber Security Month pilot projects in various ways. The  Agency coordinated the organisation of the 2012 ECSM,  acting as the hub for all pilot countries by providing  suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating  synergies between countries when possible. For  example, the interaction between Luxembourg  and Norway and that between the United Kingdom  and Slovenia, along with Norway, demonstrated  how successful synergies could be. ENISA provided  guidance on how to organise information security  campaigns using its methodology on how to prepare  and implement awareness campaigns. In addition, the  Agency developed a series of common messages and  material to help Member States prepare their cyber  security education and awareness campaigns in similar  ways. This material was recognised by all countries as  an important tool in reaching people and getting them  to change their behaviour, or for reinforcing good  behaviour. The fi rst European Cyber Security Month  pilot project was successful, especially because of the  engagement, existing good practices and experience of  the participating countries.  ACTIVITIES FOR  AWARENESS RAISING  AMONG END USERS  Involving intermediaries in cyber  security awareness raising  ENISA and the European Commission have been  co-operating with the US Department of Homeland  Security on “Involving Intermediaries in Cyber  Security Awareness Raising’’. The project developed  mechanisms for cross-border cooperation as well  as for public-private cooperation and information  exchange. Forty- ive EU and US representatives from  the private and public sectors gathered in Brussels  to discuss the topic of “Involving Intermediaries in  Cyber Security Awareness Raising’’.  Key conclusions:  • Make companies aware that awareness  raising will help them to create business  opportunities and make money by  burnishing their brand image.  • Cyber security is a matter of cultural  challenge and behavioural change.  • Remember not to scare users and to  encourage them to get online, but in  a safe way. Do not start technical. This  is about communication. Therefore,  messages have to resonate with the target  audiences.

Together with the information  we hope to also introduce the reader to the ‘can do’  attitude that should be deployed by educators and  their students of diff erent age groups. The report  addresses educators, such as trainers, teachers, and  peers involved in formal education and non-formal  education, including lifelong learning.  The report consists of three parts, each of which is  equally important:  • Results of the survey and consultations with  stakeholders involved at diff erent levels in  Germany, Romania, The Netherlands, Estonia,  Italy, Greece, Ireland and Poland as well as bodies  like the Open Web Application Security Project  (OWASP)  • ENISA recommendations from 2012 deliverables  • Case studies from Austria, Luxembourg and  Denmark  Some of the most important recommendations from  the report are:  • Cyber-security strategies should include a  subsection on education and research as part of  the overall strategy  • There is a need to promote awareness of personal  information security and regarding legal advice  on misbehaviour  • A new didactic approach and ‘textbook-atlas-  concept’ should be used for NIS manuals  • Using pseudonyms and aliases on the Internet is  the fi rst step to protecting your personal data  The report Collaborative solutions for Network  Information Security in education is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-  relations/nis-brokerage-1/collaborative-solutions-for-  network-information-security-in-education  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  31  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  34  COMMUNICATING  CYBERSECURITY  RESULTS  ENISA’s Public Aff airs Unit (PAU) continued to keep the  Agency and its mission in the spotlight during 2012.  Notable achievements included the redesign of ENISA’s  web site and the addition of social media to the Agency’s  communications channels. The year also saw closer  cooperation with local and national media, resulting  in TV coverage, editorials in the press and articles  published in online news portals. PAU gained Europe-  wide coverage for Cyber Europe 2012 – the second, and  to date, largest, pan-European cyber security exercise.  Broadly speaking, the Public Aff airs Unit focused on  six areas during 2012:  1. Deepening and broadening audience impact  across Europe and locally  2. Gaining increased media coverage  3. Enhancing the use of digital media  4. Ensuring coherence and consistency –  communication planning  5. Strengthening the ENISA brand  6. Internal communication  DEEPENING AND  BROADENING  AUDIENCE IMPACT  ACROSS EUROPE AND  LOCALLY  As the cyber security information hub, PAU’s focus is on  communicating the results of ENISA’s operational work  to diverse audiences through the appropriate channels.  This is a key element of ENISA’s mandated mission to  develop a cyber-security culture that will result in a safe  and sound digital society. ENISA’s Public Aff airs Unit  outreach channels include public relations campaigns,  digital communications, both external and internal  communications, and media activity and events across  the EU.  Deepening and broadening communication with  various audiences was a major thrust of PAU’s work in  2012. To do so, the unit organised or participated in  joint events with other EU bodies, such as the high-level  cyber event in Brussels that brought ENISA together  with representatives of the European Parliament, the  European Commission and industry. The Agency also  engaged in outreach work, particularly with the local  community, such as organising a Europe Day celebration  event on Crete to highlight the benefi ts of information  and communication technology for all of Europe’s  children. The Public Aff airs team has also worked to  further strengthen ties with Greece’s government,  which hosts the Agency in Heraklion and Athens.  Moreover, in 2012, ENISA engaged in collaborations  with the Regional Governor of Crete and the Heraklion  local authorities.  GAINING INCREASED  MEDIA COVERAGE  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme  provides the Agency with an opportunity to reach  many more of its stakeholders than it can through  direct means. In 2012, the Agency adopted a new media  outreach distribution and media monitoring process  to enhance the targeting and reach of its media work.  Major accomplishments include:  • Produced and issued 25 media releases.  • Posted more than 80 individual news items on the  ENISA web site.  • Many media releases and news items  simultaneously published in the Agency’s social  media channels.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  35  Multi-lingual approach  As a fundamental part of ENISA’s work is to make its  messages accessible to stakeholders across Europe,  the Agency issues media releases in fi ve EU languages:  English, German, French, Spanish and Greek, to press,  radio, television and web-based news organisations. It  also maintains online landing pages in German, French  and Greek. ENISA media releases are distributed to  both general media, and specialised ICT/Network and  Information Security publications and web sites. Media  monitoring analysis and in depth-evaluation of the  Agency’s media output shows that in 2012, this work  generated more than 2,000 stories in European news  media, and that stories appeared in all 23 EU languages.  Cross-media impact  Figures show a clear correlation between peaks in  web visitors and the distribution of media releases in  multiple channels, thus demonstrating the benefi cial  eff ect of media activity. Overall, ENISA reached a  combined potential audience of several million readers,  listeners and viewers. Directly, news stories on the  ENISA web site received more than 171,000 unique page  views in 2012.  Cyber Europe 2012  A major media focus during the autumn was the Cyber  Europe 2012 security exercise. This was the second  pan-European cyber security exercise, following  on from Cyber Europe 2010, and from the fi rst ever  EU-US exercise, Cyber Europe 2011. The 2012 exercise  was Europe’s biggest to date, involving around 400  individual participants. In addition to involvement from  all EU Member States, the exercise included the private  sector for the fi rst time, with telecommunications,  banking, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) taking  part. This major event required a fully coordinated  Communication Strategy, drawn up by the Public Aff airs  Unit, in close collaboration with the Commission, and  the Member States. The exercise’s ‘media footprint’  included more than 225 individual stories across Europe  and globally.  More than 100 of these were on the day of  the exercise itself, and included live interviews.  With regard to ENISA’s wider work, the Public Aff airs  Unit organised two special media briefi ngs in Brussels  – one in relation to a European Parliament hearing.  Other media outreach work included a high-level event  examining European cooperation in cyber security. The  event involved key EU policy makers, stakeholders, and  research and industry participants.  Other media outreach activities  Other press conferences and briefi ngs were targeted  at media in specifi c countries or around Network  Information Security special interest areas. As part of  its media activities, the Agency also produced a Crisis  Communication Strategy and Scenario Plan in 2012,  which it will continue to develop in 2013.  DIGITAL MEDIA  ENISA’s website continues to be the Agency’s principal  communications channel. In 2012, development work  was carried out to re-design the website and enhance  its interactivity for users. A new template layout was  introduced throughout the website and the information  structure of the home page and publications was  improved. A faceted search for publications was  introduced to improve the search function. Three mini-  sites in French, German and Greek were also launched.  Social media  The launch of social media channels – Facebook,  LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube – has enabled ENISA to  connect with new communities or deepen its ties with  existing ones. The channels are accessible through the  website’s home page.  Website Improvements  Further enhancing the website for users, and helping  visitors to navigate with greater ease to fi nd the  information they are looking for, is an on-going  process. To this end, after the launch of the new  design, a web usability project was also carried out  in 2012, the results of which will be used in 2013 to  augment and improve the information architecture of  further sections of the site.  Technical improvements in 2012 included the  development of web tools for the Agency’s extranets  (portals), used by specialist expert communities, and  the application of all security patches to the Zope  application and PHP scripting used by the ENISA site.  Further enhancements and improvements will be  carried out on the website in 2013. These will include an  improved content structure, based on the results of the  web usability project, and further development of the  French, German and Greek mini-sites.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  36  Video  Turning to other digital media, in 2012, the Public Aff airs  Unit produced videos covering key areas of activity, such  as the Cyber Europe 2012 exercise, Incident Reporting  and a corporate info fi lm and clip. For 2013, ENISA  envisages the production of videos and other digital  products such as podcasts and info fi lms that underline  the achievements in ENISA’s major work-streams.  ENSURING COHERENCE  AND CONSISTENCY:  COMMUNICATION  PLANNING  In 2012, the Public Aff airs Unit ensured that ENISA’s  corporate communications activity was fully aligned  with ENISA’s operational and policy development  goals. Partly this entailed forming close links with  the European Parliament, the European Commission,  the Council and Member States. All communications  activity falls within the scope of six planned areas of  Public Aff airs activity in ENISA’s work programme. This  ensures that information forms part of a coherent and  consistent narrative on the Agency’s work. In addition,  the continuing provision of high quality editorial,  graphic design and printing services, through contracts  managed by PAU, has helped to ensure quality and  consistency in ENISA’s communications.  STRENGTHENING THE  ENISA BRAND  Branding  Given the nature of ENISA’s mission, branding is an  important aspect of PAU’s work. A strong ENISA  brand helps the Agency to achieve consistent and  coherent results with all of its communications. It raises  awareness and increases understanding regarding  Network Information Security issues. The ENISA brand  was strengthened in 2012 through several means:  • Visual identity: the ENISA brand’s visual identity  was developed further in 2012 through updated  brand guidelines. The new visual identity will be  launched in early 2013.  • Campaigns: to increase awareness and  recognition of the ENISA brand, campaigns were  run in Brussels-based publications.  • Promotional material: promotional material has  been produced on a regular basis and distributed  both during corporate events and to visitors.  Special focus was given to children this year,  notably with the Europe Day celebrations.  An effective brand strategy is the key to connecting  effectively with our audiences. Therefore, refreshing  the look and feel of ENISA material will create a new  chapter in the way the Agency communicates and is  perceived.  Publications  Publications are the ‘face’ of the ENISA brand and an  important communication tool given ENISA’s mission.  Through 2012, ENISA published around 40 publications  as Work Programme ‘deliverables’ and produced  around 30 other reports, papers and studies. The Public  Aff airs Unit assists with the editing and design of these  publications, and during 2012, a brand new publication  review process was developed, with the close support  of the Agency’s Quality Control Advisor.  Along with the writing and design of the Agency’s  General Report, in 2012, the Public Aff airs team also  produced a special report for the ENISA high-level event  in November, EU Cyber cooperation: the digital frontline.  The report gave an overview of Europe’s cyber security  position and examined areas where cooperation can  ensure a secure digital environment.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  37  In 2012, the Public Aff airs team worked with the  Agency’s NIS experts to step up the frequency of its  special Flash Notes – short expert reports published  to provide advice, guidance or commentary on a ‘hot  topic’ in security.  Subjects covered included the Flamer  cyber attacks on Middle-Eastern oil and gas companies,  the ‘high roller’ automated attacks on bank accounts,  and the ease with which customers’ passwords can be  stolen from some large organisations. The Flash Notes  were extremely well received because of their frankness  and immediacy, and the Agency will do more in this area  in 2013. In early 2013, PAU will also begin publication of  a brand new ENISA monthly newsletter.  On a wider front, a poster campaign for child protection  online was successfully launched, and will be translated  and distributed in every Member State through the EU  Representations and Info points.  INTERNAL  COMMUNICATION Employees are ENISA’s key ambassadors and reaching  them successfully is both challenging and rewarding.  Defi ning common ground between 60 members of  staff  from 18 diff erent Member States is a continuous  challenge. Activities revolving around internal  information planning, best practices and resourcing  help to shape a culture of cooperation and support  within ENISA, a culture which is developed through  staff  meetings and social events, as well as through  an in-house intranet platform. The dynamics of the  workplace are changing internal communications,  however, as the rapid development of communications-  related technology and the rapid expansion of  communications channels create opportunities and  challenges.  During 2012, employee engagement has been  encouraged through follow-up on internal surveys and  teambuilding events. Strengthening common goals for  all staff  and encouraging on-going interaction have  also been crucial at a time when the Agency has been  reorganised, and greater focus placed on the Agency’s  Athens-based mobile team. Clear communication is  essential during times of change, and the Public Aff airs  team is closely involved in keeping staff  updated on  these developments.  CONFERENCES, JOINT  EVENTS AND VISITS  The Public Aff airs events coordinator organised 60  ENISA conferences and events in 2012. In addition, the  Agency took part in numerous external events and  high-level European conferences.  One of the key events during the year was ENISA’s  high-level event, “EU cyber cooperation”, which took  place in November in Brussels. The event explored how  greater cooperation can help to enhance cyber security  across Europe, and brought together experts from the  European Commission, the European Parliament and  industry. An audience made up of people from the  worlds of network and information security and politics  had the opportunity to watch the debate and put  questions to the panel.  In addition to these activities, the Public Aff airs Unit  provided support to the Executive Director for his  participation in events across Europe. These included  a round table presentation at the European Parliament,  made at the special request of members of the  Parliament’s Committee for Industry, Research, and  Energy (ITRE) Committee. In-house events facilitated by  the Public Aff airs team included a visit in July by MEPs  from the European Parliament’s ITRE Committee. The  group included Rapporteur, Giles Chichester, Amelia  Andersdotter and Ivailo Kafl in.  In September, MEP Jutta Haug, a Vice Chair of the  Parliament’s Budget Committee, visited the Agency  to learn more about its future plans and excellent  budgetary performance.  RELATIONS WITH  ENISA STAKEHOLDERS  REL ATIONS WITH ENISA STAKEHOLDERS  40  ENISA’s stakeholder relations are a key factor in the  success of its overall mission of contributing to the  security of the EU internal market. The Management  Board (composed of the Commission, Member State  and private sector representatives) and Permanent  Stakeholders Group (composed of multiple  stakeholders), as well as the Agency’s informal networks  and expert working parties, give ENISA unparalleled  insights and access to public and private sector  Network and Information Security (NIS) experts. This  in turn enables ENISA to identify emerging risks and  gain new insights in order to help Member States and  private sector organisations better prepare themselves  for challenges in a proactive and professional manner,  as well as to build novel public and private sector  partnerships.  MANAGEMENT BOARD  The Agency is governed by a Management Board (MB),  composed of one representative from each EU Member  State and EEA country (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and  Norway), three representatives from the Commission  and three representatives from designated stakeholder  groups (the information and communication  technology industry, consumer groups; academic  experts in network and information security).  In line with established practice, two MB meetings were  held as planned during 2012. In addition to several,  regular and extraordinary administrative, management  and budgetary items, the preparation and subsequent  adoption of the Budget and the Work Programme for  2013 were important activities during the year.  Minutes and decisions of the Management Board are  available on the ENISA website: http://www.enisa.  europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/  management-board/minutes-decisions-1  Furthermore, an informal joint meeting between the  MB and the Permanent Stakeholders Group took place  in February 2012. The meeting focused on setting the  priorities and deliverables of the Work Programme  2013. In addition, an informal MB meeting on strategic  guidance for Work Programme 2014 was held in  November 2012.  For a list of members of the MB, see Appendix: Members  of the Management Board  PERMANENT  STAKEHOLDERS GROUP  The ENISA Permanent Stakeholders group (PSG)  facilitates the Agency’s regular dialogue with the  private sector, academia, consumer organisations and  other relevant stakeholders. The PSG is composed of  30 experts in Network and Information Security who  provide advice to the Executive director and input for  the annual work programme. The term of offi  ce of the  PSG is two and a half years. Following the open call for  Members in April 2012, a new composition of the PSG  was established. The 30 appointed members formally  started their term of offi  ce on 17 August 2012.  For the list of members of the PSG, see Appendix:  Members of the Permanent Stakeholders Group.  The PSG met three times in 2012, in April, September  and November. The September meeting was an  introductory meeting for the new members, which was  followed by the meeting in November to discuss the  themes and possible deliverables for the ENISA Work  Programme 2014.  RESPONDING TO  REQUESTS FOR  ASSISTANCE FROM  MEMBER STATES  Throughout 2012, ENISA received inquiries as well as a  number of requests for advice and assistance according  to Article 10 of ENISA’s founding Regulation. Altogether,  13 requests according to art. 10 were received by  ENISA from various Member States and EU Institutions  referring to diff erent areas of NIS-activities.  Please see Appendix 4: Handling of requests for  Advice and Assistance in 2012 for more information.  REL ATIONS WITH ENISA STAKEHOLDERS  41  NATIONAL LIAISON  OFFICER (NLO)  NETWORK  Although not formally based on ENISA’s Regulation, the  network of National Liaison Offi  cers (NLOs) is very helpful  to the Agency, improving the production of deliverables  that match stakeholders’ expectations and needs. NLOs  serve as ENISA’s primary contact point within the Member  States. They liaise with national bodies and institutions in  their respective Member State, and build and maintain  a national network of contacts that includes relevant  stakeholders in their country.  NLOs are well placed to reinforce the impact of the  Agency in the Member States, and to facilitate the  exchange of information between ENISA and its  stakeholders as well as amongst them. They do this by  disseminating ENISA’s deliverables, Press Releases, and  procurement and vacancy notices, and by providing  feedback on the impact of ENISA deliverables and  outcomes in their country.  During 2012, ENISA conducted a survey to gather  information about the members of the NCO and the  means of dissemination used by each respective NLO.  The survey showed that most of the Member States  have in place adequate dissemination tools in order  to reach a relevant number of stakeholders in the EU.  The survey also recommended areas for improvement,  such as using structured channels of communication  to categorise the information and produce targeted  messages to stakeholders.  Also during 2012 the Management Board newsletter  distribution list was expanded to include NLOs.  For the list of members of the NLOs, see Appendix:  Members of the National Liaison Offi  cers network.  The NLO-network met once in November 2012 in  Athens, Greece. The primary purpose of this meeting  was a discussion on how to enhance collaboration and  the reach of ENISA’s dissemination activities within the  Member States.  The NLO team  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT  AND ADMINISTRATION  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTR ATION  44  The IT and Facilities Management Unit (ITFMU) and the Administration Department play a supportive yet  important role in enabling ENISA’s operational units to smoothly and securely execute their work.  FACILITIES  MANAGEMENT  Following the agreement to open a branch offi  ce  in Athens, serious eff ort was put into the selection  of a suitable location. The implementation of Lync  telephony as well as Direct Access will allow those staff  involved to easily transition to the new offi  ce.  ADMINISTRATION  The Administration Department seeks to ensure  compliance and deliver services reliably to the  ENISA’s operational units. It does so by enhancing  the functionality of the administrative procedures  of the Agency that are mandated by the regulatory  framework. The main tasks of the department are  represented below:  Human resources  As a knowledge-based organisation, ENISA relies on its  personnel to deliver its services to its stakeholders and  ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. The  Agency also strives to implement modern HR practices  such as teleworking and fl exitime. As an EU Agency,  ENISA benefi ts from having a diverse multi-national  workforce, as demonstrated in the statistics regarding  personnel at ENISA presented below:18  Staff  in service: 58 Staff  Members: 42 Temporary Agents  (27 TA AD’s, 15 TA AST’s), 12 CA’s, 4 SNE’s.  Note: 7 Staff  members have double nationality: 2 GR/  NL, 1 IT/AU, 1GB/IT, 1 CY/GR, 1 NL/CH, 1 GR/DE.  18  Last update: 31 December 2012.  INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY  As one of the guardians of Network and Information  Security (NIS) in Europe, ENISA needs to practice  what it preaches. We therefore strive to achieve  a high level of security for our own information  technology infrastructure. Moreover, to keep abreast  of the latest technological developments, we keep  our IT infrastructure up-to-date with the most modern  technologies. The IT and Facilities Management Unit  (ITFMU) is tasked not only with maintaining ENISA’s IT  infrastructure and facilities, but with ensuring that the  Agency follows IT best practise in doing so.  Collaboration and Mobility  In order to enhance user collaboration and  communication, as well as off er integrated online  meeting services, ENISA implemented Microsoft Lync  in 2012. This service enables ENISA staff  to be able to  reach and collaborate with the rest of the organisation,  no matter where they are located. The system will also  include IP telephony in 2013, thus off ering full Unifi ed  Communications.  Given the high mobility of the ENISA workforce, ENISA  implemented Direct Access in 2012. This  allows staff  to  securely connect to internal resources in a transparent  manner when they are outside the offi  ce. The solution  supports multiple factor authentication (Kerberos,  Machine Digital Certifi cate, User credentials) and  modern network protocols like IPv6 and IPSEC.  Security  To enhance the security of the internal network, ENISA  implemented authentication and encryption of the  network connections using IPSEC. This not only ensures  the privacy of the data exchanged between ENISA clients  and servers, but also the ENISA servers themselves are  better protected. This was demonstrated in practice  by a penetration test that was conducted against our  Intranet by EsCert. The results were very favourable  results for ENISA.  In addition to the above enhancements, ENISA’s fi rewall  was upgraded to be fully redundant (hot standby).  Service  Com pliance  A ud  it  &  Co  nt ro  l Administration  Department  Performance  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTR ATION  45  Financial resources  In 2012, the Agency committed its appropriations at a rate  of 100%, repeating the performance of 2011. This allowed  the Agency to carry out its operational activities as  specifi ed in the Work Programme 2012, and to make the  investments needed to ensure an appropriate operating  environment, compliance and the continued provision  of services by the Agency. Payments reached the level  of 91.45% of the total appropriations managed.

Moreover, it demonstrates the strong eff ort made  to fi nalise administrative and operational activities and  deliverables within the fi nancial year and minimise the  carry forward of appropriations to the next year.

Background  This document provides a short summary of the requests for advice and assistance that ENISA has dealt with in 2012.  ENISA is handling requests in line with the following legal framework:  • Art. 10 of the Regulation19;  • the implementing decision of the Management Board20; and  • its internal procedure21.  In the course of developing its internal procedure and policy document, ENISA has built up an intranet platform for  responding to art. 10 requests as well as to inquiries in the most effi  cient way.  2. Scope of Art. 10 requests  Requests for advice and assistance and stated as “requests” in this document and by ENISA are “Article 10-requests”.

Commission, DG INFSO (A3)  DG INFSO requested ENISA for support on the “security  in the supply chain” as one of the proposed areas of  action for the European Public-Private Partnership for  Resilience (EP3R).  ENISA actions: creation of a group of experts, preparation  of a document covering the state-of-the-art in the area  taking into account of a survey to a selected number of  EU National Security Agencies  4.2. Hellenic Republic, Ministry of  Administrative Reform and e-Government  The Hellenic Republic requested assistance of  ENISA in various areas of ICT.  ENISA actions: Meetings (Hellenic DPA, S. Katsikas, Vice  Minister Voloudakis-ED) took place; ENISA provided an  overview mapping of eID and the approaches followed  within the EU by other MS regarding the following  points: how a citizen’s id is confi rmed, which dbases are  used, how as well as how many, their interconnection,  how privacy is handled, what they use (cards, mobile  apps, etc.); a workshop was held at the ministry of  administrative reform and eGov.  4.3. Commission, DG INFSO (D4)  In order to achieve an effi  cient, eff ective and truly  European implementation of the PIA-Framework,  the European Commission monitors the current  developments in the Member States and creates  conditions for facilitating the emergence of a common  European approach. A fi rst milestone in this respect was  a conference in Brussels (in CCAB) on 8th February 2012.  ENISA actions: meetings, ENISA participation in EC PIA  conference on RFID PIA Framework.  4.4. Commission, DG INFSO (A3)  In Nov2011 the Commission adopted the Commission  Legislative Work programme for 2012:  http://ec.europa.eu/atwork /programmes/index_  en.htm. In annex I, two initiatives on a “Pan European  framework for electronic identifi cation, authentication  and signature” and a “European Strategy for Internet  Security” were announced. The EC invited ENISA to  respond on how the Agency could support the EC in  shaping up these initiatives on which we have already  started working.  ENISA actions: The following options were found for  ENISA to assist the EC in particular:  • the promotion of security standards in public pro-  curement of new/innovative technologies/systems  • the defi nition of the scope and provisions of the  legal measure the EC intends to propose (with Art  114 as legal basis). An element of this measure  would be the extension of the applicability of  the “security breach notifi cation” model and  mechanism of Art 13.a of the FD beyond the  electronic communication market, thus covering  the information society service (as set in the  e-commerce Directive) as well as other sectors.  In this regard, the work planned by ENISA on  security breach notifi cation for the cloud would  be extremely relevant. Another element to refl ect  upon (wrt the scope) would be how to embrace  and/or articulate the link/relation with obligations  for critical infrastructure provides.  • Another component of the legal measure, on  which ENISA may have already some ideas and  provide some support on how to shape the legal  provisions, relates to supporting the cooperation  and information exchange/communication  between National Competent bodies.  4.5. Romania  ENISA received a request to support CERT RO in  becoming fully operational, in the areas of  • Incidents response procedures;  • Technical expertise;  • Training;  • Help in development of Romanian early warning  system, interconnected with other National systems;  • Help in developing of a national contingency plan.  ENISA actions: Workshop was delivered, request was  completed.  APPENDICES  59  4.6. Ireland  ENISA received a request for support in setting a  national CERT.  ENISA actions: meetings, support in the national/  governmetal CERT, participation in the TRANSITS  I training in Portugal, Porto, information on CERT  communities was provided.  4.7. Hellenic Data Protection Authority  The Hellenic Data Protection Authority requested  ENISAs collaboration.  ENISA actions: following the invitation of art. 29  Technology Subgroup to ENISA to collaborate in  the implementation of pilots regarding the art. 4  publication in 2 MS, it was decided to carry out the fi rst  two pilots in collaboration with the DPAs of Greece and  Poland; meetings took place; Hellenic DPA participated  in the pilots (tests) of severity assessment methodology,  workshop in Athens took place.  4.8. National CSIRT of Czech Republic  The Czech Republic requested ENISA’s feedback to the  draft of the Czech Cyber Security Bill.  ENISA actions: ENISA provided comments on the  document contributing to the preparation of the  drafting of the bill on cyber security in the Czech  Republic.  4.9. Romania CERT  Romania CERT requested ENISA’s help in the  organisation of a CIIP workshop/exercise.  ENISA actions: The CIIP workshop took place.  4.10. BSI Germany  The BSI Germany requested ENISAs support of DFS (Air  Traffi  c Germany).  ENISA actions: The Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS)  is working on a norming eff ort of CEN TC 377 (Air Traffi  c  Management committee) with the subject of security  in ATM. Coordination with ENISA on this issue has  taken place, i.e. the interoperability of risk assessments  performed by the diff erent stakeholders.  4.11. Commission (DG HOME)  The request by DG HOME for support consisted of two  elements:  • On the one hand, ENISA was requested to provide  input and comments on the benefi ts, main  impacts and possible means of enforcement of  new data security measures in the reform of the  EU legal framework for data retention.  • ENISA was also requested to assess the current  implementation of data security measures for data  retention in selected MS that can be considered as  “best practice” in this respect.  ENISA actions: Due to the results of an internal assessment  in DG Home, and the identifi ed dependencies with  ePrivacy directive, the reform is delayed and as such  the request for fi nalizing this request was shifted to the  second part of 2013. ENISA will start working in March  with the new contractors for the survey and also for the  state-of-the art recommendations for data security.  4.12. Poland  Poland asked for ENISA’s assistance with their national  cyber exercise.  ENISA actions: Advice was provided, organisation of a  seminar.  4.13. Commission, SG  The Commission’s Secretariat General asked  for ENISA’s assistance regarding the Business  Continuity Corporate Exercise 2012.  ENISA actions: providing of a seminar to relevant  Commission staff on organising/planning cyber  exercises, providing a skeleton cyber scenario  using Cyber Europe’s 2012 basic scenario adapted  to the needs of the Commission, participation in a  workshop.  APPENDICES  60  Fulfi lment of SMART goals and KPIs  Below SMART goals and KPIs regarding requests for advice and assistance  have been successfully achieved:  SMART Goal KPI Achieved  In 2012, at least 3 request will result in a suitable policy  update of the requesting party  Number of requests  Number of policy updates 6  In 2012 at least 5 requests will be received by ENISA Number of requests received 14  In 2012 at least 3 requests will be responded to by ENISA Number of responses to requests 14  Drafting a reply to a request should not exceed 50 person  days per request Time Fulfi lled  Overall time for accepting/rejecting a request should  not exceed 10 working days (from registration to reply  to Sender)  Time Fulfi lled  Inquiries  In 2012, ENISA has also dealt with a number of queries that do not qualify as requests according to art. 10  Regulation because they do not fulfi l all requirements as laid down in art.10. These queries are referred to as  “inquiries”, they are not foreseen in ENISA’s annual Work Programme but the Agency handles them anyway, if  workload and resources allow so.  Therefore in 2012, ENISA has received a number of inquiries. This list provides a short overview of  these inquiries:  Nb. Requestor Area of NIS activity Status  1.

For an  agency that deals with the ever-changing world of cyber  security, however, success will always be determined by  how we manage future challenges, rather than how we  performed in the past.  Information technology now supports every aspect of  our modern lives, and the borders between the virtual  and real worlds are dissolving, as new technologies,  services and business models push existing concepts  and regulation to their limits. The organisational  structures and physical barriers that ensured security  in the past are now being tested, and in some cases,  breached by cyber threats that are continually evolving.  Dealing with these challenges requires cooperation  between everyone involved with the cyber world – the  IT industry, policy makers, politicians and, not least,  citizens. In 2012, ENISA focused on ways to strengthen  cyber cooperation across all sectors. This cooperation  includes coordination throughout Europe as well as  worldwide in both the public and private sectors.  Our starting point was to ask ourselves: what are  the next steps for building stronger bridges and  establishing common ground amidst the ever-evolving  cyber scenarios? In responding to destructive digital  attacks, what are the new challenges for EU institutions,  the private sector and citizens?  Providing answers to these questions in 2012 has been  challenging yet rewarding. One of the highlights in 2012  was ENISA’s successful management of Europe’s biggest  ever cyber security exercise, Cyber Europe 2012. The  exercise involved all EU Member States and countries  from the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) as well as  private sector organisations (a fi rst for Europe). We also  responded swiftly and professionally to Member States’  requests for assistance, through ENISA’s Athens-based  mobile team.  In terms of the development  of ENISA’s activities, the  Agency took up a formal  role in Europe’s Cyber Incident  Reporting framework, under Article 13a of the  EU’s Telecommunications Framework Regulation, and  assisted with the setup of new Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) in Malta, Romania, Cyprus and  Ireland, while providing ongoing support to established  teams. ENISA was also closely involved in the CERT-EU  pre-confi guration team, and, in cooperation with the  European Commission, organised the pilot for the fi rst  ever European Cyber Security Month, with activities  across eight European countries throughout October.  In addition, the agency continued to strengthen its  collaboration with Europol, part of which has included  having a member on the board of the new European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in The Hague.  This year has also seen the new ENISA Regulation  progressing towards the fi nal stages of approval within  the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  We look forward to a new mandate for ENISA, so that  the Agency can proactively and effi  ciently support the  Member States.  Although there is still a signifi cant amount of work  to be done to achieve the vision of a harmonised  approach to cyber security across the EU, it is clear that  great progress has been made in collaborating across  communities and across national boundaries.  In this new inter-dependent world we must act as one,  and develop a cohesive online ethos: the next chapters  of cyber security depend on it. It is crucial that the  Internet is safeguarded as an arena for commercial,  governmental, cultural and leisure activity. Therefore  all eff orts and strategies dedicated to securing Europe’s  cyber cooperation must remain coherent, consistent  and unifi ed.  I hope that you fi nd our 2012 General Report useful and  informative.

Such  technologies present us, however, with a double- edged sword: greater bene its invariably come with  new threats. All of us depend inextricably on cyber- space, yet very few of us are in a position to fully  appreciate the magnitude of damaging activity that  occurs online every day.  The number and sophistication of cyber-attacks  affecting public and private information systems  has increased dramatically over the past year, and is  expected to continue to grow at a fast pace. Moreover,  in today’s world, geographically separated societies  are interconnected by information technology – and  are irreversibly dependent on it. New threats thus  re lect the global nature of the systems they target  and their mitigation often requires international  collaboration. The propagation and implications of  threats such as malware (and botnets in particular)  mean they are no longer just an issue for individuals,  but are increasingly a social and civic responsibility  that affects all sectors of our digital society. VIRTUAL VS. REAL:  BORDERS BLUR  The borders between virtual and real worlds are  dissolving. New technologies, services and business  models push existing concepts and regulation to  their limits. The organisational structures and physical  barriers that have stood for centuries are being severely  put to the test by cyber threats that are continually  evolving. Even national borders may hinder us more  than protect us against challenges which are global  in nature and which require responses that are  coordinated across sectors, organisations and national  borders. The leading role that information technologies  play in modern society has made cyber security  essential to the worldwide economy. Moreover, the EU’s  competitiveness and prosperity are closely connected  to the safety and security of critical infrastructures.  Hence, we need to cooperate closely in order to ensure  that the EU as a whole is equipped with appropriate  protection and defence mechanisms, including an  overview of major cyber incidents.  “The organisational structures  and physical barriers that have  stood for centuries are being  severely put to the test by cyber  threats that are continually  evolving.”  INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION  TECHNOLOGIES (ICT): A “DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD”  INTRODUCTION  7  THE DIGITAL AGENDA European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes has  put forward the Digital Agenda for Europe, with the  objective of improving citizens’ quality of life through,  for example, better healthcare, safer and more effi  cient  transport solutions, a cleaner environment, new media  opportunities and easier access to public services  and cultural content.1 This is a major step towards the  creation of the Digital Society. Cyber-attacks, however,  complicate the deployment of ICT solutions used by  citizens in their day-to-day lives, such as online payment  and e-government services. According to the Special  Eurobarometer 390 on Cyber Security (published in July  2012), 29% of EU citizens do not feel confi dent in using  the Internet for banking or purchases and 12% said they  had already fallen victim to online fraud.2 Moreover, the  Special Eurobarometer 371 on Internal Security found  that eight out of ten Europeans consider cybercrime to  be an important challenge to EU security.3  THE IMPORTANCE  OF CROSS-BORDER  COOPERATION  Any future approach to securing Europe’s ICT systems  must be coherent across geographical borders and  pursued with consistency over time. This is not yet the  case, as approaches vary in diff erent Member States and  communities. Without a coordinated global strategy for  combatting major incidents on the Internet, Member  States could fi nd themselves in a situation where local  systems cannot function eff ectively because of issues  that are beyond their control. The EU institutions and  bodies play an important role in improving cyber  security by providing support for collaboration and  a policy framework for Member States to achieve a  coordinated global approach.  1  1 COM(2010) 245 fi nal/2  2  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_390_en.pdf  3  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_371_en.pdf  ENISA’S ROLE Since its launch in 2004, ENISA has endeavoured to  build bridges between communities by promoting  cooperation across the EU and beyond. The Agency  has successfully done so through activities such as  supporting the CERT community (including the newly  formed EU CERT), organising the Cyber Europe and  Cyber Atlantic exercises, assisting the Member States  in implementing the requirements of security breach  notifi cation legislation, responding quickly and  effi  ciently to Member States’ requests for Assistance  through ENISA’s Athens-based Mobile Assistance  Team (MAT) and in helping to establish new Computer  Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Malta, Romania,  Cyprus and Ireland. ENISA aims to support communities  that are striving to improve the level of EU cyber security,  by improving the resilience of critical information  infrastructures and services, in both the public and  private sectors.  There are a number of areas where the current  approach to improving cyber security in the EU could  sensibly be extended. For example, there is a clear  need to collect and analyse data relating to information  security in a cross-border context which could reveal  trends that are not visible at present. This is already  under way with cyber incident reporting under Article  13a of the EU’s Telecommunications directive4, but  there is scope for this to be done across more areas.  In addition, a new ENISA Regulation is progressing  towards its fi nal stages within the European Parliament  and the Council of Ministers. The coming into force of  the Lisbon Treaty off ers an unparalleled opportunity to  improve the level of dialogue between communities  in the area of Network and Information Security.  A proactive approach to building these new cross-  border communities will bring great benefi ts, both in  terms of eff ectiveness of approach and effi  ciency in the  use of resources.  At a time in which the importance of cyber security is  recognised by all, it is important that eff orts to protect  and facilitate the development and prosperity of the  European Information Society do not lose momentum.  We need to prepare for a range of security-related  incidents that threaten large-scale disruption. ENISA  is assisting the Commission and the Member States  in identifying and preparing for such incidents and is  4  Telecommunications Regulatory Package (article 13a. amended  Directive 2002/21/EC Framework Directive) http://www.enisa.  europa.eu/media/news-items/agency-initiative-to-implement-  art.-13-of-telecom-package  INTRODUCTION  8  actively collaborating with a wide-range of stakeholder  communities as part of this eff ort. It is important that  ENISA is fully supported and further developed so that  the Agency can continue to respond to these challenges  and provide support and expertise to stakeholders  across Europe.  ABOUT ENISA The European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for Network  and Information Security (NIS). ENISA bridges the gap  between citizens, industry and governments by acting  as a knowledge broker in NIS matters and as a promoter  of good NIS practices within EU Member States.  ENISA is a de-centralised agency of the European Union.  It was established in 2004 and is based in Heraklion,  Greece with a branch offi  ce in Athens.  ENISA’s objectives are to:  • Secure Europe’s information infrastructure  • Promote information security standards,  guidelines and certifi cation schemes  • Educate the wider public on ICT  The main contributions of ENISA to enhancing cyber  security are in the following areas:  • Identifi cation and analysis of emerging trends and  threats  • Awareness of network and information security  risks and challenges  • Early warning and response  • Critical information infrastructure protection  • Adequate and consistent policy implementation  • Supporting other community actors in actions  against cybercrime  • International cooperation  • Information exchange  • Building communities  INTRODUCTION  9  EU AGENCIES  From Helsinki to Crete and from Lisbon to Vilnius,  specialised agencies have been established to  carry out specifi c legal, technical or scientifi c  tasks within the European Union. The agencies  were set up to help implement EU policies more  effi  ciently, and to respond to particular needs  identifi ed by the EU institutions and Member  States. They provide advice, facilitate exchanges  of best practice among Member States, and  support consensus-building through networks  and exchanges. All agencies work in the public  interest, and as they are spread throughout  the EU, they can facilitate outreach to EU  citizens. The EU agencies are involved in varied  activities: safeguarding freedom, justice and  security; improving health, safety and the  environment; supporting education, business  and innovation; and developing transport and  satellite infrastructure. Today the agencies play  a key role in implementing EU policies and are  making a valuable contribution to the EU 2020  strategic objectives.  In 2012, ENISA published numerous reports and  studies on a range of NIS issues, including:  • Minimum security measures and reporting  incidents  • Cyber incident reporting in the EU  • Assessing cloud computing security risks  • Minimum security requirements for smart grids  • Protecting Industrial Control Systems  • National cyber security strategies  • Incentives and barriers in the cyber insurance  market in Europe  • National and international cyber security exercises  • Good practice for national cyber contingency  plans  • Cyber exercise scenario modelling  • Cooperation between n/g CERTs and other  stakeholders  • Proactive detection of security incidents using  honeypots  • The right to be forgotten  • Privacy considerations of online behavioural  tracking  • ICT supply chain risks and challenges  • Electronic identifi cation and trusted services for  electronic transactions  • Consumerization of IT  • Involving intermediaries in cyber security  awareness raising  • Collaborative solutions for Network Information  Security in education  ENISA co-organises conferences, runs workshops and  publishes position papers.  As a European agency, ENISA is uniquely positioned to  bring together a wide range of key players in network  and information security, by acting as a neutral and  independent adviser. With its technical expertise, its  central position and its independence, the Agency is  well placed to provide expert advice on current issues, as  well as ring the alarm bells on emerging and future risks.  ENISA OPERATIONAL  ACTIVITIES  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  12  CRITICAL INFORMATION  INFRASTRUCTURE  PROTECTION (CIIP) AND  RESILIENCE Reliable communications networks and services are  now critical to public welfare and economic stability.  Attacks on the Internet, disruptions due to physical  phenomena, software and hardware failures, and  human error all aff ect the proper functioning of public  e-communications networks. Such disruptions reveal  the increased dependence of our society on these  networks and their services. Moreover, experience  has shown that neither single providers nor a country  alone can eff ectively detect, prevent and respond to  threats. Offi  cial Communications from the European  Commission have highlighted the importance of  network and information security and resilience for the  creation of a single European information space. They  have stressed the importance of dialogue, partnership  and the empowerment of all stakeholders to properly  address these threats. Fully recognising this need,  ENISA is engaged in several activities with the ultimate  objective of collectively evaluating and improving the  resilience of public e-communication networks and  services in Europe.  For 2012, the Resilience activities and tasks were defi ned  within the ENISA Work Programme 2012 – Improving  Information Security Through Collaboration. The  Resilience activities were included within Work Stream  (WS) 2: Improving Pan-European CIIP & Resilience  and Work Stream (WS) 3: Supporting the CERT and  other Operational Communities. The work packages  dedicated to Resilience were Work Package (WPK) 2.1:  Further Securing EU’s Critical Information Infrastructure  and Services; Work Package (WPK) 2.2: Cyber Exercises;  Work Package (WPK) 2.3: European Public Private  Partnership for Resilience (EP3R); and Work Package  (WPK) 2.4: Implementing article 13a.  Article 13a: Incident reporting and  security measures in the electronic  communications sector  The 2009 reform of the EU Regulatory Framework for  electronic communications added Article 13a to the  Framework Directive. Article 13a requires operators to  take technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of networks and services, as  well as to report security incidents to competent National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). Article 13a asks NRAs in turn  to send an annual report to the European Commission and  ENISA that summarises the reported incidents.  In 2010, ENISA formed a working group to work together  with NRAs to achieve a harmonised implementation of  Article 13a across the EU and to establish a process for  reporting incidents to the European Commission and  ENISA. In 2011, the Article 13a Working Group agreed  on two technical guidelines, a Technical Guideline for  Minimum Security Measures and a Technical Guideline  on Reporting Incidents.  In 2012, NRAs reported on the 2011 security incidents  to the European Commission and ENISA, and later  that year ENISA published a summary and aggregate  analysis of the incidents in 2011 that were reported to  regulators across the EU. This marked the fi rst time that  security incidents from across the EU were collected and  analysed. ENISA also took a snapshot of existing and  future EU legislation on security measures and incident  reporting. In its fi ndings, published in Cyber Incident  Reporting in the EU, ENISA underlined the important  steps that have been taken, but also pointed out gaps  and the fact that most security incidents fall outside  the scope of incident reporting legislation and are not  reported to authorities. ENISA is currently completing  the creation of an online incident reporting tool for  reporting security incidents.  The Annual Incident Reports 2011 is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-  and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-  incident-reports-2011  The report Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU is  available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  Resil ience -and- CIIP/Incidents-repor ting/c yber-  incident-reporting-in-the-eu  The Technical Guideline for Minimum Security  Measures is available at:  h t t p : / / w w w . e n i s a . e u r o p a . e u / a c t i v i t i e s /  R e s i l i e n c e - a n d - C I I P/ I n c i d e n t s - r e p o r t i n g /  m i n i m u m - s e c u r i t y - r e q u i r e m e n t s /c o p y _ o f _  minimum-security-requirements/technical-guideline-  on-minimum-security-measures  “…experience has shown that  neither single providers nor a  country alone can eff ectively detect,  prevent and respond to threats.”  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  13  The Technical Guideline on Reporting Incidents is  available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-  CIIP/Incidents-reporting/Technical%20Guidelines%20  on%20Incident%20Reporting/incidents-reporting-to-  enisa/technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting  Cloud computing: from individual  contracts to EU governance  In 2009, when cloud computing was still a relatively  new concept, ENISA published Cloud Computing  Security Risk Assessment, an assessment of the risks  and opportunities for SMEs considering adopting  cloud computing. The risk assessment became one of  the most widely quoted papers on cloud computing  security. In the paper, ENISA stressed the enormous  potential of cloud computing, particularly in terms of  security. Cloud computing allows diff erent customers  to join forces and in this way, with little investment, get  access to state-of-the-art technology and resources,  such as a 24/7 security team, a thorough software  development process with extensive security testing,  or geographically redundant data centres.  In a cloud computing environment, the work of the  organisation’s IT offi  cer changes as well: instead of  setting up hardware and installing software, IT offi  cers in  a cloud computing environment have to manage service  contracts with IT service providers. In December 2011,  ENISA surveyed IT offi  cers across the EU’s public sector  to analyse security parameters in cloud Service Level  Agreements (SLAs). The cloud SLA survey showed that  many key aspects of service delivery are not adequately  monitored by customers and that as a result customers  may fi nd out about issues too late. To remedy this  situation, in 2012 ENISA published a guide on monitoring  key security parameters in cloud service contracts.  With many private and public sector organisations  switching to cloud computing, IT resources are no  longer distributed across a large number of remote  locations but instead concentrated in a few large data  centres. From a security perspective this concentration  is a ‘double edged sword’. On the plus side, large  cloud providers can deploy state of the art security  and business continuity measures and spread the  associated costs across many customers. On the minus  side, if an outage or a security breach occurs then the  consequences could be more widespread, aff ecting a  large amount of data, many organisations and a large  number of citizens. In 2012, ENISA fi nalised an analysis  of the key security issues to consider from a national  and CIIP perspective regarding the uptake of cloud  computing. That year, ENISA also examined cloud  computing from a national CIIP perspective and began  work on an update of the 2009 cloud computing risk  assessment for small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs). Both documents are open for consultation and  they are currently being validated by a working group  of cloud computing experts from industry and the  public sector.  Towards the end of 2012 the European Commission  worked on two initiatives which will have an important  bearing on ENISA’s future work in the area of cloud  computing. First of all, the Commission issued a cloud  computing strategy that would have ENISA work with  the European Telecommunications Standards Institute  (ETSI). The two institutions would map the standards  relevant to the security and privacy of cloud computing  services, and take stock of existing security governance  and auditing schemes that could be used for governing  cloud computing services. Secondly, the European  Commission is working on a cyber security strategy that  will focus on critical services including cloud services.  The report Cloud Computing Security Risk  Assessment is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/  fi les/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  The report Procure Secure: A guide to monitoring of  security service levels in cloud contracts is available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-  CIIP/cloud-computing/procure-secure-a-guide-to-  monitoring-of-security-service-levels-in-cloud-contracts  “From a security perspective, the  concentration of IT resources in a  few large data centres is a ‘double  edged sword’.”  centre  is a ‘d  cloud  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  14  Emergency Communications  Crisis events like the terrorist attacks in New York,  London, Madrid, and Mumbai, industrial accidents  like the ones that happened in Enschede or Toulouse,  and natural disasters such as the Elbe fl oods in Saxony,  the Tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and Japan, and the  Katrina and Sandy storms in the US, have highlighted  the importance of maintaining communications during  emergencies. Crisis managers need to maintain an  accurate picture of the current situation, effi  ciently  deploy and command the available resources and relay  important information to the public.  A common observation in the analyses made after  some of the above disasters is that communications  were often a weakness in the response operations. In  many cases, communications networks failed or were  overloaded. One of the needs identifi ed during the  studies covering technical and economic aspects of  the underlying communications infrastructure in 2010  (Inter-X: Resilience of the Internet Interconnection  Ecosystem) and 2011 (Resilience of Interconnections)  was the need for a broad understanding of current  communication practices used during a crisis.  ENISA addressed this key topic in 2012 by taking stock of  existing practices in this area. The goal was to understand  the mechanisms, policies and legal frameworks used  in Europe and in selected third countries to facilitate  emergency communication including voice and data  (wireless, wired, and satellite) during a crisis. The  study used a comprehensive methodology of primary  research and interviews with relevant stakeholders in  the regulatory, service provision and crisis response  sectors. On the basis of the report fi ndings, three key  objectives were identifi ed:  • Develop improved inter-agency crisis  communications technology and procedures  • Defi ne standards in crisis communications  technology and procedures  • Encourage the uptake of data services in  emergency communications, particularly in the  area of public interaction  A series of recommendations have been made to  Member State Governments, Competent Authorities,  Service Providers and the Institutions of the European  Union.  Securing European Smart Grids  The smart grid can be defi ned as an upgraded electricity  network to which two-way digital communication  between supplier and consumer, intelligent metering  and monitoring systems have been added. Smart grids  will be able to effi  ciently integrate the behaviour and  actions of all users connected to them — generators,  consumers and those that do both — in order to  ensure an economically effi  cient, sustainable power  system with low losses and a supply that is safe, secure  and of high quality. Information and Communication  Technologies (ICT) are the platform underpinning smart  grids.  Achieving a secure smart grid will not be an easy task.  Assessing risks, securing processes as well as identifying  technological gaps and organisational problems are  some of the main challenges that the smart grid will face  in the years to come. Recognising the importance of  Smart Grids for the functioning of the EU economy and  society, ENISA has launched a series of new activities or  actively participated in existing ones.  The Agency has published two relevant studies and  is conducting another one on the Minimum security  requirements for smart grids. The studies recommend  that the European Commission and Member States  take measures such as bolstering research in smart grid  cyber security, improving the regulatory and policy  framework, fostering awareness raising, training and  test bed initiatives and promoting the development of  security certifi cation schemes for the components and  products of smart grid infrastructure.  Apart from these activities, ENISA has taken the fi rst  steps towards defi ning a common model for the  security and resilience of smart grids. Such a model  would be used by regulators and operators, or by other  stakeholders.  The report on Protecting Industrial Control Systems  is available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/  scada-industrial-control-systems/protecting-industrial-  control-systems.-recommendations-for-europe-and-  member-states.

ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  15  National Cyber Security Strategies:  Practical Guide on development and  execution  Cooperation at the pan-European level is necessary to  eff ectively prepare for and respond to cyber-attacks.  Comprehensive national cyber security strategies are  the fi rst step in this direction. In 2012, ENISA published  a practical guide that identifi es the most common  elements and practices of National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS), in the EU and non-EU countries. The  guide also proposes a national cyber security strategy  lifecycle, with a special emphasis on the development  and execution phase. For each component of the  strategy a list of possible KPIs is described. The report  includes specifi c recommendations for policymakers.  The report on National Cyber Security Strategies  is available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-  ncsss/cyber-security-strategies-paper  Incentives and barriers in the cyber  insurance market in Europe  Cyber-insurance has captured the imagination of many  involved in cyber-security at the policy and research  level as a means of transferring cyber security-related  fi nancial risks to third parties. The coverage in traditional  insurance policies may not fully address the risks faced  by an organisation that is part of the digital economy.  To address this gap, ENISA has conducted a study to  identify what may be inhibiting the cyber-insurance  market and ways to kick start its development.  The report on Incentives and barriers of the cyber  insurance market in Europe is available at: http://  www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/  national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/incentives-  and-barriers-of-the-cyber-insurance-market-in-europe  Cyber crises exercises and  cooperation  Cyber Europe 2012  On 4 October 2012, nearly 600 cyber-  security professionals across Europe participated  in Cyber Europe 2012, the second pan-European Cyber  Exercise. The exercise built on extensive activities at  both the national and European level to improve the  resilience of critical information infrastructures. Cyber  Europe 2012 was a milestone in the eff orts to strengthen  cyber-crisis cooperation, preparedness and response  across Europe.  Cyber Europe 2012 had three objectives:  1. Test the eff ectiveness and scalability of mechanisms,  procedures and information fl ow for public  authorities’ cooperation in Europe.  2. Explore the cooperation between public and private  stakeholders in Europe.  3. Identify gaps and challenges to see how large-scale  cyber-incidents can be handled more eff ectively in  Europe.  Twenty-nine EU Member States and EFTA countries  were involved in the exercise of which 25 countries  participated actively in the exercise, while four countries  were involved as observers. Overall, 571 individuals from  339 organisations – including several EU institutions –  participated. Following up on a key recommendation  of Cyber Europe 2010, the private sector took part in  this exercise. Cooperation between public and private  players took place at the national level, while public  authorities also cooperated across borders.  In 2013, ENISA plans to initiate discussions with the EU  Member States on the future objectives and scope of  the upcoming Pan-European Cyber Exercise, Cyber  Europe 2014.  The exercise report is available upon request.  icipated  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  16  Status report on national and  international CIIP Exercises  Cyber exercises are an important tool for assessing  the preparedness of a community against cyber  crises, technology failures and critical information  infrastructure incidents. ENISA supports the  stakeholders involved in EU cyber exercises.  This report aims to support European and international  bodies involved in cyber exercises with lessons  learned from cyber exercises. The report presents the  results of research and analysis conducted by ENISA  in 2012. ENISA examined 85 exercises covering the  period between 2002 and 2012. In total, 84 countries  worldwide participated in the multinational exercises  analysed in this report. A total of 22 European countries  have conducted national cyber-exercises over the past  several years. In 2013, ENISA will follow-up with a 2nd  International Conference on Cyber Crisis Exercises and  Cooperation.  The report on National and International  Cyber Security Exercises: Survey, Analysis and  Recommendations is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-  CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-exercises/exercise-  survey2012  Cyber exercises in Europe  The results of several cyber exercises in Europe – Cyber  Europe 2010 and 2012, and Cyber Atlantic 20115 – have  confi rmed the need for and signifi cance of cyber-  crisis cooperation.6 Other eff orts such as the European  Cyber Crisis Cooperation Framework (ECCCF) and the  European Standard Operating Procedures for cross-  country cyber-crisis mitigation (EU-SOPs)7 are currently  under development by Member States. This ENISA  report covers current and past eff orts in the area of  cyber exercises. It provides an overview of the role and  objectives of cyber exercises, potential stakeholders,  international and regional cooperation and a summary  of the exercises themselves. It complements the results  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-  crisis-cooperation/cyber-atlantic/cyber-atlantic-2011.  6  Cyber Europe 2010 Final Report (2010), http://www.enisa.europa.  eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-  europe/ce2010/ce2010report  7  The ECCCF report and the draft EU-SOPs are both available at  ENISA’s resilience portal at: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/  eu-exercises/sops  and recommendations of the recently published ENISA  report on over 80 cyber exercises.8  The document is available upon request.  ENISA Report on National Contingency  Plans for Critical Information  Infrastructures  National Cyber Contingency Plans (NCPs) are the  interim structures and measures needed to respond  and recover services following major incidents that  involve Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). CIIs,  used synonymously with ‘cyber’ hereafter, are the  Information and Communication Technology systems,  services, networks and other infrastructures, such  as embedded processors and controllers in critical  industries, which form a vital part of the European  economy and society. An NCP helps a nation make its  CII more resilient by establishing a response framework  before incidents occur.  ENISA’s Good Practice Guide on National Cyber  Contingency Plans shows how a nation can plan,  develop, test, improve and maintain a good and well-  functioning NCP for Critical Information Infrastructures.  In 2013, ENISA will follow-up this work with a project  that focuses on a single element of the NCP lifecycle,  National Risk Assessment for Critical Information  Infrastructures.  The Good Practice Guide on National Cyber  Contingency Plans is available upon request.  Regional cyber security exercises:  EuroSOPEx 1 & 2  In 2012, ENISA organised two distributed table-top  regional exercises, called EuroSOPEx, in order to  familiarise Member States with the EU Standard  Operating Procedures (EU-SOPs)9, as part of preparing  for Cyber Europe 2012. The fi rst EuroSOPEx exercise was  organised on 30 May 2012 with Cyprus, Estonia, Greece,  Iceland and Malta. The second EuroSOPEx exercise was  organised on 6 June 2012 with Belgium, Denmark, Ireland,  Italy, Netherlands, Romania, and Spain. In 2013, ENISA will  continue to foster and facilitate regional cyber exercises  by organising two similar EuroSOPEx exercises based on  the specifi c fi ndings of the Cyber Europe 2012 report.  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-  crisis-cooperation/cyber-exercises/exercise-survey2012.  9  Available at ENISA’s resilience portal: https://resilience.enisa.  europa.eu  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  1 7  The EuroSOPEx 1&2 exercise report is available  upon request.  Cyber Exercise Scenario Modelling  (CESMO)  The aim of this work was to identify a model that can  help designers of cyber exercises to develop and model  their scenarios. The report defi nes the basic blocks that  make up cyber incidents such as the type of actor that  initiates and carries out the event, the threats that exist,  or the outcome of a cyber-incident. These basic building  blocks are then connected together in a logical fashion  that clarifi es the dependencies that exist between them.  For example, an incident aff ects a resource; an actor has  a motive. At a high-level, the model represents cyber-  incident scenarios as a sequence of events that can be  combined to form any type of scenario. At a low-level,  the model focuses on two major concepts, incidents  and impact. Incidents may be either intentional, such  as a malicious attack, or unintentional, such as a natural  disaster. Impact comes as the result of an incident and  may have virtual consequences, like loss of data or  privacy, as well as physical consequences, such as loss of  money or life.  To validate the eff ectiveness of the model and modelling  process, six sample scenarios involving cyber incidents  were modelled. In each scenario, the parameters of that  scenario were mapped onto the model, to demonstrate  its fl exibility and capability in representing cyber  incidents. Guidance is given on how the model and  modelling process may be instantiated using a simple  data base system.  Based on the fi ndings of this report, ENISA has developed  a pilot application for creating cyber exercise scenarios.  In 2013, ENISA experts will work on a more advanced  project that will use the existing CESMO prototype as  a starting point.  The report on Cyber Exercise Scenario Modelling is  available upon request.  EP3R - European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience  The European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience  (EP3R) was continued in 2012, to address the three  main areas established by the EP3R Non-Paper (the  memorandum that defi nes the initial establishment of  EP3R) in June 2010:  • Area 1: Key assets, resources and functions for the  continuous and secure provisioning of electronic  communications across countries.10  • Area 2: Baseline requirements for the security and  resilience of electronic communications.11  • Area 3: Coordination and cooperation needs  and mechanisms to prepare for and respond  to large-scale disruptions aff ecting electronic  communications.12  Four working groups were established to address these  areas with area 3 divided specifi cally between exercises  and botnets. Each working group reached a number  of conclusions in June 2012, and prepared for the new  cycle beginning in 2013. In 2012, ENISA also developed  an agile working model together with an enhanced  governance proposal for EP3R, and established task  forces. Task forces are smaller groups of 5-6 experts that  focus solely on 1-2 work packages. Each task force will  deliver their initial conclusions before the end of May  2013, and in June 2013, an EP3R plenary will vote on  each recommendation issued by the task forces.  All the work of EP3R experts (whether working groups  or task forces) is documented on the EP3R web portal13,  along with the EP3R publications to be delivered by the  end of December 2012.  10  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_  docs/ep3r_tor_area1.pdf  11  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_  docs/ep3r_tor_area2.pdf  12  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_  docs/ep3r_tor_area3.pdf  13  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ep3r/  (a login is requested to see this content)  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  18  SUPPORTING CERTS  AND OTHER NIS  COMMUNITIES  National/governmental Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) are responsible for supporting  the management of security incidents for systems and  networks within their country’s borders, as well as for  the protection of critical information infrastructure.  They act as an offi  cial national point of contact for their  counterparts in other Member States.  From the very beginning of ENISA’s existence, the  Agency has provided intensive support to this group  of stakeholders. Our aim is to continuously support the  establishment and operations of CERT teams, as they are  considered by Member States to be an indispensable  means for ensuring the resilience and stability of vital  ICT infrastructure.  Figure 1: national/governmental CERTs in Europe 2012  National/governmental CERTs –  Situation in Europe in 2012  The 2011 Progress Report on the CIIP Action Plan14 noted  that a minimum set of baseline capabilities and related  policy recommendations for a well-functioning network  of national/governmental Computer Emergency  Response Teams (n/g CERTs) in all Member States has  been developed. These developments encompass  preparedness, information sharing, co-ordination and  response. ENISA addressed this topic in detail and  presented a status report in 2012 on the deployment of  baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs in Europe.  14  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:201  1:0163:FIN:EN:PDF  The report describes the current situation in Europe  regarding n/g CERTs’ capabilities, and how they are  deployed. The current situation was assessed according  to four baseline capabilities previously defi ned by  ENISA and accepted by the CERT community.15 As the  report notes, the role of n/g CERTs is usually supported  by an offi  cial mandate. There are many variations  concerning the hosting organisations of n/g CERTs,  however. Several Member States have followed the  trend in creating national cyber-security centres. These  will ultimately be responsible for the implementation of  cyber-security strategies that integrate the functionality  of n/g CERTs. Key constituents such as governmental  bodies receive the complete menu of services, while  a subset of services is available for other constituents,  including end-users. More than 80% of n/g CERTs  employ 6–8 or more full-time equivalents, which is the  minimal staffi  ng level considered necessary to provide  an acceptable level of service.

In particular,  based on our experience to date, we have assisted  several Member States with the process of setting up  an n/g CERT. Our proactive attitude towards brokering  relationships between those Member States with a  particular requirement and those willing to share their  experience helped with this process in Ireland and  Romania this year.

INCSC is itself divided into three sections  covering computer security (CSG), critical national  infrastructure (CNIPF), and incident response (CSIRT-IE).  CSIRT-IE focuses on helping government departments  to protect their ICT infrastructure and data against  attack and misuse.  Romania  CERT-RO16 was established in response to the EU  action calling for n/g CERTs to be established in all  Member States, and was created by a law passed by the  Romanian Parliament in May 2011. The goals of CERT-RO  are to analyse and respond to cyber-security incidents  in Romania, and to develop national IT security policies  16  http://www.cert-ro.eu/index.php?lang=en  and strategies in conjunction with other public bodies. It  also acts as a national contact point for the international  community.  Figure 3: CERTs by Country – n/g CERTs in Ireland and Romania  ENISA’s updated recommendations  on gaps in the baseline capabilities of  national/governmental CERTs  Despite progress in the deployment of baseline  capabilities by n/g CERTs across Europe, there are  still several challenges which need to be addressed  by interested parties such as legislators, CERT teams  themselves, cooperation partners, international  initiatives and – last but not least – ordinary citizens.  That is why in 2012 ENISA presented an updated set of  recommendations on n/g CERTs’ baseline capabilities.  The gaps identifi ed and addressed in the report  are mainly legal and political. There are a number  of actions that need to be taken by policymakers  in the Member States to support n/g CERTs in their  work, especially regarding the protection of critical  information infrastructure and the coordination of  incident handling. This will require the clarifi cation  of n/g CERTs’ mandates, as well as incorporating the  provisions on n/g CERTs into national cyber-security  strategies. More concretely, the n/g CERTs should be  empowered to require the exchange of information  with telecommunication operators, Internet service  providers and law enforcement authorities.  Although the n/g CERTs cannot infl uence many of the  above-mentioned items on their own, they can take  action. For example, in a time of economic crisis and  with a perceived lack of funding for their activities, n/g  CERTs should actively look for additional resources such  as EU funds, consulting engagements with the private  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  20  sector, and research projects. It is also crucial that they  increase their transparency and visibility by publishing  general statistics on incidents and other activities  or by raising awareness of their actions among their  constituencies.

Seventh annual CERT workshop “CERTs  in Europe”  Part I: Technical training for national/ governmental CERTs  Every year ENISA organises the workshop “CERTs  in Europe” for national and governmental CERTs in  Europe. The workshop is one of the most effi  cient and  indispensable tools ENISA has for supporting CERT  teams in their daily work and for continuously improving  their capabilities.  The 7th annual workshop (Part I) took place on 14-15  June 2012 in Valletta, Malta. Last year the workshop  focused on addressing NIS aspects of cybercrime,  particularly the operational and technical aspects of the  collaboration between national/governmental CERTs  and the Law Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) in the EU  Member States. This year, the fi rst part of the workshop  focused on hands-on technical training for national/  governmental CERTs in Europe. ENISA enhanced CERTs’  capabilities in the EU Member States by providing  information on good operational practice and  facilitating suitable training and exercises. Hands-on  training for CERT team members on operational topics  is essential for improving the capabilities of the team as  a whole. ENISA, supported by the well-known Internet  security research fi rm Team Cymru, off ered two days  of deep technical information on topics like botnets  and mobile malware. The workshop was hosted by the  University of Malta.  Part II:  ENISA and EUROPOL joint forces on  fi ght against cybercrime  ENISA and Europol jointly organised the 7th annual  CERT Workshop, Part II, as a follow up event to the very  successful 6th Annual CERT workshop held last year  in Prague, Czech Republic. This year the workshop  was held at the Europol premises in The Hague, The  Netherlands on 16-17 October 2012. The focus remained  on cooperation between national/governmental  CERTs (n/g CERTs) in Europe and their national Law  Enforcement Authority counterparts (LEAs). Out of a  total number of 44 participants 15 represented n/g CERTs  and 12 represented national LEAs (usually the high tech  crime units). The other participants were experts from  industry as well as from international organisations.  Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece,  Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovenia,  Spain, United Kingdom were the EU Member States  that participated along with non-EU countries Norway  and Switzerland. Emphasis was placed on how to  increase the exchange of information on cybercrime  threats as well as cooperation between the n/g CERT  and LEA communities on a practical working level,  both nationally and across borders. There is an urgent  need for these two communities to collaborate because  of their complementary responsibilities. Currently,  however, in many cases this collaboration is very limited  and sometimes even non-existent. The workshop aimed  to identify synergies and gaps and practically address  these obstacles to cooperation. It was also a forum for  discussing the next steps that need to be taken in order  to improve collaboration in the short-term.  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  21  The fi ght against cybercrime  One of the key elements in the fi ght against cybercrime  is cooperation between diff erent actors involved  in this fi ght. While a lot of work has been done in  this area in some Member States, there is still room  for improvement. ENISA, therefore, has focused on  the cooperation between n/g CERTs and their LEA  counterparts.  ENISA started its support for operational collaboration  between CERTs and LEAs in 2010. Various activities,  including the workshops mentioned above, have since  been launched. In addition, in 2012 ENISA published a  Good Practice Guide concerning cooperation between  n/g CERTs and other stakeholders, primarily LEAs within  Europe.  The guide provides a snapshot of ENISAs  support for CERTs and LEAs, and includes good practices  and recommendations for both communities. Fostering  collaboration between CERTs and LEAs is, however, a  process of trust building, tackling obstacles together,  discussion and fi nally working together which will need  time and the active, continuous support of ENISA.  Figure 5: CERT / LEA interests17  CERT exercises – learning by doing  ENISA CERT exercises and training material were  introduced in 2008. In 2012 these were complemented  with new exercise scenarios containing essential  material for success in the CERT community and in  the fi eld of information security. ENISA CERT exercise  material consists of a handbook for teachers, a toolset  for students and a virtual image to support hands-on  training sessions. The complete set of material can be  found at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/  support/exercise  17  Adapted from presentation given at the Octopus Conference  of the Council of Europe Convention Against Cybercrime 21-23  November 2011, Strasbourg  The exercise and training material have been prepared  in great detail so that teachers can, with minimal eff ort,  prepare and conduct high quality training sessions that  are enjoyable for both teachers and students.  The exercise material covers operational, organisational,  and technical areas in the fi eld of CERT activities, and  supports the economically effi  cient training of CERT  teams or any relevant and interested target audience.  The training suite, for example, challenges students to  identify a malware infection inside a mobile device or  in a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  network and proposes the most effi  cient methodologies  for mitigating the incidents. From the management  point of view it off ers a solution for calculating the cost  of information security incidents that have occurred  within an organisation. It also suggests an economically  effi  cient method for mitigating the identifi ed risks  using calculations explained in the exercise “Cost of ICT  incident”  Those who are more interested in understanding  the organisational aspects of running a CERT might  be attracted to exercises that improve and develop  the communication skills and critical thinking in a  CERT team. Exercises such as “Cooperation with Law  Enforcement agencies” and “Assessing and Testing  Communication Channels with CERTs and all their  stakeholders” develop and improve such skills.  The whole exercise suite consists of 23 exercises,  ranging from technical hands-on training to training on  organisational aspects. The exercises meet the needs of  target audiences with diff erent skills and expectations.  The exercises available for immediate use are:  • Triage and basic incident handling  • Incident handling procedure testing  • Recruitment of CERT staff  • Developing CERT infrastructure  • Vulnerability handling  • Writing security advisories  • Network forensics  • Establishing external contacts  • Large-scale incident handling  • Automation in incident handling  • Incident handling in live role playing  • Cooperation with Law Enforcement Agencies  • Incident handling during an attack on Critical  Information Infrastructure  • Proactive incident detection  • Cost of ICT incident calculation  • Mobile incident handling  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  22  • Incident handling in the cloud  • Advanced persistent threat incident handling  • CERT participation in incident handling related to  the Article 13a obligations  • CERT participation in incident handling related to  Article 4 obligations  • Assessing and testing communication channels  between CERTs and all their stakeholders  • Social networks used as an attack vector for  targeted attacks  • Honeypots  Investing in training and exercises leads to a win-win  situation in which the CERT team’s skills are improved  and developed further. It may also indicate the gaps  where further training may be needed for improvement  of overall awareness and the security posture.  Honeypots – powerful tools for the  detection of incidents  In order to cope with the increasing number of complex  cyber-attacks, CERTs, the digital fi re brigades, need to  improve their operational capabilities in the proactive  detection of attacks.  The most common approach used by CERTs to handle  security incidents, is to wait for incoming incident  reports, then try to ‘treat’ the eff ects of the attacks but  not necessarily the ‘cause’. In such cases the incident  has already occurred and potentially had an impact on  production environments.  Another approach is possible, however, when dealing  with security incidents, and that is to be proactive  in detecting attacks by using honeypots to collect  attack information. This ‘threat intelligence’ includes  information such as the attack source and attack  technique. It may be used to block further attacks.  Honeypots are ‘digital traps’. They can be a service, an  application, a system or a piece of information whose  sole task is to be probed, attacked, compromised, used  or accessed in any unauthorized way. Honeypots are  core components of Early Warning Systems used in  attack detection.  The Proactive detection of security incidents: Honeypots  study that ENISA ran in 2012 was initiated to investigate  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  23  ‘digital traps’, or honeypot technologies, in-depth. The  goal was to identify technologies that can be used by  CERTs in general and national/governmental (n/g) CERTs  in particular to proactively detect and capture network  attacks directed at their constituencies. The core of  the document is an investigation of existing honeypot  and related technologies, with a focus on open-source  solutions, including online honeypots and sandboxes,  and other early warning systems or initiatives. One  of the study’s fi ndings was that while honeypots are  recognised by CERTs as useful tools that can be utilised  to detect and study attacks, their usage in the CERT  community is not as widespread as would be expected.  This implies that barriers exist to their deployment.  The Proactive detection of security incidents:  Honeypots study is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/  proactive-detection-of-security-incidents-II-honeypots  EISAS Pilot: a collaborative approach to  reach out to EU citizens and small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  No fi rewall or security policy can effi  ciently protect  users if they are not suffi  ciently aware of the risks they  are facing. As European Commissioner Neelie Kroes has  said, “Cyber security is also about ensuring ordinary  computer users are ‘Web Wise’”.  Introduced by the European Commission in 2006, EISAS,  the European Information Sharing and Alert System,  aims to enhance the cooperation of Member States in  reaching out to citizens and small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) with relevant security information.  This year ENISA ran the EISAS Pilot project. National/  governmental CERTs and other communities in  Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Norway, Spain and Poland  participated in a collaborative cross-border awareness  raising eff ort. Innovative awareness raising materials  were obtained from major public and private actors  at a national level. An international team was set up to  process and adapt the materials to the particularities of  each stakeholder’s population. These materials were  then disseminated to EU citizens and SMEs through  social networks and other communication channels.  In due course, this large-scale pilot reached more  than 1,700 people. Citizens and SMEs across Europe  were empowered with security knowledge to protect  themselves against some of today’s most critical cyber  threats. However, the achievement of this pilot project  goes beyond raising citizens’ awareness; it also shows  that European collaboration in awareness raising works  and off ers a cost-eff ective solution to better prepare EU  citizens facing ever-evolving cyber threats.  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  24  SECURE SERVICES  The work performed within the framework of Secure  Services includes areas of privacy and trust, security  governance and electronic identities/trust services.  Projects in the area of privacy and trust started in 2010  and were very well received by many stakeholders,  which led to the extension of this topic in the following  years. The Agency performed numerous studies on  topics such as trustmarks, the right to be forgotten,  and behavioural tracking. At the same time, ENISA  continued its work on the implementation of the data  breach notifi cation obligation in the EU, becoming a  centre of expertise in this area.  For 2012, the Secure Services activities and tasks are  defi ned within the ENISA Work Programme 2012 –  Improving Information Security Through Collaboration.  The activities are included within Work Stream (WS)  4: Securing the Digital Economy. The work packages  dedicated to Secure Services are Work Package WPK  4.2: Secure governance; and WP 4.3: Supporting the  development of secure, interoperable services.  Privacy and trust  Trustmarks  As online users, we increasingly face the decision of  whether or not to trust specifi c applications or services.  One way we deal with this situation is by taking  decisions based on recommendations made by our  family, friends, colleagues or other trusted sources. In  addition, an increasing number of trust indicators, such  as trustmarks and seals, are becoming available to assist  us in our decision-making. These labels are issued by  national, international or commercial bodies, most of  which use standardised methodologies for assessing  and certifying products, processes, or persons. The EU  data protection legislation framework is also under  revision and further work is being carried out in the  area of privacy seals by bodies such as the European  Commission’s Directorate General for Justice (DG  JUST) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). This work  complements that of other initiatives and provides  a good starting point for further work by other  stakeholders.  Deliverable: Developing recommendations for an EU  approach on certifi cation schemes. Identifying criteria  and certifi cation levels for trustmarks – delayed, due to  postponement of the EC project on seals.  The right to be forgotten  The right to be forgotten is included in the proposed  Regulation on data protection published by the  European Commission in January 2012. The Regulation  remains to be adopted by the European Parliament  before entering into force. The diff erent legal aspects of  the right to be forgotten, such as the right to erasure  or the right to oblivion, have been debated in diff erent  contexts and are beyond the scope of this paper.  Instead, with this paper we focus on the technical  means to enforce or support the right to be forgotten  in information systems. The paper shows that there are  technical limitations as well as the need to clearly defi ne  terminology and legal aspects.  The report The Right to be forgotten - between  expectations and practice is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/the-right-to-be-forgotten  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  25  Privacy considerations of online  behavioural tracking  Internet users are being increasingly tracked and  profi led and their personal data are used extensively as  currency in exchange for services. It is important that  this new reality is better understood by all stakeholders  in order to support and respect the right to privacy.  The report Privacy considerations of online  behavioural tracking is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/privacy-considerations-of-  online-behavioural-tracking  Annual Privacy Forum 2012  Privacy is an area that is multidisciplinary by its  nature. Regulations, legal frameworks, technology,  user adoption, and economic considerations are all  necessary for elevating privacy to the status of an  accepted societal norm. A crucial element of individual  protection and autonomy is also individuals’ ability  to understand and act on their context, assisted by  appropriate and intuitive tools.  Against this backdrop, the fi rst Annual Privacy Forum  (APF’12) was held in Limassol, Cyprus from 10-11  October 2012. The Forum was co-organised by ENISA  and the European Commission’s Directorate General for  Communications Networks, Content and Technology  (DG CONNECT), with the support of the Department  of Computer Science of the University of Cyprus.  APF’12 was endorsed as an offi  cial event of the Cyprus  Presidency of the Council of the European Union. At the  Forum, 20 papers were presented and four technical  sessions and three panel sessions were held. In addition,  keynote speakers representing the Council Presidency,  the European Commission, industry and research  participated in the event. APF’2012 was attended by  71 researchers, academics, industry representatives  and policy makers from 12 countries (including several  non-EU countries), exceeding the objectives set.  Moreover, the Forum website has had more than 1,000  visitors, over 1,700 visits and over 5,500 page views.  The main objective of the Commission and ENISA is for the  Forum to evolve into an annual event that will foster dialogue  between the policy, research and industrial communities,  thus “closing the loop from research to policy”.  The report of the Annual Privacy Forum is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/report-on-annual-privacy-  forum-2012  Security governance  Supply chain integrity  Supply Chain Integrity (SCI) in the ICT industry is a topic  receiving attention from both the public and private  sectors – including vendors, infrastructure owners,  operators, and others – as part of a wider review of supply  chain management. Understanding supply chains is critical  to business success and thus to the economy of nation  states. ENISA focused on supply chain integrity in 2012  with a view to providing guidance to EU Member States.  One of the many aims of this work was to identify what  SCI means in the ICT context and to propose means for  ensuring SCI, primarily by taking the telecommunications  sub-sector as a model for ICT in general.  The report An overview of the ICT supply chain risks  and challenges, and vision for the way forward is  available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/sci  Methodology for severity assessment of  data breaches  In 2011, the Agency developed specifi c technical  recommendations for the implementation of Article 4  of the e-Privacy Directive, these included:  • Criteria for determining when a data breach has occurred  • Identifying and assessing security controls that help  determine when a breach has occurred  • Identifying and assessing the risks regarding data  breaches  • Developing procedures for notifi cation when data  breaches occur, in either the private or public sector  As a continuation of this work, in 2012 ENISA  collaborated very closely with the national Data  Protection Authorities participating in the Technology  Subgroup of the Art. 29 Working Party on developing a  specifi c methodology for assessing the severity of data  breaches. In view of the need for extensive discussions  among multiple national Data Protection Authorities,  this work was not fi nalised in 2012 and will continue in  the fi rst quarter of 2013.  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  26  Electronic identities and trust services  Notifi cations of security breaches at trust  service providers  E-Government services have signifi cant potential to  make public services more effi  cient for the benefi t of  citizens and businesses in terms of time and money,  and while these benefi ts are increasingly being realised  at the national level, e-Government services still face  administrative and legal barriers at the cross-border  level. In order to remove existing barriers to cross-border  e-ID based services, the European Commission has  proposed a draft Regulation on electronic identifi cation  and trust services for electronic transactions in  the internal market, which will replace the existing  Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC. Article 15  of the proposed Regulation requires that trust service  providers undertake extensive security measures and  notify competent bodies of any breach of security and  loss of integrity that could have a signifi cant impact on  the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein. ENISA has reviewed the feasibility  of implementing this article and provided guidelines  for such implementation.  The report Implementation of article 15 of the draft  Regulation on electronic identifi cation and trusted  services for electronic transactions in the internal  market is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-  trust/library/deliverables/implementation-of-article-15  IDENTIFYING AND  RESPONDING TO THE  EVOLVING THREAT  ENVIRONMENT Information Security is about managing risks and  threats linked to the security of information and  information systems. ENISA’s objective in this work is to  provide stakeholders with information on how risks and  threats are evolving. More specifi cally, the aim is to link  particular trends to particular stakeholder communities,  thereby helping such communities to recognise and  respond to changes in the threat landscape that are  particularly relevant to their activities. In addition,  suitable mitigation strategies have been proposed and  recommendations and implementation options for  dealing with the identifi ed risks have been identifi ed.  The emphasis is on the provision of non-technical  information regarding all the components of risks.  ENISA emerging threat landscape  As with information security, the ability to respond to  the evolving cyber-threat environment is a journey  rather than a destination. There is and will always be  an “arms race” in cyber space between attackers and  defenders. The bad news is that currently attackers are  one step ahead. In this race, it is impossible to know  your opponents without understanding their methods  of attack. Hence, analysing threats is essential for  protecting cyber assets. It needs to be within the focus  of information security professionals.  The ENISA Threat Landscape is based on publicly  available data and provides an independent view on  threats, threat agents and threat trends observed.  The current top cyber threats have been identifi ed. In  addition, current threat trends have been derived by  comparing current threat information with that from  previous years. Finally, a number of threat trends for  emerging areas of information technology have been  identifi ed. The emerging areas taken into account  were: Mobile Computing, Social Technology, Critical  Infrastructures, Trust Infrastructures, Cloud Computing  and Big Data. An overview of the ENISA Threat  Landscape is shown in Table 1.  The ENISA Threat Landscape is available at:  h t t p s : // w w w. e n is a . e u r o p a . e u /a c t i v i t i e s /r i s k-  management/evolving-threat-environment/ENISA_  Threat_Landscape  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  27  Given the specifi c trends towards Mobile Computing,  shown in Table 1, ENISA has delivered detailed  assessments in the areas of “Consumerization of IT” and  “Bring Your Own Device”. This work covers risks as well  as opportunities emerging from mobile computing. A  set of security policies for the mitigation of these risks  has been developed.  The report Consumerization of IT: Risk Assessment  and Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices is  available at:  h t t p s : // w w w. e n i s a . e u r o p a . e u /a c t i v i t i e s /r i s k-  management/evolving-threat-environment/COIT_  Risk_Mitigation_Strategies  The ENISA Threat Landscape is a contribution towards  understanding the ‘cyber enemy’. Many steps need  to follow, however, to collect the intelligence and  knowledge needed to defeat cyber-attacks. Some of  those steps are:  • Collect and develop better evidence about attack  vectors  • Collect and develop better evidence about impact  achieved by adversaries  • Collect and maintain more qualitative information  about threat agents  • Use common terminology within threat reports  • Include the user perspective  • Develop use cases for threat landscapes  • Collect security intelligence that covers incidents  in an end-to-end manner  • Perform a shift in security controls to  accommodate emerging threat trends  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  28  Key fi ndings regarding the threat landscape  Top Threats Current  Trends  Top Emerging Trends  Mobile  Computing  Social  Technology  Critical  Infrastr.

To address this issue, ENISA conducted  an assessment. The assessment provides guidance  on developing eff ective strategies and policies for  mitigating the underlying risks. The analysis examines  three areas of mitigation that should be considered in  concert: technical considerations, governance aspects  and the prevailing regulatory environment. Each  organisation should create an eff ective blend of the  three areas in their mitigation strategies.  The analysis also identifi es relevant security controls  that could facilitate the eff orts of stakeholders to  develop and implement a combination of controls in  their risk mitigation plans. While there is no “one size fi ts  all” solution, a combination of controls can be chosen  which suits a stakeholder’s particular operational  setting, strategy and policy requirements.  Identifying Consumerization of IT (COIT)  risks  It is important to identify which COIT risks need to be  mitigated within your organisation while the window  of opportunity still remains open (see opportunity  assessment in Consumerization of IT: Top Risks and  Opportunities, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/  risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/  consumerization-of-it-top-risks-and-opportunities/  at_download/fullReport)  29  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  5 key messages for decision makers  Five key messages for decision makers, such as  Chief Information Offi  cers and Chief Executives,  have been derived from this report:  • Ensure that governance aspects are  derived from business processes and  protection requirements and are defi ned  before dealing with technology.  • End-user involvement can eff ectively  mitigate risks. Awareness raising on COIT  programmes is highly eff ective for the  enforcement of security policies.  • Periodic risk assessment on COIT  programmes should be undertaken  to ensure that security policies remain  compatible with evolving technologies.  • Keep in mind that encryption  complements, but does not replace,  strategic risk management within a COIT  programme.  • Perform small steps initially and proceed  with more complex policies when  suffi  cient experience has been gained.  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  Citizens are increasingly relying on the Internet in their  everyday lives for banking, shopping, education and  a number of other services. It is, therefore, important  that they are able to use the Internet in a secure and  confi dent manner.  Making the Internet a better place for all citizens is a  shared responsibility, at both the European and global  level. The EU Cyber Security Strategy, due for release  in the near future, will set out just how important this  is, with concrete proposals to improve digital security.  Moreover, the European Union has been working with  the US, and at last year’s EU-US Summit, several steps  were agreed upon to help make the online world  secure, on both sides of the Atlantic.  For the fi rst time, last October, a European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) took place as a pilot project across  Europe. The ECSM campaign raised awareness about  Network and Information Security (NIS). It was planned  in the EU-US Summit fi nal report and in the roadmap  produced by the awareness-raising sub-group of the  EU-US Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-  crime in December 2011. The project was supported by  ENISA and the European Commission.  The main objectives of the European Cyber Security  Month were to:  • Generate general awareness about Network and  Information Security  • Promote safer use of the Internet for all users  • Build a strong track record to raise awareness  through the ECSM  • Involve relevant stakeholders  • Increase national media interest through the  European and international dimension of the  project  • Enhance attention and interest with regard to  information security through political and media  coordination  This year, eight countries participated in the fi rst  European Cyber Security Month: the Czech Republic,  Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia,  Spain and the United Kingdom. These countries replied  positively either to a call for expressions of interest  to organise ‘Security week’ pilot projects sent to all  members of the awareness-raising sub-group of the  EU-US Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-  crime, or to a communication campaign on the project  initiated by ENISA.  Latvia, together with the Council of the European Union,  offi  cially supported the project. Each pilot country  decided upon the scope and number of activities and  events to be organised.  Over the course of the month of October, a range of  local activities and events were held across Europe to  raise the security awareness of diff erent target groups.  These included, among others:  • Conferences and workshops in Norway, Portugal  and Spain  • Media and social media campaigns in Norway and  Slovenia  • Non-governmental organisation (NGO) round  tables in the Czech Republic  • Competitions and quizzes in Luxembourg, Norway  and Slovenia  • Roadshows in the United Kingdom  30  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  Each country built on its own existing activities and  experience for maximum impact. The private sector was  involved in almost all pilot countries. The proportion  of campaigns encompassing general users versus  those targeting business users was almost the same.  A wide variety of key messages were promoted across  the diff erent European countries by using a variety of  techniques that were fun, exciting and motivating. The  wide variety of delivery channels used made it possible  to match diff erent messages to diff erent media and  opportunities across all sectors and countries.  ENISA supported the organisation of the European  Cyber Security Month pilot projects in various ways. The  Agency coordinated the organisation of the 2012 ECSM,  acting as the hub for all pilot countries by providing  suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating  synergies between countries when possible. For  example, the interaction between Luxembourg  and Norway and that between the United Kingdom  and Slovenia, along with Norway, demonstrated  how successful synergies could be. ENISA provided  guidance on how to organise information security  campaigns using its methodology on how to prepare  and implement awareness campaigns. In addition, the  Agency developed a series of common messages and  material to help Member States prepare their cyber  security education and awareness campaigns in similar  ways. This material was recognised by all countries as  an important tool in reaching people and getting them  to change their behaviour, or for reinforcing good  behaviour. The fi rst European Cyber Security Month  pilot project was successful, especially because of the  engagement, existing good practices and experience of  the participating countries.  ACTIVITIES FOR  AWARENESS RAISING  AMONG END USERS  Involving intermediaries in cyber  security awareness raising  ENISA and the European Commission have been  co-operating with the US Department of Homeland  Security on “Involving Intermediaries in Cyber  Security Awareness Raising’’. The project developed  mechanisms for cross-border cooperation as well  as for public-private cooperation and information  exchange. Forty- ive EU and US representatives from  the private and public sectors gathered in Brussels  to discuss the topic of “Involving Intermediaries in  Cyber Security Awareness Raising’’.  Key conclusions:  • Make companies aware that awareness  raising will help them to create business  opportunities and make money by  burnishing their brand image.  • Cyber security is a matter of cultural  challenge and behavioural change.  • Remember not to scare users and to  encourage them to get online, but in  a safe way. Do not start technical. This  is about communication. Therefore,  messages have to resonate with the target  audiences.

Together with the information  we hope to also introduce the reader to the ‘can do’  attitude that should be deployed by educators and  their students of diff erent age groups. The report  addresses educators, such as trainers, teachers, and  peers involved in formal education and non-formal  education, including lifelong learning.  The report consists of three parts, each of which is  equally important:  • Results of the survey and consultations with  stakeholders involved at diff erent levels in  Germany, Romania, The Netherlands, Estonia,  Italy, Greece, Ireland and Poland as well as bodies  like the Open Web Application Security Project  (OWASP)  • ENISA recommendations from 2012 deliverables  • Case studies from Austria, Luxembourg and  Denmark  Some of the most important recommendations from  the report are:  • Cyber-security strategies should include a  subsection on education and research as part of  the overall strategy  • There is a need to promote awareness of personal  information security and regarding legal advice  on misbehaviour  • A new didactic approach and ‘textbook-atlas-  concept’ should be used for NIS manuals  • Using pseudonyms and aliases on the Internet is  the fi rst step to protecting your personal data  The report Collaborative solutions for Network  Information Security in education is available at:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-  relations/nis-brokerage-1/collaborative-solutions-for-  network-information-security-in-education  ENISA OPER ATIONAL ACTIVITIES  31  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  34  COMMUNICATING  CYBERSECURITY  RESULTS  ENISA’s Public Aff airs Unit (PAU) continued to keep the  Agency and its mission in the spotlight during 2012.  Notable achievements included the redesign of ENISA’s  web site and the addition of social media to the Agency’s  communications channels. The year also saw closer  cooperation with local and national media, resulting  in TV coverage, editorials in the press and articles  published in online news portals. PAU gained Europe-  wide coverage for Cyber Europe 2012 – the second, and  to date, largest, pan-European cyber security exercise.  Broadly speaking, the Public Aff airs Unit focused on  six areas during 2012:  1. Deepening and broadening audience impact  across Europe and locally  2. Gaining increased media coverage  3. Enhancing the use of digital media  4. Ensuring coherence and consistency –  communication planning  5. Strengthening the ENISA brand  6. Internal communication  DEEPENING AND  BROADENING  AUDIENCE IMPACT  ACROSS EUROPE AND  LOCALLY  As the cyber security information hub, PAU’s focus is on  communicating the results of ENISA’s operational work  to diverse audiences through the appropriate channels.  This is a key element of ENISA’s mandated mission to  develop a cyber-security culture that will result in a safe  and sound digital society. ENISA’s Public Aff airs Unit  outreach channels include public relations campaigns,  digital communications, both external and internal  communications, and media activity and events across  the EU.  Deepening and broadening communication with  various audiences was a major thrust of PAU’s work in  2012. To do so, the unit organised or participated in  joint events with other EU bodies, such as the high-level  cyber event in Brussels that brought ENISA together  with representatives of the European Parliament, the  European Commission and industry. The Agency also  engaged in outreach work, particularly with the local  community, such as organising a Europe Day celebration  event on Crete to highlight the benefi ts of information  and communication technology for all of Europe’s  children. The Public Aff airs team has also worked to  further strengthen ties with Greece’s government,  which hosts the Agency in Heraklion and Athens.  Moreover, in 2012, ENISA engaged in collaborations  with the Regional Governor of Crete and the Heraklion  local authorities.  GAINING INCREASED  MEDIA COVERAGE  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme  provides the Agency with an opportunity to reach  many more of its stakeholders than it can through  direct means. In 2012, the Agency adopted a new media  outreach distribution and media monitoring process  to enhance the targeting and reach of its media work.  Major accomplishments include:  • Produced and issued 25 media releases.  • Posted more than 80 individual news items on the  ENISA web site.  • Many media releases and news items  simultaneously published in the Agency’s social  media channels.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  35  Multi-lingual approach  As a fundamental part of ENISA’s work is to make its  messages accessible to stakeholders across Europe,  the Agency issues media releases in fi ve EU languages:  English, German, French, Spanish and Greek, to press,  radio, television and web-based news organisations. It  also maintains online landing pages in German, French  and Greek. ENISA media releases are distributed to  both general media, and specialised ICT/Network and  Information Security publications and web sites. Media  monitoring analysis and in depth-evaluation of the  Agency’s media output shows that in 2012, this work  generated more than 2,000 stories in European news  media, and that stories appeared in all 23 EU languages.  Cross-media impact  Figures show a clear correlation between peaks in  web visitors and the distribution of media releases in  multiple channels, thus demonstrating the benefi cial  eff ect of media activity. Overall, ENISA reached a  combined potential audience of several million readers,  listeners and viewers. Directly, news stories on the  ENISA web site received more than 171,000 unique page  views in 2012.  Cyber Europe 2012  A major media focus during the autumn was the Cyber  Europe 2012 security exercise. This was the second  pan-European cyber security exercise, following  on from Cyber Europe 2010, and from the fi rst ever  EU-US exercise, Cyber Europe 2011. The 2012 exercise  was Europe’s biggest to date, involving around 400  individual participants. In addition to involvement from  all EU Member States, the exercise included the private  sector for the fi rst time, with telecommunications,  banking, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) taking  part. This major event required a fully coordinated  Communication Strategy, drawn up by the Public Aff airs  Unit, in close collaboration with the Commission, and  the Member States. The exercise’s ‘media footprint’  included more than 225 individual stories across Europe  and globally.  More than 100 of these were on the day of  the exercise itself, and included live interviews.  With regard to ENISA’s wider work, the Public Aff airs  Unit organised two special media briefi ngs in Brussels  – one in relation to a European Parliament hearing.  Other media outreach work included a high-level event  examining European cooperation in cyber security. The  event involved key EU policy makers, stakeholders, and  research and industry participants.  Other media outreach activities  Other press conferences and briefi ngs were targeted  at media in specifi c countries or around Network  Information Security special interest areas. As part of  its media activities, the Agency also produced a Crisis  Communication Strategy and Scenario Plan in 2012,  which it will continue to develop in 2013.  DIGITAL MEDIA  ENISA’s website continues to be the Agency’s principal  communications channel. In 2012, development work  was carried out to re-design the website and enhance  its interactivity for users. A new template layout was  introduced throughout the website and the information  structure of the home page and publications was  improved. A faceted search for publications was  introduced to improve the search function. Three mini-  sites in French, German and Greek were also launched.  Social media  The launch of social media channels – Facebook,  LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube – has enabled ENISA to  connect with new communities or deepen its ties with  existing ones. The channels are accessible through the  website’s home page.  Website Improvements  Further enhancing the website for users, and helping  visitors to navigate with greater ease to fi nd the  information they are looking for, is an on-going  process. To this end, after the launch of the new  design, a web usability project was also carried out  in 2012, the results of which will be used in 2013 to  augment and improve the information architecture of  further sections of the site.  Technical improvements in 2012 included the  development of web tools for the Agency’s extranets  (portals), used by specialist expert communities, and  the application of all security patches to the Zope  application and PHP scripting used by the ENISA site.  Further enhancements and improvements will be  carried out on the website in 2013. These will include an  improved content structure, based on the results of the  web usability project, and further development of the  French, German and Greek mini-sites.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  36  Video  Turning to other digital media, in 2012, the Public Aff airs  Unit produced videos covering key areas of activity, such  as the Cyber Europe 2012 exercise, Incident Reporting  and a corporate info fi lm and clip. For 2013, ENISA  envisages the production of videos and other digital  products such as podcasts and info fi lms that underline  the achievements in ENISA’s major work-streams.  ENSURING COHERENCE  AND CONSISTENCY:  COMMUNICATION  PLANNING  In 2012, the Public Aff airs Unit ensured that ENISA’s  corporate communications activity was fully aligned  with ENISA’s operational and policy development  goals. Partly this entailed forming close links with  the European Parliament, the European Commission,  the Council and Member States. All communications  activity falls within the scope of six planned areas of  Public Aff airs activity in ENISA’s work programme. This  ensures that information forms part of a coherent and  consistent narrative on the Agency’s work. In addition,  the continuing provision of high quality editorial,  graphic design and printing services, through contracts  managed by PAU, has helped to ensure quality and  consistency in ENISA’s communications.  STRENGTHENING THE  ENISA BRAND  Branding  Given the nature of ENISA’s mission, branding is an  important aspect of PAU’s work. A strong ENISA  brand helps the Agency to achieve consistent and  coherent results with all of its communications. It raises  awareness and increases understanding regarding  Network Information Security issues. The ENISA brand  was strengthened in 2012 through several means:  • Visual identity: the ENISA brand’s visual identity  was developed further in 2012 through updated  brand guidelines. The new visual identity will be  launched in early 2013.  • Campaigns: to increase awareness and  recognition of the ENISA brand, campaigns were  run in Brussels-based publications.  • Promotional material: promotional material has  been produced on a regular basis and distributed  both during corporate events and to visitors.  Special focus was given to children this year,  notably with the Europe Day celebrations.  An effective brand strategy is the key to connecting  effectively with our audiences. Therefore, refreshing  the look and feel of ENISA material will create a new  chapter in the way the Agency communicates and is  perceived.  Publications  Publications are the ‘face’ of the ENISA brand and an  important communication tool given ENISA’s mission.  Through 2012, ENISA published around 40 publications  as Work Programme ‘deliverables’ and produced  around 30 other reports, papers and studies. The Public  Aff airs Unit assists with the editing and design of these  publications, and during 2012, a brand new publication  review process was developed, with the close support  of the Agency’s Quality Control Advisor.  Along with the writing and design of the Agency’s  General Report, in 2012, the Public Aff airs team also  produced a special report for the ENISA high-level event  in November, EU Cyber cooperation: the digital frontline.  The report gave an overview of Europe’s cyber security  position and examined areas where cooperation can  ensure a secure digital environment.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS  37  In 2012, the Public Aff airs team worked with the  Agency’s NIS experts to step up the frequency of its  special Flash Notes – short expert reports published  to provide advice, guidance or commentary on a ‘hot  topic’ in security.  Subjects covered included the Flamer  cyber attacks on Middle-Eastern oil and gas companies,  the ‘high roller’ automated attacks on bank accounts,  and the ease with which customers’ passwords can be  stolen from some large organisations. The Flash Notes  were extremely well received because of their frankness  and immediacy, and the Agency will do more in this area  in 2013. In early 2013, PAU will also begin publication of  a brand new ENISA monthly newsletter.  On a wider front, a poster campaign for child protection  online was successfully launched, and will be translated  and distributed in every Member State through the EU  Representations and Info points.  INTERNAL  COMMUNICATION Employees are ENISA’s key ambassadors and reaching  them successfully is both challenging and rewarding.  Defi ning common ground between 60 members of  staff  from 18 diff erent Member States is a continuous  challenge. Activities revolving around internal  information planning, best practices and resourcing  help to shape a culture of cooperation and support  within ENISA, a culture which is developed through  staff  meetings and social events, as well as through  an in-house intranet platform. The dynamics of the  workplace are changing internal communications,  however, as the rapid development of communications-  related technology and the rapid expansion of  communications channels create opportunities and  challenges.  During 2012, employee engagement has been  encouraged through follow-up on internal surveys and  teambuilding events. Strengthening common goals for  all staff  and encouraging on-going interaction have  also been crucial at a time when the Agency has been  reorganised, and greater focus placed on the Agency’s  Athens-based mobile team. Clear communication is  essential during times of change, and the Public Aff airs  team is closely involved in keeping staff  updated on  these developments.  CONFERENCES, JOINT  EVENTS AND VISITS  The Public Aff airs events coordinator organised 60  ENISA conferences and events in 2012. In addition, the  Agency took part in numerous external events and  high-level European conferences.  One of the key events during the year was ENISA’s  high-level event, “EU cyber cooperation”, which took  place in November in Brussels. The event explored how  greater cooperation can help to enhance cyber security  across Europe, and brought together experts from the  European Commission, the European Parliament and  industry. An audience made up of people from the  worlds of network and information security and politics  had the opportunity to watch the debate and put  questions to the panel.  In addition to these activities, the Public Aff airs Unit  provided support to the Executive Director for his  participation in events across Europe. These included  a round table presentation at the European Parliament,  made at the special request of members of the  Parliament’s Committee for Industry, Research, and  Energy (ITRE) Committee. In-house events facilitated by  the Public Aff airs team included a visit in July by MEPs  from the European Parliament’s ITRE Committee. The  group included Rapporteur, Giles Chichester, Amelia  Andersdotter and Ivailo Kafl in.  In September, MEP Jutta Haug, a Vice Chair of the  Parliament’s Budget Committee, visited the Agency  to learn more about its future plans and excellent  budgetary performance.  RELATIONS WITH  ENISA STAKEHOLDERS  REL ATIONS WITH ENISA STAKEHOLDERS  40  ENISA’s stakeholder relations are a key factor in the  success of its overall mission of contributing to the  security of the EU internal market. The Management  Board (composed of the Commission, Member State  and private sector representatives) and Permanent  Stakeholders Group (composed of multiple  stakeholders), as well as the Agency’s informal networks  and expert working parties, give ENISA unparalleled  insights and access to public and private sector  Network and Information Security (NIS) experts. This  in turn enables ENISA to identify emerging risks and  gain new insights in order to help Member States and  private sector organisations better prepare themselves  for challenges in a proactive and professional manner,  as well as to build novel public and private sector  partnerships.  MANAGEMENT BOARD  The Agency is governed by a Management Board (MB),  composed of one representative from each EU Member  State and EEA country (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and  Norway), three representatives from the Commission  and three representatives from designated stakeholder  groups (the information and communication  technology industry, consumer groups; academic  experts in network and information security).  In line with established practice, two MB meetings were  held as planned during 2012. In addition to several,  regular and extraordinary administrative, management  and budgetary items, the preparation and subsequent  adoption of the Budget and the Work Programme for  2013 were important activities during the year.  Minutes and decisions of the Management Board are  available on the ENISA website: http://www.enisa.  europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/  management-board/minutes-decisions-1  Furthermore, an informal joint meeting between the  MB and the Permanent Stakeholders Group took place  in February 2012. The meeting focused on setting the  priorities and deliverables of the Work Programme  2013. In addition, an informal MB meeting on strategic  guidance for Work Programme 2014 was held in  November 2012.  For a list of members of the MB, see Appendix: Members  of the Management Board  PERMANENT  STAKEHOLDERS GROUP  The ENISA Permanent Stakeholders group (PSG)  facilitates the Agency’s regular dialogue with the  private sector, academia, consumer organisations and  other relevant stakeholders. The PSG is composed of  30 experts in Network and Information Security who  provide advice to the Executive director and input for  the annual work programme. The term of offi  ce of the  PSG is two and a half years. Following the open call for  Members in April 2012, a new composition of the PSG  was established. The 30 appointed members formally  started their term of offi  ce on 17 August 2012.  For the list of members of the PSG, see Appendix:  Members of the Permanent Stakeholders Group.  The PSG met three times in 2012, in April, September  and November. The September meeting was an  introductory meeting for the new members, which was  followed by the meeting in November to discuss the  themes and possible deliverables for the ENISA Work  Programme 2014.  RESPONDING TO  REQUESTS FOR  ASSISTANCE FROM  MEMBER STATES  Throughout 2012, ENISA received inquiries as well as a  number of requests for advice and assistance according  to Article 10 of ENISA’s founding Regulation. Altogether,  13 requests according to art. 10 were received by  ENISA from various Member States and EU Institutions  referring to diff erent areas of NIS-activities.  Please see Appendix 4: Handling of requests for  Advice and Assistance in 2012 for more information.  REL ATIONS WITH ENISA STAKEHOLDERS  41  NATIONAL LIAISON  OFFICER (NLO)  NETWORK  Although not formally based on ENISA’s Regulation, the  network of National Liaison Offi  cers (NLOs) is very helpful  to the Agency, improving the production of deliverables  that match stakeholders’ expectations and needs. NLOs  serve as ENISA’s primary contact point within the Member  States. They liaise with national bodies and institutions in  their respective Member State, and build and maintain  a national network of contacts that includes relevant  stakeholders in their country.  NLOs are well placed to reinforce the impact of the  Agency in the Member States, and to facilitate the  exchange of information between ENISA and its  stakeholders as well as amongst them. They do this by  disseminating ENISA’s deliverables, Press Releases, and  procurement and vacancy notices, and by providing  feedback on the impact of ENISA deliverables and  outcomes in their country.  During 2012, ENISA conducted a survey to gather  information about the members of the NCO and the  means of dissemination used by each respective NLO.  The survey showed that most of the Member States  have in place adequate dissemination tools in order  to reach a relevant number of stakeholders in the EU.  The survey also recommended areas for improvement,  such as using structured channels of communication  to categorise the information and produce targeted  messages to stakeholders.  Also during 2012 the Management Board newsletter  distribution list was expanded to include NLOs.  For the list of members of the NLOs, see Appendix:  Members of the National Liaison Offi  cers network.  The NLO-network met once in November 2012 in  Athens, Greece. The primary purpose of this meeting  was a discussion on how to enhance collaboration and  the reach of ENISA’s dissemination activities within the  Member States.  The NLO team  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT  AND ADMINISTRATION  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTR ATION  44  The IT and Facilities Management Unit (ITFMU) and the Administration Department play a supportive yet  important role in enabling ENISA’s operational units to smoothly and securely execute their work.  FACILITIES  MANAGEMENT  Following the agreement to open a branch offi  ce  in Athens, serious eff ort was put into the selection  of a suitable location. The implementation of Lync  telephony as well as Direct Access will allow those staff  involved to easily transition to the new offi  ce.  ADMINISTRATION  The Administration Department seeks to ensure  compliance and deliver services reliably to the  ENISA’s operational units. It does so by enhancing  the functionality of the administrative procedures  of the Agency that are mandated by the regulatory  framework. The main tasks of the department are  represented below:  Human resources  As a knowledge-based organisation, ENISA relies on its  personnel to deliver its services to its stakeholders and  ensure compliance with the regulatory framework. The  Agency also strives to implement modern HR practices  such as teleworking and fl exitime. As an EU Agency,  ENISA benefi ts from having a diverse multi-national  workforce, as demonstrated in the statistics regarding  personnel at ENISA presented below:18  Staff  in service: 58 Staff  Members: 42 Temporary Agents  (27 TA AD’s, 15 TA AST’s), 12 CA’s, 4 SNE’s.  Note: 7 Staff  members have double nationality: 2 GR/  NL, 1 IT/AU, 1GB/IT, 1 CY/GR, 1 NL/CH, 1 GR/DE.  18  Last update: 31 December 2012.  INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY  As one of the guardians of Network and Information  Security (NIS) in Europe, ENISA needs to practice  what it preaches. We therefore strive to achieve  a high level of security for our own information  technology infrastructure. Moreover, to keep abreast  of the latest technological developments, we keep  our IT infrastructure up-to-date with the most modern  technologies. The IT and Facilities Management Unit  (ITFMU) is tasked not only with maintaining ENISA’s IT  infrastructure and facilities, but with ensuring that the  Agency follows IT best practise in doing so.  Collaboration and Mobility  In order to enhance user collaboration and  communication, as well as off er integrated online  meeting services, ENISA implemented Microsoft Lync  in 2012. This service enables ENISA staff  to be able to  reach and collaborate with the rest of the organisation,  no matter where they are located. The system will also  include IP telephony in 2013, thus off ering full Unifi ed  Communications.  Given the high mobility of the ENISA workforce, ENISA  implemented Direct Access in 2012. This  allows staff  to  securely connect to internal resources in a transparent  manner when they are outside the offi  ce. The solution  supports multiple factor authentication (Kerberos,  Machine Digital Certifi cate, User credentials) and  modern network protocols like IPv6 and IPSEC.  Security  To enhance the security of the internal network, ENISA  implemented authentication and encryption of the  network connections using IPSEC. This not only ensures  the privacy of the data exchanged between ENISA clients  and servers, but also the ENISA servers themselves are  better protected. This was demonstrated in practice  by a penetration test that was conducted against our  Intranet by EsCert. The results were very favourable  results for ENISA.  In addition to the above enhancements, ENISA’s fi rewall  was upgraded to be fully redundant (hot standby).  Service  Com pliance  A ud  it  &  Co  nt ro  l Administration  Department  Performance  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,  FACILITIES MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTR ATION  45  Financial resources  In 2012, the Agency committed its appropriations at a rate  of 100%, repeating the performance of 2011. This allowed  the Agency to carry out its operational activities as  specifi ed in the Work Programme 2012, and to make the  investments needed to ensure an appropriate operating  environment, compliance and the continued provision  of services by the Agency. Payments reached the level  of 91.45% of the total appropriations managed.

Moreover, it demonstrates the strong eff ort made  to fi nalise administrative and operational activities and  deliverables within the fi nancial year and minimise the  carry forward of appropriations to the next year. Both  commitment and payment rates constitute historical  highs for the Agency, and confi rm the sustained capacity  of the Agency to effi  ciently utilise its annual budget.

Background  This document provides a short summary of the requests for advice and assistance that ENISA has dealt with in 2012.  ENISA is handling requests in line with the following legal framework:  • Art. 10 of the Regulation19;  • the implementing decision of the Management Board20; and  • its internal procedure21.  In the course of developing its internal procedure and policy document, ENISA has built up an intranet platform for  responding to art. 10 requests as well as to inquiries in the most effi  cient way.  2. Scope of Art. 10 requests  Requests for advice and assistance and stated as “requests” in this document and by ENISA are “Article 10-requests”.  For a request to be classifi ed as an Article 10 request, the following conditions must be satisfi ed:  • The request for advice and assistance must be made directly to the Executive Director (art. 10.1).  • The request must be made by a qualifi ed entity, being the European Parliament, the Commission,  any competent body appointed by a MS such as an NRA as per art. 2 of Directive 02/21/EC (art. 10.2)  • http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:108:0033:0033:EN:PDF  • The request for advice and assistance must fall directly within the Agency’s scope, objectives  and tasks (art. 10.1).  • The request must be accompanied by suffi  cient background information in order to assess its  relevance (art. 10.1).  All other queries that do not fulfi l all the requirements of art. 10 of the Regulation as mentioned above are referred to  as “inquiries”. They are followed up by ENISA while at the same time taking into account its resources and priorities in  line with the Work Programme.22  19  According to Art. 10 of Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European  Network and Information Security Agency; as follows “the Regulation”.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0460:EN:HTML  20  Decision of the Management Board of 6 March 2006 on practical arrangements concerning requests to the ENISA.  21  Internal procedure “Handling Of Requests For Advice and Assistance (art. 10 requests)”, Version 1.0 fi nal, 29 May 2012  22  Please note that the new ENISA Regulation, which is currently being negotiated by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, provides  for more fl exible criteria as regards the defi nition of “requests”. They will actually be “Art. 14 Requests”, as the new regulation enters into force.  APPENDICES  57  3. Requests for advice and assistance received by ENISA  In 2012 up to today, 13 requests have been received by ENISA. This table shows the requests ENISA has received and  replied to during 2012. It names both the requestor and the area of activity the specifi c request refers to.  Nb. Requestor Area of NIS activity Status  1.

Business continuity corporate  exercise Completed  APPENDICES  58  4.Summary of requests  4.1. Commission, DG INFSO (A3)  DG INFSO requested ENISA for support on the “security  in the supply chain” as one of the proposed areas of  action for the European Public-Private Partnership for  Resilience (EP3R).  ENISA actions: creation of a group of experts, preparation  of a document covering the state-of-the-art in the area  taking into account of a survey to a selected number of  EU National Security Agencies  4.2. Hellenic Republic, Ministry of  Administrative Reform and e-Government  The Hellenic Republic requested assistance of  ENISA in various areas of ICT.  ENISA actions: Meetings (Hellenic DPA, S. Katsikas, Vice  Minister Voloudakis-ED) took place; ENISA provided an  overview mapping of eID and the approaches followed  within the EU by other MS regarding the following  points: how a citizen’s id is confi rmed, which dbases are  used, how as well as how many, their interconnection,  how privacy is handled, what they use (cards, mobile  apps, etc.); a workshop was held at the ministry of  administrative reform and eGov.  4.3. Commission, DG INFSO (D4)  In order to achieve an effi  cient, eff ective and truly  European implementation of the PIA-Framework,  the European Commission monitors the current  developments in the Member States and creates  conditions for facilitating the emergence of a common  European approach. A fi rst milestone in this respect was  a conference in Brussels (in CCAB) on 8th February 2012.  ENISA actions: meetings, ENISA participation in EC PIA  conference on RFID PIA Framework.  4.4. Commission, DG INFSO (A3)  In Nov2011 the Commission adopted the Commission  Legislative Work programme for 2012:  http://ec.europa.eu/atwork /programmes/index_  en.htm. In annex I, two initiatives on a “Pan European  framework for electronic identifi cation, authentication  and signature” and a “European Strategy for Internet  Security” were announced. The EC invited ENISA to  respond on how the Agency could support the EC in  shaping up these initiatives on which we have already  started working.  ENISA actions: The following options were found for  ENISA to assist the EC in particular:  • the promotion of security standards in public pro-  curement of new/innovative technologies/systems  • the defi nition of the scope and provisions of the  legal measure the EC intends to propose (with Art  114 as legal basis). An element of this measure  would be the extension of the applicability of  the “security breach notifi cation” model and  mechanism of Art 13.a of the FD beyond the  electronic communication market, thus covering  the information society service (as set in the  e-commerce Directive) as well as other sectors.  In this regard, the work planned by ENISA on  security breach notifi cation for the cloud would  be extremely relevant. Another element to refl ect  upon (wrt the scope) would be how to embrace  and/or articulate the link/relation with obligations  for critical infrastructure provides.  • Another component of the legal measure, on  which ENISA may have already some ideas and  provide some support on how to shape the legal  provisions, relates to supporting the cooperation  and information exchange/communication  between National Competent bodies.  4.5. Romania  ENISA received a request to support CERT RO in  becoming fully operational, in the areas of  • Incidents response procedures;  • Technical expertise;  • Training;  • Help in development of Romanian early warning  system, interconnected with other National systems;  • Help in developing of a national contingency plan.  ENISA actions: Workshop was delivered, request was  completed.  APPENDICES  59  4.6. Ireland  ENISA received a request for support in setting a  national CERT.  ENISA actions: meetings, support in the national/  governmetal CERT, participation in the TRANSITS  I training in Portugal, Porto, information on CERT  communities was provided.  4.7. Hellenic Data Protection Authority  The Hellenic Data Protection Authority requested  ENISAs collaboration.  ENISA actions: following the invitation of art. 29  Technology Subgroup to ENISA to collaborate in  the implementation of pilots regarding the art. 4  publication in 2 MS, it was decided to carry out the fi rst  two pilots in collaboration with the DPAs of Greece and  Poland; meetings took place; Hellenic DPA participated  in the pilots (tests) of severity assessment methodology,  workshop in Athens took place.  4.8. National CSIRT of Czech Republic  The Czech Republic requested ENISA’s feedback to the  draft of the Czech Cyber Security Bill.  ENISA actions: ENISA provided comments on the  document contributing to the preparation of the  drafting of the bill on cyber security in the Czech  Republic.  4.9. Romania CERT  Romania CERT requested ENISA’s help in the  organisation of a CIIP workshop/exercise.  ENISA actions: The CIIP workshop took place.  4.10. BSI Germany  The BSI Germany requested ENISAs support of DFS (Air  Traffi  c Germany).  ENISA actions: The Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS)  is working on a norming eff ort of CEN TC 377 (Air Traffi  c  Management committee) with the subject of security  in ATM. Coordination with ENISA on this issue has  taken place, i.e. the interoperability of risk assessments  performed by the diff erent stakeholders.  4.11. Commission (DG HOME)  The request by DG HOME for support consisted of two  elements:  • On the one hand, ENISA was requested to provide  input and comments on the benefi ts, main  impacts and possible means of enforcement of  new data security measures in the reform of the  EU legal framework for data retention.  • ENISA was also requested to assess the current  implementation of data security measures for data  retention in selected MS that can be considered as  “best practice” in this respect.  ENISA actions: Due to the results of an internal assessment  in DG Home, and the identifi ed dependencies with  ePrivacy directive, the reform is delayed and as such  the request for fi nalizing this request was shifted to the  second part of 2013. ENISA will start working in March  with the new contractors for the survey and also for the  state-of-the art recommendations for data security.  4.12. Poland  Poland asked for ENISA’s assistance with their national  cyber exercise.  ENISA actions: Advice was provided, organisation of a  seminar.  4.13. Commission, SG  The Commission’s Secretariat General asked  for ENISA’s assistance regarding the Business  Continuity Corporate Exercise 2012.  ENISA actions: providing of a seminar to relevant  Commission staff on organising/planning cyber  exercises, providing a skeleton cyber scenario  using Cyber Europe’s 2012 basic scenario adapted  to the needs of the Commission, participation in a  workshop.  APPENDICES  60  Fulfi lment of SMART goals and KPIs  Below SMART goals and KPIs regarding requests for advice and assistance  have been successfully achieved:  SMART Goal KPI Achieved  In 2012, at least 3 request will result in a suitable policy  update of the requesting party  Number of requests  Number of policy updates 6  In 2012 at least 5 requests will be received by ENISA Number of requests received 14  In 2012 at least 3 requests will be responded to by ENISA Number of responses to requests 14  Drafting a reply to a request should not exceed 50 person  days per request Time Fulfi lled  Overall time for accepting/rejecting a request should  not exceed 10 working days (from registration to reply  to Sender)  Time Fulfi lled  Inquiries  In 2012, ENISA has also dealt with a number of queries that do not qualify as requests according to art. 10  Regulation because they do not fulfi l all requirements as laid down in art.10. These queries are referred to as  “inquiries”, they are not foreseen in ENISA’s annual Work Programme but the Agency handles them anyway, if  workload and resources allow so.  Therefore in 2012, ENISA has received a number of inquiries. This list provides a short overview of  these inquiries:  Nb. Requestor Area of NIS activity Status  1.

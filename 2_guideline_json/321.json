Establishing secure  supply chain across the IoT ecosystem is a fundamental building block for IoT security. Supply  chain lays the foundation of IoT devices security, because the majority of these devices are  comprised from a multitude of components from different suppliers (both hardware and  software). At the same time, supply chains present a weak link for cybersecurity because  organisations cannot always control the security measures taken by supply chain partners.  Taking a step back and looking into the entire supply chain of IoT products and services, ENISA  with the input of IoT experts created security guidelines for the whole lifespan: from  requirements and design, to end use delivery and maintenance, as well as disposal. The  motivation is clear: security is not only about the end product, but also about the processes to  be followed to develop the product.  ENISA has long argued for security by design and by default to be weaved into digital products .  Setting specific security guidelines for IoT supply chain security is of paramount importance to  holistically approach the issue of IoT security. IoT security needs to be considered at all stages  of the supply chain, from the early conceptual design to the end user delivery and maintenance.  It is therefore important to analyse the relevant supply chain security threats and accordingly to  set forward security measures and guidelines that help avoiding the risks that affect  trustworthiness of the IoT supply chain.  The study is developed to help IoT manufacturers, developers, integrators and all stakeholders  that are involved to the supply chain of IoT to make better security decisions when building,  deploying, or assessing IoT technologies. This study builds up on existing ENISA studies on IoT  security, the baseline IoT security recommendations and the secure software development  lifecycle for IoT, and thus should be considered as complementary to the work that has been  produced from ENISA the previous years. It aims to serve as a point of reference for secure  supply chain for IoT.  This ENISA study aspires to address cybersecurity challenges related to the security of the  supply chain for IoT. It analyses the different stages of the IoT supply chain and explores all the  important security considerations to be taken into account in each stage.  Key guidelines of the report conclude on the need to:   Forge better relationships between actors   Further cultivate cybersecurity expertise   Adopt security by design principles   Take a comprehensive and explicit approach to security   Leverage existing standards and good practices  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The heterogeneous nature of the IoT ecosystem and its critical use make security an essential  aspect that must be taken care of. Although most of the IoT hardware and software vendors  consider and apply security measures during the design and development of their products and  services, security implications1 can be found at the stages of the supply chain where IoT  solutions are produced.  Any organisation that deals with physical goods understands the concept of the supply chain.  Supply chain activities transform natural resources, raw materials, software, and components  into a finished IoT product or service that is delivered to the end customer. Concepts like supply  chain optimisation and supply chain risk management need to be considered when developing  IoT solutions2. Understanding supply chains is a critical factor in business success and in  security and quality of end-products. ENISA has been advocating for security and privacy by  design and by default. The wide range of heterogeneous actors and IoT assets involved in the  IoT supply chain introduce new challenges and aspects that are reflected in this study, along  with a set of good practices and guidelines to be applied in the different phases of the supply  chain.  Although IoT is being used as a key enabling technology to secure the supply chain of several  industries (e.g. by tracking of assets, raw materials, supplies, etc.), the supply chain security for  the IoT itself must be ensured. Security in the IoT needs to be considered at all stages of the  supply chain, from the early conceptual design to the end user delivery and maintenance or  even repurposing.  The IoT threat landscape is highly complex and has been analysed exhaustively by ENISA  studies that cover the specific elements of the IoT ecosystem (e.g. embedded devices, IoT  platforms, network components). Relevant studies published by ENISA include:   Supply Chain Integrity: An overview of the ICT supply chain risks and challenges, and  vision for the way forward (2015).   Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT (2017).   Good Practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  (2018).   Good Practices for Security of IoT - Secure Software Development Lifecycle (2019).   Industry 4.0 - Cybersecurity Challenges and Recommendations (2019).  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This ENISA study aspires to address cybersecurity challenges related to the security of the  supply chain for IoT. The main objectives of this study aim at identifying challenges, threats,  security considerations and good practices for ensuring cybersecurity across the different  stages of the IoT supply chain.  1 Boyens, Jon M. 2020. “Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations from Industry.” Preprint.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276-draft  2 Cascella, Roberto. 2019. “Challenges of Cybersecurity Certification and Supply Chain Management.” ECSO - EUNITY  Workshop, January 24.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276-draft  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  7  To this end, the following objectives have been set:   Analyse the different IoT supply chain stages and underline key cybersecurity  challenges in each one.   Identify key cybersecurity threats targeting the IoT supply chain.   Underline main challenges for employing security across the IoT supply chain.   Identify security measures and map them to threats and supply chain stages.   Develop guidelines that may support IoT stakeholders securing the IoT supply chain.  1.2 SCOPE  The scope of the study includes all the stages of the IoT supply chain, defined as a holistic  system of organizations, people, technology, processes, information, and other physical and  virtual resources involved in the whole lifespan of any IoT product or service, from the  conception to the end customer supply and the end of the product life cycle.  The following list includes the IoT supply chain stages that were considered within the scope.  Detailed descriptions of each stage are provided in later sections.   Product design   Semiconductor fabrication   Component manufacturing   IoT Platform development   Component assembly and embedded software   Device programming   Distribution and logistics   Service provisioning and end-user operation   Technical support and maintenance   Device recovery and repurpose  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  This study defines good practices for security of IoT, focusing on the supply chain. Given the  heterogeneous phases involved in the supply chain and the complexity of the IoT ecosystem,  the target audience of this study comprises the following profiles:   IoT software developers and manufacturers.   Information security experts.   IT/Security solutions architects.   Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).   Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) experts.   Project managers.   Procurement teams.  1.4 METHODOLOGY  This ENISA study was carried out using a five-step methodological approach.  1. Scope definition and identification of experts: The first step was to establish the  scope of the study and to pinpoint the main topics to be considered. A concurrent  activity involved identifying the relevant IoT subject matter experts to contribute to this  study. The experts (members of ENISA informal expert groups on IoTSec and EICS)  provided input and expertise in relation to the objectives of this report.  2. Desktop research: Extensive research of relevant efforts to gather information on  securing the IoT supply chain. The identified documents included existing good  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  8  practices, publications, standards and other initiatives on the topics related to the  objectives of the report. This served as the foundations and support for the analysis of  the threats and for the development of the security measures.  3. Questionnaire and interviews with identified experts: ENISA reached out to the  identified experts in order to collect information and get their point of view. To this end,  an online questionnaire covering various security aspects, such as critical assets, key  threats targeting IoT supply chain and awareness with respect to supply chain  standards and guidelines, was developed. The identified experts completed the  questionnaire, and interviews were conducted with experts to collect additional  valuable inputs to prepare the report.  4. Analysis and development: The results from the desktop research, online  questionnaire and the interviews were analysed to align them with the objectives of the  report, developing the asset and threat taxonomies. This helped to identify the attack  scenarios, as well as the IoT supply chain security measures. This led to the  development of the first draft of this report.  5. Report write-up and validation: ENISA shared the draft of the report with its relevant  stakeholder communities and reference groups for review. The draft validation will be  done in parallel with the continuous improvement of the report. The final report will be  shared again to be reviewed at the end of its write up.  1.5 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  This report is structured as follows:   Chapter 1 - Introduction: provides introductory information to the report and  introduces the scope, objectives, and the methodology followed.   Chapter 2 – Overview of IoT supply chain: presents the different phases and formal  definitions of the IoT supply chain. It also discusses cybersecurity considerations in the  different phases; these considerations are expanded in the following chapters.   Chapter 3 –Threat taxonomy: identifies the security threats affecting IoT supply chain  and details some examples of potential attack scenarios.   Chapter 4 – Good practices for security of IoT supply chain: lists and descriptions  of good practices and security measures to secure the IoT supply chain.   Chapter 5 – Guidelines and conclusions: once the main conclusions of the report  had been laid out in the format of good practices in the previous chapter, a series of  written guidelines are presented to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the  security in the IoT supply chain.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  9  2. OVERVIEW OF IOT  SUPPLY CHAIN  2.1 SUPPLY CHAIN REFERENCE MODEL FOR IOT  The IoT supply chain includes the actors, processes and assets that participate in the  realization (e.g. development, design, maintenance, patch management) of any IoT device.  This study considers the supply chain for IoT is composed of two main aspects: the physical  aspect and the logic aspect. The physical supply chain relates to all the physical objects (e.g.  devices, electronic components, appliances) moved through the supply chain phases, as well  as the associated manual processes (e.g. manual assembly, distribution processes). The logic  aspect of the supply chain for IoT is associated with the software development and deployment,  network-based communications, and virtual interactions between the IoT objects and the supply  chain stakeholders.  IoT supply chain risks, and more generally IT supply chain risks, are associated with an  organisation’s decreased visibility into, and understanding of, how the technology they employ  in their product or solution is developed, integrated, and deployed3. An overview of the IoT  supply chain is provided , presenting all its different stages with a detailed mapping of them that  can be found after the following subsections. This aims to give an approximation of the stages  sequence and the interactions between actors to identify where the security concerns might  arise.  Although the stage layers are presented as being separated, it should be taken into account  that sometimes they are treated as a single entity due to project constraints or other business  realities.  3 National Cyber Security Centre. 2018. “Supply Chain Security Guidance.” National Cyber Security Centre.  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  10  Figure 1: Supply Chain Reference Model for IoT  2.1.1 Conceptual Phase  During this phase, the products and services are conceptually designed. This includes both  software and hardware units, as well as other services that may be involved. This early stage is  important to define and establish the basic security foundations that will be part of the  requirements during the subsequent stages in the supply chain. Security at the design phase is  critical as some cost-driven decisions or mistakes at this stage may result in security flaws in the  final product.  This phase contains the design of security models. Physical and digital assets are inextricably  linked in the IoT domain—a security model for the IoT supply chain should merge both physical  safety and digital security.  Requirements are also specified at the conceptual stage. One of the main challenges is the  harmonization of the different disciplines (e.g. hardware engineering, security engineering,  business) to achieve proper security in the IoT product while properly considering all the  requirements. One other challenge is the understanding the target environment. For ‘general  purpose’ devices there is likely to be a wide range of target environments, all exhibiting different  risks and therefore expressing different risk appetite.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  11  Finally, it should be noted that the investment of resources in the conceptual and development  phases tends to contribute to minimize the cost of making an error in later stages.  2.1.2 Development Phase  Broadly speaking the Development Phase consists of a wide range of tasks that span from  semiconductor fabrication to firmware programming and whose main objective is producing a  physical device ready to ship to customers. Development of software services and platforms  required for the operation and deployment of IoT devices are also included in this phase. This is  one of the most critical phases as most of the risks and threats arise from poor decisions,  omissions or mistakes at this point.  As is the case with the conceptual phase, the lack of visibility of the development-related  differences (e.g. timelines, needs) between the different teams (e.g. software, security) can  have a significant and negative impact on security.  On a deeper level, a typical IoT device will go through many steps during the Development  Phase. Those steps can roughly be categorized under Hardware and Software, with the former  consisting mainly in semiconductor fabrication (according to design guidelines), PCB  manufacturing, component integration and functional testing; while the latter involves  components like on-chip microcode, operating systems, middleware, third-party libraries, cloud  services integration and several development tools.  The number of actors involved in this stage can be potentially very high. For example,  semiconductor manufacturers, PCB integrators, security engineers, device assembly and  packaging and developers (micro-code, firmware, operating systems, middleware, libraries).  2.1.3 Production Phase  This phase involves mass production, distribution, and logistics. A significant percentage of IoT  devices use multiple units from different vendors and thus require a wide, and often complex,  supply chain. This usually leads to a multi-faceted logistic challenge, where keeping track of all  the stages and sources is not an easy task.  This phase is linked with the support and retirement phases, as the challenges that are involved  in the initial distribution resurface when products have to be retrieved due to malfunction or to  be disposed of.  The IoT supply chain production phase may be defined as the effort needed to efficiently and  securely deliver while keeping track of all the units in IoT devices. Typically, this involves  several different actors: shipping, warehousing, inventory management, delivery fleet operation,  packaging, handling and customer support, among others.  2.1.4 Utilisation Phase  Although it depends greatly on the type of device and services provided, the Utilisation Phase  contains all those tasks required to get the device up and running at the customer final location.  For a typical device this usually involves tasks ranging from delivery to the customer or retailers,  physical installation at the operating location, device initial set-up, establishing secure user  credentials both at device level and remote services, pairing with mobile devices, data  collection/sharing agreements up to cloud/3rd-party services.  As is the case in the other phases, the complexities of the supply chain require a significant  number of potential actors to be involved in this phase. For example, logistics companies to  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  12  transport IoT products, retailers, technicians to participate in the deployment process or cloud  service providers that offer the services that serve as building blocks of IoT platforms. These  actors are usually also involved in the following support and retirement phases.  2.1.5 Support Phase  When thinking about the support phase in the life cycle of a product, we always tend to think in  repairing damages or fixing issues. From the perspective of the supply chain in IoT devices this  often means repairing or replacing damaged units. The IoT devices are very susceptible to  damage and malfunctions, as such the IoT suppliers usually have a good size team working as  support of their product, that work closely with the developers and users if needed.  But there is another very important part of the support phase that revolves around the constant  supervision of the unit’s security. This part is mainly divided between maintaining updates4 for  the devices (firmware, software and libraries) and remote support.  For this phase of the supply chain, the report is focusing on the continuous prevention  aspect.The majority of the IoT devices are widespread and usually have various components  with different origins. This makes it even harder to ensure the security of the devices, and even  presents threats to the functionality of the product. This is why a lot of security measures and  good practices have been centred around this phase, using different technologies and  standards to ensure a correct support of the IoT devices through its life cycle.  2.1.6 Retirement Phase  The final phase of a product consists in a series of steps to ensure that the disposal of the IoT  device is done securely. One of the key aspects of this phase is the secure removal of the  information in the device5.  If needed, another step in the disposal of a device is its physical destruction. This presents  challenges not only in the cyber-security department but also logistics and environmental  concerns, as electronics wastes involve a great deal of contamination problems. One of these  problems is the scarcity of some of the materials used in creating them, so an important part of  the retirement process is the recycling of the devices.  So, the retirement process can be summarized as the recycling of the devices in economically  feasible and environmentally friendly ways while adhering to security and privacy standards.  Another important breach in security is added when the device is not completely taken out of  circulation but instead is repurposed or refurbished. When reused, there is again a strong need  for information erasing, but also extra measures must be taken to ensure that the product can fit  into its new use.  2.2 DESCRIPTION OF IOT SUPPLY CHAIN STAGES  This section contains brief descriptions of each of the stages in the IoT supply chain. All of them  are relevant from a security standpoint and should be considered in the security process.  2.2.1 Product Design  The first stage includes the generation of the required design resources for both hardware and  software components before proceeding to fabrication and development stages. This process  4 Kissel, Richard, Andrew Regenscheid, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine. 2014. “Guidelines for Media Sanitization.” NIST  SP 800-88r1. National Institute of Standards and Technology. https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1  5 Kyung Lee, Teddy. 2020. “VIA PUF Technology as a Root of Trust in IoT Supply Chain.” Global Semiconductor Alliance  (blog). 2020.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  13  shall take into account security features to support a secure supply chain (e.g. secure root of  trust, process isolation for trusted software). The design of IoT products tends to be complex  due to the highly coupled nature of the relationship between hardware and software—these  products usually have restrictive constraints (e.g. cost, size) and are based on hardware  platforms specifically tailored to the scenario.  Design tasks in the software domain include, for example, gathering functional and non-  functional requirements, producing initial versions of threat models, designing architectures,  defining the technology stack and developing small-scale proof-of-concepts to assess viability.  On the other hand, hardware requires producing schematics for PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards)  and mechanical elements using ECAD (Electronic Computer-Aided Design) and MCAD  (Mechanical Computer-Aided Design) tools. Schematics can then be validated using simulation  processes (e.g. thermal).  The product design phase is significantly challenging due to the fact that is forces designers to  think long-term and consider multiple future issues and possibilities (e.g. how to deal with  remote management of credentials when a root of trust is implemented). On the other hand, it is  comparatively easy to verify.  2.2.2 Semiconductor Fabrication  Developments in the semiconductor fabrication field have played a major role in the recent  growth of the IoT domain, increasing the capabilities and computational resources of devices  with low power consumption and small form factor requirements.  The fabrication stage includes the chemical processes involved in transforming raw  semiconductor materials into silicon wafers; the production of the masks containing patterns that  will be transferred to the silicon wafers after being irradiated with UV light; and what is  commonly known as the IC (Integrated Circuit) frontend process. Two distinct and consecutive  steps can be identified in this process: FEOL (Front End-Of-Line) refers to the first part where  individual electrical components (e.g. transistors, capacitors) are formed on the silicon, while  BEOL (Back End-Of-Line) is the second part where interconnections are formed between  components.  With the shortage of materials being an increasingly pressing issue, the competition for the  access to resources has intensified. Additionally, it should be noted that the separation lines  between fabrication and manufacturing phases are often blurred. Actors such as foundries can  sometimes offer services beyond their expected scope, benefiting from a stronger integration  between steps in the semiconductor chain to optimize costs. The Semiconductor Fabrication  and Component Manufacturing stages could therefore be considered as a single unit depending  on the specific case. Furthermore, another reasonable model of the IoT supply chain could even  group the fabrication and manufacturing stages under the initial design phase due to their low-  level nature.  Not all IoT projects require the design and fabrication of ad-hoc ICs; many products can be  based on off-the-shelf chips to avoid dealing with the high barriers and costs of entry of low-  level semiconductor fabrication (which is only cost-efficient on projects with a high volume of  devices).  Unlike the product design stage, the fabrication and manufacturing stages tend to be more  difficult to verify—this has the side effect of increasing challenges from a security perspective.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  14  2.2.3 Component Manufacturing  This stage is comprised of the tasks that are necessary to arrive at a production-ready IC after  the electrical components and interconnections are formed on the wafers during the  Semiconductor Fabrication stage. These steps include separation of each individual die from  the silicon wafer, and packaging of the die into the final physical IC container for protection and  usage. Extensive testing is also involved6 to validate and ensure that ICs meet the performance  requirements.  PCB manufacturing is another common task that is included in this stage. Unlike ad-hoc ICs,  many IoT projects require the design of custom PCBs that serve as an interconnection platform  for components such as microcontrollers, FPGAs or physical connectors. The PCB only  provides the substrate and interconnection tracks, the actual components are assembled on the  next stage.  2.2.4 Component & Embedded Software Assembly  In this stage electronic components are mounted and soldered on the PCBs. This process may  be manual or automated, depending on the capabilities of the assembly pipeline and the type of  the components—through-hole components tend to be manually soldered, while SMDs  (Surface-Mount Devices) can be automatically placed by specialized machinery.  Software modules or pieces of information that are integral to the units and are not directly  related to the actual IoT application logic (developed in later stages) are loaded and initialized in  this phase. Two distinct types of initialization may be identified: one type includes modules that  are the same for the entire range of devices (e.g. bootloader, firmware); the other includes  modules that change on a per device basis (e.g. device ID). It should be noted that this is  logically separated from the setup that takes part during the service provision stage.  Finally, devices are integrated into their physical enclosures and packaged for distribution to  end users or intermediary VARs (Value-Added Resellers).  Security challenges in this stage arise from the combinations of the same software running with  different configurations in different hardware platforms. The impact of different hardware  platforms in software safety and reliability needs to be evaluated, although this is a hard  process.  2.2.5 Device Programming  This stage can be defined as all the tasks geared towards writing, testing and deploying  functional software on all the components of an IoT device. Depending on the complexity of the  device and the number of different components these tasks might require developing software  at several layers: low-level firmware (e.g. bootloader)7, drivers, networking/communication  stacks, Operating System, Middleware (e.g. web server), user GUI.  This stage can potentially span along most of the lifecycle of the product as part of the  development team is usually involved in the support phase: fixing detected flaws, implementing  new features or simply working alongside the maintenance team in keeping online/cloud  services fully operational.  6 Fagan, Michael, Katerina N Megas, Karen Scarfone, and Matthew Smith. 2020. “Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for  IoT Device Manufacturers.” NIST IR 8259.

These services tend to be centralized in nature, providing intelligence  and capabilities that cannot be implemented in a local fashion in the IoT devices (e.g. due to  constrained resources). The following list contains some examples of IoT platform services:   Identification and authorization services.   Streaming platforms for the ingestion of data flows originated on the IoT devices.  Processing pipelines are usually included to clean, analyse and persist the data.   Services for the provisioning of the environment and configuration of IoT devices.   APIs for the exposition of historical data or events.   Gateways or bridges for the adaptation and translation of protocols.  Tasks involved in this stage are commonly a combination of the development of ad-hoc projects  tailored for the specific context of use, and the integration of third-party APIs and services—  whether exposed on the cloud following the SaaS model (Software as a Service) or installed in  private servers. It is important to note that the endorsement of third-party software is a  significant security challenge for all stages related to software development.  2.2.7 Distribution & Logistics  From the end-user point of view the classical definition of distribution and logistics is about how  to make the goods reach the customer quickly and reliably. However, most IoT devices use  many components and services from different vendors and so require a wide, and often  complex, supply chain. This usually leads to a multi-faceted logistic challenge, where keeping  track of all the stages is not an easy task.  With this in mind we can define IoT supply chain distribution and logistics as the effort needed  to efficiently and securely deliver while keeping track of all the components in IoT devices8.  Typically, this involves several different tasks and actors: shipping, warehousing, inventory  management, delivery fleet operation, packaging and handling among others.  2.2.8 Service Provision & End-User Operation  This term is usually applied to the initial steps to be taken in order to bring an IoT device to a  fully operational state at the customer site (once the physical installation is completed). This  usually requires device initialization, user/application account set-up, networking set-up, cloud  services enrolment and any further custom/ad-hoc device configuration. It is one of the critical  stages at which proper security practices must be enforced, especially by the end-user.  There are many approaches to the service provisioning procedure: End-user driven (either via  manuals or software-based wizards), technician driven (a skilled staff set-up all required  services asking the customer key configuration items) or automatic (device shipped  totally/partially pre-configured or remote configuration retrieval upon device boot).  Three additional sub-stages could be identified: Provision of Public Key Infrastructure,  Evaluation and Certification for Security and Safety, and Third-party and Independent Security  and Safety Assessments. These could be considered as separate stages but are included here  for simplicity.  8 Xu, Xiaolin, Fahim Rahman, Bicky Shakya, Apostol Vassilev, Domenic Forte, and Mark Tehranipoor. 2019. “Electronics  Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain.” ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems 24 (3): 1– 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571  https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  16  2.2.9 Technical Support & Maintenance  Support and maintenance can be defined as the series of actions and processes that are taken  during the device life cycle to keep the IoT product from degrading and ensuring it fulfils its  purpose according to the requirements (i.e. functional, security) in the face of the passage of  time or unexpected developments (e.g. software bugs, zero day vulnerabilities).  Support and maintenance processes can be classified in two categories, remote and local. The  former leverages network infrastructure and techniques like secure firmware or credential  updates to achieve its goal and could be considered more cost-effective. However, the  sensitivity of the information involved can sometimes pose a big challenge that may require of  the physical approach. An example challenge could be remotely revoking and updating device  credentials using a communication channel enabled by those same credentials.  In the case of a technical support instance due to a proactive request from the user's part, the  assigned technician fixes the issue by either guiding the user in the required steps (e.g.  delivering a software update) or remotely connecting to the device. The opportunities for remote  assistance—and the related beneficial cost implications—are defined by the capabilities  established in the product design stage.  Occasionally some issues cannot be fixed and require a full or partial product replacement. In  this case the device recovery and service provisioning stages are clearly interlinked with the  support stage.  From the staff point of view the support effort can be structured in tiers, usually starting with first  line operators trained to deal with the most common problems down to highly skilled technicians  with expertise in a particular area.  Providing proper support for IoT devices can help in addressing the issues that may arise even  in the presence of a good design. Furthermore, a good design has a big impact in keeping the  volume of said issues to an acceptable level.  2.2.10 Device Recovery & Repurpose  This stage can be defined as the procedure followed after a device has reached the end of the  operational life at a particular location. Depending on its condition (or customer needs) the  device will be scrapped and recycled or repurposed to start a new operational cycle at a  different location. In case of device repurpose it must be provisioned again.  The recovery procedure can involve several operations at two different levels. Examples in the  software domain include data retrieval for archiving purposes, user data erasure9, full wipe and  operating system installation. Some operations are also usually required on the IoT platform  backend such as revoking credentials or access permissions. On the other hand, hardware  operations include destruction of storage media, recycling of components or raw materials and  biological sanitization.  2.3 MAPPING OF THE IOT SUPPLY CHAIN  Whereas the previous section presented an overview of the general phases of supply chain, the mapping below  provides a visualization of the more detailed activities specific to the stages of the supply chain for IoT. It also  helps to develop a linear understanding of the correlation between subsequent phases.  9 Kissel, Richard, Andrew Regenscheid, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine. 2014. “Guidelines for Media Sanitization.” NIST  SP 800-88r1.

THREATS TO IOT SUPPLY  CHAIN  This chapter presents a series of threats that are considered the most relevant in the context of  the IoT supply chain. Relevance has been determined by conducting a preliminary desktop  research phase, followed by a validation phase where threats were discussed with experts  using two distinct formats—personal interviews and questionnaires.  These threats have been classified under a set of high-level categories. Please note that  horizontal threats that apply to all domains (e.g. vandalism) should still be considered in addition  to the specific threats of the supply chain.  All threats include a short description and the list of IoT supply chain stages that are most  likely to be affected by the threat. This doesn´t mean that other stages are not related to a  threat, instead affected stages are the phases in which the threats are more dangerous and/or  can be tackled most effectively.  3.1 PHYSICAL ATTACK (DELIBERATE/INTENTIONAL)  Sabotage  The assembly pipeline may provide malicious actors with the opportunity  to interfere and inject defects that may end up causing problems (up to the  total shutdown and malfunction of the product) in later stages. The threat  of attacking manufacturing processes (independently discussed in another  category) is relevant and closely related in the context of sabotage.   Component assembly &  embedded software.  Grey markets  Defective, discarded or lost products may end up in grey markets that exist  outside of the proper distribution channels. This can lead to unforeseen  consequences and add numerous difficulties to the implementation of strict  security and quality standards by injecting untested and unreliable  products into the market.   Technical support &  maintenance.   Device disposal &  decommissioning.  Exploitation of inadequate physical enclosures  Some devices require to be physically tamper-proof depending on the  scenario. The choice of materials and construction method must be  adequate for the intended use of the product. For instance, it doesn't  matter how good the software of a smart lock is if the device can be easily  torn apart with bare hands . Besides worrying about the physical  enclosure, the designer should also consider how ports are included in the  case. For instance, a maintenance port only used in manufacturing can be  used by an attacker in the field. This port should be disabled or removed  prior to field installation.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support &  maintenance.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  19  3.2 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LOSS  IP theft  Malicious actors may be able to illegally acquire, exploit, store or  redistribute intellectual property and sensitive pieces of information (e.g.  design documents, source code, credentials or other secrets). These  provide dangerous insight into the vulnerabilities of the specific IoT  products and may serve as valuable assets for attackers. This threat is  closely related to the security-by-obscurity strategy (i.e. achieving security  by ensuring documentation and sources remain secret) whose  effectiveness and relevance is regularly criticized by experts.   Product design.   Component manufacturing.  Reverse engineering  The consequences of reverse engineering are arguably similar to those of  IP theft; the main difference resides in the method used to obtain the  sensitive assets and pieces of information (e.g. source code from the  binaries, deep understanding of hardware blocks). These are derived from  trial-and-error and meticulous study of the behaviour of a final product  during the utilization phase by attackers that lack access to the original  designs. This process may also lead to the discovery and release into the  public domain of vulnerabilities (whether in first or third-party components)  or firmware backdoors. It is important to note that reverse engineering in  itself is not a threat, and should only be considered as such when used  with malicious intent.   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Device programming.   Technical support &  maintenance.   Device disposal &  decommissioning.  Overproduction and cloning  Overproducing is the practice of fabricating a product whose design  documents and specifications have been provided willingly by the rightful  owner, with the particularity that this is done outside of the established  bounds of a legal contract. These products appear to be original but are  insecure and pose a threat to the supply chain. A malicious factory can  also clone the physical characteristics, firmware/software and security  configuration of the device. Deployed devices might also be compromised  and their software reverse-engineered, allowing for cloning. Cloned  devices may be sold cheaply in the market and can contain functional  modifications including backdoors. Alternatively, a genuine device may be  substituted with a variant or clone during transportation or commissioning .   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  20  3.3 NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY/ABUSE  Magnetic field attacks  Devices that are deployed in the field may be exposed to magnetic field  attacks. These attacks are based on interfering with the units on an  electromagnetic level, corrupting system memory in the process. Possible  consequences include a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or the extraction of  sensitive information (e.g. private keys during generation).   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Service Provision & End-user  Operation  Malware insertion  Attackers are presented with the opportunity to insert malicious software  whose main objective is to provide illicit access or any other functionality  that goes against the intended usage of the system. Insecure update  mechanisms and poisoned update services are prime examples of such  opportunities for malware injection. IoT gateways are especially relevant in  this context; these are functional devices that are commonly found in IoT  architectures, but can also function as a threats source. IoT gateways  usually have a supporting role in the scope of security requirements, they  are, however, an avenue to compromise IoT devices for a malicious actor,  providing access into trusted networks and a method to acquire data from  supported constrained devices.   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Device programming.   IoT platform development   Service provision & end-user  operation  Exploitation of debug interfaces  Debugging IoT devices without compromising confidentiality, integrity and  availability is a relevant challenge—there are no standards to incorporate  debugging interfaces such as JTAG. Hardware or software interfaces  specifically meant for internal use in the organization may be improperly  disabled and end up as part of the final designs that reach the production  and assembly stages. The existence of these interfaces is commonly  attributed to oversight in the early phases, as they are meant to serve as  tools for debugging and detection of errors, although there may be cases  where those interfaces are included with malicious intent. The key is  enabling this functionality securely and only to authorized personnel which  seems to be the industry challenge. They provide attackers with a  dangerous level of access to the final product .   Service provision & end-user  operation.  Tampering and counterfeits  Counterfeit products are sold by unauthorized suppliers who are not part of  manufacturer's official sales channel. These products, which have been  designed and manufactured by unknown parties, are labeled as the  manufacturer’s products. This threat contemplates the inclusion of  counterfeit chips in boards—chips that contain some kind of malicious  modification (e.g. hardware trojans) or that have not been properly  validated. Boards that present this issue are referred to as tampered  boards. These unauthorized chips range from similar parts with lower  tolerances and capabilities, defective parts that needed to be disposed of,  parts reused from other boards that do not meet the quality standards,  overproduced parts, or parts produced through an unauthorized use of  intellectual property  . The window of opportunity for tampering may  appear during multiple stages, including distribution, especially when  operating with logistics companies that lack transparency about their  security measures.   Semiconductor fabrication.   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Distribution & logistics.   Device recovery & repurpose.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  21  3.4 LEGAL  Implications due to standard and regulation non-compliance  Architecting processes around privacy/encryption is a challenge that is  affected by existing privacy laws and regulations and by the fact that some  actors in the supply chain ecosystem have their own different  understanding about the security aspects. SLAs are signed between  different actors in the supply chain to ensure a common contractual  enforced view of the security aspects. All devices should comply with  security guidelines mandated by respective industries (e.g. energy,  medical, automotive). Moreover, GDPR and any other local regulation  should be applied to cover the risks associated with standards/regulation  non-compliance.   Product design.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support & maintenance.  3.5 UNINTENTIONAL DAMAGE OR LOSS OF INFORMATION  Compromise of Network  Systems that are necessary for the control of supply chain processes and  exist in a network could become compromised without the proper QoS or  firewall policies. These assets could be weaponized to orchestrate, for  example, large scale Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, or to degrade the  operation of the supply chain. Those that have access to the Internet are  the most vulnerable, although isolated internal networks are also at risk  from insider attacks.   Product design.   Device programming.   Service provision & end-user  operation.  Use of factory authentication settings  Devices which require authentication should never leave the factory with a  fixed global default credentials or a credentials derived from easily  obtainable information (i.e. MAC address). Each device should have a  unique random credentials assigned to it during manufacturing. Especially  during any updates, which represent an important critical point in security.   Product design.   Component assembly & embedded  software.   Device programming.   Service provision & end-user  operation   Technical support & maintenance.  Undetected software or hardware disruptions of the devices  Systems related in any fashion to the operation of the supply chain should  ideally be extensively monitored for an early detection of hardware of  software issues. A more proactive approach on detection usually results in  a reduced number of disruptions to the supply chain, especially when  compared with reactive measures.   All stages.  User Errors  Users should be properly informed and trained to raise awareness about  the functionality and the security risks; whether in the case of internal  members of an organization operating critical supply chain systems and  tools, or end users whose compromised devices could be used to gain  access to other nodes that could disrupt the supply chain. Unintentional  human errors could be the most direct approach to infiltrating into an   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support & maintenance.   Device recovery & repurpose.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  22  otherwise adequately protected system. The interception of  communications to other stakeholders related to the supply chain (e.g.  procurements) and other attacks that derive from social engineering  techniques are important threats to be considered in the context of user  errors.  Technological evolution during device life cycle  The technological landscape is constantly evolving. This evolution can  result in unexpected vulnerabilities that were not present during the design  and implementation stages; this is especially impactful in the case of  devices with long life cycles (e.g. cars). Examples of such vulnerabilities  include devices lacking the performance to run state of the art encryption  after a flaw is discovered in previous schemes, or abandonment of  software support by the vendors.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support &  maintenance.  Use of unpatched devices and systems  It is a common occurrence to discover vulnerabilities during the device life  cycle that were not considered in the first stages of the supply chain. This  is in fact expected, as no system can ever be considered perfectly secure.  Failure to integrate a software upgrade mechanism during the design  phase can pose a serious threat, as it robs the manufacturer of the ability  to react to these security issues. Moreover, this mechanism must  implement all technical measures to avoid code tampering and ensure the  deployed firmware is genuine.   Product design.   Device programming.   Technical support & maintenance.  Disruptions in cloud services  Systems that depend on cloud services and are critical to the operation of  the supply chain should be able to perform their core functionality even  when disconnected for extended periods of time. Organizations should  consider the possibility of the service vendor going out of business,  ensuring their data is available in some form of backup. Security measures  to handle malicious takeover of the original domain names for the cloud  services should also be ideally implemented.   Device programming.   IoT platform development.   Service provision & end-user  operation.  Failure of recovery procedures  Due to an attack, the system (and the device) is not able to be recovered  impacting functionality and security. During the lifecycle of an IoT device,  several assets (firmware, configuration, credentials) might need to be  updated. Chain of trust must be considered since depending the asset to  be updated (impacted), different mechanisms must be used. The recovery  plan must define which mechanism and which process must be followed to  fix any potential situation that might compromise the service and the  security of the device. Depending the level of criticality and the element of  the chain that is compromised, the mechanisms must be one or other. This  is a critical process in which the security of the device and the system can  be compromised.   Service provision & end-user  operation   Technical support & maintenance  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  23  Attack to registration procedures  A lack of registration procedures, or insecure registration mechanisms,  could lead to attackers registering fraudulent devices or preventing the  registration of genuine devices. Devices must be registered in the  appropriate authentication IoT platform services after device initialization in  the product line and before final user provisioning in order to grant them  access.   Device programming.   IoT platform development.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support & maintenance.  Use of recovered or repurposed components  Organizations may opt to reuse components or parts that have already  gone through the regular supply chain flow; this could be done for reasons  such as cost optimization. The usage of components that have already  been retired and may have not been properly validated for reinsertion in  the supply chain poses a threat and could contaminate an otherwise  secure batch of devices.   Device recovery & repurpose.  Attack to manufacturing processes  Manufacturing pipelines are highly sensitive points of entry to the supply  chain. Processes that do not implement adequate measures to regulate  and monitor the access of personnel to the pipeline could cause serious  vulnerabilities; this could in turn lead to other discussed threats such as  sabotage or malware injection.   Semiconductor fabrication.   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  24  4. GOOD PRACTICES FOR  SECURITY OF IOT  SUPPLY CHAIN  4.1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  One of the most significant objectives of this document is to address the main security  considerations to adopt throughout the supply chain for IoT. During the creation of this study, a  group of experts expressed their views on the main challenges they consider the global supply  chain for IoT needs to overcome in order to deliver greater security.  As a result of this consultation, a non-exhaustive list of security considerations is shown in the  following table. In the following chapter a more in-depth group of good practices is presented; to  address these considerations and ensure not only the security, but also the overall quality of the  IoT supply chain.  A security consideration that applies in a horizontal manner to all stages is the fact that those  processes that are beyond the direct control of the organization (i.e. managed by a third party)  are inherently challenging; audits and inspections can help with this consideration but are hard  to enforce. Another horizontal security consideration can be found in the resilience of  trustworthiness of the supply chain, that is, the ability to be able to provide continuous service of  operation.  Stages  Security  considerations  Description  Product design  Threat model  Identification and creation of a catalogue of potential  threats.  Secure building blocks  Usage of up-to-date and properly supported building  blocks (e.g. cryptography, software libraries).  Sabotage prevention  Monitoring of deliberate flaws in design introduced by  insider threats.  Physical-logical  convergence  Ensuring adequate visibility of all requirements and  needs for security  engineers and other stakeholders (especially relevant  in E2E security design).  Recovery plan  Conceptual design must face and consider the  definition of a recovery plan for future stages and  secure mechanisms to implement it (compliant with the  chain of trust).  Combined security  controls (SW and tamper  resistant HW)  Define the integration between HW and SW when  defining security measures. Security controls (e.g.  secure boot, attestation) require the usage of tamper  resistant hardware to fulfil the security requirements.  Chain of trust definition  Chain of trust is necessary to ensure levels of trust  between HW and SW elements.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  25  Resource constraints  Achieving a compromise between device resources  (e.g. memory, computation) and other constraints such  as cost or size that ensures devices are able to  implement security measures while leaving room for  future unexpected developments.  Semiconductor  Fabrication  Hardware security  mechanism  Integration of a hardware root of trust to serve as the  trusted secure foundation of cryptographic operations.  Scrap management  Management of residual and discarded materials to  ensure parts are securely removed from the supply  chain.  Component  Manufacturing Counterfeit components  Usage of authenticated parts to avoid security  concerns introduced by fraudulent components.  Defective components  Usage of properly tested parts that pass the quality  requirements to avoid degradation of security.  Component  Assembly +  Embedded  Software  Firmware access control  Enable secure mechanisms to control access to  firmware for updates and other maintenance  operations. Specially for its installation.  Backdoors  Monitoring of suspicious behaviour and backdoors  implanted in hardware or low-level firmware boot code.  Device  Programming  Secure provisioning  Usage of end-to-end robust provisioning mechanisms  guaranteeing the security of credentials and  cryptographic information.  Coding practices  Adoption of best practices such as code reviews and  continuous integration of cybersecurity checks in the  software development process.  IoT Platform  Development  Development focus  Basing development efforts on a risk-based approach  to achieve both adequate functionality and security.  Dependencies  management  Checks and review processes to ensure that  dependencies and libraries are available, have not  been tampered with and conform to security  requirements.  Network security  Secure network policies to minimize the risk of  intrusion while exposing the required services in the  public domain.  Service  Provision  & End-user  Operation  Management support  Appropriate level of resources and support provided by  the organization to ensure secure operation during the  lifecycle of the  IoT device.  Convenience  compromises  Appropriate balance of user convenience and intrusive  security mechanisms that degrade the user  experience.  Usage by operators  Operators of IoT services are provided with adequate  training to avoid introducing security risks that originate  from misuse or misconfiguration.  Adoption of security  features  Monitoring and usage of techniques to increase the  adoption rate of optional security features by end  users.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  26  Technical support  Technical support throughout the life cycle of the  product.  Access control  Management of credentials (including revocation) and  access permissions of devices to IoT platforms.  Distribution  and logistics  Value-added resellers  (VAR)  Certification of personalization services for IoT devices  offered by third parties that may introduce unforeseen  security risks.  Protection against theft  and counterfeits  Adoption of security measures to reduce the risk of  property theft and replacement with counterfeit  components in the distribution process and logistics  chain.  Device identity  Compose a device identity during device fabrication  based on the combination of the different HW and SW  components (e.g. board ID, secure element ID). This  device identity composition helps to track and device  fabrication tracking and can be used in the IoT  platform access control.  Tracking for registration  Define a proper device registration or onboarding to  the IoT platform based on the tracking of the device in  the different stages of fabrication.  Technical Support  & Maintenance  OTA control tools  Adoption of mechanisms to ensure remote Over-The-  Air control tools used for maintenance are properly  managed and secured following the chain of trust.  Patches  Usage of software version that sufficiently mitigates  the threats exposed and the latest security patches to  avoid risks from well-known security vulnerabilities.  Device  Recovery &  Repurpose  Data removal  Adoption of secure data removal techniques to avoid  sensitive pieces of information remaining on the  device.  4.2 GOOD PRACTICES TO IMPROVE SECURITY  Development of good practices for securing the supply chain for IoT is one of the key objectives  of this study. The aim is to provide recommendations for the target audience to assist in  countering and mitigating the threats that might impact the supply chain for IoT.  Recommendations focus on covering the overlapping issues, as most practices are not effective  across all industries and users.  To organise the domains in a logical manner, good practices were classified into the following  three main groups: actors, processes and technologies. Please note that there may exist a  degree of overlap between groups and some good practices could be classified into multiple  categories due to the strongly integrated nature of the supply chain for IoT.  Actors: guidelines related to the principles that shape how actors in the supply chain are  expected to think about, perceive and approach security in the supply chain for IoT; whether it is  in the context of a clearly defined and previously agreed framework or from a personal  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  27  standpoint. Industry professionals (e.g. managers, engineers), end users and organizations can  be identified as actors in the supply chain.  Processes: addresses security in the processes involved when an IoT project is designed,  developed, deployed and maintained. These processes are not limited to the context of a single  organization and include interactions between stakeholders, especially in those cases where  trust cannot be clearly established.  Technologies: potential technical measures and elements that could be applied in order to  predict, detect and reduce vulnerabilities and threats. These include hardware components,  design recommendations, techniques, libraries or other software components to support the  process throughout the entire supply chain.  Each practice consists of a title, its relation to one of the three categories above, a description of  the practice, and references to sources for further information. Standards are to be found in the  Annex C of this document.  4.2.1 Actors  ACT-01 PRIORITIZE WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS THAT PROVIDE  SECURITY GUARANTEES  There is an inherent threat in working with external suppliers due to the lack of control in their  security measures, however, this is regularly a business reality that cannot be avoided. This  threat can be minimized by favouring companies that implement standards such as the ISO  27036 and ISO 28000, or recommendations such as NISTIR 8259.10 A company seeking  certification approval is usually a sign that they are willing to seriously work towards improving  supply chain security. Certification is usually a costly process that is not suitable for all  organizations—organizations that are not standardized but have comprehensive security  measures in place and are transparent about them (e.g. right to audit, contractual security  requirements) should also be considered trustworthy.  ACT-02 WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY  Transparency is crucial to control security in the supply chain. Stakeholders, especially  suppliers, should be transparent, offering clear and detailed information about the operations  and normal behaviour of the supplied products; and communicating all the relevant information  to the next step of the chain. An increased level of transparency would have the desirable side  effect of reinforcing trust between participants in the supply chain.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-03 DEVELOP INNOVATIVE TRUST MODELS  Trust between the stakeholders is one of the most relevant and important challenges to  consider for securing the IoT supply chain (e.g. how to assess the security of ODM (Original  Design Manufacturers) binaries without source code). Each stakeholder should establish a  minimum level of trust according to their needs and expertise, analysing the flux of data and  guaranteeing the security and privacy within their services of products. Trust models define a  framework to provide formal guarantees about the behaviour of the different parties and  enhance security. The supply chain would greatly benefit from developing innovative trust  models or adapting existing ones to focus on its specific necessities. It should be noted that  10 For further information on these standards, please see Annex B.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  28  there is no one-fits-all approach to trust. An approach based on consistent risk evaluation would  allow organizations to evaluate the business impact to apply the proper technical measures and  contractual obligations (e.g. audits).  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-04 ADOPT THE VIEW OF SECURITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS A  CONTINUOUS PROCESS  Security in the supply chain should not be characterized as an occasional activity or a state, as  the assurances provided by actions in the security plane (e.g. penetration tests) decrease in  value over time once they have been obtained. The concept of a process implies flow and  formal consensus among stakeholders, as well as approval and acceptance. Security should be  included in all stages of the supply chain as a continuous and iterative process.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-05 MAINTAIN AND TRAIN A QUALIFIED AND SKILLED  WORKFORCE  As is the case with many technological fields, the IoT domain displays a fast pace of change.  Maintaining a skilled workforce that has access to regular security training and the required  resources to keep up to date with the field is of great importance to face the security challenges  raised by the supply chain for IoT. Professional teams dedicated solely to security should be  present in most organizations; those that lack the resources to maintain such teams should at  least ensure that other technical teams have an appropriate degree of knowledge on security.  References  Own sources: Questionnaire Analysis Report   Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-06 PROMOTE A DEVELOPER WORK CULTURE FOCUSED ON A  RISK-BASED APPROACH  Software developers sometimes tend to invest significant resources in pursuing extended  functionality for the end product, which can have the undesired side effect of taking said  resources from security-related tasks. This issue can be exacerbated by some decisions from  the management layers, if they are detached from the development focus, a perfect example of  this is unrealistic deadlines. Promoting a development process that considers risks when  distributing resources and ensures that security receives the appropriate attention can have a  significant impact in the security of the supply chain.  ACT-07 PROMOTE IOT SECURITY AWARENESS FOR USERS  A significant percentage of users lack knowledge about security configuration and are not fully  aware of the impact of weak security. Vulnerable IoT devices in the possession of users can  sometimes be used as an entry point to systems and services in the supply chain (e.g. servers  used for provisioning or configuration). The burden of security should never be left as a  responsibility to the user; however, organizations could benefit from investing resources in  campaigns and actions to raise awareness on the importance of proper security. For example,  this could take the form of marketing campaigns or carefully crafted configuration modules to  provide guidance and a great user experience. In addition, manufacturers should be required to  include a comprehensive user guide or manual, which provides instructions on the safe and  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  29  secure use of its products.  In a related fashion, consumers should also be educated to ensure  they view counterfeiting as an unacceptable and dangerous practice.  References  Standards: CMU SPL - Carnegie Mellon University’s Security & Privacy  Label  ACT-08 PROVIDE SECURITY PROMISES TO CUSTOMERS  Customers should be clearly and explicitly provided with comprehensive information related to  security. This includes, for example, possible vulnerabilities that could be discovered during the  life cycle of the product, or the relation of software updates that are deployed in devices on the  field. The transference of this information to actors down in the chain is crucial to achieve  continuous security. This practice is closely related to ACT-01 and ACT-02, it is, however,  presented separately to highlight its nuances and relevance.  4.2.2 Processes  PRO-01 ADOPT SECURITY BY DESIGN PRINCIPLES  Security modules should be considered components of high priority and factored into the design  process from the first stages throughout the entirety of the supply chain; this is to avoid the  threat that originates when security modules are treated as an afterthought or considered of a  lesser priority. Integration of a strong chain of trust should be a priority to ensure the integrity of  hardware and software modules in IoT devices (please see TEC-06). Use of secure coding  techniques and tests focused on security (e.g. penetration tests, vulnerability scanning) should  be included in the appropriate stages of the IoT supply chain to implement and validate  appropriate security features. A security baseline to cover the most important components of the  IoT supply chain should be defined; such a security model should cover the security core  elements: protection, detection and incident response. Human factors must also be taken into  account at the design stage. Best practices must be enforced and followed rigorously to avoid  undermined security because of poor user decisions. The inclusion of legal departments in the  security and privacy assessments is another important practice that should be integrated into  the design process. Moreover, security experts should be directly involved in the early  conceptual design discussions with the product management team, so they can include their  point of view in the selection of the materials according to their security requirements.

It is desirable to minimize these assumptions when  feasible, while maintaining privacy assurances for the end user. An advanced tool or  mechanism to help with data collection and measurement would be of significant help in this  regard. Initiatives like the International Data Spaces—an international initiative with links to the  European Commission focused on improving methods and mechanisms for a more secure and  trusted data exchange in business ecosystems—may also provide inspiration.

Most  interpretations could agree that it is related to the state of the supply chain operating in an  unadulterated manner, being free of counterfeits, malware or other influences that may reduce  visibility and accountability (e.g. not being able to properly trace firmware updates). Metrics can  be created and monitored continuously to provide visibility on the state of the supply chain. These  metrics could be tied to the specifics of the current supply chain or be more horizontal in nature.  Metrics could be designed mainly in the earlier design phases and be adjusted in an iterative and  continuous fashion depending on the evolution of the supply chain. Examples of such metrics  could include the distribution of firmware versions that are currently deployed in the field.

The development process includes dividing the supply chain  into functional blocks and listing the assets in those blocks, to later detect critical assets and  blocks. To this end, a knowledge base of attack tactics and techniques such as MITRE ATT&CK  or the threat model presented in this report may serve as the foundation to develop combined  (safety-security) threat models. This also should include, besides threats of attacks,  unintentional incidents that may also impact security, safety and performance resulting from  errors in managing the increased complexity of systems coming from the addition of IoT. Risk  assessment methodology should be applied in order to assess the relative importance of the  threats depending on the criticality of the domain and implement actions (e.g. optimizing the  resources available, preparing contingency plans) to protect the different stages in the supply  chain—motivation behind the cyberattacks (e.g. financial gain, terrorism) should also be  considered to define cost-effective protections and security controls. Furthermore, a significant  amount of IoT elements present a lack of accountability for the tasks they perform. This is due  to the absence of logging in most IoT devices because of hardware constraints or additional  costs. A risk assessment for the whole IoT supply chain setup should be performed to identify  components where logging components are necessary.

These software components must be documented as part of the  supply chain security process, including the criteria followed for its selection; organizations  should prefer those that have passed an evaluation and certification process, and include a  maintenance plan. A comprehensive analysis of the source code is recommended for open  source cases where a reputable community of maintainers and industry stakeholders cannot be  identified—a possible approach to cover vulnerable code is to deploy a custom layer on top,  although this forces the organization to follow the updates of the original developer. To help with  the software identification process, organizations may use software tools specialized in  11 Xu, Xiaolin, Fahim Rahman, Bicky Shakya, Apostol Vassilev, Domenic Forte, and Mark Tehranipoor. 2019. “Electronics  Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain.” ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems 24 (3): 1– 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571 .  12 Khan, Faud, and David Rogers. 2019. “IoT Cybersecurity Guidelines, Standards and Verification Systems.” In .

Scanning products may also be leveraged to identify  software components and vulnerabilities; source code scanning tools are available for internal  and open source components, while binary scanning tools can be applied in the context of  closed source. It should be noted that open source tools can play a significant role in IoT  security as transparency and openness are highly important. The open source community is  also efficient when finding flaws and promptly fixing them. The industry benefits greatly when  fixes for vulnerabilities discovered in open source tools in the context of a private organization  are released back to the open source community.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  PRO-06 ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN  All IoT solutions should include a comprehensive testing plan to verify that the product displays  the expected features in both the software and hardware. Acceptance testing should occur  independently from any previous testing that could have taken place in earlier stages in the  supply chain. A fraction of the devices should be inspected in the last part of manufacturing and  subjected to cybersecurity testing to detect misconfigurations or errors.  References  Own sources: Questionnaire Analysis Report   Desktop research: IoT cybersecurity guidelines, standards and verification  systems, a caba white paper13  PRO-07 IMPLEMENT FACTORY SETTINGS THAT USE SECURITY BY  DEFAULT  A significant percentage of customers tend to ignore security features due to convenience  reasons or a lack of technical knowledge; this usually results in vulnerabilities that could be  avoided with an appropriate usage of the security features already included in the devices and  products. Security by default should be the approach for the manufacturers and suppliers, so  customers that need to disable security have to do so in a conscious and explicit manner. This  approach would be based on a consistent security model that is mandatory to be applied and  ensure that data is properly collected, manipulated and transferred.  PRO-08 COMMIT TO PROVIDING SECURITY PATCHES FOR A CERTAIN  PERIOD OF TIME  Legacy IoT devices based on unmaintained software are a threat to the integrity of the supply  chain. Extended support and a timely delivery of security patches should be factored into the  design and planning of an IoT product—this includes proper dimensioning of resources (e.g.  memory) to support future updates. Manufacturers should have the obligation to deliver security  patches at least until the end-of warranty time, and preferably until the end-of-support time. In  any case, the period of time that the manufacturer commits to provide the security patches  should be explicitly and clearly indicated in advance to procurement, and available at no  additional cost during use.  PRO-09 INTEGRATE SECURE SCRAP MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Materials and components produced in the manufacturing and fabrication stages that fail the  quality tests or are not deemed ready for production due to any possible reason should be  processed and disposed of in a secure fashion (e.g. avoid leaving the defective units in  unsecured containers). This is to avoid the threat of malicious actors gaining access to said  13 Khan, Faud, and David Rogers. 2019. “IoT Cybersecurity Guidelines, Standards and Verification Systems.” In . CABA.

PRO-10 USE SECURE DATA REMOVAL TECHNIQUES  Devices are usually restored back to factory settings and cleared of all private user data during  the decommissioning and recovery stages. Insecure data removal practices (e.g. a simple  deletion process that does not overwrite all storage sectors) may leave traces of private user  data in the persistent storage that may be later recovered using specialized software tools by  another user with access to the device. Secure data erasure techniques should be integrated  into these stages to ensure that all private user data and configuration data are effectively  removed in a safe manner. Some of these techniques should be taken into consideration way  before the data removal such as the cryptographic erase, that means that this good practice  should be adopted from the beginning of the supply chain.

This is a critical issue as the  absence of said resources is a threat to the supply chain; moreover, the presence of sub-par  documentation could actually be actively harmful. The support and end-of-life stages are  especially vulnerable to this threat. ENISA could play a significant role in this regard by hosting  and maintaining a repository of resources such as list of flawed software stacks to be avoided  by vendors, or a list of secure components and proven combinations to be used as a guideline  in the design stage.

Although some IT security standards could be applied, there are limitations,  depending on the industry. Some standards, such as ISO27001 or the recent NERC CIP-013-1,  could arguably be considered quite open or generic. For certain domains or industries, some  standards are too abstract and perceived as difficult to understand and apply in the context.  Moreover, there is arguably a gap between the standardisation bodies and the development  community. Development of new standards or adaptation of existing ones would contribute  towards giving coherence to the security management for the global supply chain for IoT and  improving the integration of security information across all actors. One of the most important  challenges related to this issue is finding building blocks for the supply chain that are meaningful  and general enough to be applied in a horizontal fashion, thus reducing the cost of entry of  implementing a standard for small and medium companies.  14 Kissel, Richard, Andrew Regenscheid, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine. 2014. “Guidelines for Media Sanitization.” NIST  SP 800-88r1.

These  lists increase visibility into the product and enable both the manufacturer and external users to  check for known vulnerabilities and validate the device from a security standpoint, helping to  reduce the vulnerability gaps that may enable attackers successfully leverage a vulnerability for  malicious purposes. Increased product visibility may also lead to increased trust between actors  of the supply chain. SBOMs should ideally be available for all IoT products of any given  organization, regardless of the fact if they are commercially distributed or not. SBOMs can serve  as a building block for the implementation of a configuration management and versioning  system; these systems support the evolution of software components, improving traceability and  enabling users and organizations to establish a timeline of software versions. This can, in turn,  be used to revert to previous stable states in case of unexpected issues.

The scope of the supply chain should be extended towards the end-of-life of any  connected device, especially if OTA updates are involved. The update of IoT devices is difficult  since the products are usually based on various packages from different sources and using  different tools and third-party components. The planning and management of these updates is  something very important to consider.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  TEC-02 LEVERAGE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR SECURITY  CONTROL AND AUDITING  Emerging technologies could help provide visibility into the supply chain for IoT and should at  least be evaluated. Organizations should first assess their viability from a security standpoint  before committing to an application. Examples of such technologies include Blockchain, that can  be used to provide strong integrity guarantees in traceability systems; and artificial intelligence  (AI), which could help support professionals in the process of decision-making for a wide range  of issues. For example, Device Fingerprinting (DFP) is an example application of AI where  device identity is derived from its network activity without the need of reading an unequivocal  identity. However, organizations should factor in the fact that AI does not provide absolute  performance guarantees and should be used as a complementary tool in a significant number of  cases.  16 Buchheit, Marcellus, Mark Hermeling, Frederick Hirsch, Bob Martin, and Simon Rix. 2020. “Software Trustworthiness  Best Practices.” An Industrial Internet Consortium White Paper.  https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/Software_Trustworthiness_Best_Practices_Whitepaper_2020_03_23.pdf .  https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/Software_Trustworthiness_Best_Practices_Whitepaper_2020_03_23.pdf  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  34  References  Desktop research: Electronics Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by  Blockchain17  TEC-03 USE HARDWARE MECHANISMS TO PROVIDE INTERNAL  VALIDATION  Integrate hardware obfuscation techniques into the circuit design processes to protect against  threats such as reverse engineering and overproduction. These techniques are based on  adding key inputs that are not critical to the actual functionality of the circuit but are used to  validate the operation; the output of said circuits would not be correct in the presence of an  invalid key. The secret keys should not be known to the untrusted foundries and OSATs and  should be activated later in the fabrication process by the IP owner. In a related fashion,  transport keys and/or activation keys should be used to protect from theft during transport  (between entities or sites).

In the case of firmware signing the hash of any given firmware image is  signed using a private key that is only available to the genuine provider of the software; the  public key is later used by the device to verify the integrity of firmware images. Secure boot  refers to the practice of cryptographically validating the entire chain of software components that  take part in the device boot process starting from an immutable root of trust. This integrity  measures must be used during device manufacturing (when firmware is flashed in first boot)  and during maintenance (in OTA) these cryptographic operations must be done in conjunction  with a tamper resistant hardware in the framework of the chain of trust (being the tamper  resistant hardware the root). These two measures can be integrated into existing Service-Level  Agreements with third-party suppliers. It is also worth mentioning that GlobalPlatform members  are working towards developing security standards that define a series of security foundations  (SRFs) (e.g. root of trust, secure firmware installation)—these could be used to provide visibility  of the security features in the chips. This integrity measures must be used during device  manufacturing (when firmware is flashed in first boot) and during maintenance (in OTA); ii)  these cryptographic operations must be done in conjunction with a tamper resistant hardware in  the framework of the chain of trust (being the tamper resistant hardware the root).

TEC-06 INTEGRATE A STRONG ROOT OF TRUST  A root of trust is the first item in the chain of trust of a device; it is commonly implemented using  a dedicated hardware component that provides a set of cryptographic capabilities and primitives  that can be assumed as trustworthy by the device. These components are usually tamper-  resistant on a hardware level and can be used as the foundation for security measures such as  firmware signing or secure boot. Software alternatives with lower costs also exist, although they  are significantly more vulnerable, and thus they are, in general, fit for a limited scope of  applications. Actors in the IoT supply chain (e.g. OS providers, application developers) should  base their contributions in this security foundation when possible.

The stages of the lifecycle of most IoT  devices are not discrete, that is, further development can occur once the device has been  deployed; and vulnerabilities with impact on supply chain systems can be discovered at a later  date, or as a result of data gathered from an actual attack. The ability to react quickly to  changes in the environment and deploy updates for remote devices shall be included and  considered from the earlier stages of design. Furthermore, these mechanisms shall be secure to  prevent misuse and malware injection.  References  Desktop research: TCG Guidance for Secure Update of Software and  Firmware on Embedded Systems21  TEC-08 INTEGRATE AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS INTO CIRCUITS  To support traceability and maintenance, device authentication is mandatory. Physical  Unclonable Functions (PUF)—a primitive based on the physical characteristics of a circuit that  derive from its fabrication process and provide unequivocal identification—is one of the most  significant options available. This means that PUF can be used to determine if a given device is  genuine, improving the traceability of devices throughout the supply chain. Advantages of PUF  include resistance to invasive attacks, which require the attacker to face the complex prospect  of modifying the physical characteristics of the circuit. It should be noted that, in addition to PUF,  other technologies such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) can be used to this end.  Closely related to this good practice is the recommendation of properly leveraging traceability  data that may be already included by silicon manufacturers in their chips.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  36  TEC-09 CONSIDER THE CYBERSECURITY POSSIBILITIES INTRODUCED  BY HARDWARE-SOFTWARE COLLABORATION  Hardware-software collaborative schemes are an approach that focus on covering the  cybersecurity gap left by security measures that operate solely on the hardware or software  layers. Hardware measures can benefit from the context provided by the current state of the  system on a software level; while vulnerabilities in software measures can be covered when the  software is able to communicate with specialized hardware components, especially in those  cases where the attacker gains privileged/root access. It could be argued that trusted execution  can be achieved only by combining hardware and software. Examples of applications of these  schemes include secure storage for PUF-based keys and security assurances for untrusted  kernel extensions. The security of IoT devices can be significantly improved by implementing  these schemes in those cases where it is feasible to do so, however, this is usually an  endeavour that requires high technical expertise.

GUIDELINES AND  CONCLUSIONS  This chapter reflects the general conclusions extracted from the analysis of the good practices  and standards. Conclusions take the form of a set of guidelines that represent high-level  recommendations and an entry point to the expanded set of good practices. They are intended  to serve as super categories—all good practices have been classified under one of the  guidelines—and a quick reference to the comprehensive list of good practices, which may be  difficult to parse.  Each guideline presents a set of related good practices that can be categorized under said  guideline and a set of standards that are relevant and strongly related. Please note that  although other standards could be relevant in the context of any given guideline, only the ones  that are considered the most pertinent are mentioned.  5.1 FORGING BETTER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ACTORS  This guideline addresses the security issues that may arise from problems and frictions in the  communications and relationships between actors in the supply chain. The set of actors may  include, for example, integrated device manufacturers (IDM), foundries, outsourced  semiconductor assembly and test companies (OSAT), software development houses, logistics  companies or cloud service providers.  These issues may be malicious in nature or have their origin in misunderstandings or lack of  coordination. Some problematic examples that can be identified include errors in design due to  lack of visibility into the components provided by suppliers, or overproduction of a product  outside of the boundaries of an established contract.  The opportunities for organizations to improve security are clearer when they look beyond their  own operations. The use of the connections that exist between the links of the supply chain to  share key information will increase the efficiency of all actors in the chain. The increase of  visibility is an important benefit from a security perspective, which will help to define a better  security design of the supply chain and the device consequently, in the conceptual phase.  While vertical collaboration—between suppliers and customers—is more common, horizontal  collaboration between supply chain actors is also desirable for certain aspects of the security,  such as the creation and establishment of industry regulations or other common frameworks.  Good practices  to consider   Prioritize working with suppliers that provide  cybersecurity guarantees.   Work towards improving transparency.   Develop innovative trust models.   Adopt the view of security in the supply chain as a  continuous process.   Favour the adoption of SLAs that require the  presence of software integrity measures.   Provide security promises to customers.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  38  Most pertinent  standards   ISO/IEC 27001: Requirements for an information  security mgmt. system (ISMS)   ISO 27036: Information security for supplier  relationships  5.2 CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE SHOULD BE FURTHER CULTIVATED  Problems that have their origin in errors in the usage, design and implementation of controls  and mechanisms related to the security domain can usually be difficult to detect and assess,  especially when compared to problems in the actual functionality of the device. This is  exacerbated by the moderately recent nature of the IoT industry, as best practices and past  experiences are not as firmly established as in other industries.  Members of any layer of an organization (e.g. engineering, management, and marketing) may  be inclined to neglect security training and education, falsely assuming that \"it won't happen to  me or my organization\". However, security issues tend to be pervasive and severe, and as  such, the lack of knowledge in this area needs to be adequately addressed.  It should also be noted that superficial security knowledge may lead to a false sense of security  and could become a threat. Training deficiencies, lack of standard procedures and limited  supervision usually have a direct correlation to significant security vulnerabilities in a later stage  of the product.  Good practices  to consider   Maintain and train a qualified and skilled  workforce.   Promote a developer work culture focused on a  risk-based approach.   Promote IoT security awareness for users.  Most pertinent  standards   NIST 8276: Key practices in cyber Supply Chain  risk management.  5.3 SECURITY BY DESIGN  The design of an IoT device or product is a complex process that requires careful planning and  risk management. Early decisions made during the design phase usually have impactful  implications on later stages, especially during maintenance. Complexity originates in a  significant amount of cases from particular characteristics of the IoT domain; for example, the  tendency of devices to be constrained in terms of resources, which may impose limits to the  implementation of security measures or upgradability during lifecycle.  Security goals can often fail—even in the presence of good design—if there is a lack of tools  that enable stakeholders to understand and assess security issues. Although some degree of  flexibility is desirable, organizations should also be vigilant to ensure a well-planned strategy is  adequately executed even in the face of possible shortcuts that could falsely appear to be more  efficient in terms of resources.  IoT is applied to solve business problems, thus the high-level customer requirements should be  included as the main input to assess the security aspects of products and services.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  39  Furthermore, the fact that cybersecurity is not perceived as an added value in IoT mass  products should be taken into account, as it usually slows the adoption of security technologies  by all stakeholders.  Good practices  to consider   Adopt security by design principles.   Establish and improve data collection,  measurement technologies, and data  management.   Create supply chain integrity metrics.   Leverage emerging technologies for security  control and auditing.   Establish and improve planning and management  of device upgradeability and obsolescence.   Implement mechanisms for remote update.   Develop threat models for the IoT supply chain.  Most pertinent  standards   ISO 20243: Mitigating maliciously tainted and  counterfeit products.  5.4 TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE AND EXPLICIT APPROACH TO SECURITY  The majority of security threats detected during any stage of the IoT supply chain—all except  those where the impact is negligible—should be explicitly addressed by organizations. This  could be applied to all domains but is crucial in the IoT context due to the increased number of  devices and deployment characteristics, which usually include public spaces and unattended  operation.  Preconceptions and biases related to security should ideally be considered during risk  management. Data and designs can be analysed and validated from multiple points of view, and  human intervention should be carefully monitored when feasible. The cost of reacting to a  security breach is usually higher than the cost of adequately addressing the issue in a proactive  fashion.  Good practices  to consider   Identify third-party software.   Establish a comprehensive test plan.   Implement factory settings that use security by  default.   Commit to providing security patches for a certain  period of time.   Integrate secure scrap management processes.   Use secure data removal techniques.   Use hardware mechanisms to provide internal  validation.   Integrate identity management systems for IoT  devices.   Integrate a strong root of trust.   Integrate authentication mechanisms into circuits.   Consider the cybersecurity possibilities  introduced by hardware-software collaboration.   Provide Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for  IoT devices.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  40   Create comprehensive documentation resources.  Most pertinent  standards   ISO 11889: Trusted platform module (TPM)   IETF RFC 8520: Manufacturer usage description  (MUD)   IEEE 802.1AR-2018: Secure device identity for  local and metropolitan area networks   ISO 20243: Mitigating maliciously tainted and  counterfeit products.  5.5 LEVERAGE EXISTING STANDARDS AND GOOD PRACTICES  Existing standards, previous cases and relevant legal frameworks are a cornerstone of a  successful IoT supply chain implementation. Organizations can benefit greatly from dedicating  resources to studying the current landscape and adapting the existing best practices to their  particular case. This approach should also be applied to the internal interactions in an  organization, as documentation resources and processes developed by a department can  usually turn out to be critical assets for other teams.  Standards are created by bringing together all interested parties. All actors in the supply chain  for IoT should make progress towards new or adapted standards in those cases where gaps are  detected, as all of them will benefit from standardization through increased safety and quality of  their products and services. Governments are important actors that should also be taken into  account. The industry should work towards solving security and trust issues before government  regulation forces a more unpalatable solution.  Security standards implemented at every stage of the supply chain reduce the attack surface—  simple measures usually have a big impact in this reduction.  Good practices  to consider   Develop or adapt standards for the supply chain  for IoT.  Most pertinent  standards   GSMA SAS-UP: Security accreditation scheme  for UICC production.   CMU SPL: Security and privacy label.

Establishing secure  supply chain across the IoT ecosystem is a fundamental building block for IoT security. Supply  chain lays the foundation of IoT devices security, because the majority of these devices are  comprised from a multitude of components from different suppliers (both hardware and  software). At the same time, supply chains present a weak link for cybersecurity because  organisations cannot always control the security measures taken by supply chain partners.  Taking a step back and looking into the entire supply chain of IoT products and services, ENISA  with the input of IoT experts created security guidelines for the whole lifespan: from  requirements and design, to end use delivery and maintenance, as well as disposal. The  motivation is clear: security is not only about the end product, but also about the processes to  be followed to develop the product.  ENISA has long argued for security by design and by default to be weaved into digital products .  Setting specific security guidelines for IoT supply chain security is of paramount importance to  holistically approach the issue of IoT security. IoT security needs to be considered at all stages  of the supply chain, from the early conceptual design to the end user delivery and maintenance.  It is therefore important to analyse the relevant supply chain security threats and accordingly to  set forward security measures and guidelines that help avoiding the risks that affect  trustworthiness of the IoT supply chain.  The study is developed to help IoT manufacturers, developers, integrators and all stakeholders  that are involved to the supply chain of IoT to make better security decisions when building,  deploying, or assessing IoT technologies. This study builds up on existing ENISA studies on IoT  security, the baseline IoT security recommendations and the secure software development  lifecycle for IoT, and thus should be considered as complementary to the work that has been  produced from ENISA the previous years. It aims to serve as a point of reference for secure  supply chain for IoT.  This ENISA study aspires to address cybersecurity challenges related to the security of the  supply chain for IoT. It analyses the different stages of the IoT supply chain and explores all the  important security considerations to be taken into account in each stage.  Key guidelines of the report conclude on the need to:   Forge better relationships between actors   Further cultivate cybersecurity expertise   Adopt security by design principles   Take a comprehensive and explicit approach to security   Leverage existing standards and good practices  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The heterogeneous nature of the IoT ecosystem and its critical use make security an essential  aspect that must be taken care of. Although most of the IoT hardware and software vendors  consider and apply security measures during the design and development of their products and  services, security implications1 can be found at the stages of the supply chain where IoT  solutions are produced.  Any organisation that deals with physical goods understands the concept of the supply chain.  Supply chain activities transform natural resources, raw materials, software, and components  into a finished IoT product or service that is delivered to the end customer. Concepts like supply  chain optimisation and supply chain risk management need to be considered when developing  IoT solutions2. Understanding supply chains is a critical factor in business success and in  security and quality of end-products. ENISA has been advocating for security and privacy by  design and by default. The wide range of heterogeneous actors and IoT assets involved in the  IoT supply chain introduce new challenges and aspects that are reflected in this study, along  with a set of good practices and guidelines to be applied in the different phases of the supply  chain.  Although IoT is being used as a key enabling technology to secure the supply chain of several  industries (e.g. by tracking of assets, raw materials, supplies, etc.), the supply chain security for  the IoT itself must be ensured. Security in the IoT needs to be considered at all stages of the  supply chain, from the early conceptual design to the end user delivery and maintenance or  even repurposing.  The IoT threat landscape is highly complex and has been analysed exhaustively by ENISA  studies that cover the specific elements of the IoT ecosystem (e.g. embedded devices, IoT  platforms, network components). Relevant studies published by ENISA include:   Supply Chain Integrity: An overview of the ICT supply chain risks and challenges, and  vision for the way forward (2015).   Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT (2017).   Good Practices for Security of Internet of Things in the context of Smart Manufacturing  (2018).   Good Practices for Security of IoT - Secure Software Development Lifecycle (2019).   Industry 4.0 - Cybersecurity Challenges and Recommendations (2019).  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This ENISA study aspires to address cybersecurity challenges related to the security of the  supply chain for IoT. The main objectives of this study aim at identifying challenges, threats,  security considerations and good practices for ensuring cybersecurity across the different  stages of the IoT supply chain.  1 Boyens, Jon M. 2020. “Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations from Industry.” Preprint.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276-draft  2 Cascella, Roberto. 2019. “Challenges of Cybersecurity Certification and Supply Chain Management.” ECSO - EUNITY  Workshop, January 24.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8276-draft  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  7  To this end, the following objectives have been set:   Analyse the different IoT supply chain stages and underline key cybersecurity  challenges in each one.   Identify key cybersecurity threats targeting the IoT supply chain.   Underline main challenges for employing security across the IoT supply chain.   Identify security measures and map them to threats and supply chain stages.   Develop guidelines that may support IoT stakeholders securing the IoT supply chain.  1.2 SCOPE  The scope of the study includes all the stages of the IoT supply chain, defined as a holistic  system of organizations, people, technology, processes, information, and other physical and  virtual resources involved in the whole lifespan of any IoT product or service, from the  conception to the end customer supply and the end of the product life cycle.

Given the  heterogeneous phases involved in the supply chain and the complexity of the IoT ecosystem,  the target audience of this study comprises the following profiles:   IoT software developers and manufacturers.   Information security experts.   IT/Security solutions architects.   Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).   Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) experts.   Project managers.   Procurement teams.  1.4 METHODOLOGY  This ENISA study was carried out using a five-step methodological approach.  1. Scope definition and identification of experts: The first step was to establish the  scope of the study and to pinpoint the main topics to be considered. A concurrent  activity involved identifying the relevant IoT subject matter experts to contribute to this  study. The experts (members of ENISA informal expert groups on IoTSec and EICS)  provided input and expertise in relation to the objectives of this report.  2. Desktop research: Extensive research of relevant efforts to gather information on  securing the IoT supply chain. The identified documents included existing good  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  8  practices, publications, standards and other initiatives on the topics related to the  objectives of the report. This served as the foundations and support for the analysis of  the threats and for the development of the security measures.  3. Questionnaire and interviews with identified experts: ENISA reached out to the  identified experts in order to collect information and get their point of view. To this end,  an online questionnaire covering various security aspects, such as critical assets, key  threats targeting IoT supply chain and awareness with respect to supply chain  standards and guidelines, was developed. The identified experts completed the  questionnaire, and interviews were conducted with experts to collect additional  valuable inputs to prepare the report.  4. Analysis and development: The results from the desktop research, online  questionnaire and the interviews were analysed to align them with the objectives of the  report, developing the asset and threat taxonomies. This helped to identify the attack  scenarios, as well as the IoT supply chain security measures. This led to the  development of the first draft of this report.  5. Report write-up and validation: ENISA shared the draft of the report with its relevant  stakeholder communities and reference groups for review. The draft validation will be  done in parallel with the continuous improvement of the report. The final report will be  shared again to be reviewed at the end of its write up.  1.5 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  This report is structured as follows:   Chapter 1 - Introduction: provides introductory information to the report and  introduces the scope, objectives, and the methodology followed.   Chapter 2 – Overview of IoT supply chain: presents the different phases and formal  definitions of the IoT supply chain. It also discusses cybersecurity considerations in the  different phases; these considerations are expanded in the following chapters.   Chapter 3 –Threat taxonomy: identifies the security threats affecting IoT supply chain  and details some examples of potential attack scenarios.   Chapter 4 – Good practices for security of IoT supply chain: lists and descriptions  of good practices and security measures to secure the IoT supply chain.   Chapter 5 – Guidelines and conclusions: once the main conclusions of the report  had been laid out in the format of good practices in the previous chapter, a series of  written guidelines are presented to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the  security in the IoT supply chain.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  9  2. OVERVIEW OF IOT  SUPPLY CHAIN  2.1 SUPPLY CHAIN REFERENCE MODEL FOR IOT  The IoT supply chain includes the actors, processes and assets that participate in the  realization (e.g. development, design, maintenance, patch management) of any IoT device.  This study considers the supply chain for IoT is composed of two main aspects: the physical  aspect and the logic aspect. The physical supply chain relates to all the physical objects (e.g.  devices, electronic components, appliances) moved through the supply chain phases, as well  as the associated manual processes (e.g. manual assembly, distribution processes). The logic  aspect of the supply chain for IoT is associated with the software development and deployment,  network-based communications, and virtual interactions between the IoT objects and the supply  chain stakeholders.  IoT supply chain risks, and more generally IT supply chain risks, are associated with an  organisation’s decreased visibility into, and understanding of, how the technology they employ  in their product or solution is developed, integrated, and deployed3. An overview of the IoT  supply chain is provided , presenting all its different stages with a detailed mapping of them that  can be found after the following subsections. This aims to give an approximation of the stages  sequence and the interactions between actors to identify where the security concerns might  arise.  Although the stage layers are presented as being separated, it should be taken into account  that sometimes they are treated as a single entity due to project constraints or other business  realities.  3 National Cyber Security Centre. 2018. “Supply Chain Security Guidance.” National Cyber Security Centre.  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  10  Figure 1: Supply Chain Reference Model for IoT  2.1.1 Conceptual Phase  During this phase, the products and services are conceptually designed. This includes both  software and hardware units, as well as other services that may be involved. This early stage is  important to define and establish the basic security foundations that will be part of the  requirements during the subsequent stages in the supply chain. Security at the design phase is  critical as some cost-driven decisions or mistakes at this stage may result in security flaws in the  final product.  This phase contains the design of security models. Physical and digital assets are inextricably  linked in the IoT domain—a security model for the IoT supply chain should merge both physical  safety and digital security.  Requirements are also specified at the conceptual stage. One of the main challenges is the  harmonization of the different disciplines (e.g. hardware engineering, security engineering,  business) to achieve proper security in the IoT product while properly considering all the  requirements. One other challenge is the understanding the target environment. For ‘general  purpose’ devices there is likely to be a wide range of target environments, all exhibiting different  risks and therefore expressing different risk appetite.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  11  Finally, it should be noted that the investment of resources in the conceptual and development  phases tends to contribute to minimize the cost of making an error in later stages.  2.1.2 Development Phase  Broadly speaking the Development Phase consists of a wide range of tasks that span from  semiconductor fabrication to firmware programming and whose main objective is producing a  physical device ready to ship to customers. Development of software services and platforms  required for the operation and deployment of IoT devices are also included in this phase. This is  one of the most critical phases as most of the risks and threats arise from poor decisions,  omissions or mistakes at this point.  As is the case with the conceptual phase, the lack of visibility of the development-related  differences (e.g. timelines, needs) between the different teams (e.g. software, security) can  have a significant and negative impact on security.  On a deeper level, a typical IoT device will go through many steps during the Development  Phase. Those steps can roughly be categorized under Hardware and Software, with the former  consisting mainly in semiconductor fabrication (according to design guidelines), PCB  manufacturing, component integration and functional testing; while the latter involves  components like on-chip microcode, operating systems, middleware, third-party libraries, cloud  services integration and several development tools.  The number of actors involved in this stage can be potentially very high. For example,  semiconductor manufacturers, PCB integrators, security engineers, device assembly and  packaging and developers (micro-code, firmware, operating systems, middleware, libraries).  2.1.3 Production Phase  This phase involves mass production, distribution, and logistics. A significant percentage of IoT  devices use multiple units from different vendors and thus require a wide, and often complex,  supply chain. This usually leads to a multi-faceted logistic challenge, where keeping track of all  the stages and sources is not an easy task.  This phase is linked with the support and retirement phases, as the challenges that are involved  in the initial distribution resurface when products have to be retrieved due to malfunction or to  be disposed of.  The IoT supply chain production phase may be defined as the effort needed to efficiently and  securely deliver while keeping track of all the units in IoT devices. Typically, this involves  several different actors: shipping, warehousing, inventory management, delivery fleet operation,  packaging, handling and customer support, among others.  2.1.4 Utilisation Phase  Although it depends greatly on the type of device and services provided, the Utilisation Phase  contains all those tasks required to get the device up and running at the customer final location.  For a typical device this usually involves tasks ranging from delivery to the customer or retailers,  physical installation at the operating location, device initial set-up, establishing secure user  credentials both at device level and remote services, pairing with mobile devices, data  collection/sharing agreements up to cloud/3rd-party services.  As is the case in the other phases, the complexities of the supply chain require a significant  number of potential actors to be involved in this phase. For example, logistics companies to  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  12  transport IoT products, retailers, technicians to participate in the deployment process or cloud  service providers that offer the services that serve as building blocks of IoT platforms. These  actors are usually also involved in the following support and retirement phases.  2.1.5 Support Phase  When thinking about the support phase in the life cycle of a product, we always tend to think in  repairing damages or fixing issues. From the perspective of the supply chain in IoT devices this  often means repairing or replacing damaged units. The IoT devices are very susceptible to  damage and malfunctions, as such the IoT suppliers usually have a good size team working as  support of their product, that work closely with the developers and users if needed.  But there is another very important part of the support phase that revolves around the constant  supervision of the unit’s security. This part is mainly divided between maintaining updates4 for  the devices (firmware, software and libraries) and remote support.  For this phase of the supply chain, the report is focusing on the continuous prevention  aspect.The majority of the IoT devices are widespread and usually have various components  with different origins. This makes it even harder to ensure the security of the devices, and even  presents threats to the functionality of the product. This is why a lot of security measures and  good practices have been centred around this phase, using different technologies and  standards to ensure a correct support of the IoT devices through its life cycle.  2.1.6 Retirement Phase  The final phase of a product consists in a series of steps to ensure that the disposal of the IoT  device is done securely. One of the key aspects of this phase is the secure removal of the  information in the device5.  If needed, another step in the disposal of a device is its physical destruction. This presents  challenges not only in the cyber-security department but also logistics and environmental  concerns, as electronics wastes involve a great deal of contamination problems. One of these  problems is the scarcity of some of the materials used in creating them, so an important part of  the retirement process is the recycling of the devices.  So, the retirement process can be summarized as the recycling of the devices in economically  feasible and environmentally friendly ways while adhering to security and privacy standards.  Another important breach in security is added when the device is not completely taken out of  circulation but instead is repurposed or refurbished. When reused, there is again a strong need  for information erasing, but also extra measures must be taken to ensure that the product can fit  into its new use.  2.2 DESCRIPTION OF IOT SUPPLY CHAIN STAGES  This section contains brief descriptions of each of the stages in the IoT supply chain. All of them  are relevant from a security standpoint and should be considered in the security process.  2.2.1 Product Design  The first stage includes the generation of the required design resources for both hardware and  software components before proceeding to fabrication and development stages. This process  4 Kissel, Richard, Andrew Regenscheid, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine. 2014. “Guidelines for Media Sanitization.” NIST  SP 800-88r1. National Institute of Standards and Technology. https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1  5 Kyung Lee, Teddy. 2020. “VIA PUF Technology as a Root of Trust in IoT Supply Chain.” Global Semiconductor Alliance  (blog). 2020.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  13  shall take into account security features to support a secure supply chain (e.g. secure root of  trust, process isolation for trusted software). The design of IoT products tends to be complex  due to the highly coupled nature of the relationship between hardware and software—these  products usually have restrictive constraints (e.g. cost, size) and are based on hardware  platforms specifically tailored to the scenario.  Design tasks in the software domain include, for example, gathering functional and non-  functional requirements, producing initial versions of threat models, designing architectures,  defining the technology stack and developing small-scale proof-of-concepts to assess viability.  On the other hand, hardware requires producing schematics for PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards)  and mechanical elements using ECAD (Electronic Computer-Aided Design) and MCAD  (Mechanical Computer-Aided Design) tools. Schematics can then be validated using simulation  processes (e.g. thermal).  The product design phase is significantly challenging due to the fact that is forces designers to  think long-term and consider multiple future issues and possibilities (e.g. how to deal with  remote management of credentials when a root of trust is implemented). On the other hand, it is  comparatively easy to verify.  2.2.2 Semiconductor Fabrication  Developments in the semiconductor fabrication field have played a major role in the recent  growth of the IoT domain, increasing the capabilities and computational resources of devices  with low power consumption and small form factor requirements.  The fabrication stage includes the chemical processes involved in transforming raw  semiconductor materials into silicon wafers; the production of the masks containing patterns that  will be transferred to the silicon wafers after being irradiated with UV light; and what is  commonly known as the IC (Integrated Circuit) frontend process. Two distinct and consecutive  steps can be identified in this process: FEOL (Front End-Of-Line) refers to the first part where  individual electrical components (e.g. transistors, capacitors) are formed on the silicon, while  BEOL (Back End-Of-Line) is the second part where interconnections are formed between  components.  With the shortage of materials being an increasingly pressing issue, the competition for the  access to resources has intensified. Additionally, it should be noted that the separation lines  between fabrication and manufacturing phases are often blurred. Actors such as foundries can  sometimes offer services beyond their expected scope, benefiting from a stronger integration  between steps in the semiconductor chain to optimize costs. The Semiconductor Fabrication  and Component Manufacturing stages could therefore be considered as a single unit depending  on the specific case. Furthermore, another reasonable model of the IoT supply chain could even  group the fabrication and manufacturing stages under the initial design phase due to their low-  level nature.  Not all IoT projects require the design and fabrication of ad-hoc ICs; many products can be  based on off-the-shelf chips to avoid dealing with the high barriers and costs of entry of low-  level semiconductor fabrication (which is only cost-efficient on projects with a high volume of  devices).  Unlike the product design stage, the fabrication and manufacturing stages tend to be more  difficult to verify—this has the side effect of increasing challenges from a security perspective.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  14  2.2.3 Component Manufacturing  This stage is comprised of the tasks that are necessary to arrive at a production-ready IC after  the electrical components and interconnections are formed on the wafers during the  Semiconductor Fabrication stage. These steps include separation of each individual die from  the silicon wafer, and packaging of the die into the final physical IC container for protection and  usage. Extensive testing is also involved6 to validate and ensure that ICs meet the performance  requirements.  PCB manufacturing is another common task that is included in this stage. Unlike ad-hoc ICs,  many IoT projects require the design of custom PCBs that serve as an interconnection platform  for components such as microcontrollers, FPGAs or physical connectors. The PCB only  provides the substrate and interconnection tracks, the actual components are assembled on the  next stage.  2.2.4 Component & Embedded Software Assembly  In this stage electronic components are mounted and soldered on the PCBs. This process may  be manual or automated, depending on the capabilities of the assembly pipeline and the type of  the components—through-hole components tend to be manually soldered, while SMDs  (Surface-Mount Devices) can be automatically placed by specialized machinery.  Software modules or pieces of information that are integral to the units and are not directly  related to the actual IoT application logic (developed in later stages) are loaded and initialized in  this phase. Two distinct types of initialization may be identified: one type includes modules that  are the same for the entire range of devices (e.g. bootloader, firmware); the other includes  modules that change on a per device basis (e.g. device ID). It should be noted that this is  logically separated from the setup that takes part during the service provision stage.  Finally, devices are integrated into their physical enclosures and packaged for distribution to  end users or intermediary VARs (Value-Added Resellers).  Security challenges in this stage arise from the combinations of the same software running with  different configurations in different hardware platforms. The impact of different hardware  platforms in software safety and reliability needs to be evaluated, although this is a hard  process.  2.2.5 Device Programming  This stage can be defined as all the tasks geared towards writing, testing and deploying  functional software on all the components of an IoT device. Depending on the complexity of the  device and the number of different components these tasks might require developing software  at several layers: low-level firmware (e.g. bootloader)7, drivers, networking/communication  stacks, Operating System, Middleware (e.g. web server), user GUI.  This stage can potentially span along most of the lifecycle of the product as part of the  development team is usually involved in the support phase: fixing detected flaws, implementing  new features or simply working alongside the maintenance team in keeping online/cloud  services fully operational.  6 Fagan, Michael, Katerina N Megas, Karen Scarfone, and Matthew Smith. 2020. “Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for  IoT Device Manufacturers.” NIST IR 8259. Gaithersburg, MD: National Institute of Standards and Technology.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259  7 Trusted Computing Group. 2020. “TCG Guidance for Secure Update of Software and Firmware on Embedded Systems.”  Version 1.0 Revision 72.  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  15  2.2.6 IoT Platform Development  An IoT platform is comprised of all the services that are required for the operation and support  of a fleet of IoT devices. These services tend to be centralized in nature, providing intelligence  and capabilities that cannot be implemented in a local fashion in the IoT devices (e.g. due to  constrained resources). The following list contains some examples of IoT platform services:   Identification and authorization services.   Streaming platforms for the ingestion of data flows originated on the IoT devices.  Processing pipelines are usually included to clean, analyse and persist the data.   Services for the provisioning of the environment and configuration of IoT devices.   APIs for the exposition of historical data or events.   Gateways or bridges for the adaptation and translation of protocols.  Tasks involved in this stage are commonly a combination of the development of ad-hoc projects  tailored for the specific context of use, and the integration of third-party APIs and services—  whether exposed on the cloud following the SaaS model (Software as a Service) or installed in  private servers. It is important to note that the endorsement of third-party software is a  significant security challenge for all stages related to software development.  2.2.7 Distribution & Logistics  From the end-user point of view the classical definition of distribution and logistics is about how  to make the goods reach the customer quickly and reliably. However, most IoT devices use  many components and services from different vendors and so require a wide, and often  complex, supply chain. This usually leads to a multi-faceted logistic challenge, where keeping  track of all the stages is not an easy task.  With this in mind we can define IoT supply chain distribution and logistics as the effort needed  to efficiently and securely deliver while keeping track of all the components in IoT devices8.  Typically, this involves several different tasks and actors: shipping, warehousing, inventory  management, delivery fleet operation, packaging and handling among others.  2.2.8 Service Provision & End-User Operation  This term is usually applied to the initial steps to be taken in order to bring an IoT device to a  fully operational state at the customer site (once the physical installation is completed). This  usually requires device initialization, user/application account set-up, networking set-up, cloud  services enrolment and any further custom/ad-hoc device configuration. It is one of the critical  stages at which proper security practices must be enforced, especially by the end-user.  There are many approaches to the service provisioning procedure: End-user driven (either via  manuals or software-based wizards), technician driven (a skilled staff set-up all required  services asking the customer key configuration items) or automatic (device shipped  totally/partially pre-configured or remote configuration retrieval upon device boot).  Three additional sub-stages could be identified: Provision of Public Key Infrastructure,  Evaluation and Certification for Security and Safety, and Third-party and Independent Security  and Safety Assessments. These could be considered as separate stages but are included here  for simplicity.  8 Xu, Xiaolin, Fahim Rahman, Bicky Shakya, Apostol Vassilev, Domenic Forte, and Mark Tehranipoor. 2019. “Electronics  Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain.” ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems 24 (3): 1– 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571  https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  16  2.2.9 Technical Support & Maintenance  Support and maintenance can be defined as the series of actions and processes that are taken  during the device life cycle to keep the IoT product from degrading and ensuring it fulfils its  purpose according to the requirements (i.e. functional, security) in the face of the passage of  time or unexpected developments (e.g. software bugs, zero day vulnerabilities).  Support and maintenance processes can be classified in two categories, remote and local. The  former leverages network infrastructure and techniques like secure firmware or credential  updates to achieve its goal and could be considered more cost-effective. However, the  sensitivity of the information involved can sometimes pose a big challenge that may require of  the physical approach. An example challenge could be remotely revoking and updating device  credentials using a communication channel enabled by those same credentials.  In the case of a technical support instance due to a proactive request from the user's part, the  assigned technician fixes the issue by either guiding the user in the required steps (e.g.  delivering a software update) or remotely connecting to the device. The opportunities for remote  assistance—and the related beneficial cost implications—are defined by the capabilities  established in the product design stage.  Occasionally some issues cannot be fixed and require a full or partial product replacement. In  this case the device recovery and service provisioning stages are clearly interlinked with the  support stage.  From the staff point of view the support effort can be structured in tiers, usually starting with first  line operators trained to deal with the most common problems down to highly skilled technicians  with expertise in a particular area.  Providing proper support for IoT devices can help in addressing the issues that may arise even  in the presence of a good design. Furthermore, a good design has a big impact in keeping the  volume of said issues to an acceptable level.  2.2.10 Device Recovery & Repurpose  This stage can be defined as the procedure followed after a device has reached the end of the  operational life at a particular location. Depending on its condition (or customer needs) the  device will be scrapped and recycled or repurposed to start a new operational cycle at a  different location. In case of device repurpose it must be provisioned again.  The recovery procedure can involve several operations at two different levels. Examples in the  software domain include data retrieval for archiving purposes, user data erasure9, full wipe and  operating system installation. Some operations are also usually required on the IoT platform  backend such as revoking credentials or access permissions. On the other hand, hardware  operations include destruction of storage media, recycling of components or raw materials and  biological sanitization.  2.3 MAPPING OF THE IOT SUPPLY CHAIN  Whereas the previous section presented an overview of the general phases of supply chain, the mapping below  provides a visualization of the more detailed activities specific to the stages of the supply chain for IoT. It also  helps to develop a linear understanding of the correlation between subsequent phases.  9 Kissel, Richard, Andrew Regenscheid, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine. 2014. “Guidelines for Media Sanitization.” NIST  SP 800-88r1.

THREATS TO IOT SUPPLY  CHAIN  This chapter presents a series of threats that are considered the most relevant in the context of  the IoT supply chain. Relevance has been determined by conducting a preliminary desktop  research phase, followed by a validation phase where threats were discussed with experts  using two distinct formats—personal interviews and questionnaires.  These threats have been classified under a set of high-level categories. Please note that  horizontal threats that apply to all domains (e.g. vandalism) should still be considered in addition  to the specific threats of the supply chain.  All threats include a short description and the list of IoT supply chain stages that are most  likely to be affected by the threat. This doesn´t mean that other stages are not related to a  threat, instead affected stages are the phases in which the threats are more dangerous and/or  can be tackled most effectively.  3.1 PHYSICAL ATTACK (DELIBERATE/INTENTIONAL)  Sabotage  The assembly pipeline may provide malicious actors with the opportunity  to interfere and inject defects that may end up causing problems (up to the  total shutdown and malfunction of the product) in later stages. The threat  of attacking manufacturing processes (independently discussed in another  category) is relevant and closely related in the context of sabotage.   Component assembly &  embedded software.  Grey markets  Defective, discarded or lost products may end up in grey markets that exist  outside of the proper distribution channels. This can lead to unforeseen  consequences and add numerous difficulties to the implementation of strict  security and quality standards by injecting untested and unreliable  products into the market.   Technical support &  maintenance.   Device disposal &  decommissioning.  Exploitation of inadequate physical enclosures  Some devices require to be physically tamper-proof depending on the  scenario. The choice of materials and construction method must be  adequate for the intended use of the product. For instance, it doesn't  matter how good the software of a smart lock is if the device can be easily  torn apart with bare hands . Besides worrying about the physical  enclosure, the designer should also consider how ports are included in the  case. For instance, a maintenance port only used in manufacturing can be  used by an attacker in the field. This port should be disabled or removed  prior to field installation.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support &  maintenance.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  19  3.2 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LOSS  IP theft  Malicious actors may be able to illegally acquire, exploit, store or  redistribute intellectual property and sensitive pieces of information (e.g.  design documents, source code, credentials or other secrets). These  provide dangerous insight into the vulnerabilities of the specific IoT  products and may serve as valuable assets for attackers. This threat is  closely related to the security-by-obscurity strategy (i.e. achieving security  by ensuring documentation and sources remain secret) whose  effectiveness and relevance is regularly criticized by experts.   Product design.   Component manufacturing.  Reverse engineering  The consequences of reverse engineering are arguably similar to those of  IP theft; the main difference resides in the method used to obtain the  sensitive assets and pieces of information (e.g. source code from the  binaries, deep understanding of hardware blocks). These are derived from  trial-and-error and meticulous study of the behaviour of a final product  during the utilization phase by attackers that lack access to the original  designs. This process may also lead to the discovery and release into the  public domain of vulnerabilities (whether in first or third-party components)  or firmware backdoors. It is important to note that reverse engineering in  itself is not a threat, and should only be considered as such when used  with malicious intent.   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Device programming.   Technical support &  maintenance.   Device disposal &  decommissioning.  Overproduction and cloning  Overproducing is the practice of fabricating a product whose design  documents and specifications have been provided willingly by the rightful  owner, with the particularity that this is done outside of the established  bounds of a legal contract. These products appear to be original but are  insecure and pose a threat to the supply chain. A malicious factory can  also clone the physical characteristics, firmware/software and security  configuration of the device. Deployed devices might also be compromised  and their software reverse-engineered, allowing for cloning. Cloned  devices may be sold cheaply in the market and can contain functional  modifications including backdoors. Alternatively, a genuine device may be  substituted with a variant or clone during transportation or commissioning .   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  20  3.3 NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY/ABUSE  Magnetic field attacks  Devices that are deployed in the field may be exposed to magnetic field  attacks. These attacks are based on interfering with the units on an  electromagnetic level, corrupting system memory in the process. Possible  consequences include a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or the extraction of  sensitive information (e.g. private keys during generation).   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Service Provision & End-user  Operation  Malware insertion  Attackers are presented with the opportunity to insert malicious software  whose main objective is to provide illicit access or any other functionality  that goes against the intended usage of the system. Insecure update  mechanisms and poisoned update services are prime examples of such  opportunities for malware injection. IoT gateways are especially relevant in  this context; these are functional devices that are commonly found in IoT  architectures, but can also function as a threats source. IoT gateways  usually have a supporting role in the scope of security requirements, they  are, however, an avenue to compromise IoT devices for a malicious actor,  providing access into trusted networks and a method to acquire data from  supported constrained devices.   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Device programming.   IoT platform development   Service provision & end-user  operation  Exploitation of debug interfaces  Debugging IoT devices without compromising confidentiality, integrity and  availability is a relevant challenge—there are no standards to incorporate  debugging interfaces such as JTAG. Hardware or software interfaces  specifically meant for internal use in the organization may be improperly  disabled and end up as part of the final designs that reach the production  and assembly stages. The existence of these interfaces is commonly  attributed to oversight in the early phases, as they are meant to serve as  tools for debugging and detection of errors, although there may be cases  where those interfaces are included with malicious intent. The key is  enabling this functionality securely and only to authorized personnel which  seems to be the industry challenge. They provide attackers with a  dangerous level of access to the final product .   Service provision & end-user  operation.  Tampering and counterfeits  Counterfeit products are sold by unauthorized suppliers who are not part of  manufacturer's official sales channel. These products, which have been  designed and manufactured by unknown parties, are labeled as the  manufacturer’s products. This threat contemplates the inclusion of  counterfeit chips in boards—chips that contain some kind of malicious  modification (e.g. hardware trojans) or that have not been properly  validated. Boards that present this issue are referred to as tampered  boards. These unauthorized chips range from similar parts with lower  tolerances and capabilities, defective parts that needed to be disposed of,  parts reused from other boards that do not meet the quality standards,  overproduced parts, or parts produced through an unauthorized use of  intellectual property  . The window of opportunity for tampering may  appear during multiple stages, including distribution, especially when  operating with logistics companies that lack transparency about their  security measures.   Semiconductor fabrication.   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.   Distribution & logistics.   Device recovery & repurpose.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  21  3.4 LEGAL  Implications due to standard and regulation non-compliance  Architecting processes around privacy/encryption is a challenge that is  affected by existing privacy laws and regulations and by the fact that some  actors in the supply chain ecosystem have their own different  understanding about the security aspects. SLAs are signed between  different actors in the supply chain to ensure a common contractual  enforced view of the security aspects. All devices should comply with  security guidelines mandated by respective industries (e.g. energy,  medical, automotive). Moreover, GDPR and any other local regulation  should be applied to cover the risks associated with standards/regulation  non-compliance.   Product design.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support & maintenance.  3.5 UNINTENTIONAL DAMAGE OR LOSS OF INFORMATION  Compromise of Network  Systems that are necessary for the control of supply chain processes and  exist in a network could become compromised without the proper QoS or  firewall policies. These assets could be weaponized to orchestrate, for  example, large scale Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, or to degrade the  operation of the supply chain. Those that have access to the Internet are  the most vulnerable, although isolated internal networks are also at risk  from insider attacks.   Product design.   Device programming.   Service provision & end-user  operation.  Use of factory authentication settings  Devices which require authentication should never leave the factory with a  fixed global default credentials or a credentials derived from easily  obtainable information (i.e. MAC address). Each device should have a  unique random credentials assigned to it during manufacturing. Especially  during any updates, which represent an important critical point in security.   Product design.   Component assembly & embedded  software.   Device programming.   Service provision & end-user  operation   Technical support & maintenance.  Undetected software or hardware disruptions of the devices  Systems related in any fashion to the operation of the supply chain should  ideally be extensively monitored for an early detection of hardware of  software issues. A more proactive approach on detection usually results in  a reduced number of disruptions to the supply chain, especially when  compared with reactive measures.   All stages.  User Errors  Users should be properly informed and trained to raise awareness about  the functionality and the security risks; whether in the case of internal  members of an organization operating critical supply chain systems and  tools, or end users whose compromised devices could be used to gain  access to other nodes that could disrupt the supply chain. Unintentional  human errors could be the most direct approach to infiltrating into an   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support & maintenance.   Device recovery & repurpose.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  22  otherwise adequately protected system. The interception of  communications to other stakeholders related to the supply chain (e.g.  procurements) and other attacks that derive from social engineering  techniques are important threats to be considered in the context of user  errors.  Technological evolution during device life cycle  The technological landscape is constantly evolving. This evolution can  result in unexpected vulnerabilities that were not present during the design  and implementation stages; this is especially impactful in the case of  devices with long life cycles (e.g. cars). Examples of such vulnerabilities  include devices lacking the performance to run state of the art encryption  after a flaw is discovered in previous schemes, or abandonment of  software support by the vendors.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support &  maintenance.  Use of unpatched devices and systems  It is a common occurrence to discover vulnerabilities during the device life  cycle that were not considered in the first stages of the supply chain. This  is in fact expected, as no system can ever be considered perfectly secure.  Failure to integrate a software upgrade mechanism during the design  phase can pose a serious threat, as it robs the manufacturer of the ability  to react to these security issues. Moreover, this mechanism must  implement all technical measures to avoid code tampering and ensure the  deployed firmware is genuine.   Product design.   Device programming.   Technical support & maintenance.  Disruptions in cloud services  Systems that depend on cloud services and are critical to the operation of  the supply chain should be able to perform their core functionality even  when disconnected for extended periods of time. Organizations should  consider the possibility of the service vendor going out of business,  ensuring their data is available in some form of backup. Security measures  to handle malicious takeover of the original domain names for the cloud  services should also be ideally implemented.   Device programming.   IoT platform development.   Service provision & end-user  operation.  Failure of recovery procedures  Due to an attack, the system (and the device) is not able to be recovered  impacting functionality and security. During the lifecycle of an IoT device,  several assets (firmware, configuration, credentials) might need to be  updated. Chain of trust must be considered since depending the asset to  be updated (impacted), different mechanisms must be used. The recovery  plan must define which mechanism and which process must be followed to  fix any potential situation that might compromise the service and the  security of the device. Depending the level of criticality and the element of  the chain that is compromised, the mechanisms must be one or other. This  is a critical process in which the security of the device and the system can  be compromised.   Service provision & end-user  operation   Technical support & maintenance  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  23  Attack to registration procedures  A lack of registration procedures, or insecure registration mechanisms,  could lead to attackers registering fraudulent devices or preventing the  registration of genuine devices. Devices must be registered in the  appropriate authentication IoT platform services after device initialization in  the product line and before final user provisioning in order to grant them  access.   Device programming.   IoT platform development.   Service provision & end-user  operation.   Technical support & maintenance.  Use of recovered or repurposed components  Organizations may opt to reuse components or parts that have already  gone through the regular supply chain flow; this could be done for reasons  such as cost optimization. The usage of components that have already  been retired and may have not been properly validated for reinsertion in  the supply chain poses a threat and could contaminate an otherwise  secure batch of devices.   Device recovery & repurpose.  Attack to manufacturing processes  Manufacturing pipelines are highly sensitive points of entry to the supply  chain. Processes that do not implement adequate measures to regulate  and monitor the access of personnel to the pipeline could cause serious  vulnerabilities; this could in turn lead to other discussed threats such as  sabotage or malware injection.   Semiconductor fabrication.   Component manufacturing.   Component assembly &  embedded software.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  24  4. GOOD PRACTICES FOR  SECURITY OF IOT  SUPPLY CHAIN  4.1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  One of the most significant objectives of this document is to address the main security  considerations to adopt throughout the supply chain for IoT. During the creation of this study, a  group of experts expressed their views on the main challenges they consider the global supply  chain for IoT needs to overcome in order to deliver greater security.  As a result of this consultation, a non-exhaustive list of security considerations is shown in the  following table. In the following chapter a more in-depth group of good practices is presented; to  address these considerations and ensure not only the security, but also the overall quality of the  IoT supply chain.  A security consideration that applies in a horizontal manner to all stages is the fact that those  processes that are beyond the direct control of the organization (i.e. managed by a third party)  are inherently challenging; audits and inspections can help with this consideration but are hard  to enforce. Another horizontal security consideration can be found in the resilience of  trustworthiness of the supply chain, that is, the ability to be able to provide continuous service of  operation.  Stages  Security  considerations  Description  Product design  Threat model  Identification and creation of a catalogue of potential  threats.  Secure building blocks  Usage of up-to-date and properly supported building  blocks (e.g. cryptography, software libraries).  Sabotage prevention  Monitoring of deliberate flaws in design introduced by  insider threats.  Physical-logical  convergence  Ensuring adequate visibility of all requirements and  needs for security  engineers and other stakeholders (especially relevant  in E2E security design).  Recovery plan  Conceptual design must face and consider the  definition of a recovery plan for future stages and  secure mechanisms to implement it (compliant with the  chain of trust).  Combined security  controls (SW and tamper  resistant HW)  Define the integration between HW and SW when  defining security measures. Security controls (e.g.  secure boot, attestation) require the usage of tamper  resistant hardware to fulfil the security requirements.  Chain of trust definition  Chain of trust is necessary to ensure levels of trust  between HW and SW elements.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  25  Resource constraints  Achieving a compromise between device resources  (e.g. memory, computation) and other constraints such  as cost or size that ensures devices are able to  implement security measures while leaving room for  future unexpected developments.  Semiconductor  Fabrication  Hardware security  mechanism  Integration of a hardware root of trust to serve as the  trusted secure foundation of cryptographic operations.  Scrap management  Management of residual and discarded materials to  ensure parts are securely removed from the supply  chain.  Component  Manufacturing Counterfeit components  Usage of authenticated parts to avoid security  concerns introduced by fraudulent components.  Defective components  Usage of properly tested parts that pass the quality  requirements to avoid degradation of security.  Component  Assembly +  Embedded  Software  Firmware access control  Enable secure mechanisms to control access to  firmware for updates and other maintenance  operations. Specially for its installation.  Backdoors  Monitoring of suspicious behaviour and backdoors  implanted in hardware or low-level firmware boot code.  Device  Programming  Secure provisioning  Usage of end-to-end robust provisioning mechanisms  guaranteeing the security of credentials and  cryptographic information.  Coding practices  Adoption of best practices such as code reviews and  continuous integration of cybersecurity checks in the  software development process.  IoT Platform  Development  Development focus  Basing development efforts on a risk-based approach  to achieve both adequate functionality and security.  Dependencies  management  Checks and review processes to ensure that  dependencies and libraries are available, have not  been tampered with and conform to security  requirements.  Network security  Secure network policies to minimize the risk of  intrusion while exposing the required services in the  public domain.  Service  Provision  & End-user  Operation  Management support  Appropriate level of resources and support provided by  the organization to ensure secure operation during the  lifecycle of the  IoT device.  Convenience  compromises  Appropriate balance of user convenience and intrusive  security mechanisms that degrade the user  experience.  Usage by operators  Operators of IoT services are provided with adequate  training to avoid introducing security risks that originate  from misuse or misconfiguration.  Adoption of security  features  Monitoring and usage of techniques to increase the  adoption rate of optional security features by end  users.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  26  Technical support  Technical support throughout the life cycle of the  product.  Access control  Management of credentials (including revocation) and  access permissions of devices to IoT platforms.  Distribution  and logistics  Value-added resellers  (VAR)  Certification of personalization services for IoT devices  offered by third parties that may introduce unforeseen  security risks.  Protection against theft  and counterfeits  Adoption of security measures to reduce the risk of  property theft and replacement with counterfeit  components in the distribution process and logistics  chain.  Device identity  Compose a device identity during device fabrication  based on the combination of the different HW and SW  components (e.g. board ID, secure element ID). This  device identity composition helps to track and device  fabrication tracking and can be used in the IoT  platform access control.  Tracking for registration  Define a proper device registration or onboarding to  the IoT platform based on the tracking of the device in  the different stages of fabrication.  Technical Support  & Maintenance  OTA control tools  Adoption of mechanisms to ensure remote Over-The-  Air control tools used for maintenance are properly  managed and secured following the chain of trust.  Patches  Usage of software version that sufficiently mitigates  the threats exposed and the latest security patches to  avoid risks from well-known security vulnerabilities.  Device  Recovery &  Repurpose  Data removal  Adoption of secure data removal techniques to avoid  sensitive pieces of information remaining on the  device.  4.2 GOOD PRACTICES TO IMPROVE SECURITY  Development of good practices for securing the supply chain for IoT is one of the key objectives  of this study. The aim is to provide recommendations for the target audience to assist in  countering and mitigating the threats that might impact the supply chain for IoT.  Recommendations focus on covering the overlapping issues, as most practices are not effective  across all industries and users.  To organise the domains in a logical manner, good practices were classified into the following  three main groups: actors, processes and technologies. Please note that there may exist a  degree of overlap between groups and some good practices could be classified into multiple  categories due to the strongly integrated nature of the supply chain for IoT.  Actors: guidelines related to the principles that shape how actors in the supply chain are  expected to think about, perceive and approach security in the supply chain for IoT; whether it is  in the context of a clearly defined and previously agreed framework or from a personal  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  27  standpoint. Industry professionals (e.g. managers, engineers), end users and organizations can  be identified as actors in the supply chain.  Processes: addresses security in the processes involved when an IoT project is designed,  developed, deployed and maintained. These processes are not limited to the context of a single  organization and include interactions between stakeholders, especially in those cases where  trust cannot be clearly established.  Technologies: potential technical measures and elements that could be applied in order to  predict, detect and reduce vulnerabilities and threats. These include hardware components,  design recommendations, techniques, libraries or other software components to support the  process throughout the entire supply chain.  Each practice consists of a title, its relation to one of the three categories above, a description of  the practice, and references to sources for further information. Standards are to be found in the  Annex C of this document.  4.2.1 Actors  ACT-01 PRIORITIZE WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS THAT PROVIDE  SECURITY GUARANTEES  There is an inherent threat in working with external suppliers due to the lack of control in their  security measures, however, this is regularly a business reality that cannot be avoided. This  threat can be minimized by favouring companies that implement standards such as the ISO  27036 and ISO 28000, or recommendations such as NISTIR 8259.10 A company seeking  certification approval is usually a sign that they are willing to seriously work towards improving  supply chain security. Certification is usually a costly process that is not suitable for all  organizations—organizations that are not standardized but have comprehensive security  measures in place and are transparent about them (e.g. right to audit, contractual security  requirements) should also be considered trustworthy.  ACT-02 WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY  Transparency is crucial to control security in the supply chain. Stakeholders, especially  suppliers, should be transparent, offering clear and detailed information about the operations  and normal behaviour of the supplied products; and communicating all the relevant information  to the next step of the chain. An increased level of transparency would have the desirable side  effect of reinforcing trust between participants in the supply chain.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-03 DEVELOP INNOVATIVE TRUST MODELS  Trust between the stakeholders is one of the most relevant and important challenges to  consider for securing the IoT supply chain (e.g. how to assess the security of ODM (Original  Design Manufacturers) binaries without source code). Each stakeholder should establish a  minimum level of trust according to their needs and expertise, analysing the flux of data and  guaranteeing the security and privacy within their services of products. Trust models define a  framework to provide formal guarantees about the behaviour of the different parties and  enhance security. The supply chain would greatly benefit from developing innovative trust  models or adapting existing ones to focus on its specific necessities. It should be noted that  10 For further information on these standards, please see Annex B.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  28  there is no one-fits-all approach to trust. An approach based on consistent risk evaluation would  allow organizations to evaluate the business impact to apply the proper technical measures and  contractual obligations (e.g. audits).  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-04 ADOPT THE VIEW OF SECURITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS A  CONTINUOUS PROCESS  Security in the supply chain should not be characterized as an occasional activity or a state, as  the assurances provided by actions in the security plane (e.g. penetration tests) decrease in  value over time once they have been obtained. The concept of a process implies flow and  formal consensus among stakeholders, as well as approval and acceptance. Security should be  included in all stages of the supply chain as a continuous and iterative process.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-05 MAINTAIN AND TRAIN A QUALIFIED AND SKILLED  WORKFORCE  As is the case with many technological fields, the IoT domain displays a fast pace of change.  Maintaining a skilled workforce that has access to regular security training and the required  resources to keep up to date with the field is of great importance to face the security challenges  raised by the supply chain for IoT. Professional teams dedicated solely to security should be  present in most organizations; those that lack the resources to maintain such teams should at  least ensure that other technical teams have an appropriate degree of knowledge on security.  References  Own sources: Questionnaire Analysis Report   Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  ACT-06 PROMOTE A DEVELOPER WORK CULTURE FOCUSED ON A  RISK-BASED APPROACH  Software developers sometimes tend to invest significant resources in pursuing extended  functionality for the end product, which can have the undesired side effect of taking said  resources from security-related tasks. This issue can be exacerbated by some decisions from  the management layers, if they are detached from the development focus, a perfect example of  this is unrealistic deadlines. Promoting a development process that considers risks when  distributing resources and ensures that security receives the appropriate attention can have a  significant impact in the security of the supply chain.  ACT-07 PROMOTE IOT SECURITY AWARENESS FOR USERS  A significant percentage of users lack knowledge about security configuration and are not fully  aware of the impact of weak security. Vulnerable IoT devices in the possession of users can  sometimes be used as an entry point to systems and services in the supply chain (e.g. servers  used for provisioning or configuration). The burden of security should never be left as a  responsibility to the user; however, organizations could benefit from investing resources in  campaigns and actions to raise awareness on the importance of proper security. For example,  this could take the form of marketing campaigns or carefully crafted configuration modules to  provide guidance and a great user experience. In addition, manufacturers should be required to  include a comprehensive user guide or manual, which provides instructions on the safe and  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  29  secure use of its products.  In a related fashion, consumers should also be educated to ensure  they view counterfeiting as an unacceptable and dangerous practice.  References  Standards: CMU SPL - Carnegie Mellon University’s Security & Privacy  Label  ACT-08 PROVIDE SECURITY PROMISES TO CUSTOMERS  Customers should be clearly and explicitly provided with comprehensive information related to  security. This includes, for example, possible vulnerabilities that could be discovered during the  life cycle of the product, or the relation of software updates that are deployed in devices on the  field. The transference of this information to actors down in the chain is crucial to achieve  continuous security. This practice is closely related to ACT-01 and ACT-02, it is, however,  presented separately to highlight its nuances and relevance.  4.2.2 Processes  PRO-01 ADOPT SECURITY BY DESIGN PRINCIPLES  Security modules should be considered components of high priority and factored into the design  process from the first stages throughout the entirety of the supply chain; this is to avoid the  threat that originates when security modules are treated as an afterthought or considered of a  lesser priority. Integration of a strong chain of trust should be a priority to ensure the integrity of  hardware and software modules in IoT devices (please see TEC-06). Use of secure coding  techniques and tests focused on security (e.g. penetration tests, vulnerability scanning) should  be included in the appropriate stages of the IoT supply chain to implement and validate  appropriate security features. A security baseline to cover the most important components of the  IoT supply chain should be defined; such a security model should cover the security core  elements: protection, detection and incident response. Human factors must also be taken into  account at the design stage. Best practices must be enforced and followed rigorously to avoid  undermined security because of poor user decisions. The inclusion of legal departments in the  security and privacy assessments is another important practice that should be integrated into  the design process. Moreover, security experts should be directly involved in the early  conceptual design discussions with the product management team, so they can include their  point of view in the selection of the materials according to their security requirements.

It is desirable to minimize these assumptions when  feasible, while maintaining privacy assurances for the end user. An advanced tool or  mechanism to help with data collection and measurement would be of significant help in this  regard. Initiatives like the International Data Spaces—an international initiative with links to the  European Commission focused on improving methods and mechanisms for a more secure and  trusted data exchange in business ecosystems—may also provide inspiration.

Most  interpretations could agree that it is related to the state of the supply chain operating in an  unadulterated manner, being free of counterfeits, malware or other influences that may reduce  visibility and accountability (e.g. not being able to properly trace firmware updates). Metrics can  be created and monitored continuously to provide visibility on the state of the supply chain. These  metrics could be tied to the specifics of the current supply chain or be more horizontal in nature.  Metrics could be designed mainly in the earlier design phases and be adjusted in an iterative and  continuous fashion depending on the evolution of the supply chain. Examples of such metrics  could include the distribution of firmware versions that are currently deployed in the field.  References  Own sources: Questionnaire Analysis Report   Desktop research: Electronics Supply Chain Integrity Enabled  by Blockchain11  PRO-04 DEVELOP THREAT MODELS FOR THE IOT SUPPLY CHAIN  Threat models should merge the concepts of both physical safety and digital security that are  intrinsic to cyber-physical systems. The development process includes dividing the supply chain  into functional blocks and listing the assets in those blocks, to later detect critical assets and  blocks. To this end, a knowledge base of attack tactics and techniques such as MITRE ATT&CK  or the threat model presented in this report may serve as the foundation to develop combined  (safety-security) threat models. This also should include, besides threats of attacks,  unintentional incidents that may also impact security, safety and performance resulting from  errors in managing the increased complexity of systems coming from the addition of IoT. Risk  assessment methodology should be applied in order to assess the relative importance of the  threats depending on the criticality of the domain and implement actions (e.g. optimizing the  resources available, preparing contingency plans) to protect the different stages in the supply  chain—motivation behind the cyberattacks (e.g. financial gain, terrorism) should also be  considered to define cost-effective protections and security controls. Furthermore, a significant  amount of IoT elements present a lack of accountability for the tasks they perform. This is due  to the absence of logging in most IoT devices because of hardware constraints or additional  costs. A risk assessment for the whole IoT supply chain setup should be performed to identify  components where logging components are necessary.

These software components must be documented as part of the  supply chain security process, including the criteria followed for its selection; organizations  should prefer those that have passed an evaluation and certification process, and include a  maintenance plan. A comprehensive analysis of the source code is recommended for open  source cases where a reputable community of maintainers and industry stakeholders cannot be  identified—a possible approach to cover vulnerable code is to deploy a custom layer on top,  although this forces the organization to follow the updates of the original developer. To help with  the software identification process, organizations may use software tools specialized in  11 Xu, Xiaolin, Fahim Rahman, Bicky Shakya, Apostol Vassilev, Domenic Forte, and Mark Tehranipoor. 2019. “Electronics  Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain.” ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems 24 (3): 1– 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571 .  12 Khan, Faud, and David Rogers. 2019. “IoT Cybersecurity Guidelines, Standards and Verification Systems.” In .

Scanning products may also be leveraged to identify  software components and vulnerabilities; source code scanning tools are available for internal  and open source components, while binary scanning tools can be applied in the context of  closed source. It should be noted that open source tools can play a significant role in IoT  security as transparency and openness are highly important. The open source community is  also efficient when finding flaws and promptly fixing them. The industry benefits greatly when  fixes for vulnerabilities discovered in open source tools in the context of a private organization  are released back to the open source community.  References  Standards: NISTIR 8276 - Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk  Management  PRO-06 ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN  All IoT solutions should include a comprehensive testing plan to verify that the product displays  the expected features in both the software and hardware. Acceptance testing should occur  independently from any previous testing that could have taken place in earlier stages in the  supply chain. A fraction of the devices should be inspected in the last part of manufacturing and  subjected to cybersecurity testing to detect misconfigurations or errors.  References  Own sources: Questionnaire Analysis Report   Desktop research: IoT cybersecurity guidelines, standards and verification  systems, a caba white paper13  PRO-07 IMPLEMENT FACTORY SETTINGS THAT USE SECURITY BY  DEFAULT  A significant percentage of customers tend to ignore security features due to convenience  reasons or a lack of technical knowledge; this usually results in vulnerabilities that could be  avoided with an appropriate usage of the security features already included in the devices and  products. Security by default should be the approach for the manufacturers and suppliers, so  customers that need to disable security have to do so in a conscious and explicit manner. This  approach would be based on a consistent security model that is mandatory to be applied and  ensure that data is properly collected, manipulated and transferred.  PRO-08 COMMIT TO PROVIDING SECURITY PATCHES FOR A CERTAIN  PERIOD OF TIME  Legacy IoT devices based on unmaintained software are a threat to the integrity of the supply  chain. Extended support and a timely delivery of security patches should be factored into the  design and planning of an IoT product—this includes proper dimensioning of resources (e.g.  memory) to support future updates. Manufacturers should have the obligation to deliver security  patches at least until the end-of warranty time, and preferably until the end-of-support time. In  any case, the period of time that the manufacturer commits to provide the security patches  should be explicitly and clearly indicated in advance to procurement, and available at no  additional cost during use.  PRO-09 INTEGRATE SECURE SCRAP MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Materials and components produced in the manufacturing and fabrication stages that fail the  quality tests or are not deemed ready for production due to any possible reason should be  processed and disposed of in a secure fashion (e.g. avoid leaving the defective units in  unsecured containers). This is to avoid the threat of malicious actors gaining access to said  13 Khan, Faud, and David Rogers. 2019. “IoT Cybersecurity Guidelines, Standards and Verification Systems.” In . CABA.

PRO-10 USE SECURE DATA REMOVAL TECHNIQUES  Devices are usually restored back to factory settings and cleared of all private user data during  the decommissioning and recovery stages. Insecure data removal practices (e.g. a simple  deletion process that does not overwrite all storage sectors) may leave traces of private user  data in the persistent storage that may be later recovered using specialized software tools by  another user with access to the device. Secure data erasure techniques should be integrated  into these stages to ensure that all private user data and configuration data are effectively  removed in a safe manner. Some of these techniques should be taken into consideration way  before the data removal such as the cryptographic erase, that means that this good practice  should be adopted from the beginning of the supply chain.

This is a critical issue as the  absence of said resources is a threat to the supply chain; moreover, the presence of sub-par  documentation could actually be actively harmful. The support and end-of-life stages are  especially vulnerable to this threat. ENISA could play a significant role in this regard by hosting  and maintaining a repository of resources such as list of flawed software stacks to be avoided  by vendors, or a list of secure components and proven combinations to be used as a guideline  in the design stage.

Although some IT security standards could be applied, there are limitations,  depending on the industry. Some standards, such as ISO27001 or the recent NERC CIP-013-1,  could arguably be considered quite open or generic. For certain domains or industries, some  standards are too abstract and perceived as difficult to understand and apply in the context.  Moreover, there is arguably a gap between the standardisation bodies and the development  community. Development of new standards or adaptation of existing ones would contribute  towards giving coherence to the security management for the global supply chain for IoT and  improving the integration of security information across all actors. One of the most important  challenges related to this issue is finding building blocks for the supply chain that are meaningful  and general enough to be applied in a horizontal fashion, thus reducing the cost of entry of  implementing a standard for small and medium companies.  14 Kissel, Richard, Andrew Regenscheid, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine. 2014. “Guidelines for Media Sanitization.” NIST  SP 800-88r1.

These  lists increase visibility into the product and enable both the manufacturer and external users to  check for known vulnerabilities and validate the device from a security standpoint, helping to  reduce the vulnerability gaps that may enable attackers successfully leverage a vulnerability for  malicious purposes. Increased product visibility may also lead to increased trust between actors  of the supply chain. SBOMs should ideally be available for all IoT products of any given  organization, regardless of the fact if they are commercially distributed or not. SBOMs can serve  as a building block for the implementation of a configuration management and versioning  system; these systems support the evolution of software components, improving traceability and  enabling users and organizations to establish a timeline of software versions. This can, in turn,  be used to revert to previous stable states in case of unexpected issues.

The scope of the supply chain should be extended towards the end-of-life of any  connected device, especially if OTA updates are involved. The update of IoT devices is difficult  since the products are usually based on various packages from different sources and using  different tools and third-party components. The planning and management of these updates is  something very important to consider.

Organizations should first assess their viability from a security standpoint  before committing to an application. Examples of such technologies include Blockchain, that can  be used to provide strong integrity guarantees in traceability systems; and artificial intelligence  (AI), which could help support professionals in the process of decision-making for a wide range  of issues. For example, Device Fingerprinting (DFP) is an example application of AI where  device identity is derived from its network activity without the need of reading an unequivocal  identity. However, organizations should factor in the fact that AI does not provide absolute  performance guarantees and should be used as a complementary tool in a significant number of  cases.  16 Buchheit, Marcellus, Mark Hermeling, Frederick Hirsch, Bob Martin, and Simon Rix. 2020. “Software Trustworthiness  Best Practices.” An Industrial Internet Consortium White Paper.  https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/Software_Trustworthiness_Best_Practices_Whitepaper_2020_03_23.pdf .  https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/Software_Trustworthiness_Best_Practices_Whitepaper_2020_03_23.pdf  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  34  References  Desktop research: Electronics Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by  Blockchain17  TEC-03 USE HARDWARE MECHANISMS TO PROVIDE INTERNAL  VALIDATION  Integrate hardware obfuscation techniques into the circuit design processes to protect against  threats such as reverse engineering and overproduction. These techniques are based on  adding key inputs that are not critical to the actual functionality of the circuit but are used to  validate the operation; the output of said circuits would not be correct in the presence of an  invalid key. The secret keys should not be known to the untrusted foundries and OSATs and  should be activated later in the fabrication process by the IP owner. In a related fashion,  transport keys and/or activation keys should be used to protect from theft during transport  (between entities or sites).

In the case of firmware signing the hash of any given firmware image is  signed using a private key that is only available to the genuine provider of the software; the  public key is later used by the device to verify the integrity of firmware images. Secure boot  refers to the practice of cryptographically validating the entire chain of software components that  take part in the device boot process starting from an immutable root of trust. This integrity  measures must be used during device manufacturing (when firmware is flashed in first boot)  and during maintenance (in OTA) these cryptographic operations must be done in conjunction  with a tamper resistant hardware in the framework of the chain of trust (being the tamper  resistant hardware the root). These two measures can be integrated into existing Service-Level  Agreements with third-party suppliers. It is also worth mentioning that GlobalPlatform members  are working towards developing security standards that define a series of security foundations  (SRFs) (e.g. root of trust, secure firmware installation)—these could be used to provide visibility  of the security features in the chips. This integrity measures must be used during device  manufacturing (when firmware is flashed in first boot) and during maintenance (in OTA); ii)  these cryptographic operations must be done in conjunction with a tamper resistant hardware in  the framework of the chain of trust (being the tamper resistant hardware the root).

Identity management systems should be  integrated into the supply chain to provide these unique identifiers. These are usually included  17 Xu, Xiaolin, Fahim Rahman, Bicky Shakya, Apostol Vassilev, Domenic Forte, and Mark Tehranipoor. 2019. “Electronics  Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain.” ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems 24 (3): 1– 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571 .  18 Savage, Warren. 2020. “Design for Security: The Next Frontier of Smart Silicon.” DesignCon 2020.  19 Trusted Computing Group. 2020. “TCG Guidance for Secure Update of Software and Firmware on Embedded Systems.”  Version 1.0 Revision 72.  https://doi.org/10.1145/3315571  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  35  in the wider context of Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems that regulate the  lifecycle of the device identity and provide authentication and authorization services.  TEC-06 INTEGRATE A STRONG ROOT OF TRUST  A root of trust is the first item in the chain of trust of a device; it is commonly implemented using  a dedicated hardware component that provides a set of cryptographic capabilities and primitives  that can be assumed as trustworthy by the device. These components are usually tamper-  resistant on a hardware level and can be used as the foundation for security measures such as  firmware signing or secure boot. Software alternatives with lower costs also exist, although they  are significantly more vulnerable, and thus they are, in general, fit for a limited scope of  applications. Actors in the IoT supply chain (e.g. OS providers, application developers) should  base their contributions in this security foundation when possible.

The stages of the lifecycle of most IoT  devices are not discrete, that is, further development can occur once the device has been  deployed; and vulnerabilities with impact on supply chain systems can be discovered at a later  date, or as a result of data gathered from an actual attack. The ability to react quickly to  changes in the environment and deploy updates for remote devices shall be included and  considered from the earlier stages of design. Furthermore, these mechanisms shall be secure to  prevent misuse and malware injection.  References  Desktop research: TCG Guidance for Secure Update of Software and  Firmware on Embedded Systems21  TEC-08 INTEGRATE AUTHENTICATION MECHANISMS INTO CIRCUITS  To support traceability and maintenance, device authentication is mandatory. Physical  Unclonable Functions (PUF)—a primitive based on the physical characteristics of a circuit that  derive from its fabrication process and provide unequivocal identification—is one of the most  significant options available. This means that PUF can be used to determine if a given device is  genuine, improving the traceability of devices throughout the supply chain. Advantages of PUF  include resistance to invasive attacks, which require the attacker to face the complex prospect  of modifying the physical characteristics of the circuit. It should be noted that, in addition to PUF,  other technologies such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) can be used to this end.  Closely related to this good practice is the recommendation of properly leveraging traceability  data that may be already included by silicon manufacturers in their chips.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  36  TEC-09 CONSIDER THE CYBERSECURITY POSSIBILITIES INTRODUCED  BY HARDWARE-SOFTWARE COLLABORATION  Hardware-software collaborative schemes are an approach that focus on covering the  cybersecurity gap left by security measures that operate solely on the hardware or software  layers. Hardware measures can benefit from the context provided by the current state of the  system on a software level; while vulnerabilities in software measures can be covered when the  software is able to communicate with specialized hardware components, especially in those  cases where the attacker gains privileged/root access. It could be argued that trusted execution  can be achieved only by combining hardware and software. Examples of applications of these  schemes include secure storage for PUF-based keys and security assurances for untrusted  kernel extensions. The security of IoT devices can be significantly improved by implementing  these schemes in those cases where it is feasible to do so, however, this is usually an  endeavour that requires high technical expertise.

GUIDELINES AND  CONCLUSIONS  This chapter reflects the general conclusions extracted from the analysis of the good practices  and standards. Conclusions take the form of a set of guidelines that represent high-level  recommendations and an entry point to the expanded set of good practices. They are intended  to serve as super categories—all good practices have been classified under one of the  guidelines—and a quick reference to the comprehensive list of good practices, which may be  difficult to parse.  Each guideline presents a set of related good practices that can be categorized under said  guideline and a set of standards that are relevant and strongly related. Please note that  although other standards could be relevant in the context of any given guideline, only the ones  that are considered the most pertinent are mentioned.  5.1 FORGING BETTER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ACTORS  This guideline addresses the security issues that may arise from problems and frictions in the  communications and relationships between actors in the supply chain. The set of actors may  include, for example, integrated device manufacturers (IDM), foundries, outsourced  semiconductor assembly and test companies (OSAT), software development houses, logistics  companies or cloud service providers.  These issues may be malicious in nature or have their origin in misunderstandings or lack of  coordination. Some problematic examples that can be identified include errors in design due to  lack of visibility into the components provided by suppliers, or overproduction of a product  outside of the boundaries of an established contract.  The opportunities for organizations to improve security are clearer when they look beyond their  own operations. The use of the connections that exist between the links of the supply chain to  share key information will increase the efficiency of all actors in the chain. The increase of  visibility is an important benefit from a security perspective, which will help to define a better  security design of the supply chain and the device consequently, in the conceptual phase.  While vertical collaboration—between suppliers and customers—is more common, horizontal  collaboration between supply chain actors is also desirable for certain aspects of the security,  such as the creation and establishment of industry regulations or other common frameworks.  Good practices  to consider   Prioritize working with suppliers that provide  cybersecurity guarantees.   Work towards improving transparency.   Develop innovative trust models.   Adopt the view of security in the supply chain as a  continuous process.   Favour the adoption of SLAs that require the  presence of software integrity measures.   Provide security promises to customers.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  38  Most pertinent  standards   ISO/IEC 27001: Requirements for an information  security mgmt. system (ISMS)   ISO 27036: Information security for supplier  relationships  5.2 CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE SHOULD BE FURTHER CULTIVATED  Problems that have their origin in errors in the usage, design and implementation of controls  and mechanisms related to the security domain can usually be difficult to detect and assess,  especially when compared to problems in the actual functionality of the device. This is  exacerbated by the moderately recent nature of the IoT industry, as best practices and past  experiences are not as firmly established as in other industries.  Members of any layer of an organization (e.g. engineering, management, and marketing) may  be inclined to neglect security training and education, falsely assuming that \"it won't happen to  me or my organization\". However, security issues tend to be pervasive and severe, and as  such, the lack of knowledge in this area needs to be adequately addressed.  It should also be noted that superficial security knowledge may lead to a false sense of security  and could become a threat. Training deficiencies, lack of standard procedures and limited  supervision usually have a direct correlation to significant security vulnerabilities in a later stage  of the product.  Good practices  to consider   Maintain and train a qualified and skilled  workforce.   Promote a developer work culture focused on a  risk-based approach.   Promote IoT security awareness for users.  Most pertinent  standards   NIST 8276: Key practices in cyber Supply Chain  risk management.  5.3 SECURITY BY DESIGN  The design of an IoT device or product is a complex process that requires careful planning and  risk management. Early decisions made during the design phase usually have impactful  implications on later stages, especially during maintenance. Complexity originates in a  significant amount of cases from particular characteristics of the IoT domain; for example, the  tendency of devices to be constrained in terms of resources, which may impose limits to the  implementation of security measures or upgradability during lifecycle.  Security goals can often fail—even in the presence of good design—if there is a lack of tools  that enable stakeholders to understand and assess security issues. Although some degree of  flexibility is desirable, organizations should also be vigilant to ensure a well-planned strategy is  adequately executed even in the face of possible shortcuts that could falsely appear to be more  efficient in terms of resources.  IoT is applied to solve business problems, thus the high-level customer requirements should be  included as the main input to assess the security aspects of products and services.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  39  Furthermore, the fact that cybersecurity is not perceived as an added value in IoT mass  products should be taken into account, as it usually slows the adoption of security technologies  by all stakeholders.  Good practices  to consider   Adopt security by design principles.   Establish and improve data collection,  measurement technologies, and data  management.   Create supply chain integrity metrics.   Leverage emerging technologies for security  control and auditing.   Establish and improve planning and management  of device upgradeability and obsolescence.   Implement mechanisms for remote update.   Develop threat models for the IoT supply chain.  Most pertinent  standards   ISO 20243: Mitigating maliciously tainted and  counterfeit products.  5.4 TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE AND EXPLICIT APPROACH TO SECURITY  The majority of security threats detected during any stage of the IoT supply chain—all except  those where the impact is negligible—should be explicitly addressed by organizations. This  could be applied to all domains but is crucial in the IoT context due to the increased number of  devices and deployment characteristics, which usually include public spaces and unattended  operation.  Preconceptions and biases related to security should ideally be considered during risk  management. Data and designs can be analysed and validated from multiple points of view, and  human intervention should be carefully monitored when feasible. The cost of reacting to a  security breach is usually higher than the cost of adequately addressing the issue in a proactive  fashion.  Good practices  to consider   Identify third-party software.   Establish a comprehensive test plan.   Implement factory settings that use security by  default.   Commit to providing security patches for a certain  period of time.   Integrate secure scrap management processes.   Use secure data removal techniques.   Use hardware mechanisms to provide internal  validation.   Integrate identity management systems for IoT  devices.   Integrate a strong root of trust.   Integrate authentication mechanisms into circuits.   Consider the cybersecurity possibilities  introduced by hardware-software collaboration.   Provide Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for  IoT devices.  GUIDELINES FOR SECURING THE INTERNET OF THINGS  November 2020  40   Create comprehensive documentation resources.  Most pertinent  standards   ISO 11889: Trusted platform module (TPM)   IETF RFC 8520: Manufacturer usage description  (MUD)   IEEE 802.1AR-2018: Secure device identity for  local and metropolitan area networks   ISO 20243: Mitigating maliciously tainted and  counterfeit products.  5.5 LEVERAGE EXISTING STANDARDS AND GOOD PRACTICES  Existing standards, previous cases and relevant legal frameworks are a cornerstone of a  successful IoT supply chain implementation. Organizations can benefit greatly from dedicating  resources to studying the current landscape and adapting the existing best practices to their  particular case. This approach should also be applied to the internal interactions in an  organization, as documentation resources and processes developed by a department can  usually turn out to be critical assets for other teams.  Standards are created by bringing together all interested parties. All actors in the supply chain  for IoT should make progress towards new or adapted standards in those cases where gaps are  detected, as all of them will benefit from standardization through increased safety and quality of  their products and services. Governments are important actors that should also be taken into  account. The industry should work towards solving security and trust issues before government  regulation forces a more unpalatable solution.  Security standards implemented at every stage of the supply chain reduce the attack surface—  simple measures usually have a big impact in this reduction.  Good practices  to consider   Develop or adapt standards for the supply chain  for IoT.  Most pertinent  standards   GSMA SAS-UP: Security accreditation scheme  for UICC production.   CMU SPL: Security and privacy label.

programme  WPK: Work Package  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 7  1 Introduction  1.1 Introduction  As in previous years, the work programme for 2014 reflects the results of the consultation process  with the ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group (PSG) and Management Board that was carried out in  November 2012 and February 2013. This version also takes account of comments submitted by  Member States following the March Management Board meeting and includes modifications to  resources and budget following confirmation of the latter by the EU Commission.  The structure of the 2014 work programme is fundamentally different to that of previous work  programmes. Whilst core operational activities are still structured into three streams of work, these  streams reflect the way in which the work supports the EU policy goals of the Member States rather  than areas of activity that are based on the content. The result is a work programme that is a natural  continuation of the evolution of the Agency’s work over the last few years, but organised according  to new criteria.  Estimates for resources and budget have been adapted to reflect the fact that ENISA will have new  activities to perform during 2014 as a result of the new mandate and the Cybersecurity  Strategy for  the European Union.  1.2 Structure  1.2.1 Core operational activities  The core operational activities covered by the 2014 Work Programme have been structured as  three separate work streams. These work streams are as follows.   WS1: Support EU policy building   WS2: Support capacity building   WS3: Support co-operation.  In addition, supporting work will continue in the form of a set of horizontal activities.  1.2.2 Horizontal activities  As in previous years, this work programme also regroups a number of activities into a single  chapter, under the general heading of ‘Horizontal Operational Activities’:   Management Board, Executive Board & PSG Secretariat   National Liaison Officer Network   EU Relations   Corporate Communication   Dissemination activities   Quality control  The Project Support Activities cover Dissemination Activities, Quality Management and Public  Relations support for COD.  1.2.3 Administration and support department, Directorate and General management  activities  Support activities have been further streamlined by integrating facility management and IT support  activities within the Administration and Support department .  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 8  1.3 Key Performance Indicators and Key Impact Indicators  The terms Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and Key Impact Indicator (KII) are defined as follows:  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable metrics used to evaluate objectives to reflect the  performance of an organisation. KPIs measure the agency’s performance during the budgetary/fiscal  year. KPIs differ depending on the nature of the organisation. Different layers and dimensions should  be taken into consideration. KPIs can constitute both quantitative and qualitative measures;  however, the most useful and common types are quantitative based. These include amongst others a  focus on metrics such as number of Member States targeted, and number of hits to the website etc.  Key impact indicators (KIIs) are indicators used to evaluate long-term performance and eventually  linked to the strategy foundation stone of an organisation.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 9  2 Policy and Legal Context  The Agency situates its work in the wider context of a legal and policy environment as pointed out  below. Its activities and tasks are fulfilled as defined by its Regulation and integrated in this larger legal  framework and policy context.1  ENISA-Regulation2,3  Prior to the adoption of the new regulation, all activities and tasks carried out by the Agency were  fulfilled on the basis of the founding ENISA-Regulation. This basis was laid down in Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security.  The new Regulation builds on ENISA’s achievements in areas such as supporting Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) in Member States and facilitating the pan-European cybersecurity exercises.  It provides ENISA with a strong interface to Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to enable the  Agency to contribute to the fight against cybercrime, focusing on prevention and detection. It also  foresees a more proactive role for the Agency in supporting the development of EU cybersecurity  policy and legislation. This is also true for the areas of research, development and standardisation,  where EU standards for risk management and the security of electronic products, networks and  services are cited as key aspects. Finally, ENISA is also given a stronger role in cooperating with third  countries.  The Cybersecurity  Strategy of the EU4 and the proposal for an NIS Directive  Information and communications technology has become the backbone of our economic growth and is  a critical resource which all economic sectors rely on. It now underpins the complex systems which  keep our economies running in key sectors such as finance, health, energy and transport; while many  business models are built on the uninterrupted availability of the Internet and the smooth functioning  of information systems.  Recent years have seen that while the digital world brings enormous benefits, it is also vulnerable.  Cybersecurity incidents, be it intentioal or accidental, are increasing at an alarming pace and could  disrupt the supply of essential services we take for granted such as water, healthcare, electricity or  mobile services. Threats can have different origins — including criminal, politically motivated, terrorist  or state-sponsored attacks as well as natural disasters and unintentional mistakes.  The Commission has proposed the Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union, which outlines the  EU's vision in this domain, clarifies roles and responsibilities and sets out the actions required based on  strong and effective protection and promotion of citizens' rights to make the EU's online environment  the safest in the world.  This strategy is accompanied by a proposal for legislation5 to:  1  Please note that this does not constitute a comprehensive listing of all relevant policy acts and the legal framework. For more detailed references  of legal base and policy context of ENISA’s activities in WP 2014, please refer to each WS.  2 Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European Network and Information  Security Agency.  3 REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 May 2013 concerning the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004  4 http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/planned_ia/docs/2012_infso_003_european_internet_security_strategy_en.pdf  5  Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network  and information security across the Union, COM(2013) 48 final  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0460:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0460:EN:HTML  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 10   Establish common minimum requirements for NIS at national level   Set up coordinated prevention, detection, mitigation and response mechanisms, enabling  information sharing and mutual assistance amongst the national NIS competent authorities.   Improve preparedness and engagement of the private sector.  Council conclusions on the Commission and the High Representative of the European Union  for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of  the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace6  These Council Conclusions, agreed by the General Affairs Council on 25 June 2013, summarises actions  to be carried out by various actors in the cybersecurity field.  Digital Agenda7  The Digital Agenda for Europe is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and  provides an action plan for making the best use of ICT to speed up economic recovery and lay the  foundations of a sustainable digital future. The Digital Agenda for Europe outlines seven priority areas  for action, in the context of which it also attributes a significant role to ENISA as well as to its  stakeholders.Council Directive on the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection8.  This Directive establishes a procedure for the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures (‘ECIs’), and a common approach to the assessment of the need to improve the  protection of such infrastructures in order to contribute to the protection of people.  The CIIP Action Plan  The Commission Communication “Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions:  enhancing preparedness, security and resilience” calls upon ENISA to support the Commission and  Member States in implementing the CIIP Action Plan to strengthen the security and resilience of CIIs.  The Commission Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection  \"Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security\" adopted on 31 March 20119  In this communication, the Communication takes stock of the results achieved since the adoption of  the CIIP action plan in 2009 launched to strengthen the security and resilience of vital Information and  Communication Technology infrastructures. The next steps the Commission proposes for each action  at both European and international level are also described.  Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework10  The review of the EU electronic communications regulatory framework and, in particular, the new  provisions of articles 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive and the amended article 4 of the e- Privacy Directive aim at strengthening obligations for operators to ensure security and integrity of  their networks and services, and to notify breaches of security, integrity and personal data to  competent national authorities and assign to ENISA specific tasks.  6  Available at http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st12/st12109.en13.pdf  7  A Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010)245, May, 2010.  8  Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment  of the need to improve their protection  9  \"Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security\" adopted on 31 March 2011 and the Council Conclusion on CIIP of May 2011  ( http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf)  10  Telecommunications Regulatory Package (article 13a. amended Directive 2002/21/EC Framework Directive)  http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st12/st12109.en13.pdf  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 11  Review of the Data Protection Framework11  In 2012, the European Commission published its proposal for a regulation on data protection. This  regulation will replace the existing Data Protection Directive. It encompasses many of the concepts  described above, promoting privacy by design and data protection by default while including  provisions for remedies, liability and administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. ENISA will  support the implementation of the new regulation on data protection.  Electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal  market12  The new framework for electronic identification and electronic trust services ensures mutual  recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders, gives legal effect and mutual  recognition to trust services including enhancing current rules on e-signatures and provides a legal  framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document acceptability, electronic delivery  and website authentication.  This proposal represents the first milestone in the implementation of the objectives of the Legislation  Team (eIDAS) Task Force set up by the Commission in order to to deliver a predictable regulatory  environment for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market to boost the user convenience, trust and confidence in the digital world.  Commission Regulation on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data  breaches  In June 2013, the European Commission has put in place new specific rules to ensure that personal  data breaches in the EU telecoms sector are notified in the same way in each Member State13.  The 2002 ePrivacy Directive requires telecommunications operators and Internet service providers to  keep personal data confidential and secure. To ensure consistent implementation of the data breach  rules across Member States, the Commission has adopted \"technical implementing measures\" –  practical rules to complement the existing legislation – on the circumstances, formats and procedures  for the notification requirements. These rules will help ensure ensure that all customers receive  equivalent treatment across the EU in case of a data breach, and that businesses can take a pan-EU  approach to these problems if they operate in more than one country.  A coherent framework to build trust in the Digital single market for e-commerce and online  services14  The European Commission adopted the Communication on e-commerce and other online services  announced in the ”Digital Agenda“ and the ”Single Market Act“. Based on an in-depth public  consultation, this Communication sets out the Commission's vision for the potential represented by  online services in growth and employment, identifies the principal obstacles to the development of e- commerce and online services, and establishes 5 priorities, accompanied by an action plan.  Council Framework Decision on attacks against information systems15  11  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal  data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) COM 2012/11 final of 25.1.2012, available at  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf  12  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions  in the internal market, COM(2012) 238/2  13 Commission Regulation on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and  electronic communications” online: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  14 European Commission, “A coherent framework for building trust in the Digital Single Market for e-commerce and online services” COM  (2011)942, 11.1.2012, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/e-commerce/communication_2012_en.htm  15  Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA of 24 February 2005 on attacks against information systems  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/smact/ http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/e-commerce/communication_2012_en.htm  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 12  This Framework Decision proposes the approximation of criminal law systems and the enhancement  of cooperation between judicial authorities. It forms a part of the information society and of the  eEurope Action Plan16 in general. The Framework Decision will be replaced by a new Directive on  attacks against information systems, that is expected to be adopted shortly. This Directive retains the  Framework Decision´s current provisions – the penalisation of illegal access, illegal system interference  and illegal data interference – and notably includes new offences, such as illegal interception and the  use of tools to commit large-scale attacks.  Commission Communication 'Tackling Crime in our Digital Age: Establishing a European  Cybercrime Centre'17  In this Communication, the Commission proposes a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), which will be  part of Europol and act as the focal point in the fight against cybercrime in the EU. This  Communication drawing on the feasibility study outlines the proposed core functions of the European  Cybercrime Centre, explains why it should be located in Europol, and how it can be established. The  EC3 was officially launched on 11 January 2013.  Council Resolution of December 200918  The Council Resolution on a collaborative European approach on Network and Information Security of  18 December 2009 builds on a number of EU strategies and instruments developed in recent years. It  provides political direction on how the Member States, the Commission, ENISA and stakeholders can  play their part in enhancing the level of network security in Europe.  Council conclusion on CIIP of May 201119  These Council Conclusion take stock of the results achieved since the adoption of the CIIP action plan  in 2009, launched to strengthen the security and resilience of vital Information and Communication  Technology Infrastructures.  Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the  European Economic and Social Committee regarding an Action Plan for an innovative and  competitive Security Industry20  The Commission has produced a Commission Staff Working Paper on Security Industrial Policy”21  SWD(2012) 233 final, and a Communication regarding an Action Plan for an innovative and  competitive Security Industry. The underlying idea of the Commission is the creation of a true internal  market for the security industry by suggesting clear measures. A dedicated expert group set up by the  Commission will meet at least once per year to monitor the implementation of proposed policy  measures and bring together all relevant actors in the field of security.  Single Market Act22  In April 2011, the European Commission adopted a Communication, the Single Market Act, a series of  measures to boost the European economy and create jobs.

The objective is to make secure,  seamless electronic interaction possible between businesses, citizens and public authorities, thereby  increasing the effectiveness of public services and procurement, service provision and electronic  commerce (including the cross-border dimension).  Internet of Things – An Action Plan for Europe23  This Communication from the Commission addresses several main trends and challenges in the  evolution of the Internet: Scalability, Mobility, Heterogeneity, complexity and interoperability, such as  the role of public authorities, governance, personal data protection and public and private rights and  duties.  European cloud computing strategy  The Communication COM(2012)529 'Unleashing the potential of cloud computing in Europe' was  adopted on 27 September 2012. It constitutes the European policy in the area of cloud computing and  addresses areas such as standards, certification, trust and security, data protection, cross-border  services, contractual terms, consumer protection, interoperability and portability and adoption of  cloud services by public authorities. Furthermore it recognises the need for awareness raising and  international cooperation. This document is the European policy baseline on cloud computing and it  includes a specific action for ENISA on EU-wide voluntary certification schemes.\"  Internal Security Strategy for the European UnionInternal Security Strategy for the European  Union24  The Internal Security Strategy lays out a European security model, which integrates among others  action on law enforcement and judicial cooperation, border management and civil protection, with  due respect for shared European values, such as fundamental rights. This document includes a number  of suggested actions for ENISA.  Council Resolution on a collaborative approach to Network and Information Security 25  In this resolution the Council recognises the potential role of ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It  also underlines that the major goals of NIS are to support security standards, awareness raising and  serving as a center of expertise.  Telecom Ministerial Conference on CIIP organised by the Presidency in Balatonfüred,  Hungary  This conference took place on 14-15 April 2011 and was a natural extension of the \"Tallinn process\"  initiated by the 2009 Ministerial CIIP Conference in Estonia under the Czech Presidency of the EU.  On  this occasion, Vice President of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes, Digital Agenda Commissioner,  acknowledged the progresses made by Member States but also called upon for further actions and  stressed the importance of international cooperation. In particular, as a follow-up to the Conference,  VP Neelie Kroes called on ENISA to intensify its activity of promoting existing good practices by  involving all Member States in a peer-learning and mutual support process with the aim to promote  faster progress and bring all Member States on par. VP Neelie Kroes called on ENISA to establish a  highly mobile dedicated team to support such process.  23  Communication of the Commission to the Parliament, the Council, the EU Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions on the  Internet of Things, COM(2009)278 final of 18.

[Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 15  3 Core operational activities  3.1 Introduction  The core activities of ENISA for 2014 have been grouped into three work streams (WS):   WS1 : ‘Support EU policy building’ will support the policy making process by making available to  policy makers consolidated information on the emerging threat landscape and by formulating  key messages to the Member States on how to ensure that their policies and capabilities are  aligned with EU objectives taking into account lessons learned within the different Member  States. This will involve the unification of available information sources under a common context  and will also require the involvement of important stakeholders in the areas of threat  assessment, risk mitigation and policy definition.   WS2 : ‘Support capacity building’ foresees a number of activities designed to assist both the  public sector and private sector in the Member States in protecting Critical Information  Infrastructures (CIIP). By facilitating cooperation and coordination between public and private  sectors within the  Member States, ENISA will continue to support the development of policies  and measures and implementable preparedness, response and recovery strategies, to meet the  challenges of a continuously evolving threat environment.   WS3 : ‘Support cooperation’ is about strengthening NIS in the European single market.  Cooperation strengthens the capacities of Member States, EU institutions and third countries  and helps them to deal with crises. The approach will be to build upon existing collaboration in  existing communities, further enhancing community building in Europe and beyond. This work  also looks at the development of tools to facilitate and improve the international communication  and interchange of security relevant information within communities sharing the same interest  in different MS.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 16  3.2 WS1- Support EU policy building  3.2.1 Overview  Justification  This work stream consists of work packages that are designed to assist COM and Member States in  building EU policy in the area of Network & Information Security. When specifically requested by  Member States, the Agency will also assist in ensuring that national policies are aligned with EU  objectives.  This support to the policy building activities in EU can be addressed in different steps:   Analysis and research of the evolving threat environment.   The promotion of standards / best practises.   Support to the EU and Member States in the fields of education, research and standardisation.  The following benefits are foreseen:   Coherent and meaningful data on the emerging threat landscape and trends is a valuable tool  for NIS professionals, decision and policy makers.   Dissemination of current best practises and standards contributes to interoperability, provides  technical references for the harmonisation of technologies, and augments the protection level  for NIS infrastructures and services in the EU. This is expected to lead to more effective risk  mitigation stratergies.   NIS knowledge transferred to education, research and standardisation activities, contributes to  EU-wide harmonisation in these areas.  Specific Policy Context  Specific policy references for this work stream are as follows:   Proposal No COM(2010) 521 final, 2010/0275 (COD) of 30 September 2010 for a Regulation of  the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA).   Commission proposed Action Plan to enable further growth of Security industry26 COM(2012)  417.   The Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU  Overall Objectives  The objectives of this Work Stream are:   Analysis of the evolving threat environment, both from the stakeholder and EU policy makers’  perspective.   Identification of gaps in NIS technologies and policies, and the support in the development of  strategies, best practises, frameworks and standards.   Mobilisation of relevant stakeholders, the development of a roadmap for the creation of an  “NIS Drivers License”, and support for the implementation of the roadmap.  3.2.2 Work Packages  The following work packages constitute the Work Stream:  26 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security- industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth-  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth- http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth-  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 17   WPK1.1. Identifying evolving threats, risks and challenges: The main objective of this work  package is to collect and collate current data in order to develop the ENISA threat landscape. It  includes current threats, as well as threat trends in NIS and emerging technologies. The threat  landscape is based on existing publicly available material on threats, risks and trends.   WPK1.2. Contributing to EU policy initiatives: The main objective of this work package is to  provide input to new policy initiatives (in areas such as Cloud computing, smart grids, etc.)  before they are launched and also to assist the COM and the Member States in implementing  such policies in an effective way and in learning from this experience so that problems can be  avoided in future policy statements.   WPK1.3. Supporting the EU in education, research & standardisation: In the context of this  activity ENISA will continue its efforts to support EU funded R&D initiatives such as FP7 and  H2020 and standardisation activities including EU initiatives such as the ETSI CEN CENELEC  Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG). Finaly, this work will support the activities in the  area of education described in the NIS Cyber Security Strategy such as NIS driving license and  European Cyber Security Month 2014 (ECSM’2014).  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 18  3.2.3 WPK 1.1: Identifying evolving threats, risks and challenges  Desired Impact   The ENISA Threat Landscape becomes an important point of reference for security experts  worldwide and is referenced in at least 10 security related information sources world wide.   It is referenced by 5 stakeholders from the 2 sectors covered.   Identified emerging threats and trends have been taken into consideration in at least 5 R&D  projects in EU.  Description of tasks  The main goal of this work package is to collect and collate current data in order to develop the  ENISA threat landscape. It includes current threats, as well as threat trends in NIS and emerging  technologies. The threat landscape is based on existing publicly available material on threats, risks  and trends.  In addition to the global threat analysis (the ENISA threat landscape), this work will include detailed  threat and risk assessments for at least two particular areas/sectors. These will be detailed analyses  of particular areas that are crucial for society, industry or research. Examples of such areas are key  internet infrastructures, banking and finance, health, transport, energy and public administration.  During the preparatory phases of the Work Programme execution, ENISA will select these areas by  consulting relevant stakeholder communities and by identifying current priorities. This work  package will involve the analysis of three main sources of information:   Consultations with different players in the security field will support the data collection work  and will also be used as a basis for selecting the areas/sectors of interest.   An analysis of innovative projects and activities being supported by  COM or Member States in  research or early development phases. This will have impact on future uses of technologies and  may require analysis of potential new threats and associated risks.   Analysis of reported and publicly known incidents in the subject matter areas.  This approach will allow ENISA to develop a perspective of the European landscape of the NIS gaps  and needs for a wide spectrum of stakeholders. The Agency will match identified threats with  existing minimum security measures and suggest amendments of existing and publicly known  measures to better mitigate these threats.  To achieve these objectives, the following tasks will be carried out:   Development of the ENISA Threat Landscape 2014, as continuation of the work started in 2012  on a yearly basis, and improving the results in the following areas:  o Derivation of the European perspective based collected threats (e.g. incorporating  information on European companies such as size, type of business, etc.).  o Improvement of the quality of threat information collection within related  organisations.  o Liaison with sources of threat information to establish effective dissemination of  generated information.  o Analysis and assessment of previous year forecasts.  Outcomes & deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:   WPK1.1-D1 – Annual EU CyberSecurity Threats Landscape.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 19   WPK1.1-D2 – Identification of trends, security challenges, associated risks and required  countermeasures, for emerging technologies (with special attention to selected areas/sectors).  Stakeholder impact  The primary beneficiaries of this work package will be policy makers and organisations from public  and private sectors, who will receive integrated and consolidated information about the European  NIS threat landscape and how it is evolving:   Public and private organisations will be able to use the ENISA Threat Landscape in their own  risk and threat assessment in order to develop more effective security strategies, thus  improving their Return of Security Investment (ROSI).   EU Commission DG CONNECT will be able to use the ENISA output to adjust the scope of their  R&D related activities.   Public and private organisations may capatilise on the ENISA output to propose innovative R&D  activities, products or services.

The Commission proposes to create a true internal  market for the security industry by inter alia:   introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research  stage. To reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and  international procurement, the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in  Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial Procurement, to test and validate results  stemming from EU security research projects. This approach should unite industry,  public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.   novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate  results stemming from EU security research projects.   COUNCIL RESOLUTION, 18/12/ 2009, on a collaborative European approach to Network and  Information Security, (2009/C 321/01)30.

[Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 21  3.2.4 WPK 1.2: Contributing to EU policy initiatives  Desired Impact   10 Cloud Computing Providers and 5 Member States support ENISA’s recommendations for  improving NIS aspects of Cloud Computing   15 Smart Grids providers and 5 Member States competent authorities support ENISA’s  guidelines for implementing the  Smart Grids Strategy   5 Member States eID competent bodies/authorities, 5 Independent Auditing Bodies and 5 Trust  Service Providers take part in the development of a common audit framework for trust service  providers.   ENISA recommendations on algorithms and parameters for secure services for the protection  of personal data in the context eGov services supported by competent authorities in at least 5  Member States;  Description of tasks  The tasks carried out in this work package are designed both to provide input to new policy  initiatives before they are launched and also to assist COM and the Member States in implementing  such policies in an effective way and in learning from this experience so that problems can be  avoided in future policy statements.  EU’s Cloud Computing Strategy and Partnership  ENISA will continue to play an active role in the implementation of the EU’s cloud computing  strategy and partnership. The Agency will provide technical advice, recommendations and good  practices to Commission’s Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and the European Cloud Partnership (ECP)  in the areas of certification, public procurement guidelines, SLAs and incident reporting  mechanisms. In all these areas ENISA will engage with all relevant public and private stakeholders  and make sure that these efforts properly align with EU’s ECP, ETSI and CEN/CENELEC initiatives.  EU’s Smart Grids Strategy  ENISA will assist the Commission, the Member States and the private sector in the implementation  of the EU’s Smart Grids strategy. The Agency will provide technical advice, recommendations and  good practices in the area of Minimum Security Measures for Smart Grids, certification of Smart  Grid components, privacy profile of Smart Meters, and incident reporting mechanisms. ENISA will  engage with all relevant stakeholders, provide contributions to COM policy intiatives (e.g. EU CSS,  DG ENER Expert Group 2 (EG2), CEN/CENELEC’s M490) and make sure that these efforts properly  align with EU’s overall Smart Grid Policy.  Algorithms and parameters for secure services  Technical protection measures, specified in legal documents, need to be matched with technical  specifications in order to secure personal data31. During 2013, ENISA initiated a new activity in the  area of cryptography with an emphasis on providing technical specifications for cryptographic  algorithms to protect personal data in e government (eGov) services. The algorithms are analysed  31  ENISA is expected to assist the EC in establishing an indicative list of appropriate technological protection measures,  including encryption schemes, according to the recently published EC regulation 611/2013  (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications ) on the measures applicable to  the notification of personal data breaches. Article 4 of the ePrivacy directive and Article 29 of the proposed data  protection regulation also mention technical measures, which have an impact on the notification procedure in the  case of data breaches.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 22  and ranked based on two criteria: usage (relevant and widely deployed algorithms) and security  (clear identification of the security of the scheme with appropriately selected parameters and key  sizes).  Hence, ENISA will continue this activity during 2014, by reviewing the cryptographic  recommendations annually to ensure appropriate data security, taking into account of similar work  carried out in the Member States32,33.  Furthermore, ENISA will extend its efforts to cover  application scenarios, such as cloud computing and mobile devices. Other aspects such as the  security requirments of network end points and on how to establish trust relationships (cf, secure  computing base and new public key infrastructures) could also be investigated.  Best practice guide for prevention of data leakage and appropriate controls for the access of data  using Security and Privacy by Design and by Default  The increasing use of online services has led to significant growth in the amount of citizens’  personal data being transmitted over public networks (e.g. the Internet) and stored within  applications that are accessible from anywhere on the Internet. Data leakage or security breaches  in such systems have a direct impact on the right to privacy and may have legal implications.  Moreover, citizens are exposed to financial risks, if financial information (e.g. banking details) is  disclosed. Lastly, due to the quality and the quantity of data, leakages expose citizens to various  risks and can cause substantial reputational damage to official bodies.  Since 2010 ENISA is actively working on the subject of data leakage and notifications about  breaches. In 2014 this work will be complemented by a best practice guide addressed to the  interest of the businesses containing recommendations for prevention of data leakage and  appropriate controls for the access of data.  EU electronic identification and trust services framework  The European Commission adopted on June 4th 2012 a proposal for a Regulation34 on electronic  identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market that will  replace the existing Directive 1999/93/EC35  on a community framework for electronic signatures  was the legal recognition of electronic signatures. The proposal strengthens the provisions for  interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across borders,  enhances current rules for electronic signatures and provides a legal framework for other types of  trust services (electronic seals, electronic delivery services, electronic documents, time stamping  services and web site authentication).  ENISA has already contributed to this area by providing recommendations in the areas of:   Mechanisms for reporting security breaches by the trust service providers to the  competent bodies.   Minimum security measures and security best practices for trust services providers.  In 2014, ENISA will continue to support related activities relevant to the implementation of the  provisions of the proposal, with a focus on the areas of:  32  Commission Regulation 611/2013 on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under  Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications” online: https://ec.europa.eu/digital- agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  33  ETSI SR 002 176 “Algorithms and Parameters for Secure Electronic Signatures”  34 Proposal for a Regulation \"on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the  internal market\": http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML  35  Directive 1999/93/EC on a community framework for electronic signatures was the legal recognition of electronic  signatures: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 23   Common audit schemes for trust services providers in Member States. Technical guidelines  for independent auditing bodies and supervisory authorities. The work will refer to and  take into account relevant regulatory frameworks 36  At the end of 2012 ENISA organised the first Annual Privacy Forum (APF’2012)  http://privacyforum.eu/ in partnership with DG CONNECT, -Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the  EU and the University of Cyprus. The main objective of the APF, is to establish a forum fostering the  exchange of information and experiences between the research and academic communities, and  the EU policy and industry representatives. The response to the organisation of the first edition of  the conference in 2012 indicates that APF can become an established reference event in the area  of privacy putting emphasis on the need to bring together the policy and research communities.  Due to the delay in the new ENISA mandate decision process in 2013 it was premature to organise  the 2013 edition of the Annual Privacy Forum. In this light, in Q3 2013 it was agreed to organise the  2nd edition of APF’2014 in the context of the Greek Presidency of the EU. Experience from APF’2012  clearly indicates that the collaboration model between DG CONNECT and ENISA in the joint  organisation of APF is the way forward.

Description of tasks  Inventory of standardisation activities  in NIS, Privacy, Cloud Computing & Smart Grids  ENISA tracks the development of standards from a global perspective in the area of Network and  Information Security. The Agency will monitor NIS standards EU wide and globally, including areas  that are not specifically related to the ENISA work programme. This approach will enable ENISA to  keep its stakeholders informed on new NIS standardisation activities and to flag opportunities  and/or risks as they develop.  Since 2012 ENISA contributes actively to the creation and work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber  Security Coordination Group (CSCG). This collaboration with CSCG will continue during 2014  seeking out synergies with the Agency’s work programme and involve standards bodies in the  different work packages in as far as this is appropriate.  Moreover in 2014, ENISA will develop an inventory of relevant standardisation activities in the  areas of NIS and privacy . ENISA will assess whether there is a gap between these standardisation  activities and state of the art developments in NIS (including ENISA results).  Contribution/participation at the evaluation of the calls of proposals for EU funded R&D  published by the European Commission  As was the case in previous years, ENISA will continue to support COM by providing experts at the  evaluations of the calls of proposals that are published in the context EU funded R&D programs. In  this context, emphasis will be given to the areas of important to the ENISA Work Program as  presented in this document. It should be envisaged that ENISA may contribute up to 2 experts for  the evaluation of calls of proposals during 2014.  Collaboration with EU funded R&D projects  In the areas of interest to the ENISA Work Program the Agency wil continue to collaborate with and  to support EU funded R&D projects. Such collaboration may be in the form of:   Participating in the panel of reviewers that are supporting COM in reviewing the progress  of a project and steering the project’s future work.   Participation in the advisory/steering board of selective projects accepted by COM for  funding. Obviously ENISA may contribute to only a small number of projects. In this  context, emphasis will be given to the areas of important to the ENISA Work Program as  presented in this document.   Contributions to the various consultations launched by COM in the areas of interest to  ENISA. Such consultations may be conducted in the context of setting the research  priorities for future calls for proposals or in the context policy intitiatives launched or about  to be launched by the COM.  Early Warning and Response System against cyber-attacks and disruptions  In the context of the publication of the Cybersecurity  Strategy for the EU and the Proposal for a  Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 26  common level of network and information security across the Union (COM(2013) 48 final), the  European Commission has launched a feasibility study on the implementation of a European-wide  Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) against cyber-attacks and disruptions.  The scope of this EWRS would be focused on major incidents with transnational impact on the  functioning of the ICT infrastructure or services that require a coordinated response from several  Member States. In addition, this platform would encourage the sharing of best practices between  the competent authorities and their constituency.  Subject to the approval of the NIS Directive, ENISA will collaborate with COM in the  implementation of this study providing advice and input to the study team when called upon and  according to the needs of COM.  Contribution to the ‘EU NIS Driving Licence’  Together with relevant stakeholder community, ENISA will drive the development of a roadmap for  the implementation of a \"Network and Information Security driving licence\". This roadmap will  cover the needs of different levels of education, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary education.  The roadmap will exploit existing material and synergies among relevant training bodies. Within  this activity, ENISA, in cooperation with COM, will assist in:   identifying partners to produce the material for the defined curricula,   identifying partners to lecture courses and seminars implementing this curricula, and   upon feasibility, organising pilot courses and seminars related to the “NIS driving licence”.  Outcomes & deadlines  The outcome of this work package will be:   WKP1.3-D1 – Inventory of standardisation activities in NIS and Privacy (Workshops, report, Q1- Q4, 2014)   WPK1.3-D2 – Roadmap for the implementation of the “NIS Driving license”  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work package will be the policy makers,  standardisation bodies and the end user organisations from public and private sectors, in particular  in the areas of:   Standardisation related to NIS, Privacy, Cloud Computing and Smart Grids,   Harmonisation of EU-wide NIS education.

Protecting Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIP) is a key priority for Member States, the  Commission and industry (operators, service providers, manufacturers). By facilitating cooperation  and coordination among Member States, ENISA will continue to support all in developing sound  and implementable preparedness, response and recovery strategies, including those policies and  measures that are necessary to meet the challenges of a continually evolving threat environment.  EU Member States and private sector companies have different maturity levels in their capabilities  to address cyber attacks and disruptions. ENISA, with this work stream, aims to raise the level of  security across Member States and the private sector by supporting the development of relevant  capabilities.  The Agency assists EU Member States, the Commission and the private sector in sharing knowledge  and experience with each other in key sectors (e.g. Cloud Computing, Smart Grids, ICS-SCADA), on  key information security topics (e.g. minimum security measures) and to develop good practices  and recommendations that would be of mutual benefit to all. This way public and private  stakeholders will be better prepared to coordinate and cooperate with each other durinng a cyber  crisis.  Key action 3 of the European cloud strategy [ref. COM(2012)529] aims at supporting Member  States, associated countries and industry in preparing sound approaches for cloud  computing  adoption. This will be achieved by setting up a European Cloud Partnership (ECP) bringing together  leading public sector actors from all over Europe cooperating with industry consortia. It will address  issues such as safe and secure cloud usage, data protection and others.  ENISA's work will be  aligned with the work in the European Cloud Partnership.  The Agency also will also offer targeted assistance to EU Member States that wish to improve their  security standing in certain areas (e.g. training on national exercises, cyber security strategies).  The private sector is the main owner of current critical information infrastructures. The effective  co-operation between public and private sector is important for the swift implementation of ICT  security measures in relevant sectors and services. The NIS Platform will be an important  instrument in enabling such co-operation to flourish.

[Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 30  3.3.3 WPK 2.1: Support Member States’ Capacity Building  Desired Impact   10 Member States and 5 private companies support ENISA’s conclusions on national cyber  security strategies   Improved operational practices of CERTs (on-going support with best practices development)  training provided to a minimum of 20 participants of different organisations   6 Member States and 10 private companies support ENISA recommendations on national PPPs  Description of tasks  The objective of this work package is to support the development of prevention, detection, analysis  and response capabilities within Member States institutions and EU institutions. Corresponding  actions aimed at the private sector are detailed in WPK 2.2.  Cyber Security Strategies - CSS  ENISA will continue to support Member States in developing their capabilities in the area of  National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS). The Agency, building on previous work in the area of  NCSS, will act as facilitator among Member States and foster the sharing of good practices. ENISA  will continue offering targeted assistance to Member States on the development of new NCSS,  evaluation of existing ones or the development of elements of a NCSS. The Agency will also bring  Member States and the private sector together to share experiences and good practices on NCSS or  invidual elements of an CSS. This work will be summarised by a status report about the deployment  of  NCSS in the EU.  ENISA will take stock of existing evaluation/assessment mechanisms of NCSS, identify good  practices, validate them with public and private sector and finally issue a white paper with practical  recommedations on the evaluation and update of existing NCSS.  Developing CERT Capabilities  Whilst the EU Member States acknowledge the need to establish competent  national/governmental CERTs on national level, the level of those capabilities vary greatly from  Member State to Member State. In addition, the EU has recently established its own CERT in form  of the CERT-EU, whose goal is to protect the EU institutions.  It is one of ENISA’s primary goals to support all Member States and EU institutions in their efforts  to build up effective CERTs, to reach a specific level of capabilities and, where possible, extend  those to provide even better services. Underpinning this work is a set of “Baseline capabilities”,  which are competencies defined in four key areas (operational, technical, mandate and  cooperation). These are agreed with the CERT teams in the Member States, and constantly  monitored and updated by ENISA. To help CERTs to implement these baseline capabilities ENISA  provides support in the form of good practice material, training and exercises.  In 2014, ENISA will build upon its work in this area, but will also take stock of its work in the area of  CERTs in the last 8 years. The goal will be to concisely draw “lessons learned” through a dialogue  with relevant stakeholders, and to draw a roadmap of CERT activities for the coming years.  Concrete Activities in this area are as follows:   Take stock of achievements, good practice and experiences from 8 years of work in the area of  CERT, with the goal to develop a roadmap and plan the work ahead.   Enhance training and exercising methodology (“learning loop”) to improve the competencies of  trainers. This will be supported by a collection of “use cases” and “lessons learned” from  existing trainings and team exercises  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 31   To support above mentioned action, further actively support capability building for CERTs by  delivering (on request) trainings and suitable exercises to technical staff from EU Member  States, EU institutions and other appropriate audiences   Extend good practice collection with new training and exercise material for CERTs and  (potentially) communities in the four areas of the “Baseline capabilities”   Together with suitable stakeholder groups (like the FIRST Education SIG) investigate how to  best apply ENISAs training material, and how to integrate suitable trainings and material from  other communities (NIST, ISACA, etc.)One of the topics for new good practice/training material  will be to Identify suitable mechanisms for gathering, processing and exchange of actionable  information (format, channels, etc.) to support the effective and efficient exchange of  operational data among teams  Support of regional, sector-specific and national cyber exercises  In the past, the Agency has supported national, regional and sectorial cyber exercises efforts upon  request (Art14 of the ENISA regulation). This effort will continue in 2014 in line with the ENISA  regulation, the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the EU Member States’ needs. Where appropriate  the Agency will collaborate with and support regional or sectorial cyber exercises in a cost efficient  manner, for example by re-using exercise planning and management knowledge and tools from  other exercises and efforts.  National and European PPPs  ENISA will continue supporting Member States in the development of their capabilities in the area  of national Public Private Partnerships. The Agency, building on its work in the area of PPPs and  Trusted Information Sharing, will provide targeted and customised advice on national PPPs (e.g. in  a form of a seminar or training). In certain areas ENISA will try to transfer experiences from  existing, successful Member States to other Member States. ENISA will also try to engage National  PPPs into the NIS platform.

In addition, the report in this area will serve as a point of  reference for those Member States who choose to develop a strategy at a later date.  National/Governmental CERTs and other operational entities will benefit from training and  capability enhancement actions specially tailored for those communities.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 32  Member States will also develop capacity on national PPP. ENISA will help advanced Member  States to assess or improve existing policies, measures or actions through the co-operation and  information sharing with their peers.  In the area of CIIP and Resilience, ENISA will share knowledge and expertise with Member States  and the private sector on testing frameworks for ICS-SCADA systems or on minimum security  measures for Smart Grids or on how to develop governmental clouds.  Finally, through its expertise in the area of article 13 a and article 4, ENISA will be able to assist  NRAs with the proper implementation of incident reporting schemes at national level. This will  involve participating in workshops organised by NRAs at national level with ISPs and  Telecommunications organisations to better explain how article 13 a and article 4 can be  implemented.

ENISA will assist Member States in achieving this by providing assistance and  advice but will not become engaged in operational work.  Leverage the NIS Platform as a tool to enhance public private co-operation  From 2011-2013, the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) has covered a  number of key areas mostly in the areas of Internet, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud  computing and Smart Grids.  In 2014, ENISA will continue supporting the NIS platform, the successor of EP3R, with the goal of  engaging more targeted public and private stakeholders, especially experts from small industry  players. ENISA will support the working groups and their chairpersons (e.g. via the resilience portal,  conference calls), contribute to the outcomes of the working groups, and ensure its quality. The  Agency will keep the working groups informed about the latest developments in their respective  areas including deliverables done by the Agency (e.g. art. 13 a Working Group).  Through such interactions with the stakeholders ENISA will identify new topics in emerging areas  (e.g. mobile applications, eHealth, insurance or finance sector) and investigate ways to analyse  them in the future.  Provide advice and assistance to targeted stakeholder communities  In 2014, we will focus on the following areas:  Smart Grids: ENISA will promote to relevant stakeholders its existing work on “Minimum Security  Measures for Smart Grids” and will aim at aligning them with the work of CEN/CENELEC/ETSI  (M/490 SG-CG/SGIS Working Group), ERNCIP and other EU initiatives. These measures might be the  basis of a Commission Recommendation. ENISA will also work with relevant public and private  stakeholders to assess the challenges and requirements of national certification schemes for Smart  Grids, consult with them (e.g. SOGIS) and issue a white paper with practical recommendations on  the matter. In addition the Agency will take stock of existing initiatives on the certification of cyber  security skills of ICS-SCADA experts and issue practical recommendations to stakeholders for the  wide deployment of such schemes. Finally ENISA will analyse the area of proactive operational  preparedness measures for ICS-SCADA (e.g. intrusion detection, honeypots, etc.) and consult with  public and private stakeholders on the proper deployment of them.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 34  Electronic communications sector (ISPs and telecommunications companies):  ENISA, building on its  relevant work carried out in previous years, will develop one single, integrated set of minimum  security measures for electronic communications providers taking into consideration the  requirements of both article 13 a and article 4. This will enable providers to address security,  privacy and confidentiality issues in an integrated manner. The Agency will also take stock of  existing methodologies to identify critical assets and services of data communication networks. In  co-operation with ISPs and public stakeholders, ENISA will identify good practices, assess them and  develop guidelines on the identification of critical services, assets and links at national and cross  country levels. In addition ENISA will continue serving as advisor to the EU sponsored project on  botnets (ACDC41). The Agency will provide technical expertise on several issues related to botnets  (e.g. how to mitigate and response to cyber attacks, how to disinfect wide-scale and systematic  malware threats).  Cloud Computing: ENISA, in co-operation with public and private stakeholders, will develop and  agree on a set of Minimum Security Measures and adequate maturity levels for cloud computing  providers. Providers will then have a baseline of measures and maturity levels to use for improving  their security. The Agency will also continue its work in the area of critical clouds by analysing how  cloud computing can be securely used in specific critical sectors like ehealth, insurance and finance.  Finally the Agency, in consultation with public and private stakeholders, will take stock of existing  corporate, national, EU and international procurement guidelines for the secure deployment of  cloud computing and issue relevant recommedations in the form of a white paper.  Finance: ENISA will identify relevant experts from the financial sector to analyse the security and  resilience of inter-banking communications and transactions. The Agency, through a dedicated  expert group consisting of experts from public and private sector, will assess the challenges of  inter-banking communications and transactions, identify possible areas of improvement and issue  recommedations that will improve the security of such transactions.

This work package is in line with the principle of shared responsibility to ensure security, as stated  in section 1.2  of the Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU42, which calls for empowering users “All  relevant actors, whether public authorities, the private sector or individual citizens, need to  recognise this shared responsibility, take action to protect themselves and if necessary ensure a  coordinated response to strengthen cyber security.”  Statistics show43 that although Internet users express high levels of concern about cyber security  and becoming victims of cyber-attacks, it is difficult to get them to  adopt enhanced security  behaviour. In many cases, this change occurs too late to avoid incidents.  Through its NIS expertise, ENISA will participate together with different stakeholders in actively  promoting cybersecurity awareness.  The Agency will support the COM to  to develop the security dimension in the use of ICTs in  Member States:   Establish partnerships with academic institutions and provide information and expertise in its  core areas in order to feed the academic curricula and reading recommendations with ENISA  reports   Cooperate with educational bodies to successfully organize a cyber security championship  where university students will compete in proposing NIS solutions   Step up national efforts for the creation of a voluntary certification programme to promote  enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) will be further consolidated taking into account four  basic principles:   Guide content and priorities based on the analysis of ENISA subject matter experts.   Support the multi-stakeholder governance approach   Encourage common public-private activities   Assess the impact and adapt to the challenges  42  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  43Special Eurobarometer 390 / Wave EB77.2 EU citizens’ experience and perceptions of cyber security issues  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb_special_399_380_en.htm  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb_special_399_380_en.htm  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 38  Outcomes & deadlines   WPK 2.3-D1 - Provide technical guidance and support for European Cyber-Security Month  (dissemination material, Q4 2014);  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work package will be the EU citizens, targeted by  different categories. ENISA’s role will be to provide technical guidance on priorities and suitable  subject matter and to promote stakeholder involvement. These stakeholders are expected to reap  the following benefits:   Receive more targeted information on the security dimension in the use of ICTs;   Develop an increased knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice  sharing community;    Increase their level of  contact with stakeholders of similar profiles  Resources   20 kEuro   13,1 person months  Legal base & policy context   ENISA Regulation (New mandate September 2013)   ENISA Stakeholder Strategy   Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU   Council Resolution of 18 December 2009   Internal Security Strategy for the European Union  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 39  3.4 WS3 – Support cooperation  3.4.1 Overview  Justification  Various key policy documents identify the cooperation among stakeholder and stakeholder groups  as among the most important activities to enhance and strengthen NIS in the European single  market, and to ensure that Europe is placed among the key players in this field on an international  scale.  Cooperation is a necessary prerequisite for strengthening the capacities of Member States, EU  institutions and third countries. In particular:   The exchange of ideas, good practice and a common exploration of areas of NIS (generating of  new good practices in fields of upcoming technologies, respond to  new threats, etc.) will  enable EU Member States, the EU institutions and other players to improve services,  workflows, communication, etc  in order to prepare properly for emergency cases.   In times of large scale crises, previous collaboration and planning will help to ensure the right  mitigation mechanisms, enabling a response with a much lower cost both in time and resources  than would be possible without previous cooperation.  One very important element of this work is to build upon existing collaboration in already existing  communities, and to further enhance community building in Europe and beyond. Since the creation  of ENISA, the Agency has been building trust amongst these communities, bridging the gap  between the products and services offered in the market and their needs, continuously updating  the information provided to those implementing NIS policy. The secondary aim of this work stream  is to ensure that ENISA’s supporting role for these communities is maintained. One important  means of achieving this is the development of tools to facilitate and improve the international  communication and interchange of security relevant information within communities sharing the  same interest in different Member States.  Specific Policy Context  Specific policy references for this work stream are as follows:   ENISA Regulation article 3   Directive 2009/140/EC, Art. 13a   CIIP Action Plan 2009 and 2011   Digital Agenda 2010   Cybersecurity Strategy for the European Union   Council Resolution of 18 December 2009   Internal Security Strategy for the European Union  Overall Objectives   Support and enhance co-operation between CERTs, and with other communities.   Organise and manage the next Cyber Europe 2014   Support Member States and the Commission on the development of a sound European Cyber  Crisis Cooperation Framework, national contingency plans and national exercises   Continue ENISA’s work on article 13a (security breach notification) and article 4 (personal data  breach notification) and develop synergies between the two initiatives   Strengthen the cooperation with the newly established European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in  the areas where ENISA and EC3 are jointly involved   Support the implementation of the new Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 40   Analyse the requirements for incident reporting schemes in the areas of cloud computing and  smart grids. Identify and approach new communities and other groups who can contribute to  enhance NIS   Identify characteristics, needs, etc. of specific communities and other groups, and propose  good practice for common problems   Determine (scalable, accepted) methods for trust building among communities and other  groups   Facilitate the bringing together of communities and other groups face-to-face (mitigate  obstacles, finding ways to collaborate within constraints and contribute to trust building)   Identify actionable, complementary information for various communities   Identify obstacles (technical, legal, etc.) preventing the effective exchange of information  information   Identify suitable mechanisms for information gathering, processing and exchange (format,  channels, etc.)   Identify what types of information should be exchanged and who would be the  beneficiaries.  3.4.2 Work Packages  The following work packages constitute the Work Stream:   WPK 3.1:  Crisis cooperation – exercises. The objective of this work package is to prepare and  carry out the next Cyber Europe Exercise in 2014, in close collaboration with all relevant  stakeholders.   WPK 3.2:  Implementation of EU legislation. The objectives of this work package are on the one  hand the continuation of work in the area of Incident Reporting (Article 13a) by analysing the  received data. On the other hand it aims at preparing the reporting for Articles 4 of the  ePrivacy Directive and Article 15 of the COM proposal for the Regulation on eID and trusted  services.   WPK 3.3:  Regular cooperation among NIS communities. The objective of this work package is  to further enhance the cooperation between operational communities, mainly CERTs and Law  Enforcement Agencies. New potential target groups for ENISA deliverables (esp. training but  also other means) might be identified during that work with the initial communities.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 41  3.4.3 WPK 3.1: Crisis cooperation – exercises  Desired Impact   At least 24 EU Member States and EFTA countries confirm their support for Cyber Europe 2014  (CE2014)   At least 80% of Member States that are in the process of establishing National Contingency  Plans by 2016 are supported by ENISA.   At least 24 Member States are familiar with the operational procedures during cyber crisis by  2016  Description of tasks  This work package focuses on the following topics:   Continuation of the work in the area of pan-European cyber exercises (Cyber Europe 2014)   Enhancement of the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises   Identification of good practices and improvement of operational procedures for cyber crisis  cooperation in Europe  Pan-European Cyber Exercises: Cyber Europe 2014  In 2014, ENISA will organise the third pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014).  This exercise will build on the experience gained in previous exercises and will take account of  previous recommendations. The exercise will be more ambitious than previous efforts, e.g.,  technical depth, scenarios, stakeholders involved, objectives, procedures to be tested, complexity  etc.  The exact setup and exercise plan will be agreed with the EU Member States and EFTA countries, in  line with the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Each country will be represented in the Exercise Planners  group. This group will be responsible for the approval of the exercise setup and plan. The approach  that will be followed will be an “opt-in scheme” for the identification of stakeholders in the  countries which are interested to play in the exercise (e.g. policy level), allowing for the countries  who wish and have the appropriate resources to extend their national play. ENISA will not invite  additional third countries or stakeholder communities to participate in future EU cyber security  exercises without having first obtained the approval of ENISA’s Management Board.  Enhancing the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises  ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, trainings and technical capabilities on the  organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises. The Agency will continue  enhancing its capabilities for managing complex, distributed exercises, by building on previous  efforts in tools and methods and by facilitating strategic partnerships, such as the one with DG JRC.  For example, more structural links will be established with the European Cybercrime Centre and  the European Defence Agency.  EU-US Cybersecurity Exercise  ENISA will support COM and the Member States in planning, organising and executing a second EU- US cybersecurity exercise. The effort will be driven by the requirements set by the involved parties:  COM, EU MS and US. The exact planning, the timelines and the actual execution of the exercise will  be decided by a group of exercise planners composed by representatives from the involved parties.  The exercise report summarising the key results and learning points will be verified with all  involved parties before publication.  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises activities overview  ENISA will continue to support MS in the maintainance and training of operational procedures for  cyber crisis cooperation. This and the activities described above including key findings in the area of  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 42  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises (C3E) will be summarised in an report at the end of 2014.  This report will help ENISA to reach out to other communities/sectors with lessons learnt from  supporting exercises (achieving broader impact).

The  Agency, in co-operation with experts from NRAs and private sector, will analyse the reports,  compare them with previous years, identify good practices and lessons learnt and where needed  make recommendations to NRAs and private sector to mitigate these threats in the future.  ENISA will continue its efforts to bring NRAs and DPAs together to agree on a harmonised  implementation of the security and data breach articles (art. 13 a and art. 4). In that respect the  Agency will assess the two incident reporting schemes (article 13 a and article 4), identify common  elements (e.g. parameters and thresholds) and propose to NRAs and DPAs the most harmonised  and cost efficient way of implementing the two articles avoiding at the same time potential  overlaps.  Support the implementation of the new regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services  The European Commission adopted on June 4th 2012 a proposal for a Regulation44 on electronic  identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market that will  replace the existing Directive 1999/93/EC45  on a community framework for electronic signatures.  ENISA has already contributed to this area by providing recommendations on the reporting of  security breaches by the trust service providers to the competent bodies started to address the  implementation of security risk assessment by trust service providers and related security  measures.  44  Proposal for a Regulation \"on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal  market\": http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML  45  Directive 1999/93/EC on a community framework for electronic signatures was the legal recognition of electronic  signatures: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 44  In 2014, ENISA will continue its efforts on this incident reporting scheme as well as on the  implementation of relavant security measures. More specifically, the Agency will identify and bring  together the competent regulatory bodies of the Member States and debate with them on the  proper implementation scheme of article 15. ENISA will use this group to properly define the scope  of incident reporting, the parameters and thresholds as well as the affected services. The Agency  will exploit all possible implementation and conceptual synergies with article 13a and article 4.  Support for the implementation of the NIS Directive  Subject to the approval of the NIS Directive, ENISA will assist the Commission and Member States in  its implementation. The Agency could provide technical assistance on the requirements of the  trusted information platform and the rules for sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities. In  addition the Agency could assist the Commission in defining the affected sectors and the relevant  stakeholders in each one of them. Finally the Agency, building on its experience with article 13 a  and 4, can work with public stakeholders to define the incident reporting modalities for each  sector, (the affected services, the parameters and thresholds, the reporting scheme and template,  the rooting causes, and the scope of the analysis).  Outcomes & deadlines   WPK 3.2-D1 - Analysis of Annual 2013 Incident Reports and Recommendations on addressing  significant incidents (report, Q2/3 2014)   WPK 3.2-D2 – Guidelines on Incident Reporting Scheme for Article 15 (report, Q4 2014)   WPK 3.2–D3 - Support the implementation of the NIS Directive (workshops, Q2-Q4)  Stakeholder impact  Telecommunications Sector   NRAs, DPAs and the EDPS will have practical references and technical guidelines to implement  the legislation.   Within the area of Article 13a, the industry, NRAs and the European Commission will be able to  develop a better understanding of the significant incidents at European level as well as a  comparison with earlier years and recommendations, which will support mitigation decisions  and actions.   EU Commission (DG CONNECT, HOME and JUSTICE) will achieve harmonization of incident  reporting, breach notifications and security measures, following international standards and  can in this way forego further detailing of the legislative text.   Industry (network providers, ISPs, cloud providers, etc.) will be able to adopt a single  framework of incident reporting/breach notification and security measures, so there is a level  playing field across the EU countries and no complications for working cross borders.  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services   NRAs and DPAs will be able to implement an efficient reporting scheme very similar to the  Article 13a scheme currently in place, and in this way lay the basis for a coherent and holistic  picture of security incidents across key service providers.   A single reporting scheme will allow trust service providers to more easily operate across  borders, effectively paving the road for a single market of trust service providers across the EU.  In turn this facilitates cross border online services, such as eCommerce and eGovernment.

[Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 46  3.4.5 WPK 3.3: Regular cooperation among NIS communities  Desired Impact   At least 10 Member States and 2 national / international LEA support the conclusions of the 9th  ENISA CERT workshop.   At least 10 Member States support the Good Practice Guide and / or (where applicable)  training and exercise material for the exchange and processing of actionable information by  CERTs   10 operational CERTs agree to adopt the recommendations of stocktaking on channels and  formats for exchange of operational information   2 CERTs agree to pilot the good practice material  for first responders (material developed in  cooperation and accordance with the EC3) (Q4)  Description of tasks  Threats to cybersecurity and cyber-attacks respect no organisational and territorial boundaries. For  that reason, effective cooperation between communities at all levels is required to facilitate the  exchange of the information and knowledge needed to reduce vulnerability and provide effective  responses to cyber incidents. This includes CERTs within particular business sectors which might be  affected by large-scale incidents, other incident responders within a country serving other  communities, national / governmental CERTs, law enforcement agents and internationally  recognised research and development organisations.  Specific tasks to be included under this area are given below:   Actively support or (when appropriate) organise common trainings including communities  such as CERTs and LEA (for example support exercises organised by the Financial ISAC (FI-ISAC)  initiative)   Engage with the European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), where appropriate, through formal and  informal cooperation channels, to leverage synergies while respecting the respective  mandates.   Take stock of existing communities up to date to cyber security challenges that could be  beneficial for the work of CERTs (like for example in the area of ICS)   Facilitate the outreach (when appropriate) to those other bodies and/or communities with  similar tasks (and broaden the focus more, to reach out to new communities as well), including  taking stock of scalable and accepted methods for trustbuilding within and among  communities   Continue collecting good practice useful for CERTs and LEAs, and further enhance the ENISA  exercise and training material.

Management Board, Executive Board & PSG Secretariat 4.1  This covers all activities that are required to support ENISA’s formal bodies, the Management Board  (MB) and the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG) as well as Executive Board in their functions.  For the MB, ordinary meeting will be organised during 2014 and informal meetings will be held, one  with the PSG, if appropriate. The existing electronic newsletter will be continued throughout 2014, as  will support for the MB Portal.  For the PSG also, two formal meetings will be organised.  For the Executive Board, formal meetings will be organised during 2014.  ENISA will continue to explore additional ways of supporting the Agency’s statutory bodies in the  most effective way, including the possible use of new technologies and modifications to existing  processes as required.  In order to make the most of its stakeholder community and also to ensure that it server the latter as  effectively as possible, ENISA will aim to involve stakeholders in concrete activities wherever  possible.  National Liaison Officer Network 4.2  In 2014, the Agency shall continue to strengthen its relations with the National Liaison Officers’ (NLO)  Network. The NLO-Network is an informal network of all Member States, including Iceland,  Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as the Commission and Council. They are key actors for the  Agency’s daily work and interaction, in terms of outreach, effective liaison in the Member States and  dissemination.  The National Contact Officers (NCO) is an extension of the National Liaison Officers (NLO), which  means that the NLO-Network is extended with contact points from governmental CERTs and  Regulatory Bodies/Agencies.  ENISA envisages ad hoc meetings with National Contact Officers on particular topics of interest and is  planning to host a minimum of 1 meeting with representatives of this network in 2014.  As a result of the NLO meeting in February 2013 and in effort to optimise resources   ENISA will regularly send information to the members of the NLO network containing  information on upcoming ENISA project related tenders, vacancy notices, and events  organised by ENISA or where the Agency contributes to (for example co-organiser, etc.).   In particular, we will continue the practice of sending, emails with relevant announcements  (time - critical) and information such as upcoming vacancy notices, new launch for tenders,  etc.An assessment of the NLO section page under the ENISA home page is being carried out  in a an effort to revise this tool of communication between the Agency and the NLOs. In this  respect the Agency is assessing possible improvements as well as gaps that can be filled  either by the ENISA home page or other tools such as the newsletter, social networks, etc.   Following the relevant discussions made in the context of the NLO meeting of February 2013  ENISA has actively collaborated with the NLOs in the implementation of its WP activites for  2013 (for example in the area of trust marks). Such collaborations will be extended in 2014  starting with the NLO meeting of Q1 2014.  EU Relations 4.3  The Agency will continue to develop and enhance relations with EU Institutions and Bodies. In  particular, ENISA will seek to ensure that other European institutions and bodies are aware of the  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 53  work that the Agency is carrying out and are liaising with the Agency in the most effective way. To  this end, ENISA will establish an office in Brussels in order to support its stakeholder activities with  the EU institutions and industry representation groups that are based in Brussels.  ENISA will undertake the analysis and review of EU policy acts when requested to do so and on its  own initiative when this is in the interest of its stakeholders.  Developing and maintaining a network of key actors, advocacy and regular interaction with ENISA’s  relevant stakeholders in the EU Institutions is highly important in order to  raise the Agency’s profile  as such and, finally, to ‘enhance the levels of security in Europe’. ENISA will therefore continue to  maintain visibility in debates relating to NIS by participating in high-level events.  Finally, ENISA shall provide advice and assistance, as stated in its founding regulation, to the EU  Institutions regarding relevant NIS policy issues.  Corporate Communication 4.4  A major element of ENISA’s mission is about communicating its work to the wide range of individuals  and groups who play a role in network and information security across Europe. In its widest sense,  ENISA’s corporate communication activity is about how the Agency creates understanding of and  support for the Agency’s work among these audiences. In 2014, the focus will be on working at all  levels to help ensure that ENISA’s work reaches the right audiences and has a real impact in making  Europe’s information society even more secure.  ENISA’s media relations programme continues to create opportunities for the agency to extend its  reach to communicate with wider audiences than it could reach independently.  A programme of  targeted press conferences is also planned for 2014, focusing on media in particular geographical  locations, or with a particular interest in specific NIS areas.  The Agency will continue to develop dynamic infographics for its web site, and use in presentations.  Along with YouTube, other Social Media, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook will continue to play  a prominent role in how ENISA engages with its audiences. Experience from 2012 (when ENISA  launch its Social Media presence) and 2013 has shown that the Agency’s typical “followers” are NIS  opinion formers and professional, making them a highly valuable and influential audience. Finally,  the Agency will again produce a number of \"Flash Notes\" during the year, highlighting key NIS issues  in a fast and effective medium.  Dissemination activities 4.5  ENISA continues to regard dissemination activities as a key part of its efforts to communicate  effectively with its stakeholder communities. As part of this effort, ENISA will, throughout 2014 be  producing informative, tightly focused video clips, plus podcasts and interviews, all available through  the Agency’s web site, and other media, such as YouTube. These will be produced in addition to the  more classic corporate video productions, on wider themes.  Quality Control 4.6  In 2011, the Executive Director, launched the quality management system of the Agency. In 2014,  the Agency plans to continue documenting, implementing and maintaining a quality management  system in order to improve its effectiveness.  In 2014 the Agency will re-engineer selected operational processes, align organisational  requirements with actual implementation in information management and seek process  improvements across the board.  Efforts will be made to measure the performance of recently  designed processes for the purpose of proposing suitable adjustments. A set of tools such as  electronic signatures, electronic workflows and enterprise management tools will be gradually  integrated as necessary to further improve productivity.  54  Summary of Horizontal Operational Activities 4.7  Horizontal Operational Activities  SR Stakeholder Relations Budget  Person  months FTE  SR1 MB & PSG Secretariat 220.000 9,6 1,0  SR2 National Liaison Officers Network 40.000 4,8 0,5  SR3 EU Relations 0 4,8 0,5  Total SR 260.000 19,2 2,0  CC Corporate Communication Budget  Person  months FTE  CC1 Corporate Communication 50.000 19,2 2,0  Total CC 50.000 19,2 2,0  PS Project Support Activities Budget  Person  months FTE  PS1 Dissemination Activities 40.000 9,6 1,0  PS2 Quality control 0 9,6 1,0  Total PS 40.000 19,2 2,0  Total Horizontal Operational Activities 350.000 57,6 6,0  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 55  5 Administration and Support Department, Directorate and General  Management activities  5.1 Overview  The Directorate consists of the Executive Director and his personal assistant.

programme  WPK: Work Package  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 7  1 Introduction  1.1 Introduction  As in previous years, the work programme for 2014 reflects the results of the consultation process  with the ENISA Permanent Stakeholder Group (PSG) and Management Board that was carried out in  November 2012 and February 2013. This version also takes account of comments submitted by  Member States following the March Management Board meeting and includes modifications to  resources and budget following confirmation of the latter by the EU Commission.  The structure of the 2014 work programme is fundamentally different to that of previous work  programmes. Whilst core operational activities are still structured into three streams of work, these  streams reflect the way in which the work supports the EU policy goals of the Member States rather  than areas of activity that are based on the content. The result is a work programme that is a natural  continuation of the evolution of the Agency’s work over the last few years, but organised according  to new criteria.  Estimates for resources and budget have been adapted to reflect the fact that ENISA will have new  activities to perform during 2014 as a result of the new mandate and the Cybersecurity  Strategy for  the European Union.  1.2 Structure  1.2.1 Core operational activities  The core operational activities covered by the 2014 Work Programme have been structured as  three separate work streams. These work streams are as follows.   WS1: Support EU policy building   WS2: Support capacity building   WS3: Support co-operation.  In addition, supporting work will continue in the form of a set of horizontal activities.  1.2.2 Horizontal activities  As in previous years, this work programme also regroups a number of activities into a single  chapter, under the general heading of ‘Horizontal Operational Activities’:   Management Board, Executive Board & PSG Secretariat   National Liaison Officer Network   EU Relations   Corporate Communication   Dissemination activities   Quality control  The Project Support Activities cover Dissemination Activities, Quality Management and Public  Relations support for COD.  1.2.3 Administration and support department, Directorate and General management  activities  Support activities have been further streamlined by integrating facility management and IT support  activities within the Administration and Support department .  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 8  1.3 Key Performance Indicators and Key Impact Indicators  The terms Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and Key Impact Indicator (KII) are defined as follows:  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable metrics used to evaluate objectives to reflect the  performance of an organisation. KPIs measure the agency’s performance during the budgetary/fiscal  year. KPIs differ depending on the nature of the organisation. Different layers and dimensions should  be taken into consideration. KPIs can constitute both quantitative and qualitative measures;  however, the most useful and common types are quantitative based. These include amongst others a  focus on metrics such as number of Member States targeted, and number of hits to the website etc.  Key impact indicators (KIIs) are indicators used to evaluate long-term performance and eventually  linked to the strategy foundation stone of an organisation.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 9  2 Policy and Legal Context  The Agency situates its work in the wider context of a legal and policy environment as pointed out  below. Its activities and tasks are fulfilled as defined by its Regulation and integrated in this larger legal  framework and policy context.1  ENISA-Regulation2,3  Prior to the adoption of the new regulation, all activities and tasks carried out by the Agency were  fulfilled on the basis of the founding ENISA-Regulation. This basis was laid down in Regulation (EC) No  460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security.  The new Regulation builds on ENISA’s achievements in areas such as supporting Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) in Member States and facilitating the pan-European cybersecurity exercises.  It provides ENISA with a strong interface to Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to enable the  Agency to contribute to the fight against cybercrime, focusing on prevention and detection. It also  foresees a more proactive role for the Agency in supporting the development of EU cybersecurity  policy and legislation. This is also true for the areas of research, development and standardisation,  where EU standards for risk management and the security of electronic products, networks and  services are cited as key aspects. Finally, ENISA is also given a stronger role in cooperating with third  countries.  The Cybersecurity  Strategy of the EU4 and the proposal for an NIS Directive  Information and communications technology has become the backbone of our economic growth and is  a critical resource which all economic sectors rely on. It now underpins the complex systems which  keep our economies running in key sectors such as finance, health, energy and transport; while many  business models are built on the uninterrupted availability of the Internet and the smooth functioning  of information systems.  Recent years have seen that while the digital world brings enormous benefits, it is also vulnerable.  Cybersecurity incidents, be it intentioal or accidental, are increasing at an alarming pace and could  disrupt the supply of essential services we take for granted such as water, healthcare, electricity or  mobile services. Threats can have different origins — including criminal, politically motivated, terrorist  or state-sponsored attacks as well as natural disasters and unintentional mistakes.  The Commission has proposed the Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union, which outlines the  EU's vision in this domain, clarifies roles and responsibilities and sets out the actions required based on  strong and effective protection and promotion of citizens' rights to make the EU's online environment  the safest in the world.  This strategy is accompanied by a proposal for legislation5 to:  1  Please note that this does not constitute a comprehensive listing of all relevant policy acts and the legal framework.

Council conclusions on the Commission and the High Representative of the European Union  for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of  the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace6  These Council Conclusions, agreed by the General Affairs Council on 25 June 2013, summarises actions  to be carried out by various actors in the cybersecurity field.  Digital Agenda7  The Digital Agenda for Europe is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and  provides an action plan for making the best use of ICT to speed up economic recovery and lay the  foundations of a sustainable digital future. The Digital Agenda for Europe outlines seven priority areas  for action, in the context of which it also attributes a significant role to ENISA as well as to its  stakeholders.Council Directive on the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection8.  This Directive establishes a procedure for the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures (‘ECIs’), and a common approach to the assessment of the need to improve the  protection of such infrastructures in order to contribute to the protection of people.  The CIIP Action Plan  The Commission Communication “Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions:  enhancing preparedness, security and resilience” calls upon ENISA to support the Commission and  Member States in implementing the CIIP Action Plan to strengthen the security and resilience of CIIs.  The Commission Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection  \"Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security\" adopted on 31 March 20119  In this communication, the Communication takes stock of the results achieved since the adoption of  the CIIP action plan in 2009 launched to strengthen the security and resilience of vital Information and  Communication Technology infrastructures. The next steps the Commission proposes for each action  at both European and international level are also described.  Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework10  The review of the EU electronic communications regulatory framework and, in particular, the new  provisions of articles 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive and the amended article 4 of the e- Privacy Directive aim at strengthening obligations for operators to ensure security and integrity of  their networks and services, and to notify breaches of security, integrity and personal data to  competent national authorities and assign to ENISA specific tasks.  6  Available at http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st12/st12109.en13.pdf  7  A Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010)245, May, 2010.  8  Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment  of the need to improve their protection  9  \"Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security\" adopted on 31 March 2011 and the Council Conclusion on CIIP of May 2011  ( http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf)  10  Telecommunications Regulatory Package (article 13a. amended Directive 2002/21/EC Framework Directive)  http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/13/st12/st12109.en13.pdf  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 11  Review of the Data Protection Framework11  In 2012, the European Commission published its proposal for a regulation on data protection. This  regulation will replace the existing Data Protection Directive. It encompasses many of the concepts  described above, promoting privacy by design and data protection by default while including  provisions for remedies, liability and administrative sanctions in case of non-compliance. ENISA will  support the implementation of the new regulation on data protection.  Electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal  market12  The new framework for electronic identification and electronic trust services ensures mutual  recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders, gives legal effect and mutual  recognition to trust services including enhancing current rules on e-signatures and provides a legal  framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document acceptability, electronic delivery  and website authentication.  This proposal represents the first milestone in the implementation of the objectives of the Legislation  Team (eIDAS) Task Force set up by the Commission in order to to deliver a predictable regulatory  environment for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market to boost the user convenience, trust and confidence in the digital world.  Commission Regulation on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data  breaches  In June 2013, the European Commission has put in place new specific rules to ensure that personal  data breaches in the EU telecoms sector are notified in the same way in each Member State13.  The 2002 ePrivacy Directive requires telecommunications operators and Internet service providers to  keep personal data confidential and secure. To ensure consistent implementation of the data breach  rules across Member States, the Commission has adopted \"technical implementing measures\" –  practical rules to complement the existing legislation – on the circumstances, formats and procedures  for the notification requirements. These rules will help ensure ensure that all customers receive  equivalent treatment across the EU in case of a data breach, and that businesses can take a pan-EU  approach to these problems if they operate in more than one country.  A coherent framework to build trust in the Digital single market for e-commerce and online  services14  The European Commission adopted the Communication on e-commerce and other online services  announced in the ”Digital Agenda“ and the ”Single Market Act“. Based on an in-depth public  consultation, this Communication sets out the Commission's vision for the potential represented by  online services in growth and employment, identifies the principal obstacles to the development of e- commerce and online services, and establishes 5 priorities, accompanied by an action plan.

It forms a part of the information society and of the  eEurope Action Plan16 in general. The Framework Decision will be replaced by a new Directive on  attacks against information systems, that is expected to be adopted shortly. This Directive retains the  Framework Decision´s current provisions – the penalisation of illegal access, illegal system interference  and illegal data interference – and notably includes new offences, such as illegal interception and the  use of tools to commit large-scale attacks.  Commission Communication 'Tackling Crime in our Digital Age: Establishing a European  Cybercrime Centre'17  In this Communication, the Commission proposes a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), which will be  part of Europol and act as the focal point in the fight against cybercrime in the EU. This  Communication drawing on the feasibility study outlines the proposed core functions of the European  Cybercrime Centre, explains why it should be located in Europol, and how it can be established. The  EC3 was officially launched on 11 January 2013.  Council Resolution of December 200918  The Council Resolution on a collaborative European approach on Network and Information Security of  18 December 2009 builds on a number of EU strategies and instruments developed in recent years. It  provides political direction on how the Member States, the Commission, ENISA and stakeholders can  play their part in enhancing the level of network security in Europe.  Council conclusion on CIIP of May 201119  These Council Conclusion take stock of the results achieved since the adoption of the CIIP action plan  in 2009, launched to strengthen the security and resilience of vital Information and Communication  Technology Infrastructures.  Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the  European Economic and Social Committee regarding an Action Plan for an innovative and  competitive Security Industry20  The Commission has produced a Commission Staff Working Paper on Security Industrial Policy”21  SWD(2012) 233 final, and a Communication regarding an Action Plan for an innovative and  competitive Security Industry. The underlying idea of the Commission is the creation of a true internal  market for the security industry by suggesting clear measures. A dedicated expert group set up by the  Commission will meet at least once per year to monitor the implementation of proposed policy  measures and bring together all relevant actors in the field of security.

It constitutes the European policy in the area of cloud computing and  addresses areas such as standards, certification, trust and security, data protection, cross-border  services, contractual terms, consumer protection, interoperability and portability and adoption of  cloud services by public authorities. Furthermore it recognises the need for awareness raising and  international cooperation. This document is the European policy baseline on cloud computing and it  includes a specific action for ENISA on EU-wide voluntary certification schemes.\"  Internal Security Strategy for the European UnionInternal Security Strategy for the European  Union24  The Internal Security Strategy lays out a European security model, which integrates among others  action on law enforcement and judicial cooperation, border management and civil protection, with  due respect for shared European values, such as fundamental rights. This document includes a number  of suggested actions for ENISA.  Council Resolution on a collaborative approach to Network and Information Security 25  In this resolution the Council recognises the potential role of ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It  also underlines that the major goals of NIS are to support security standards, awareness raising and  serving as a center of expertise.  Telecom Ministerial Conference on CIIP organised by the Presidency in Balatonfüred,  Hungary  This conference took place on 14-15 April 2011 and was a natural extension of the \"Tallinn process\"  initiated by the 2009 Ministerial CIIP Conference in Estonia under the Czech Presidency of the EU.  On  this occasion, Vice President of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes, Digital Agenda Commissioner,  acknowledged the progresses made by Member States but also called upon for further actions and  stressed the importance of international cooperation. In particular, as a follow-up to the Conference,  VP Neelie Kroes called on ENISA to intensify its activity of promoting existing good practices by  involving all Member States in a peer-learning and mutual support process with the aim to promote  faster progress and bring all Member States on par. VP Neelie Kroes called on ENISA to establish a  highly mobile dedicated team to support such process.  23  Communication of the Commission to the Parliament, the Council, the EU Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions on the  Internet of Things, COM(2009)278 final of 18.

[Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 15  3 Core operational activities  3.1 Introduction  The core activities of ENISA for 2014 have been grouped into three work streams (WS):   WS1 : ‘Support EU policy building’ will support the policy making process by making available to  policy makers consolidated information on the emerging threat landscape and by formulating  key messages to the Member States on how to ensure that their policies and capabilities are  aligned with EU objectives taking into account lessons learned within the different Member  States. This will involve the unification of available information sources under a common context  and will also require the involvement of important stakeholders in the areas of threat  assessment, risk mitigation and policy definition.   WS2 : ‘Support capacity building’ foresees a number of activities designed to assist both the  public sector and private sector in the Member States in protecting Critical Information  Infrastructures (CIIP). By facilitating cooperation and coordination between public and private  sectors within the  Member States, ENISA will continue to support the development of policies  and measures and implementable preparedness, response and recovery strategies, to meet the  challenges of a continuously evolving threat environment.   WS3 : ‘Support cooperation’ is about strengthening NIS in the European single market.  Cooperation strengthens the capacities of Member States, EU institutions and third countries  and helps them to deal with crises. The approach will be to build upon existing collaboration in  existing communities, further enhancing community building in Europe and beyond. This work  also looks at the development of tools to facilitate and improve the international communication  and interchange of security relevant information within communities sharing the same interest  in different MS.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 16  3.2 WS1- Support EU policy building  3.2.1 Overview  Justification  This work stream consists of work packages that are designed to assist COM and Member States in  building EU policy in the area of Network & Information Security. When specifically requested by  Member States, the Agency will also assist in ensuring that national policies are aligned with EU  objectives.  This support to the policy building activities in EU can be addressed in different steps:   Analysis and research of the evolving threat environment.   The promotion of standards / best practises.   Support to the EU and Member States in the fields of education, research and standardisation.  The following benefits are foreseen:   Coherent and meaningful data on the emerging threat landscape and trends is a valuable tool  for NIS professionals, decision and policy makers.   Dissemination of current best practises and standards contributes to interoperability, provides  technical references for the harmonisation of technologies, and augments the protection level  for NIS infrastructures and services in the EU. This is expected to lead to more effective risk  mitigation stratergies.   NIS knowledge transferred to education, research and standardisation activities, contributes to  EU-wide harmonisation in these areas.  Specific Policy Context  Specific policy references for this work stream are as follows:   Proposal No COM(2010) 521 final, 2010/0275 (COD) of 30 September 2010 for a Regulation of  the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA).   Commission proposed Action Plan to enable further growth of Security industry26 COM(2012)  417.   The Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU  Overall Objectives  The objectives of this Work Stream are:   Analysis of the evolving threat environment, both from the stakeholder and EU policy makers’  perspective.   Identification of gaps in NIS technologies and policies, and the support in the development of  strategies, best practises, frameworks and standards.   Mobilisation of relevant stakeholders, the development of a roadmap for the creation of an  “NIS Drivers License”, and support for the implementation of the roadmap.  3.2.2 Work Packages  The following work packages constitute the Work Stream:  26 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security- industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth-  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth- http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth-  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 17   WPK1.1. Identifying evolving threats, risks and challenges: The main objective of this work  package is to collect and collate current data in order to develop the ENISA threat landscape. It  includes current threats, as well as threat trends in NIS and emerging technologies. The threat  landscape is based on existing publicly available material on threats, risks and trends.   WPK1.2. Contributing to EU policy initiatives: The main objective of this work package is to  provide input to new policy initiatives (in areas such as Cloud computing, smart grids, etc.)  before they are launched and also to assist the COM and the Member States in implementing  such policies in an effective way and in learning from this experience so that problems can be  avoided in future policy statements.   WPK1.3. Supporting the EU in education, research & standardisation: In the context of this  activity ENISA will continue its efforts to support EU funded R&D initiatives such as FP7 and  H2020 and standardisation activities including EU initiatives such as the ETSI CEN CENELEC  Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG). Finaly, this work will support the activities in the  area of education described in the NIS Cyber Security Strategy such as NIS driving license and  European Cyber Security Month 2014 (ECSM’2014).  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 18  3.2.3 WPK 1.1: Identifying evolving threats, risks and challenges  Desired Impact   The ENISA Threat Landscape becomes an important point of reference for security experts  worldwide and is referenced in at least 10 security related information sources world wide.   It is referenced by 5 stakeholders from the 2 sectors covered.   Identified emerging threats and trends have been taken into consideration in at least 5 R&D  projects in EU.  Description of tasks  The main goal of this work package is to collect and collate current data in order to develop the  ENISA threat landscape. It includes current threats, as well as threat trends in NIS and emerging  technologies. The threat landscape is based on existing publicly available material on threats, risks  and trends.  In addition to the global threat analysis (the ENISA threat landscape), this work will include detailed  threat and risk assessments for at least two particular areas/sectors. These will be detailed analyses  of particular areas that are crucial for society, industry or research. Examples of such areas are key  internet infrastructures, banking and finance, health, transport, energy and public administration.  During the preparatory phases of the Work Programme execution, ENISA will select these areas by  consulting relevant stakeholder communities and by identifying current priorities. This work  package will involve the analysis of three main sources of information:   Consultations with different players in the security field will support the data collection work  and will also be used as a basis for selecting the areas/sectors of interest.   An analysis of innovative projects and activities being supported by  COM or Member States in  research or early development phases. This will have impact on future uses of technologies and  may require analysis of potential new threats and associated risks.   Analysis of reported and publicly known incidents in the subject matter areas.  This approach will allow ENISA to develop a perspective of the European landscape of the NIS gaps  and needs for a wide spectrum of stakeholders. The Agency will match identified threats with  existing minimum security measures and suggest amendments of existing and publicly known  measures to better mitigate these threats.  To achieve these objectives, the following tasks will be carried out:   Development of the ENISA Threat Landscape 2014, as continuation of the work started in 2012  on a yearly basis, and improving the results in the following areas:  o Derivation of the European perspective based collected threats (e.g. incorporating  information on European companies such as size, type of business, etc.).  o Improvement of the quality of threat information collection within related  organisations.  o Liaison with sources of threat information to establish effective dissemination of  generated information.  o Analysis and assessment of previous year forecasts.  Outcomes & deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:   WPK1.1-D1 – Annual EU CyberSecurity Threats Landscape.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 19   WPK1.1-D2 – Identification of trends, security challenges, associated risks and required  countermeasures, for emerging technologies (with special attention to selected areas/sectors).  Stakeholder impact  The primary beneficiaries of this work package will be policy makers and organisations from public  and private sectors, who will receive integrated and consolidated information about the European  NIS threat landscape and how it is evolving:   Public and private organisations will be able to use the ENISA Threat Landscape in their own  risk and threat assessment in order to develop more effective security strategies, thus  improving their Return of Security Investment (ROSI).   EU Commission DG CONNECT will be able to use the ENISA output to adjust the scope of their  R&D related activities.   Public and private organisations may capatilise on the ENISA output to propose innovative R&D  activities, products or services.

The Commission proposes to create a true internal  market for the security industry by inter alia:   introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research  stage. To reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and  international procurement, the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in  Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial Procurement, to test and validate results  stemming from EU security research projects. This approach should unite industry,  public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.   novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate  results stemming from EU security research projects.   COUNCIL RESOLUTION, 18/12/ 2009, on a collaborative European approach to Network and  Information Security, (2009/C 321/01)30. In this resolution the Council recognises the  potential role of ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It also underlines that the major goals  of NIS are to support:   Quality of Information handling   Collection of statistical data on NIS in Member States and EU institutions  27  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security- industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth-  28  ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/security/files/commission_staff_working_paper_-_security_industrial_policy_- _com(2012)_417_final_en.pdf  29 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0417:FIN:EN:PDF  30 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:321:0001:0004:EN:PDF  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth- http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=6117&lang=en&tpa_id=0&title=Security-industry%3A-Commission-proposes-programme-to-enable-further-growth- http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0417:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:321:0001:0004:EN:PDF  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 20   Raise awareness and good practices and guidance   EU policy development and implementation support to COM and Member States,  bridging gap between technology and policy, and following EU priorities.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 21  3.2.4 WPK 1.2: Contributing to EU policy initiatives  Desired Impact   10 Cloud Computing Providers and 5 Member States support ENISA’s recommendations for  improving NIS aspects of Cloud Computing   15 Smart Grids providers and 5 Member States competent authorities support ENISA’s  guidelines for implementing the  Smart Grids Strategy   5 Member States eID competent bodies/authorities, 5 Independent Auditing Bodies and 5 Trust  Service Providers take part in the development of a common audit framework for trust service  providers.   ENISA recommendations on algorithms and parameters for secure services for the protection  of personal data in the context eGov services supported by competent authorities in at least 5  Member States;  Description of tasks  The tasks carried out in this work package are designed both to provide input to new policy  initiatives before they are launched and also to assist COM and the Member States in implementing  such policies in an effective way and in learning from this experience so that problems can be  avoided in future policy statements.  EU’s Cloud Computing Strategy and Partnership  ENISA will continue to play an active role in the implementation of the EU’s cloud computing  strategy and partnership. The Agency will provide technical advice, recommendations and good  practices to Commission’s Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and the European Cloud Partnership (ECP)  in the areas of certification, public procurement guidelines, SLAs and incident reporting  mechanisms. In all these areas ENISA will engage with all relevant public and private stakeholders  and make sure that these efforts properly align with EU’s ECP, ETSI and CEN/CENELEC initiatives.  EU’s Smart Grids Strategy  ENISA will assist the Commission, the Member States and the private sector in the implementation  of the EU’s Smart Grids strategy. The Agency will provide technical advice, recommendations and  good practices in the area of Minimum Security Measures for Smart Grids, certification of Smart  Grid components, privacy profile of Smart Meters, and incident reporting mechanisms. ENISA will  engage with all relevant stakeholders, provide contributions to COM policy intiatives (e.g. EU CSS,  DG ENER Expert Group 2 (EG2), CEN/CENELEC’s M490) and make sure that these efforts properly  align with EU’s overall Smart Grid Policy.  Algorithms and parameters for secure services  Technical protection measures, specified in legal documents, need to be matched with technical  specifications in order to secure personal data31. During 2013, ENISA initiated a new activity in the  area of cryptography with an emphasis on providing technical specifications for cryptographic  algorithms to protect personal data in e government (eGov) services. The algorithms are analysed  31  ENISA is expected to assist the EC in establishing an indicative list of appropriate technological protection measures,  including encryption schemes, according to the recently published EC regulation 611/2013  (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications ) on the measures applicable to  the notification of personal data breaches. Article 4 of the ePrivacy directive and Article 29 of the proposed data  protection regulation also mention technical measures, which have an impact on the notification procedure in the  case of data breaches.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 22  and ranked based on two criteria: usage (relevant and widely deployed algorithms) and security  (clear identification of the security of the scheme with appropriately selected parameters and key  sizes).  Hence, ENISA will continue this activity during 2014, by reviewing the cryptographic  recommendations annually to ensure appropriate data security, taking into account of similar work  carried out in the Member States32,33.  Furthermore, ENISA will extend its efforts to cover  application scenarios, such as cloud computing and mobile devices. Other aspects such as the  security requirments of network end points and on how to establish trust relationships (cf, secure  computing base and new public key infrastructures) could also be investigated.  Best practice guide for prevention of data leakage and appropriate controls for the access of data  using Security and Privacy by Design and by Default  The increasing use of online services has led to significant growth in the amount of citizens’  personal data being transmitted over public networks (e.g. the Internet) and stored within  applications that are accessible from anywhere on the Internet. Data leakage or security breaches  in such systems have a direct impact on the right to privacy and may have legal implications.  Moreover, citizens are exposed to financial risks, if financial information (e.g. banking details) is  disclosed. Lastly, due to the quality and the quantity of data, leakages expose citizens to various  risks and can cause substantial reputational damage to official bodies.  Since 2010 ENISA is actively working on the subject of data leakage and notifications about  breaches. In 2014 this work will be complemented by a best practice guide addressed to the  interest of the businesses containing recommendations for prevention of data leakage and  appropriate controls for the access of data.  EU electronic identification and trust services framework  The European Commission adopted on June 4th 2012 a proposal for a Regulation34 on electronic  identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market that will  replace the existing Directive 1999/93/EC35  on a community framework for electronic signatures  was the legal recognition of electronic signatures. The proposal strengthens the provisions for  interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across borders,  enhances current rules for electronic signatures and provides a legal framework for other types of  trust services (electronic seals, electronic delivery services, electronic documents, time stamping  services and web site authentication).  ENISA has already contributed to this area by providing recommendations in the areas of:   Mechanisms for reporting security breaches by the trust service providers to the  competent bodies.   Minimum security measures and security best practices for trust services providers.  In 2014, ENISA will continue to support related activities relevant to the implementation of the  provisions of the proposal, with a focus on the areas of:  32  Commission Regulation 611/2013 on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under  Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications” online: https://ec.europa.eu/digital- agenda/en/eprivacy-directive-data-breach-notifications  33  ETSI SR 002 176 “Algorithms and Parameters for Secure Electronic Signatures”  34 Proposal for a Regulation \"on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the  internal market\": http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML  35  Directive 1999/93/EC on a community framework for electronic signatures was the legal recognition of electronic  signatures: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 23   Common audit schemes for trust services providers in Member States. Technical guidelines  for independent auditing bodies and supervisory authorities. The work will refer to and  take into account relevant regulatory frameworks 36  At the end of 2012 ENISA organised the first Annual Privacy Forum (APF’2012)  http://privacyforum.eu/ in partnership with DG CONNECT, -Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the  EU and the University of Cyprus. The main objective of the APF, is to establish a forum fostering the  exchange of information and experiences between the research and academic communities, and  the EU policy and industry representatives. The response to the organisation of the first edition of  the conference in 2012 indicates that APF can become an established reference event in the area  of privacy putting emphasis on the need to bring together the policy and research communities.  Due to the delay in the new ENISA mandate decision process in 2013 it was premature to organise  the 2013 edition of the Annual Privacy Forum. In this light, in Q3 2013 it was agreed to organise the  2nd edition of APF’2014 in the context of the Greek Presidency of the EU. Experience from APF’2012  clearly indicates that the collaboration model between DG CONNECT and ENISA in the joint  organisation of APF is the way forward.

Description of tasks  Inventory of standardisation activities  in NIS, Privacy, Cloud Computing & Smart Grids  ENISA tracks the development of standards from a global perspective in the area of Network and  Information Security. The Agency will monitor NIS standards EU wide and globally, including areas  that are not specifically related to the ENISA work programme. This approach will enable ENISA to  keep its stakeholders informed on new NIS standardisation activities and to flag opportunities  and/or risks as they develop.  Since 2012 ENISA contributes actively to the creation and work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber  Security Coordination Group (CSCG). This collaboration with CSCG will continue during 2014  seeking out synergies with the Agency’s work programme and involve standards bodies in the  different work packages in as far as this is appropriate.  Moreover in 2014, ENISA will develop an inventory of relevant standardisation activities in the  areas of NIS and privacy . ENISA will assess whether there is a gap between these standardisation  activities and state of the art developments in NIS (including ENISA results).  Contribution/participation at the evaluation of the calls of proposals for EU funded R&D  published by the European Commission  As was the case in previous years, ENISA will continue to support COM by providing experts at the  evaluations of the calls of proposals that are published in the context EU funded R&D programs. In  this context, emphasis will be given to the areas of important to the ENISA Work Program as  presented in this document. It should be envisaged that ENISA may contribute up to 2 experts for  the evaluation of calls of proposals during 2014.  Collaboration with EU funded R&D projects  In the areas of interest to the ENISA Work Program the Agency wil continue to collaborate with and  to support EU funded R&D projects. Such collaboration may be in the form of:   Participating in the panel of reviewers that are supporting COM in reviewing the progress  of a project and steering the project’s future work.   Participation in the advisory/steering board of selective projects accepted by COM for  funding. Obviously ENISA may contribute to only a small number of projects. In this  context, emphasis will be given to the areas of important to the ENISA Work Program as  presented in this document.   Contributions to the various consultations launched by COM in the areas of interest to  ENISA. Such consultations may be conducted in the context of setting the research  priorities for future calls for proposals or in the context policy intitiatives launched or about  to be launched by the COM.  Early Warning and Response System against cyber-attacks and disruptions  In the context of the publication of the Cybersecurity  Strategy for the EU and the Proposal for a  Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 26  common level of network and information security across the Union (COM(2013) 48 final), the  European Commission has launched a feasibility study on the implementation of a European-wide  Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) against cyber-attacks and disruptions.  The scope of this EWRS would be focused on major incidents with transnational impact on the  functioning of the ICT infrastructure or services that require a coordinated response from several  Member States. In addition, this platform would encourage the sharing of best practices between  the competent authorities and their constituency.  Subject to the approval of the NIS Directive, ENISA will collaborate with COM in the  implementation of this study providing advice and input to the study team when called upon and  according to the needs of COM.  Contribution to the ‘EU NIS Driving Licence’  Together with relevant stakeholder community, ENISA will drive the development of a roadmap for  the implementation of a \"Network and Information Security driving licence\". This roadmap will  cover the needs of different levels of education, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary education.  The roadmap will exploit existing material and synergies among relevant training bodies. Within  this activity, ENISA, in cooperation with COM, will assist in:   identifying partners to produce the material for the defined curricula,   identifying partners to lecture courses and seminars implementing this curricula, and   upon feasibility, organising pilot courses and seminars related to the “NIS driving licence”.

The Commission proposes to create a true internal  market for the security industry by inter alia:   harmonising standards and certification procedures for security technologies.   introducing checks on the societal impact of new security technologies at the research  stage. To reduce the gap between research and market, especially in European and  international procurement, the Commission will use novel funding schemes foreseen in  Horizon 2020 such as Pre-commercial Procurement, to test and validate results  stemming from EU security research projects. This approach should unite industry,  public authorities and end users from the beginning of research projects. Border  security and aviation security are the most promising areas.   novel funding schemes such as Pre-commercial Procurement to test and validate  results stemming from EU security research projects.   The priority will be to overcome fragmentation of the EU security market, by  harmonising standards and certification procedures for security technologies.  European standardisation organisations will be asked to establish concrete and  detailed standardisation roadmaps on the next generation of technologies. In this  context, to achieve mutual recognition of certification systems, the Commission  intends to issue two legislative proposals, to establish an EU wide harmonised  certification system for airport screening (detection) equipment, andan EU wide  harmonised certification system for alarm systems.   The Commission will introduce checks on the societal impact of new security  technologies at the research stage. In addition, the Commission will issue a mandate to  European standardisation organisations to develop a standard for the integration of  privacy issues, from design to production process phases.   COUNCIL RESOLUTION, 18/12/ 2009, on a collaborative European approach to Network and  Information Security, (2009/C 321/01)40. In this resolution the Council recognises the potential  role of ENISA to build a NIS scenario in Europe. It also underlines that the major goals of NIS  are to support:   Security standards   Raise awareness and good practices and guidance   Serve as EU Centre of expertise. EU institutions should seek its opinion on policy  implementation.   Council Conclusions on CIIP Action Plan (May 2011)  3.3 WS2- Support capacity building  3.3.1 Overview  Justification  This work stream aims at supporting ENISA’s key stakeholders in developing new operational and  policy capabilities to address the various challenges in cybersecurity and to extend existing  capabilities (where appropriate). This will be achieved by collecting and disseminating good  practice for public and private sectors and for the European citizen in general.

Protecting Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIP) is a key priority for Member States, the  Commission and industry (operators, service providers, manufacturers). By facilitating cooperation  and coordination among Member States, ENISA will continue to support all in developing sound  and implementable preparedness, response and recovery strategies, including those policies and  measures that are necessary to meet the challenges of a continually evolving threat environment.  EU Member States and private sector companies have different maturity levels in their capabilities  to address cyber attacks and disruptions. ENISA, with this work stream, aims to raise the level of  security across Member States and the private sector by supporting the development of relevant  capabilities.  The Agency assists EU Member States, the Commission and the private sector in sharing knowledge  and experience with each other in key sectors (e.g. Cloud Computing, Smart Grids, ICS-SCADA), on  key information security topics (e.g. minimum security measures) and to develop good practices  and recommendations that would be of mutual benefit to all. This way public and private  stakeholders will be better prepared to coordinate and cooperate with each other durinng a cyber  crisis.  Key action 3 of the European cloud strategy [ref. COM(2012)529] aims at supporting Member  States, associated countries and industry in preparing sound approaches for cloud  computing  adoption. This will be achieved by setting up a European Cloud Partnership (ECP) bringing together  leading public sector actors from all over Europe cooperating with industry consortia. It will address  issues such as safe and secure cloud usage, data protection and others.  ENISA's work will be  aligned with the work in the European Cloud Partnership.  The Agency also will also offer targeted assistance to EU Member States that wish to improve their  security standing in certain areas (e.g. training on national exercises, cyber security strategies).  The private sector is the main owner of current critical information infrastructures. The effective  co-operation between public and private sector is important for the swift implementation of ICT  security measures in relevant sectors and services. The NIS Platform will be an important  instrument in enabling such co-operation to flourish.

[Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 30  3.3.3 WPK 2.1: Support Member States’ Capacity Building  Desired Impact   10 Member States and 5 private companies support ENISA’s conclusions on national cyber  security strategies   Improved operational practices of CERTs (on-going support with best practices development)  training provided to a minimum of 20 participants of different organisations   6 Member States and 10 private companies support ENISA recommendations on national PPPs  Description of tasks  The objective of this work package is to support the development of prevention, detection, analysis  and response capabilities within Member States institutions and EU institutions. Corresponding  actions aimed at the private sector are detailed in WPK 2.2.  Cyber Security Strategies - CSS  ENISA will continue to support Member States in developing their capabilities in the area of  National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS). The Agency, building on previous work in the area of  NCSS, will act as facilitator among Member States and foster the sharing of good practices. ENISA  will continue offering targeted assistance to Member States on the development of new NCSS,  evaluation of existing ones or the development of elements of a NCSS. The Agency will also bring  Member States and the private sector together to share experiences and good practices on NCSS or  invidual elements of an CSS. This work will be summarised by a status report about the deployment  of  NCSS in the EU.  ENISA will take stock of existing evaluation/assessment mechanisms of NCSS, identify good  practices, validate them with public and private sector and finally issue a white paper with practical  recommedations on the evaluation and update of existing NCSS.  Developing CERT Capabilities  Whilst the EU Member States acknowledge the need to establish competent  national/governmental CERTs on national level, the level of those capabilities vary greatly from  Member State to Member State. In addition, the EU has recently established its own CERT in form  of the CERT-EU, whose goal is to protect the EU institutions.  It is one of ENISA’s primary goals to support all Member States and EU institutions in their efforts  to build up effective CERTs, to reach a specific level of capabilities and, where possible, extend  those to provide even better services. Underpinning this work is a set of “Baseline capabilities”,  which are competencies defined in four key areas (operational, technical, mandate and  cooperation). These are agreed with the CERT teams in the Member States, and constantly  monitored and updated by ENISA. To help CERTs to implement these baseline capabilities ENISA  provides support in the form of good practice material, training and exercises.  In 2014, ENISA will build upon its work in this area, but will also take stock of its work in the area of  CERTs in the last 8 years. The goal will be to concisely draw “lessons learned” through a dialogue  with relevant stakeholders, and to draw a roadmap of CERT activities for the coming years.  Concrete Activities in this area are as follows:   Take stock of achievements, good practice and experiences from 8 years of work in the area of  CERT, with the goal to develop a roadmap and plan the work ahead.   Enhance training and exercising methodology (“learning loop”) to improve the competencies of  trainers. This will be supported by a collection of “use cases” and “lessons learned” from  existing trainings and team exercises  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 31   To support above mentioned action, further actively support capability building for CERTs by  delivering (on request) trainings and suitable exercises to technical staff from EU Member  States, EU institutions and other appropriate audiences   Extend good practice collection with new training and exercise material for CERTs and  (potentially) communities in the four areas of the “Baseline capabilities”   Together with suitable stakeholder groups (like the FIRST Education SIG) investigate how to  best apply ENISAs training material, and how to integrate suitable trainings and material from  other communities (NIST, ISACA, etc.)One of the topics for new good practice/training material  will be to Identify suitable mechanisms for gathering, processing and exchange of actionable  information (format, channels, etc.) to support the effective and efficient exchange of  operational data among teams  Support of regional, sector-specific and national cyber exercises  In the past, the Agency has supported national, regional and sectorial cyber exercises efforts upon  request (Art14 of the ENISA regulation). This effort will continue in 2014 in line with the ENISA  regulation, the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the EU Member States’ needs. Where appropriate  the Agency will collaborate with and support regional or sectorial cyber exercises in a cost efficient  manner, for example by re-using exercise planning and management knowledge and tools from  other exercises and efforts.  National and European PPPs  ENISA will continue supporting Member States in the development of their capabilities in the area  of national Public Private Partnerships. The Agency, building on its work in the area of PPPs and  Trusted Information Sharing, will provide targeted and customised advice on national PPPs (e.g. in  a form of a seminar or training). In certain areas ENISA will try to transfer experiences from  existing, successful Member States to other Member States. ENISA will also try to engage National  PPPs into the NIS platform.  Outcomes & deadlines   WPK2.1 - D1 : Assisting MS in building capabilities on NCSS (workshops, Q1-Q4)   WPK 2.1 – D2 : White Paper – How to Evaluate a National Cyber Security Strategy (report, Q3  2014)   WPK2.1 - D3 :  Good practice guide on training methodologies, etc. for operational teams and  communities like CERTs (“Train the trainers handbook”) derived from experiences from  delivering suitable CERT training (Q4 2014)   WPK2.1 - D4 : Regular update of “Baseline capabilities” definition and status and conclusions  for new training material (Q4, 2014)   WPK2.1 - D5 : New set of CERT exercise material with at least five new scenarios from the four  areas of the “Baseline capabilities”, including the topic of processing of actionable operational  information (Q4 2014)   WPK2.1 - D6 : Stocktaking of achievements in the area of CERTs and a draft roadmap to plan  future work in this area, in close cooperation with the CERT community and the Member States  (Q4 2014)   WPK2.1 – D7 : Assisting MS in building capabilities on national PPPs (workshops, Q1-Q4)  Stakeholder impact  Member States will benefit from the experience of their peers through a process of collaboration  that will be established by the Agency. In addition, the report in this area will serve as a point of  reference for those Member States who choose to develop a strategy at a later date.  National/Governmental CERTs and other operational entities will benefit from training and  capability enhancement actions specially tailored for those communities.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 32  Member States will also develop capacity on national PPP. ENISA will help advanced Member  States to assess or improve existing policies, measures or actions through the co-operation and  information sharing with their peers.  In the area of CIIP and Resilience, ENISA will share knowledge and expertise with Member States  and the private sector on testing frameworks for ICS-SCADA systems or on minimum security  measures for Smart Grids or on how to develop governmental clouds.  Finally, through its expertise in the area of article 13 a and article 4, ENISA will be able to assist  NRAs with the proper implementation of incident reporting schemes at national level. This will  involve participating in workshops organised by NRAs at national level with ISPs and  Telecommunications organisations to better explain how article 13 a and article 4 can be  implemented.

ENISA will assist Member States in achieving this by providing assistance and  advice but will not become engaged in operational work.  Leverage the NIS Platform as a tool to enhance public private co-operation  From 2011-2013, the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) has covered a  number of key areas mostly in the areas of Internet, telecommunications infrastructure, cloud  computing and Smart Grids.  In 2014, ENISA will continue supporting the NIS platform, the successor of EP3R, with the goal of  engaging more targeted public and private stakeholders, especially experts from small industry  players. ENISA will support the working groups and their chairpersons (e.g. via the resilience portal,  conference calls), contribute to the outcomes of the working groups, and ensure its quality. The  Agency will keep the working groups informed about the latest developments in their respective  areas including deliverables done by the Agency (e.g. art. 13 a Working Group).  Through such interactions with the stakeholders ENISA will identify new topics in emerging areas  (e.g. mobile applications, eHealth, insurance or finance sector) and investigate ways to analyse  them in the future.  Provide advice and assistance to targeted stakeholder communities  In 2014, we will focus on the following areas:  Smart Grids: ENISA will promote to relevant stakeholders its existing work on “Minimum Security  Measures for Smart Grids” and will aim at aligning them with the work of CEN/CENELEC/ETSI  (M/490 SG-CG/SGIS Working Group), ERNCIP and other EU initiatives. These measures might be the  basis of a Commission Recommendation. ENISA will also work with relevant public and private  stakeholders to assess the challenges and requirements of national certification schemes for Smart  Grids, consult with them (e.g. SOGIS) and issue a white paper with practical recommendations on  the matter. In addition the Agency will take stock of existing initiatives on the certification of cyber  security skills of ICS-SCADA experts and issue practical recommendations to stakeholders for the  wide deployment of such schemes. Finally ENISA will analyse the area of proactive operational  preparedness measures for ICS-SCADA (e.g. intrusion detection, honeypots, etc.) and consult with  public and private stakeholders on the proper deployment of them.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 34  Electronic communications sector (ISPs and telecommunications companies):  ENISA, building on its  relevant work carried out in previous years, will develop one single, integrated set of minimum  security measures for electronic communications providers taking into consideration the  requirements of both article 13 a and article 4. This will enable providers to address security,  privacy and confidentiality issues in an integrated manner. The Agency will also take stock of  existing methodologies to identify critical assets and services of data communication networks. In  co-operation with ISPs and public stakeholders, ENISA will identify good practices, assess them and  develop guidelines on the identification of critical services, assets and links at national and cross  country levels. In addition ENISA will continue serving as advisor to the EU sponsored project on  botnets (ACDC41). The Agency will provide technical expertise on several issues related to botnets  (e.g. how to mitigate and response to cyber attacks, how to disinfect wide-scale and systematic  malware threats).  Cloud Computing: ENISA, in co-operation with public and private stakeholders, will develop and  agree on a set of Minimum Security Measures and adequate maturity levels for cloud computing  providers. Providers will then have a baseline of measures and maturity levels to use for improving  their security. The Agency will also continue its work in the area of critical clouds by analysing how  cloud computing can be securely used in specific critical sectors like ehealth, insurance and finance.  Finally the Agency, in consultation with public and private stakeholders, will take stock of existing  corporate, national, EU and international procurement guidelines for the secure deployment of  cloud computing and issue relevant recommedations in the form of a white paper.  Finance: ENISA will identify relevant experts from the financial sector to analyse the security and  resilience of inter-banking communications and transactions. The Agency, through a dedicated  expert group consisting of experts from public and private sector, will assess the challenges of  inter-banking communications and transactions, identify possible areas of improvement and issue  recommedations that will improve the security of such transactions.

These stakeholders are expected to reap  the following benefits:   Receive more targeted information on the security dimension in the use of ICTs;   Develop an increased knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best practice  sharing community;    Increase their level of  contact with stakeholders of similar profiles  Resources   20 kEuro   13,1 person months  Legal base & policy context   ENISA Regulation (New mandate September 2013)   ENISA Stakeholder Strategy   Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU   Council Resolution of 18 December 2009   Internal Security Strategy for the European Union  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 39  3.4 WS3 – Support cooperation  3.4.1 Overview  Justification  Various key policy documents identify the cooperation among stakeholder and stakeholder groups  as among the most important activities to enhance and strengthen NIS in the European single  market, and to ensure that Europe is placed among the key players in this field on an international  scale.  Cooperation is a necessary prerequisite for strengthening the capacities of Member States, EU  institutions and third countries. In particular:   The exchange of ideas, good practice and a common exploration of areas of NIS (generating of  new good practices in fields of upcoming technologies, respond to  new threats, etc.) will  enable EU Member States, the EU institutions and other players to improve services,  workflows, communication, etc  in order to prepare properly for emergency cases.   In times of large scale crises, previous collaboration and planning will help to ensure the right  mitigation mechanisms, enabling a response with a much lower cost both in time and resources  than would be possible without previous cooperation.  One very important element of this work is to build upon existing collaboration in already existing  communities, and to further enhance community building in Europe and beyond. Since the creation  of ENISA, the Agency has been building trust amongst these communities, bridging the gap  between the products and services offered in the market and their needs, continuously updating  the information provided to those implementing NIS policy. The secondary aim of this work stream  is to ensure that ENISA’s supporting role for these communities is maintained. One important  means of achieving this is the development of tools to facilitate and improve the international  communication and interchange of security relevant information within communities sharing the  same interest in different Member States.  Specific Policy Context  Specific policy references for this work stream are as follows:   ENISA Regulation article 3   Directive 2009/140/EC, Art. 13a   CIIP Action Plan 2009 and 2011   Digital Agenda 2010   Cybersecurity Strategy for the European Union   Council Resolution of 18 December 2009   Internal Security Strategy for the European Union  Overall Objectives   Support and enhance co-operation between CERTs, and with other communities.   Organise and manage the next Cyber Europe 2014   Support Member States and the Commission on the development of a sound European Cyber  Crisis Cooperation Framework, national contingency plans and national exercises   Continue ENISA’s work on article 13a (security breach notification) and article 4 (personal data  breach notification) and develop synergies between the two initiatives   Strengthen the cooperation with the newly established European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in  the areas where ENISA and EC3 are jointly involved   Support the implementation of the new Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 40   Analyse the requirements for incident reporting schemes in the areas of cloud computing and  smart grids. Identify and approach new communities and other groups who can contribute to  enhance NIS   Identify characteristics, needs, etc. of specific communities and other groups, and propose  good practice for common problems   Determine (scalable, accepted) methods for trust building among communities and other  groups   Facilitate the bringing together of communities and other groups face-to-face (mitigate  obstacles, finding ways to collaborate within constraints and contribute to trust building)   Identify actionable, complementary information for various communities   Identify obstacles (technical, legal, etc.) preventing the effective exchange of information  information   Identify suitable mechanisms for information gathering, processing and exchange (format,  channels, etc.)   Identify what types of information should be exchanged and who would be the  beneficiaries.  3.4.2 Work Packages  The following work packages constitute the Work Stream:   WPK 3.1:  Crisis cooperation – exercises. The objective of this work package is to prepare and  carry out the next Cyber Europe Exercise in 2014, in close collaboration with all relevant  stakeholders.   WPK 3.2:  Implementation of EU legislation. The objectives of this work package are on the one  hand the continuation of work in the area of Incident Reporting (Article 13a) by analysing the  received data. On the other hand it aims at preparing the reporting for Articles 4 of the  ePrivacy Directive and Article 15 of the COM proposal for the Regulation on eID and trusted  services.   WPK 3.3:  Regular cooperation among NIS communities. The objective of this work package is  to further enhance the cooperation between operational communities, mainly CERTs and Law  Enforcement Agencies. New potential target groups for ENISA deliverables (esp. training but  also other means) might be identified during that work with the initial communities.  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 41  3.4.3 WPK 3.1: Crisis cooperation – exercises  Desired Impact   At least 24 EU Member States and EFTA countries confirm their support for Cyber Europe 2014  (CE2014)   At least 80% of Member States that are in the process of establishing National Contingency  Plans by 2016 are supported by ENISA.   At least 24 Member States are familiar with the operational procedures during cyber crisis by  2016  Description of tasks  This work package focuses on the following topics:   Continuation of the work in the area of pan-European cyber exercises (Cyber Europe 2014)   Enhancement of the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises   Identification of good practices and improvement of operational procedures for cyber crisis  cooperation in Europe  Pan-European Cyber Exercises: Cyber Europe 2014  In 2014, ENISA will organise the third pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014).  This exercise will build on the experience gained in previous exercises and will take account of  previous recommendations. The exercise will be more ambitious than previous efforts, e.g.,  technical depth, scenarios, stakeholders involved, objectives, procedures to be tested, complexity  etc.  The exact setup and exercise plan will be agreed with the EU Member States and EFTA countries, in  line with the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. Each country will be represented in the Exercise Planners  group. This group will be responsible for the approval of the exercise setup and plan. The approach  that will be followed will be an “opt-in scheme” for the identification of stakeholders in the  countries which are interested to play in the exercise (e.g. policy level), allowing for the countries  who wish and have the appropriate resources to extend their national play. ENISA will not invite  additional third countries or stakeholder communities to participate in future EU cyber security  exercises without having first obtained the approval of ENISA’s Management Board.  Enhancing the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises  ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, trainings and technical capabilities on the  organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises. The Agency will continue  enhancing its capabilities for managing complex, distributed exercises, by building on previous  efforts in tools and methods and by facilitating strategic partnerships, such as the one with DG JRC.  For example, more structural links will be established with the European Cybercrime Centre and  the European Defence Agency.  EU-US Cybersecurity Exercise  ENISA will support COM and the Member States in planning, organising and executing a second EU- US cybersecurity exercise. The effort will be driven by the requirements set by the involved parties:  COM, EU MS and US. The exact planning, the timelines and the actual execution of the exercise will  be decided by a group of exercise planners composed by representatives from the involved parties.  The exercise report summarising the key results and learning points will be verified with all  involved parties before publication.  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises activities overview  ENISA will continue to support MS in the maintainance and training of operational procedures for  cyber crisis cooperation. This and the activities described above including key findings in the area of  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 42  Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises (C3E) will be summarised in an report at the end of 2014.  This report will help ENISA to reach out to other communities/sectors with lessons learnt from  supporting exercises (achieving broader impact).

The  Agency, in co-operation with experts from NRAs and private sector, will analyse the reports,  compare them with previous years, identify good practices and lessons learnt and where needed  make recommendations to NRAs and private sector to mitigate these threats in the future.  ENISA will continue its efforts to bring NRAs and DPAs together to agree on a harmonised  implementation of the security and data breach articles (art. 13 a and art. 4). In that respect the  Agency will assess the two incident reporting schemes (article 13 a and article 4), identify common  elements (e.g. parameters and thresholds) and propose to NRAs and DPAs the most harmonised  and cost efficient way of implementing the two articles avoiding at the same time potential  overlaps.  Support the implementation of the new regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services  The European Commission adopted on June 4th 2012 a proposal for a Regulation44 on electronic  identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market that will  replace the existing Directive 1999/93/EC45  on a community framework for electronic signatures.  ENISA has already contributed to this area by providing recommendations on the reporting of  security breaches by the trust service providers to the competent bodies started to address the  implementation of security risk assessment by trust service providers and related security  measures.  44  Proposal for a Regulation \"on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal  market\": http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML  45  Directive 1999/93/EC on a community framework for electronic signatures was the legal recognition of electronic  signatures: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0238:FIN:EN:HTML http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 44  In 2014, ENISA will continue its efforts on this incident reporting scheme as well as on the  implementation of relavant security measures. More specifically, the Agency will identify and bring  together the competent regulatory bodies of the Member States and debate with them on the  proper implementation scheme of article 15. ENISA will use this group to properly define the scope  of incident reporting, the parameters and thresholds as well as the affected services. The Agency  will exploit all possible implementation and conceptual synergies with article 13a and article 4.  Support for the implementation of the NIS Directive  Subject to the approval of the NIS Directive, ENISA will assist the Commission and Member States in  its implementation. The Agency could provide technical assistance on the requirements of the  trusted information platform and the rules for sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities. In  addition the Agency could assist the Commission in defining the affected sectors and the relevant  stakeholders in each one of them. Finally the Agency, building on its experience with article 13 a  and 4, can work with public stakeholders to define the incident reporting modalities for each  sector, (the affected services, the parameters and thresholds, the reporting scheme and template,  the rooting causes, and the scope of the analysis).  Outcomes & deadlines   WPK 3.2-D1 - Analysis of Annual 2013 Incident Reports and Recommendations on addressing  significant incidents (report, Q2/3 2014)   WPK 3.2-D2 – Guidelines on Incident Reporting Scheme for Article 15 (report, Q4 2014)   WPK 3.2–D3 - Support the implementation of the NIS Directive (workshops, Q2-Q4)  Stakeholder impact  Telecommunications Sector   NRAs, DPAs and the EDPS will have practical references and technical guidelines to implement  the legislation.   Within the area of Article 13a, the industry, NRAs and the European Commission will be able to  develop a better understanding of the significant incidents at European level as well as a  comparison with earlier years and recommendations, which will support mitigation decisions  and actions.   EU Commission (DG CONNECT, HOME and JUSTICE) will achieve harmonization of incident  reporting, breach notifications and security measures, following international standards and  can in this way forego further detailing of the legislative text.   Industry (network providers, ISPs, cloud providers, etc.) will be able to adopt a single  framework of incident reporting/breach notification and security measures, so there is a level  playing field across the EU countries and no complications for working cross borders.  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services   NRAs and DPAs will be able to implement an efficient reporting scheme very similar to the  Article 13a scheme currently in place, and in this way lay the basis for a coherent and holistic  picture of security incidents across key service providers.   A single reporting scheme will allow trust service providers to more easily operate across  borders, effectively paving the road for a single market of trust service providers across the EU.  In turn this facilitates cross border online services, such as eCommerce and eGovernment.

For  that reason, effective cooperation between communities at all levels is required to facilitate the  exchange of the information and knowledge needed to reduce vulnerability and provide effective  responses to cyber incidents. This includes CERTs within particular business sectors which might be  affected by large-scale incidents, other incident responders within a country serving other  communities, national / governmental CERTs, law enforcement agents and internationally  recognised research and development organisations.  Specific tasks to be included under this area are given below:   Actively support or (when appropriate) organise common trainings including communities  such as CERTs and LEA (for example support exercises organised by the Financial ISAC (FI-ISAC)  initiative)   Engage with the European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), where appropriate, through formal and  informal cooperation channels, to leverage synergies while respecting the respective  mandates.   Take stock of existing communities up to date to cyber security challenges that could be  beneficial for the work of CERTs (like for example in the area of ICS)   Facilitate the outreach (when appropriate) to those other bodies and/or communities with  similar tasks (and broaden the focus more, to reach out to new communities as well), including  taking stock of scalable and accepted methods for trustbuilding within and among  communities   Continue collecting good practice useful for CERTs and LEAs, and further enhance the ENISA  exercise and training material.

Management Board, Executive Board & PSG Secretariat 4.1  This covers all activities that are required to support ENISA’s formal bodies, the Management Board  (MB) and the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG) as well as Executive Board in their functions.  For the MB, ordinary meeting will be organised during 2014 and informal meetings will be held, one  with the PSG, if appropriate. The existing electronic newsletter will be continued throughout 2014, as  will support for the MB Portal.  For the PSG also, two formal meetings will be organised.  For the Executive Board, formal meetings will be organised during 2014.  ENISA will continue to explore additional ways of supporting the Agency’s statutory bodies in the  most effective way, including the possible use of new technologies and modifications to existing  processes as required.  In order to make the most of its stakeholder community and also to ensure that it server the latter as  effectively as possible, ENISA will aim to involve stakeholders in concrete activities wherever  possible.  National Liaison Officer Network 4.2  In 2014, the Agency shall continue to strengthen its relations with the National Liaison Officers’ (NLO)  Network. The NLO-Network is an informal network of all Member States, including Iceland,  Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as the Commission and Council. They are key actors for the  Agency’s daily work and interaction, in terms of outreach, effective liaison in the Member States and  dissemination.  The National Contact Officers (NCO) is an extension of the National Liaison Officers (NLO), which  means that the NLO-Network is extended with contact points from governmental CERTs and  Regulatory Bodies/Agencies.  ENISA envisages ad hoc meetings with National Contact Officers on particular topics of interest and is  planning to host a minimum of 1 meeting with representatives of this network in 2014.  As a result of the NLO meeting in February 2013 and in effort to optimise resources   ENISA will regularly send information to the members of the NLO network containing  information on upcoming ENISA project related tenders, vacancy notices, and events  organised by ENISA or where the Agency contributes to (for example co-organiser, etc.).   In particular, we will continue the practice of sending, emails with relevant announcements  (time - critical) and information such as upcoming vacancy notices, new launch for tenders,  etc.An assessment of the NLO section page under the ENISA home page is being carried out  in a an effort to revise this tool of communication between the Agency and the NLOs. In this  respect the Agency is assessing possible improvements as well as gaps that can be filled  either by the ENISA home page or other tools such as the newsletter, social networks, etc.   Following the relevant discussions made in the context of the NLO meeting of February 2013  ENISA has actively collaborated with the NLOs in the implementation of its WP activites for  2013 (for example in the area of trust marks). Such collaborations will be extended in 2014  starting with the NLO meeting of Q1 2014.  EU Relations 4.3  The Agency will continue to develop and enhance relations with EU Institutions and Bodies. In  particular, ENISA will seek to ensure that other European institutions and bodies are aware of the  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 53  work that the Agency is carrying out and are liaising with the Agency in the most effective way. To  this end, ENISA will establish an office in Brussels in order to support its stakeholder activities with  the EU institutions and industry representation groups that are based in Brussels.  ENISA will undertake the analysis and review of EU policy acts when requested to do so and on its  own initiative when this is in the interest of its stakeholders.  Developing and maintaining a network of key actors, advocacy and regular interaction with ENISA’s  relevant stakeholders in the EU Institutions is highly important in order to  raise the Agency’s profile  as such and, finally, to ‘enhance the levels of security in Europe’. ENISA will therefore continue to  maintain visibility in debates relating to NIS by participating in high-level events.  Finally, ENISA shall provide advice and assistance, as stated in its founding regulation, to the EU  Institutions regarding relevant NIS policy issues.  Corporate Communication 4.4  A major element of ENISA’s mission is about communicating its work to the wide range of individuals  and groups who play a role in network and information security across Europe. In its widest sense,  ENISA’s corporate communication activity is about how the Agency creates understanding of and  support for the Agency’s work among these audiences. In 2014, the focus will be on working at all  levels to help ensure that ENISA’s work reaches the right audiences and has a real impact in making  Europe’s information society even more secure.  ENISA’s media relations programme continues to create opportunities for the agency to extend its  reach to communicate with wider audiences than it could reach independently.  A programme of  targeted press conferences is also planned for 2014, focusing on media in particular geographical  locations, or with a particular interest in specific NIS areas.  The Agency will continue to develop dynamic infographics for its web site, and use in presentations.  Along with YouTube, other Social Media, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook will continue to play  a prominent role in how ENISA engages with its audiences. Experience from 2012 (when ENISA  launch its Social Media presence) and 2013 has shown that the Agency’s typical “followers” are NIS  opinion formers and professional, making them a highly valuable and influential audience. Finally,  the Agency will again produce a number of \"Flash Notes\" during the year, highlighting key NIS issues  in a fast and effective medium.  Dissemination activities 4.5  ENISA continues to regard dissemination activities as a key part of its efforts to communicate  effectively with its stakeholder communities. As part of this effort, ENISA will, throughout 2014 be  producing informative, tightly focused video clips, plus podcasts and interviews, all available through  the Agency’s web site, and other media, such as YouTube. These will be produced in addition to the  more classic corporate video productions, on wider themes.  Quality Control 4.6  In 2011, the Executive Director, launched the quality management system of the Agency. In 2014,  the Agency plans to continue documenting, implementing and maintaining a quality management  system in order to improve its effectiveness.  In 2014 the Agency will re-engineer selected operational processes, align organisational  requirements with actual implementation in information management and seek process  improvements across the board.  Efforts will be made to measure the performance of recently  designed processes for the purpose of proposing suitable adjustments. A set of tools such as  electronic signatures, electronic workflows and enterprise management tools will be gradually  integrated as necessary to further improve productivity.  54  Summary of Horizontal Operational Activities 4.7  Horizontal Operational Activities  SR Stakeholder Relations Budget  Person  months FTE  SR1 MB & PSG Secretariat 220.000 9,6 1,0  SR2 National Liaison Officers Network 40.000 4,8 0,5  SR3 EU Relations 0 4,8 0,5  Total SR 260.000 19,2 2,0  CC Corporate Communication Budget  Person  months FTE  CC1 Corporate Communication 50.000 19,2 2,0  Total CC 50.000 19,2 2,0  PS Project Support Activities Budget  Person  months FTE  PS1 Dissemination Activities 40.000 9,6 1,0  PS2 Quality control 0 9,6 1,0  Total PS 40.000 19,2 2,0  Total Horizontal Operational Activities 350.000 57,6 6,0  [Work Programme 2014] November 29, 2013 55  5 Administration and Support Department, Directorate and General  Management activities  5.1 Overview  The Directorate consists of the Executive Director and his personal assistant.

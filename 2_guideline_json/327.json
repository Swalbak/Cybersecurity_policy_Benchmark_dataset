The increase in  the complexity of web application and their widespread services creates  challenges in securing them against threats with diverse motivations  from financial or reputational damage to the theft of critical or personal  information.1 Web services and applications depend mostly on databases  to store or deliver the required information. SQL Injection (SQLi) type of  attacks are a well-known example and the most common threats against  to such services. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are another example.  In this type of attack, the malicious actor misuses weaknesses in forms or  other input functionalities of web applications that leads to other  malicious features such as being redirected to a malicious website.2  While organisations are becoming proficient and developing more  consistent automation in their web application lifecycle, they are  demanding security as the most crucial part of their offering and  prioritisation. This introduction of complex environments drives the  adoption of new services such as Application Programming Interfaces  (APIs). APIs, which create new challenges for web application security the  organisations involved to consider more prevention and detection  measures. For instance, roughly 80% of organisations adopting APIs  deployed controls on their ingress traffic.3 In this section, we review the  threat landscape of web applications during 2019.  2  3  __Trends  20%_of companies and organisations reported  DDoS attacks on their application services on a daily  basis5  Buffer overflow was the most common technique used (24%).  HTTP flood (23%), resource reduction (23%), HTTPS flood (21%)  and Low Slow 21% were other commonly used techniques.  63%_of respondents to CyberEdge survey are  using a web application firewall (WAF) 27,5% have plans to deploy this technology and 9,5% do not have  any such plans.15  52%_increase in the number of web application  attacks in 2019 compared with 2018 According to a security researcher, the amount of web application  attacks were almost flat compared with 2018 and rose sharply  later in the year.4  84%_of observed vulnerabilities in web  applications were security misconfigurations This was followed by cross-site scripting (53%) and broken  authentication interestingly (45%).9  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Web application  attacks  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Description  According to the survey conducted by a security researcher5, one of the  factors contributing to such ineffective security could be the decision-  making about ownership of security tools. The survey presented the views  of top influencers in this area naming IT leadership and business owners  and not the chief information security officer (CISO).  _Improved collaboration between  application security and application  development  _Growing importance of Application  Programming Interfaces (APIs) APIs are not new in web application architecture, and their widely  accepted usage reintroduces existing risks and their likelihood of  exploitation as a result of the widening of the threat landscape.  Accordingly, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) published  a top 10 list of API security measures 6 providing a prioritised way to  secure such capability in web application architecture. One instance of  such a threat is the PHP API attacks: according to another security  researcher, 87% of the scanning of API traffic was searching for available  PHP APIs.7  _Authorisation and authentication  failures  These are usually the leading cause of malicious actors gaining access to  critical information (i.e. fast retailing breach8). According to a security  researcher, the breaches of critical data are the second most pressing  threat to web application security.9  7  A recent security research identified that, two-thirds of web application  attacks include SQLi attacks. While other web application attack vectors  either remained steady or are growing, SQLi attacks continued to grow  sharply, and particularly specially escalated during the holiday season of  2019.11 The findings from this research also identified that the finance  industry faces more local file inclusion (LFi) attacks compared with other  sectors.12  _Growing trend with SQL injection (SQLi)  Figure 1: Reduction on the number of files cleaned per compromised site.

Established in 2004 and strengthened by the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT  products, services and processes with cybersecurity certification schemes,  cooperates with Member States and EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare  for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge sharing,  capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with  its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to  boost resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep  Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

Established in 2004 and strengthened by the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT  products, services and processes with cybersecurity certification schemes,  cooperates with Member States and EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare  for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge sharing,  capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with  its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to  boost resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep  Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

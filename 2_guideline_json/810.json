Governments across the world recognize that digital  transformation has the power to further the prosperity and wellbeing of their  citizens. In supporting this transformation, they also recognize that cybersecurity  must be an integral and indivisible part of technological progress.  In 2016, nearly one percent of all emails sent were essentially malicious attacks,  the highest rate in recent years. Ransomware attacks increasingly affected  businesses and consumers, with indiscriminate campaigns pushing out massive  volumes of malicious emails. Attackers are demanding more and more from  victims, with the average ransom demand rising to over 1,000 USD in 2016,  up from approximately 300 USD a year earlier. In May 2017, a massive cyberattack caused major  disruptions to companies and hospitals in over 150 countries, prompting a call for greater cooperation  around the world.  First launched in 2014, the goal of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is to help foster a global culture  of cybersecurity and its integration at the core of ICTs. This second iteration of the GCI measures the  commitment of ITU Member States towards cybersecurity in order to drive further efforts in the  adoption and integration of cybersecurity on a global scale.  The GCI reaffirms ITU’s commitment to build confidence and security in the use of ICTs. This report  on the second iteration of the GCI continues to show the cybersecurity commitment of ITU Member  States around the world, and I am pleased to note that the overall picture shows improvement and  strengthening of the global cybersecurity agenda.  I wish to thank Member States for their contribution to this effort.  The collection of information for the GCI is an ongoing process, and I therefore invite all ITU Member  States to continue sending and updating information on their cybersecurity efforts so that we can  effectively share experiences, views and solutions in order to make the digital world a more secure  and safe environment for all citizens.  Brahima Sanou  Director, Telecommunication Development Bureau  Foreword  v  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is a survey that measures the commitment of Member States  to cybersecurity in order to raise awareness.  The GCI revolves around the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA) and its five pillars (legal, technical,  organizational, capacity building and cooperation). For each of these pillars, questions were developed  to assess commitment. Through consultation with a group of experts, these questions were weighted  in order to arrive at an overall GCI score. The survey was administered through an online platform  through which supporting evidence was also collected.  One-hundred and thirty-four Member States responded to the survey throughout 2016. Member  States who did not respond were invited to validate responses determined from open-source research.  As such, the GCI results reported herein cover all 193 ITU Member States.  The 2017 publication of the GCI continues to show the commitment to cybersecurity of countries  around the world. The overall picture shows improvement and strengthening of all five elements  of the cybersecurity agenda in various countries in all regions. However, there is space for further  improvement in cooperation at all levels, capacity building and organizational measures. As well, the  gap in the level of cybersecurity engagement between different regions is still present and visible. The  level of development of the different pillars varies from country to country in the regions, and while  commitment in Europe remains very high in the legal and technical fields in particular, the challenging  situation in the Africa and Americas regions shows the need for continued engagement and support.  In addition to providing the GCI score, this report also provides a set of illustrative practices that give  insight into the achievements of certain countries.

In 2016, almost half the world used the Internet (3.5 billion users)1 and  according to one estimate, there will be over 12 billion machine-to-machine devices connected to  the Internet by 20202. Yet, just as in the real world, the cyber world is exposed to a variety of security  threats that can cause immense damage.  Statistics on threats to computer networks are sobering and reflect a shift from the relatively innocuous  spam of yesteryear to threats that are more malicious. A security company tracking incidents in 2016  found that malicious emails became a weapon of choice for a wide range of cyberattacks during the  year used by everyone from state sponsored cyber espionage groups to mass-mailing ransomware  gangs. One-in-131 emails sent were malicious, the highest rate in five years.  Ransomware continues to plague businesses and consumers, with indiscriminate campaigns pushing  out massive volumes of malicious emails. In some cases, organizations can be overwhelmed by the  sheer volume of ransomware-laden emails they receive. Attackers are demanding more and more  from victims with the average ransom demand in 2016 rising to USD 1 077, up from USD 294 a year  earlier3. The scale of cybercrime makes it critical for governments to have a robust cybersecurity  ecosystem in place to reduce threats and enhance confidence in using electronic communications  and services.  It is therefore clear that there is a direct cause-effect principle between the growth of ICTs and their  illicit and malicious use. To counter this effect, cybersecurity is becoming more and more relevant in  the minds of countries’ decision makers, and cybersecurity related doctrines have been established  in almost all countries in the world.  However, there is still an evident gap between countries in terms of awareness, understanding,  knowledge and finally capacity to deploy the proper strategies, capabilities and programmes to ensure  a safe and appropriate use of ICTs as enablers for economic development.  In this context, ITU, together with international partners from private-public and private sector as well  as academia, has established the GCI with the key objective of building capacity at the national, regional  and international level, through assessing the level of engagement of countries on cybersecurity, and,  with the data gathered, producing a list of good practices that can be used by countries in need.  1 www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Statistics/ Pages/ stat/ default. aspx 2 www. cisco. com/ c/ en/ us/ solutions/ collateral/ service- provider/ visual- networking- index- vni/ vni- hyperconnectivity- wp.  html 3 www. symantec. com  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  3  2 GCI Scope and Framework  2.1 Background  The GCI is included under Resolution 130 (Rev. Busan, 2014) on strengthening the role of ITU in  building confidence and security in the use of ICT. Specifically, Member States are invited “to support  ITU initiatives on cybersecurity, including the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), in order to promote  government strategies and the sharing of information on efforts across industries and sectors”.  A first iteration of the GCI was conducted in 2013-2014 in partnership with ABI Research1, and the  final results have been published2.  Following feedback received from various communities, a second iteration of the GCI was planned  and undertaken. This new version was formulated around an extended participation from Member  States, experts and industry stakeholders as contributing partners (namely World Bank and Red Team  Cyber as new GCI partners joining the Australia Strategic Policy Institute, FIRST, Indiana University,  INTERPOL, ITU-Arab Regional Cybersecurity Centre in Oman, Korea Internet & Security Agency, NTRA  Egypt, The Potomac Institute of Policy Studies, UNICRI, University of Technology Jamaica and UNODC)  who all provided support with the provision of secondary data, response activation, statistical analysis,  qualitative appreciation amongst other.  The data collected via GCI 2017 for ITU-D Study Group 2 Question 3 (SG2Q3) surveys have been  analysed by the Rapporteur and co-Rapporteur for inclusion in the SG2Q3 final report. GCI partners  have been active in providing expertise and secondary data as appropriate, while the UN office of ICT  (New York) has also initiated collaborative work. ITU is also working in a multi-stakeholder collaboration  led by the World Bank to elaborate a toolkit on “Best practice in Policy/Legal enabling Framework and  Capacity Building in Combatting Cybercrime”. ITU is providing support on the component on capacity  building from a cybersecurity perspective based on GCI 2017 data.  An enhanced reference model was thereby devised. Throughout the steps of this new version,  Member States were consulted using various vehicles including ITU-D Study Group 2 Question 3/2,  where the overall project was submitted, discussed and validated.  2.2 Reference model  The GCI is a composite index combining 25 indicators into one benchmark measure to monitor and  compare the level of ITU Member States cybersecurity commitment with regard to the five pillars  identified by the High-Level Experts Group and endorsed by the GCA. These pillars form the five  pillars of GCI.  The main objectives of the GCI are to measure:  • the type, level and evolution over time of cybersecurity commitment in countries and relative  to other countries;  • the progress in cybersecurity commitment of all countries from a global perspective;  • the progress in cybersecurity commitment from a regional perspective;  • the cybersecurity commitment divide, i.e. the difference between countries in terms of their  level of engagement in cybersecurity programmes and initiatives.  1 https:// www. abiresearch. com/  2 http:// www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Cybersecurity/ Pages/ GCI- 2014. aspx  https://www.abiresearch.com/ http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/GCI-2014.aspx  4  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  The objective of the GCI as an initiative is to help countries identify areas for improvement in the field  of cybersecurity, as well as to motivate them to take action to improve their ranking, thus helping  raise the overall level of commitment to cybersecurity worldwide.  Through the information collected, the GCI aims to illustrate the practices of other countries so that  Member States can implement selected aspects suitable to their national environment, with the added  benefits of helping harmonize practices and fostering, a global culture of cybersecurity.  2.3 Conceptual framework  The five pillars of the GCI are briefly explained below:  1. Legal: Measured based on the existence of legal institutions and frameworks dealing with  cybersecurity and cybercrime.  2. Technical: Measured based on the existence of technical institutions and frameworks dealing  with cybersecurity.  3. Organizational: Measured based on the existence of policy coordination institutions and  strategies for cybersecurity development at the national level.  4. Capacity Building: Measured based on the existence of research and development, education  and training programmes; certified professionals and public sector agencies fostering capacity  building.  5. Cooperation: Measured based on the existence of partnerships, cooperative frameworks and  information sharing networks.  5  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Each pillar was then further divided in sub-pillars (Figure 2.3.1).  Figure 2.3.1: GCI pillars and sub-pillars  The questionnaire was elaborated on the basis of these sub-pillars 3. The values for the 25 indicators  were therefore constructed through 157 binary questions. This was done in order to achieve the  required level of granularity and ensure accuracy and quality on the answers.  3 http:// www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Cybersecurity/ Documents/ QuestionnaireGuide- E. pdf  http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/QuestionnaireGuide-E.pdf  6  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 2.3.2 below represents all the five pillars from GCA with their indicators.

The indicators used to calculate the GCI were  selected on the basis of the following criteria:  • relevance to the five GCA pillars and in contributing towards the main GCI objectives and  conceptual framework;  • data availability and quality;  • possibility of cross verification through secondary data.  The whole concept of a new iteration of the GCI is based on a cybersecurity development tree map  and binary answer possibilities.  The tree map concept, which is illustrated in Figures 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, is an example of different possible  paths that might be taken by countries in order to enhance their cybersecurity commitment.  Each of the five pillars are associated with a specific colour. The deeper the path taken, indicating a  more developed level of commitment, the deeper the colour depicting it becomes.  The various levels of cybersecurity development among countries, as well as the different cybersecurity  needs reflected by a country’s overall ICT development status, were taken into consideration. The  concept is based on the assumption that the more developed cybersecurity is, the more complex the  solutions observed will be. Therefore, the further a country goes along the tree map by confirming  the presence of pre-identified cyber solutions, the more complex and sophisticated the cybersecurity  commitment is within that country, allowing it to obtain a higher score with the GCI.  The rationale behind using binary answer possibilities is the elimination of opinion-based evaluation  and of any possible bias towards certain types of answers.  Moreover, the simple binary concept will allow quicker and more complex evaluation as it will not  require lengthy answers from countries. This, in turn, is assumed to accelerate and streamline the  process of providing answers and further evaluation. The idea is that the respondent will only confirm  the presence or lack of certain pre-identified cybersecurity solutions. An online survey mechanism,  which was used for gathering answers and uploading all relevant materials, enabled the extraction  of good practices.  The key difference in methodology between GCI 2014 and GCI Version 2017 is the use of a binary  system instead of a three-level system. The binary system evaluates the existence or absence of a  specific activity, department or measure. Unlike GCI Version 2014, it does not take 'partial' measures  into consideration. The facility for respondents to upload supporting documents and URLs is a way  of providing more information to substantiate the binary response. Furthermore, a number of new  questions have been added in each of the five pillars in order to refine the depth of research.  The GCI 2014 and GCI 2017 are not directly comparable due to a change in methodology. While the 2014  index used a simple average methodology, the 2017 index employs a weighting factor for each pillar.  The questionnaire, made available through an online survey from January to September 2016, was  administered to the 193 ITU Member States (plus State of Palestine) in the regions of Africa, Americas,  Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Europe. 134 countries  responded to the online survey while 59 countries did not provide primary data.  10  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Table 3.1: Numbers of responses received from all Members States regionally  Region Africa Americas Arab States Asia and the  Pacific CIS Europe Global  Responses 29 23 16 25 7 34 134  Non-responses 15 12 5 13 5 9 59  Total of  participants  44 35 21 38 12 43 193  The data collection process was implemented as follows:  1. A Letter of Invitation was sent by the ITU Secretariat to all Member States, informing them on  the initiative and requesting the identification of a country level GCI focal point with whom ITU  could liaise and who would be responsible for collecting all relevant data for completing the  online GCI questionnaire. A guideline to the online questionnaire which provided explanations  and examples for each question, was attached to the letter 1.  2. Primary data collection (for countries who responded to the questionnaire):  • Verification of the responses received by the specific Member State to identify possible  missing elements (no or missing responses, no or missing supporting documents, no or  missing links, etc.).  – For instance, if a Member State answered “No”, ITU researched to prove that they do  not have any documents in the ITU database or online.  – If a Member State answered “Yes”, ITU researched to verify that answers provided were  correct and corresponded to the question.  • The focal point identified by the concerned Member State was contacted and provided  with indications on how to improve the accuracy of the responses. Where necessary ITU  provided comments and guidance to improve the completed questionnaire.  • After the necessary rounds of iterations, the pre-final questionnaire was sent back to the  concerned Member State for final approval.  • Once formal approval was received, the questionnaire was considered validated and used  for the analysis, scoring and ranking.  3. Secondary data collection (for countries that did not respond to the questionnaire):  • ITU elaborated an initial draft of the response to the questionnaire using publicly available  data and online research.  • The draft was then sent to the concerned Member State for review.  • The reviewed response received, the focal point identified by the concerned Member  State was contacted and provided with indications on how to improve the accuracy of  the responses. Where necessary ITU provided comments and guidance to improve the  completed questionnaire.  • After the necessary rounds of iterations, the pre-final questionnaire was sent back to the  concerned Member State for final approval.  1 http:// www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Cybersecurity/ Documents/ QuestionnaireGuide- E. pdf  11  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  • Once formal approval was received, the questionnaire was considered validated and used  for the analysis, scoring and ranking.  The GCI 2017 methodology encompassed the use of a panel of experts, identified according to their  specific expertise on the subject, who acted in their personal capacity in order to provide an expert  view on the weighting to be used for the scoring.  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  13  4 Key Findings  4.1  Heat Map of National Cybersecurity Commitments  Out of the 193 Member States, there is a huge range in cybersecurity commitments, as the heat map  below illustrates.  Level of commitment: from Green (highest) to Red (lowest)  Figure 4.1.1: GCI Heat Map  4.2 GCI Groups  Member States were classified into three categories by their GCI score (Figure 4.2.1).  • Initiating stage refers to the 96 countries (i.e., GCI score less than the 50th percentile) that have  started to make commitments in cybersecurity.  • Maturing stage refers to the 77 countries (i.e., GCI score between the 50th and 89th percentile)  that have developed complex commitments, and engage in cybersecurity programmes and  initiatives.  • Leading stage refers to the 21 countries (i.e., GCI score in the 90th percentile) that demonstrate  high commitment in all five pillars of the index.  14  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 4.2.1: GCI Tiers  INITIATING  Afghanistan  Andorra  Angola  Antigua and Barbuda  Armenia  Bahamas  Barbados  Belize  Benin  Bhutan  Bolivia (Plurinational State of)  Bosnia & Herzegovina  Burkina Faso  Burundi  Cambodia  Cape Verde  Central African Republic.

There are three  from Asia and the Pacific, two each from Europe and the Americas, and one from Africa, the Arab  States, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.  This suggests that being highly committed is not strictly tied to geographic location.

This gap exists between  and within regions.  Further, cybersecurity related commitments are often unequally distributed with countries performing  well in some pillars and less so in others. Cybersecurity is an ecosystem where laws, organizations,  skills, cooperation and technical implementation need to be in harmony to be most effective.  Additionally, cybersecurity is not just a concern of the government but also needs commitment from  the private sector and consumers. Thus, it is important to develop a cybersecurity culture where  citizens are aware of the trade-off between risks and monitoring when using electronic networks.  5.1  Noteworthy figures  The GCI consists of 25 different indicators. Some relate to precise commitments that help to concretize  the status of specific cybersecurity activities throughout the world.  One of the strongest commitments is to outline a cybersecurity strategy describing how the country  will prepare and respond to attacks against its digital networks. Only 38% countries have a published  cybersecurity strategy and only 11% have a dedicated standalone strategy (Figure 5.1.1, left); another  12% have a cybersecurity strategy under development.  More effort is needed in this critical area, particularly since it conveys that the government considers  digital risks high priority. In the area of training, efforts need to be enhanced particularly for those  who are most likely going to legally handle cybersecurity crimes given that less than half the Member  States (43%) have capacity-building programmes for law enforcement and the judicial system (Figure  5.1.1, right).  18  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.1.1: Cybersecurity strategy and training commitments  Despite half of the Member States not having a cybersecurity strategy, 61% do have an emergency  response team (i.e., CIRT, CSRIT, and CERT) with national responsibility (Figure 5.1.2, left). However,  just over a fifth (21%) publish metrics on cybersecurity incidents (Figure 5.1.2, right). This makes it  difficult in most countries to objectively assess incidents based on the evidence and determine if  protection measures are working.  Figure 5.1.2: Computer emergency response teams and metrics  Just less than a third of countries (32%) replied affirmatively to the existence of a homegrown  cybersecurity industry (Figure 5.1.3, left). More efforts need to be devoted to this area as a local  industry will have knowledge of national circumstances and make the security ecosystem more  sustainable. The potential for global cooperation is heightened by participation in international  cybersecurity events. This is almost universal with 95% of countries replying affirmatively (Figure  5.1.3, right).  19  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.1.3: Home-grown industry and international participation  5.2 Comparing GCI with other indices  A qualitative comparison has been performed to raise awareness on the importance of investing on  cybersecurity, as an integral component of any national ICT for development strategy.  This paragraph is not intended to provide thorough, exhaustive statistical analysis, but rather an  indication on how cybersecurity can relate to existing national processes, in order to emphasize the  importance of investing and being committed.  Comparing GCI scores to notable ICT for Development Indices does not reveal an especially close  relationship as experience shows that countries which score high in term of ICT for Development do  not necessarily invest in cybersecurity with the same level of commitment, and vice versa.  For example, comparing the GCI with the ITU ICT for Development Index (IDI), shows that some  countries are performing much better in the GCI than their level of ICT development would suggest.  The following figures show the relation between the GCI and IDI with each graph identifying the top  three countries for each region.  20  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.1: Global comparison GCI and IDI  Figure 5.2.2: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Africa region  21  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.3: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Americas region  Figure 5.2.4: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Arab States  22  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.5: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Asia and the Pacific region  Figure 5.2.6: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Commonwealth of Independent States  23  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.7: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Europe region  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  25  6 Regional Outlook During the active data collection phase of the GCI 2017 exercise, there was a varied response from  countries in the ITU regions:  • Out of the 44 Member States in the Africa region, 29 responded to the survey.  • Out of 35 Member States in the Americas region, 23 responded to the survey  • Out of 21 Member States in the Arab States region, 17 including the State of Palestine responded  to the survey.  • Out of 38 Member States in the Asia and the Pacific region, 25 responded to the survey  • Out of the 12 Member States in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, 7 responded  to the survey  • Out of 43 Member States in the Europe region, 34 responded to the survey.  Figure 6.1 illustrates the average GCI score for all countries in a particular region for the respective  pillar. Scores that fall below the 33rd percentile have a red background, scores that are between the  33rd to 65th percentiles have a yellow background and scores that lie above the 65th percentile have  a green background. There is scope for improvement since most regions have an average score for  the different pillars (i.e., lying between 33rd and 65th percentiles).  The exception is Europe, where average scores are high across all pillars. The Africa region averages low  scores for the organizational pillar while the Commonwealth of Independent States region averages  a high score for the legal pillar.  The following sub-sections show the findings for each individual ITU region, highlighting the results and  findings for the three top-scoring countries in each region. As well, a “regional scorecard” summarizes  the countries’ level of commitment to every pillar and sub-pillars (green for high, yellow for medium,  and red for low).  Figure 6.1: Average pillar scores by region  26  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  6.1 Africa  Table 6.1.1: Top three ranked countries in Africa  Country GCI  Score Legal Technical Organizational Capacity  Building Cooperation  Mauritius 0.83 0.85 0.96 0.74 0.91 0.7  Rwanda 0.6 0.6 0.71 0.79 0.66 0.28  Kenya 0.57 0.75 0.73 0.36 0.41 0.6  Mauritius is the top ranked country in the Africa region. It scores particularly high in  the legal and the technical areas. The Botnet Tracking and Detection project allows  Computer Emergency Response Team of Mauritius (CERT-MU) to proactively take  measures to curtail threats on different networks within the country. Capacity building  is another area where Mauritius does well. The government IT Security Unit has  conducted 180 awareness sessions for some 2 000 civil servants in 32 government ministries and  departments.  Rwanda, ranked second in Africa, scores high in the organizational pillar and has a  standalone cybersecurity policy addressing both the public and private sector1. It is  also committed to develop a stronger cybersecurity industry to ensure a resilient  cyber space.  Kenya, ranked third in the region, provides a good example of cooperation through its  National Kenya Computer Incident Response Team Coordination Centre (National KE- CIRT/CC)2. The CIRT coordinates at national, regional and global levels with a range of  actors. Nationally this includes ISPs and the financial and educational sectors; regionally  it works with other CIRTs through the East African Communications Organization; and  internationally it liaises with ITU, FIRST, and bi-laterally with the United States and Japan CIRTs among  others.

The United States of America has the highest scores for the legal and capacity  building pillars. One notable aspect of both capacity building and cooperation in  the country is the initiatives to coordinate cybersecurity among all states. To that  end, the National Governor's Association established the Resource Center for State  Cybersecurity, which offers best practices, tools and guidelines 3.  Canada ranks second in the region with its highest score in the legal pillar. The  country's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)  features several sections relating to cybersecurity4. It requires organizations to notify  privacy authorities in the event of privacy breaches that could cause significant damage  with penalties for those who fail to report them.  Mexico is third and some 16 points behind Canada, illustrating the cybersecurity divide  in the region. Like the other top ranked countries in the region, it scores best in the  legal pillar with a full suite of cyber legislation covering criminality, data protection,  data privacy and electronic transactions.

The island state has a long history  of cybersecurity initiatives. It launched its first cybersecurity master plan back in 2005.  The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore was created in 2015 as a dedicated entity  to oversee cybersecurity and the country issued a comprehensive strategy in 20168.  Malaysia is ranked second in the Asia and the Pacific region and scores a perfect 100  on capacity building due to a range of initiatives in that pillar. Cybersecurity Malaysia,  the government entity responsible for information security in the country, offers  professional training via higher education institutions in Malaysia. It maintains the  Cyberguru website, dedicated to professional security training9.  Australia10  is third ranked in the region and home to AusCERT, one of oldest CERTs  in the region formed in 199311. The highest scoring pillar is technical where there  is a certification programme for information security skills provided by the Council  of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST)12. Modelled after CREST, the council  offers assessment, accreditation, certification, education and training in cyber and  information security for individuals and corporate entities in both Australia and New Zealand.

After large-scale cyber-attacks on the country in  2008, the government has strongly supported protection of the country's information  systems13. The Information Security Law14 established a Cyber Security Bureau with a  particular emphasis on protecting critical information systems in the military sphere.  The Russian Federation, ranked second in the region, scores best in capacity building.  Its commitments range from developing cybersecurity standards to R&D and from  public awareness to a home-grown cybersecurity industry. An example of the latter is  Kaspersky Labs, founded in 1997 and whose software protects over 400 million users  and some 270 000 organizations15.  Belarus is the third ranked country, where child protection initiatives include public  and private partnerships. Mobile operator MTS has implemented a project with the  Ministry of Education to teach children about safe Internet practices that has so far  reached some 6 000 children16.

Like Georgia, Estonia  enhanced its cybersecurity commitment after a 2007 attack. This included the  introduction of an organizational structure that can respond quickly to attacks as well  as a legal act that requires all vital services to maintain a minimal level of operation  if they are cut off from the Internet17. The country also hosts the headquarters of the  NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence18.  France is the second highest ranked in the Europe region, scoring a perfect 100 in  capacity building. There is widespread cybersecurity training available in the country,  and the National Agency for Information System Security (ANSSI in French) publishes a  list of dozens of universities that provide accredited cybersecurity degrees recognized19.  Norway is ranked third in Europe with its highest score in the legal pillar. Apart  from laws dealing with cybersecurity, Norway has also conducted research on its  cybersecurity culture including surveying citizens about the degree to which they will  accept monitoring of their online activities.20  Figure 6.6.1: Top three ranked countries and an average score of all Europe  17 http:// www. nextgov. com/ cybersecurity/ 2015/ 01/ heres- what- us- could- learn- estonia- about- cybersecurity/ 103959/  18 https:// ccdcoe. org  19 https:// www. ssi. gouv. fr/ particulier/ formations/ formation- et- cybersecurite- en- france/  20 https:// norsis. no/ wp- content/ uploads/ 2016/ 09/ The- Norwegian- Cybersecurity- culture- web. pdf  http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/01/heres-what-us-could-learn-estonia-about-cybersecurity/103959/ https://ccdcoe.org https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/particulier/formations/formation-et-cybersecurite-en-france/ https://norsis.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Norwegian-Cybersecurity-culture-web.pdf  37  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 6.6.2: Europe region scorecard  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  39  7  Illustrative practices by pillar This chapter identifies noteworthy and thought-provoking practices in cybersecurity across the  various GCI pillars. Examples are drawn from a number of countries and provide an insight on the  cybersecurity commitment taken in their focus areas.  7.1  Legal  Examples for this pillar illustrate practices in national cybercrime legislation regarding unauthorized  access, data and system interference or interception, and misuse of computer systems.  7.1.1  Cybercrime legislation  Colombia became one of the first countries in the world when, in 2009, it enacted  a law specifically targeting cyberspace. Law 1273 (entitled \"By means of which the  Penal Code is amended, a new legal right is created - called ’protection of information  and data‘- and systems that use information and communication technologies are  fully preserved, among other provisions\"1) calls for a prison sentence or large fines  for anyone convicted of information systems or telecommunication network crimes. The law covers  areas such as illegally accessing personal information, intercepting data, destroying data or using  malicious software.  Georgia established cybercrime legislation in line with the principles and rules of the  Budapest Convention both in terms of substantive and procedural aspects.  Illegal  access to information systems, data and system interference, and misuse of devices  are criminalized by the Georgia criminal code. The Personal Data Protection Act was  enacted by Parliament in 2011 and is intended to ensure protection of human rights  and freedoms, including the right to privacy, in the course of personal data processing.2  7.1.2  Cybersecurity regulation  Sultanate of Oman established the eGovernance Framework, a set of standards / best  practices and process management systems to enhance the delivery of government  services in alignment with the mission of e.oman (Sultanate of Oman Digital Oman  Strategy and eGovernment). The framework spells out the rules and procedures that  ensure that government IT projects and systems are sustainable and in compliance  with the Information Technology Authority (ITA) strategies and objectives. It provides assurance about  the value of IT projects and framework for the management of IT-related risks. It helps in putting  controls to minimize risks and better delivery of IT initiatives3.  7.1.3 Cybersecurity training  Mauritius makes available training for law enforcement and judiciary which has  been conducted under the GLACY Project since 2013 and is still ongoing.  CERT-MU  also carried out cybersecurity trainings on digital forensic investigator professional  and network forensic (packet analysis) for law enforcement officers. Training on  1 Government of Colombia. Law 1273 of 2009.

The New Zealand (NZ) Police is introducing a 3-tiered training program for specialist  cyber staff, investigators and then frontline staff. This is outlined in NZ Police's  Prevention First National Cybercrime Strategy 2014-2017 5. NZ Police also provides  training to the judiciary and prosecutors.  7.2 Technical  Examples for this pillar illustrate practices in areas such as existence of technical institutions, child  online protection and industry standards and certification.  7.2.1  National CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  Egypt provides computer emergency response team (EG-CERT) support to several  entities in the ICT sector, the financial sector as well as the government sector, in  order to help them tackle cybersecurity related threats. EG-CERT is expanding and is  currently upgrading its laboratories in the four key operational departments. Additional  laboratories are being planned for mobile cybersecurity and industrial control systems  cybersecurity6.  Brazil has three computer emergency response teams with different functions, namely:  the national CERT, a government CSIRT and a sector specific SCIRT. The Brazil Federal  Police participates in the I-24/7 global police communications system developed by  Interpol to connect law enforcement officers, including cybercrimes. There is also a  complementary Standard No. 17/IN01/DSIC/GSIPR that establishes guidelines for the  certification and accreditation for information and communication security professionals of the direct  and indirect Federal Public Administration.  7.2.2 Government CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  Luxembourg created a computer emergency response team (GOVCERT.LU) in 2011 to  help protect government computer systems and data as well as specific infrastructures  and is engaged at both national and international level under the name of NCERT. LU7. GOVCERT.LU is also a critical player in the event of a large cyber-attack affecting  country's ICT assets.  7.2.3 Sectoral CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  Sri Lanka created the Financial Sector Computer Security Incident Response Team  (FINCSIRT) in 2014 with responsibility for receiving, reviewing, processing and  responding to computer security alerts and incidents affecting banks and other licensed  financial institutions in the country8. FINCSIRT is a joint initiative of the Central Bank  of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka computer emergency response team and is steered and  funded by the banking sector. Related to FINCSIRT is LankaClear, the country's certification authority  owned by the Central Bank and commercial banks9.  4 http:// www. coe. int/ en/ web/ cybercrime/ news/-/ asset_ publisher/ S73WWxscOuZ5/ content/ glacy- support- to- mauritius-  judicial- training- courses- on- cybercrime- delivered  5 http:// www. dpmc. govt. nz/ sites/ all/ files/ publications/ nz- cyber- security- cybercrime- plan- december- 2015. pdf (page 10) 6 http:// www. egcert. org 7 https:// www. govcert. lu/ en/ ncert. html  8 http:// www. fincsirt. lk 9 http:// www. lankaclear. com/ about/ index. php  http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/news/-/asset_publisher/S73WWxscOuZ5/content/glacy-support-to-mauritius-judicial-training-courses-on-cybercrime-delivered http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/news/-/asset_publisher/S73WWxscOuZ5/content/glacy-support-to-mauritius-judicial-training-courses-on-cybercrime-delivered http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/publications/nz-cyber-security-cybercrime-plan-december-2015.pdf http://www.egcert.org https://www.govcert.lu/en/ncert.html http://www.lankaclear.com/about/index.php  41  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  7.2.4  Cybersecurity standards implementation framework for organizations  Malaysia created the Information Security Certification Body (ISCB), a department  of Cybersecurity Malaysia, which manages information security certification10. The  certification services are consistent with international standards and guidelines and  include among others the Malaysian Common Criteria Evaluation and Certification  (MyCC), which certifies security functions of ICT products based on the ISO/IEC 15408  international standard11.  Hungary national regulation lays out the framework for information security training for  state and local government officials12. The National University for Public Service (NKE)  is charged with training and establishing a certification system13. Certificates issued  include information security risk assessment and testing of electronic information  systems.  7.2.5  Child online protection  Singapore’s Internet Content Providers (ICPs) and Internet Access Service Providers  (IASPs) are licensable under the Broadcasting Act and they are required to comply  with the Internet Code of Practice to protect children online. Since 2012, all service  providers have been legally obligated to offer filtering services with Internet  subscriptions and to make this known to consumers when they subscribe or renew.  The Info-communications Media Development Authority also symbolically blocks 100 pornographic,  extremist or hate websites.  7.3  Organizational  Examples for this pillar illustrate practices where governments are organized by having a cybersecurity  strategy, a coordinating agency and compilation of indicators for tracking cybercrime.  7.3.1 Strategy  United Kingdom issued in 2016 its second five years National Cyber Security Strategy14.  The strategy, issued by the Cabinet Office, aims to make the country one of the  safest places in the world to carry out online business and doubles investment in  cybersecurity compared to the first plan.  Russian Federation officially adopted its National Security Strategy in 2000 and  National Security Concept of the Russian Federation as well as Concept of the Foreign  Policy of the Russian Federation in 2013. It established an Information Security  Doctrine of the Russian Federation in 2000 and each government entity in the Russian  Federation performs an annual audit of its own networks and systems in line with the  doctrine and the areas identified in the various strategies adopted.  10 http:// www. cybersecurity. my/ en/ our_ services/ iscb/ main/ detail/ 2327/ index. html  11 http:// www. iso. org/ iso/ catalogue_ detail. htm? csnumber= 50341  12 http:// njt. hu/ cgi_ bin/ njt_ doc. cgi? docid= 164331. 250717  13 http:// en. uni- nke. hu  14 https:// www. gov. uk/ government/ uploads/ system/ uploads/ attachment_ data/ file/ 567242/ national_ cyber_ security_  strategy_ 2016. pdf  http://www.cybersecurity.my/en/our_services/iscb/main/detail/2327/index.html http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50341 http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=164331.250717 http://en.uni-nke.hu https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf  42  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  7.3.2  Public consultation  Canada conducted a three-month public consultation on updating its cybersecurity  strategy, asking security professionals and citizens for inputs and views. The consultation  was done to help identify gaps and opportunities, bring forward new ideas to shape  Canada’s renewed approach to cybersecurity and capitalize on the advantages of new  technology and the digital economy15.  7.3.3 Responsible agency  Iceland created the Cyber Security Council, appointed by the Minister of the Interior  that is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the National Cyber Security  Strategy. In addition, a cyber security forum has been created as a collaborative venue  for representatives of public bodies who sit on the Cyber Security Council and of  private entities.  7.3.4 Cybersecurity metrics  Netherlands uses metrics annually in order to measure cybersecurity development at  a national level, summarized in the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands report16.  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) compiles disclosure reports, security  advisories and incidents using a registration system. The metrics allow trends to be  observed and acted on.  7.4 Capacity building  Examples of practices for capacity building include the aspects of developing the technical and human  resources for fighting cybercrime. This includes raising awareness about cybersecurity among the  public, the existence of cybersecurity standards and standards bodies, best practices guides, education  initiatives and research and development.  7.4.1  Standardization bodies  Romania created the National Standardization Organization17 to produce relevant  national standards on processes, tools and technologies for software products and  systems in the area of security in information technology. It also tests the standardization  integrity of encryption algorithms, authentication services and algorithms for  confidential services in compliance with accepted international standards18.  7.4.2  Good practice  Canada created the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization (IIROC) that is the  national self-regulatory organization overseeing investment dealers and their trading  activity in the country's debt and equity markets. IIROC published a cybersecurity best  practices guide for its members19.  15 http:// www. itworldcanada. com/ article/ breaking- news- ottawa- announces- public- consultation- on- cyber- security-  strategy/ 385740#ixzz4dm1QjsTu  16 https:// www. ncsc. nl/ english/ current- topics/ Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/ cyber- security- assessment-  netherlands- 2016. html  17 http:// www. asro. ro/  18 http:// www. asro. ro/ CTmementoSite. html#BM208  19 http:// www. iiroc. ca/ industry/ Documents/ CybersecurityBestPracticesGuide_ en. pdf  http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/breaking-news-ottawa-announces-public-consultation-on-cyber-security-strategy/385740#ixzz4dm1QjsTu http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/breaking-news-ottawa-announces-public-consultation-on-cyber-security-strategy/385740#ixzz4dm1QjsTu https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2016.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2016.html http://www.asro.ro/ http://www.asro.ro/CTmementoSite.html#BM208 http://www.iiroc.ca/industry/Documents/CybersecurityBestPracticesGuide_en.pdf  43  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  7.4.3 Cybersecurity research and development programmes  Germany signed an agreement in 2009 on cooperation in IT security research between  the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry of the  Interior (BMI). The IT Security Research programme covers research and development  in new information security technologies. The BMBF has been supporting three  research centres since 2011 that bring together leading university and non-university  establishments in cybersecurity 20.  Kenya Education Network, (KENET), is the National Research and Education Network  (NREN) of Kenya. KENET is the computer emergency response team (CERT) for the  academic community and is licensed by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA)  as a not-for-profit operator serving the education and research institutions. They most  notably provide affordable, cost-effective and low-congestion Internet bandwidth  services to member institution campuses in Kenya.  7.4.4 Public awareness campaigns  Latvia has published a series of articles on its national CERT portal about free-of- charge security solutions including anti-viruses, firewalls, NoScript, etc.21 Twice a year,  the national CERT organizes a campaign where people can bring their computers for  a check-up to see if they are infected, and it also distributes commercial anti-virus  installations during the campaigns that are made available free-of-charge for one year.  7.4.5 Cybersecurity professional training courses  Bulgaria established the International Cyber Investigation Training Academy in  2009, which is a non-governmental organization22. The academy aims to improve  the qualification of specialists working in the field of cybersecurity. It has trained over  1 300 people from both the public and private sectors.  7.4.6  National education programmes and academic curricula  Germany has several universities and institutes providing degrees and certificates  in information security23. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research funds the  KASTEL competence centre that offers training leading to a certificate equivalent to a  specialized master degree in IT security24. The Technical University of Darmstadt has  been offering a Master of Science Degree in IT security since 201025.  7.4.7  Incentive mechanisms  Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA) is committed to establishing a network  foundation for Internet users and Internet companies by improving competitiveness  of Internet services and reliability of Internet information and knowledge. KISA  supports start-ups to commercialize their business models and enhance competitive  edge in the field of security technology through programmes that aim to nurture  start-ups in the Internet-of-things, security, and Fintech industry. They also established the one-stop  20 https:// www. bmbf. de/ en/ cybersecurity- research- to- boost- germany- s- competitiveness- 1418. html  21 https:// www. esidross. lv/ category/ bezmaksas- risinajumi/ page/ 2/  22 http:// e- crimeacademy. com/  23 https:// www. bmbf. de/ en/ cybersecurity- research- to- boost- germany- s- competitiveness- 1418. html  24 http:// www. kastel. kit. edu  25 https:// www. tu- darmstadt. de/ studieren/ abschluesse/ master/ it- sicherheit- msc. en. jsp  https://www.bmbf.de/en/cybersecurity-research-to-boost-germany-s-competitiveness-1418.html https://www.esidross.lv/category/bezmaksas-risinajumi/page/2/ http://e-crimeacademy.com/ https://www.bmbf.de/en/cybersecurity-research-to-boost-germany-s-competitiveness-1418.html http://www.kastel.kit.edu https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/abschluesse/master/it-sicherheit-msc.en.jsp  44  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  service to support start-ups to gain ground not only in the domestic market but also the global market  to expand their business models.  7.4.8 Home-grown cybersecurity industry  Ireland has the largest proportion of the Information and Communication sector of its  economy compared to all other countries in Europe and is leveraging that advantage  to grow its cybersecurity industry. The country is drawing on existing incentives and  attractions with the aim of being a cybersecurity capital26. These incentives include a  favourable business environment and low taxes, a talented pool of highly skilled and  multilingual workers and a good base for access to European markets27.  7.5  Cooperation  This pillar considers collaborative efforts across national and international domains and between the  public and private sector.  7.5.1 Bilateral agreements  Finland is an active member of many organizations, such as the Council of Europe  (CoE), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United  Nations (UN). Finland has also joined the NATO Partnership for Peace and is engaged  in cooperation with the organization in, for example, crisis management. There is also  local partnership with Finnish company Codenomicon, which later was acquired by  Synopsys, to develop the national IDS system and automatic incident reporting service with FICORA28.  7.5.2  Multilateral agreements  Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden collaborate through the Nordic National CERT  Collaboration. This includes technical cooperation and cybersecurity exercises to assess and strengthen  cyber preparedness, examine incident response processes and enhance information sharing in the  region29.  7.5.3  Participation in international fora  Participation in international cybersecurity events, workshops and training is the one indicator where  virtually all countries score high on the GCI. Therefore, it is more revealing to describe one of the  most significant initiatives in this regard. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)30  was founded in 1990. Its members are security and incident response teams from the public, private  and academic sectors. It organizes an annual conference, technical colloquia and training workshops.  26 https:// www. siliconrepublic. com/ companies/ cybersecurity- hub- ireland  27 http:// www. idaireland. com/ how- we- help/ resources/ infographics/ ida- cyber- security/ IDA_ CYBER_ SECURITY. pdf  28 http:// formin. finland. fi/ public/ default. aspx? nodeid= 49303& contentlan= 2& culture= fi- FI  https:// www. synopsys. com/  services. html  29 https:// www. msb. se/ en/ Tools/ News/ Nordic- cyber- security- exercise- was- conducted- in- Linkoping/  30 www.

The partnership helped stop  34,550 potential attacks on government departments in the last six months of 2016,  or 200 incidents a day.  7.5.5 Interagency partnerships  The United States of America started its first cross-government security information  sharing agreement in 2015. The Multilateral Information Sharing Agreement (MISA)  binds government agencies from defence, health, justice, intelligence community and  energy to work collaboratively to enhance cybersecurity information sharing, with an  emphasis on information exchanges at machine speed33.  South Africa established the national cybersecurity hub to serve as a central point  for collaboration between industry, government and civil society on all cybersecurity  incidents. The cybersecurity hub is mandated by the National Cybersecurity Policy  Framework (NCPF) that was passed by Cabinet in 2012. The hub enhances interaction  and consultations as well as promoting a coordinated approach regarding engagements  with the private sector and civil society34.  31 https:// news. netcraft. com/ archives/ 2016/ 11/ 01/ the- chancellor- of- the- exchequer- sets- out- plans- for- the- uk-  government- to- work- with- netcraft. html  32 https:// www. ncsc. gov. uk/ blog- post/ active- cyber- defence- tackling- cyber- attacks- uk  33 https:// www. ise. gov/ blog/ kshemendra- paul/ coordinating- cybersecurity- programs 34 https:// www. cybersecurityhub. gov. za/  https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/11/01/the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-sets-out-plans-for-the-uk-government-to-work-with-netcraft.html https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/11/01/the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-sets-out-plans-for-the-uk-government-to-work-with-netcraft.html https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/active-cyber-defence-tackling-cyber-attacks-uk https://www.ise.gov/blog/kshemendra-paul/coordinating-cybersecurity-programs https://www.cybersecurityhub.gov.za/  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  47  8 Conclusion Cybersecurity is an increasingly important part of our life today, and the degree of interconnectivity of  networks implies that anything and everything can be exposed, and everything from national critical  infrastructure to our basic human rights can be compromised. Governments are therefore urged to  consider policies that support continued growth in technology sophistication, access and security,  and as a crucial first step, to adopt a national cybersecurity strategy.  The GCI 2017 edition measured the commitment of the ITU Member States to cybersecurity and  highlighted a number of illustrative practices from around the world. As a logical continuation of the  first iteration of the GCI issued in 2014, this version has motivated countries to improve their work  related to cybersecurity, raised awareness in countries for the need to start bilateral, multilateral  and international cooperation, and increased the visibility of what countries are doing to improve  cybersecurity.  However, the research also revealed that while increased Internet access and more mature  technological development is correlated with improvement in cybersecurity at the global level, this  is not necessarily true for countries with developing economies and lower levels of technological  development. The data collection shows that developing countries lack well-trained cybersecurity  experts as well as a thorough appreciation and the necessary education on cybersecurity issues for  law enforcement, and continued challenges in the judiciary and legislative branches. There is a need  for the developed world to help train local experts in cybersecurity, and more cooperation should be  initiated between developed and developing countries to assist them in cybersecurity development.  For the Global Cybersecurity Index to have an impact on raising awareness on this crucial emerging  concern over time, continuity of the GCI effort is essential. ITU therefore welcomes all Member States  and industry stakeholders to actively participate in future efforts to enhance the current reference  model. As well, the success of future iterations of the GCI largely depends on the engagement of  Member States and the quality of their responses to the questionnaire, and ITU calls on all Member  States to take part in the next GCI survey.  ITU would like to thank all Member States for their valuable support for the conduct of the GCI survey  and the publication of this report as well as future ones.

Governments across the world recognize that digital  transformation has the power to further the prosperity and wellbeing of their  citizens. In supporting this transformation, they also recognize that cybersecurity  must be an integral and indivisible part of technological progress.  In 2016, nearly one percent of all emails sent were essentially malicious attacks,  the highest rate in recent years. Ransomware attacks increasingly affected  businesses and consumers, with indiscriminate campaigns pushing out massive  volumes of malicious emails. Attackers are demanding more and more from  victims, with the average ransom demand rising to over 1,000 USD in 2016,  up from approximately 300 USD a year earlier. In May 2017, a massive cyberattack caused major  disruptions to companies and hospitals in over 150 countries, prompting a call for greater cooperation  around the world.  First launched in 2014, the goal of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is to help foster a global culture  of cybersecurity and its integration at the core of ICTs. This second iteration of the GCI measures the  commitment of ITU Member States towards cybersecurity in order to drive further efforts in the  adoption and integration of cybersecurity on a global scale.  The GCI reaffirms ITU’s commitment to build confidence and security in the use of ICTs. This report  on the second iteration of the GCI continues to show the cybersecurity commitment of ITU Member  States around the world, and I am pleased to note that the overall picture shows improvement and  strengthening of the global cybersecurity agenda.  I wish to thank Member States for their contribution to this effort.  The collection of information for the GCI is an ongoing process, and I therefore invite all ITU Member  States to continue sending and updating information on their cybersecurity efforts so that we can  effectively share experiences, views and solutions in order to make the digital world a more secure  and safe environment for all citizens.  Brahima Sanou  Director, Telecommunication Development Bureau  Foreword  v  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is a survey that measures the commitment of Member States  to cybersecurity in order to raise awareness.  The GCI revolves around the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA) and its five pillars (legal, technical,  organizational, capacity building and cooperation). For each of these pillars, questions were developed  to assess commitment. Through consultation with a group of experts, these questions were weighted  in order to arrive at an overall GCI score. The survey was administered through an online platform  through which supporting evidence was also collected.  One-hundred and thirty-four Member States responded to the survey throughout 2016. Member  States who did not respond were invited to validate responses determined from open-source research.  As such, the GCI results reported herein cover all 193 ITU Member States.  The 2017 publication of the GCI continues to show the commitment to cybersecurity of countries  around the world. The overall picture shows improvement and strengthening of all five elements  of the cybersecurity agenda in various countries in all regions. However, there is space for further  improvement in cooperation at all levels, capacity building and organizational measures. As well, the  gap in the level of cybersecurity engagement between different regions is still present and visible. The  level of development of the different pillars varies from country to country in the regions, and while  commitment in Europe remains very high in the legal and technical fields in particular, the challenging  situation in the Africa and Americas regions shows the need for continued engagement and support.  In addition to providing the GCI score, this report also provides a set of illustrative practices that give  insight into the achievements of certain countries.

In 2016, almost half the world used the Internet (3.5 billion users)1 and  according to one estimate, there will be over 12 billion machine-to-machine devices connected to  the Internet by 20202. Yet, just as in the real world, the cyber world is exposed to a variety of security  threats that can cause immense damage.  Statistics on threats to computer networks are sobering and reflect a shift from the relatively innocuous  spam of yesteryear to threats that are more malicious. A security company tracking incidents in 2016  found that malicious emails became a weapon of choice for a wide range of cyberattacks during the  year used by everyone from state sponsored cyber espionage groups to mass-mailing ransomware  gangs. One-in-131 emails sent were malicious, the highest rate in five years.  Ransomware continues to plague businesses and consumers, with indiscriminate campaigns pushing  out massive volumes of malicious emails. In some cases, organizations can be overwhelmed by the  sheer volume of ransomware-laden emails they receive. Attackers are demanding more and more  from victims with the average ransom demand in 2016 rising to USD 1 077, up from USD 294 a year  earlier3. The scale of cybercrime makes it critical for governments to have a robust cybersecurity  ecosystem in place to reduce threats and enhance confidence in using electronic communications  and services.  It is therefore clear that there is a direct cause-effect principle between the growth of ICTs and their  illicit and malicious use. To counter this effect, cybersecurity is becoming more and more relevant in  the minds of countries’ decision makers, and cybersecurity related doctrines have been established  in almost all countries in the world.  However, there is still an evident gap between countries in terms of awareness, understanding,  knowledge and finally capacity to deploy the proper strategies, capabilities and programmes to ensure  a safe and appropriate use of ICTs as enablers for economic development.  In this context, ITU, together with international partners from private-public and private sector as well  as academia, has established the GCI with the key objective of building capacity at the national, regional  and international level, through assessing the level of engagement of countries on cybersecurity, and,  with the data gathered, producing a list of good practices that can be used by countries in need.  1 www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Statistics/ Pages/ stat/ default. aspx 2 www. cisco. com/ c/ en/ us/ solutions/ collateral/ service- provider/ visual- networking- index- vni/ vni- hyperconnectivity- wp.  html 3 www. symantec. com  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  3  2 GCI Scope and Framework  2.1 Background  The GCI is included under Resolution 130 (Rev. Busan, 2014) on strengthening the role of ITU in  building confidence and security in the use of ICT. Specifically, Member States are invited “to support  ITU initiatives on cybersecurity, including the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), in order to promote  government strategies and the sharing of information on efforts across industries and sectors”.  A first iteration of the GCI was conducted in 2013-2014 in partnership with ABI Research1, and the  final results have been published2.  Following feedback received from various communities, a second iteration of the GCI was planned  and undertaken. This new version was formulated around an extended participation from Member  States, experts and industry stakeholders as contributing partners (namely World Bank and Red Team  Cyber as new GCI partners joining the Australia Strategic Policy Institute, FIRST, Indiana University,  INTERPOL, ITU-Arab Regional Cybersecurity Centre in Oman, Korea Internet & Security Agency, NTRA  Egypt, The Potomac Institute of Policy Studies, UNICRI, University of Technology Jamaica and UNODC)  who all provided support with the provision of secondary data, response activation, statistical analysis,  qualitative appreciation amongst other.  The data collected via GCI 2017 for ITU-D Study Group 2 Question 3 (SG2Q3) surveys have been  analysed by the Rapporteur and co-Rapporteur for inclusion in the SG2Q3 final report. GCI partners  have been active in providing expertise and secondary data as appropriate, while the UN office of ICT  (New York) has also initiated collaborative work. ITU is also working in a multi-stakeholder collaboration  led by the World Bank to elaborate a toolkit on “Best practice in Policy/Legal enabling Framework and  Capacity Building in Combatting Cybercrime”. ITU is providing support on the component on capacity  building from a cybersecurity perspective based on GCI 2017 data.  An enhanced reference model was thereby devised. Throughout the steps of this new version,  Member States were consulted using various vehicles including ITU-D Study Group 2 Question 3/2,  where the overall project was submitted, discussed and validated.  2.2 Reference model  The GCI is a composite index combining 25 indicators into one benchmark measure to monitor and  compare the level of ITU Member States cybersecurity commitment with regard to the five pillars  identified by the High-Level Experts Group and endorsed by the GCA. These pillars form the five  pillars of GCI.  The main objectives of the GCI are to measure:  • the type, level and evolution over time of cybersecurity commitment in countries and relative  to other countries;  • the progress in cybersecurity commitment of all countries from a global perspective;  • the progress in cybersecurity commitment from a regional perspective;  • the cybersecurity commitment divide, i.e. the difference between countries in terms of their  level of engagement in cybersecurity programmes and initiatives.  1 https:// www. abiresearch. com/  2 http:// www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Cybersecurity/ Pages/ GCI- 2014. aspx  https://www.abiresearch.com/ http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/GCI-2014.aspx  4  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  The objective of the GCI as an initiative is to help countries identify areas for improvement in the field  of cybersecurity, as well as to motivate them to take action to improve their ranking, thus helping  raise the overall level of commitment to cybersecurity worldwide.  Through the information collected, the GCI aims to illustrate the practices of other countries so that  Member States can implement selected aspects suitable to their national environment, with the added  benefits of helping harmonize practices and fostering, a global culture of cybersecurity.  2.3 Conceptual framework  The five pillars of the GCI are briefly explained below:  1. Legal: Measured based on the existence of legal institutions and frameworks dealing with  cybersecurity and cybercrime.  2. Technical: Measured based on the existence of technical institutions and frameworks dealing  with cybersecurity.  3. Organizational: Measured based on the existence of policy coordination institutions and  strategies for cybersecurity development at the national level.  4. Capacity Building: Measured based on the existence of research and development, education  and training programmes; certified professionals and public sector agencies fostering capacity  building.  5. Cooperation: Measured based on the existence of partnerships, cooperative frameworks and  information sharing networks.  5  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Each pillar was then further divided in sub-pillars (Figure 2.3.1).  Figure 2.3.1: GCI pillars and sub-pillars  The questionnaire was elaborated on the basis of these sub-pillars 3. The values for the 25 indicators  were therefore constructed through 157 binary questions. This was done in order to achieve the  required level of granularity and ensure accuracy and quality on the answers.  3 http:// www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Cybersecurity/ Documents/ QuestionnaireGuide- E. pdf  http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/QuestionnaireGuide-E.pdf  6  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 2.3.2 below represents all the five pillars from GCA with their indicators.

The indicators used to calculate the GCI were  selected on the basis of the following criteria:  • relevance to the five GCA pillars and in contributing towards the main GCI objectives and  conceptual framework;  • data availability and quality;  • possibility of cross verification through secondary data.  The whole concept of a new iteration of the GCI is based on a cybersecurity development tree map  and binary answer possibilities.  The tree map concept, which is illustrated in Figures 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, is an example of different possible  paths that might be taken by countries in order to enhance their cybersecurity commitment.  Each of the five pillars are associated with a specific colour. The deeper the path taken, indicating a  more developed level of commitment, the deeper the colour depicting it becomes.  The various levels of cybersecurity development among countries, as well as the different cybersecurity  needs reflected by a country’s overall ICT development status, were taken into consideration. The  concept is based on the assumption that the more developed cybersecurity is, the more complex the  solutions observed will be. Therefore, the further a country goes along the tree map by confirming  the presence of pre-identified cyber solutions, the more complex and sophisticated the cybersecurity  commitment is within that country, allowing it to obtain a higher score with the GCI.  The rationale behind using binary answer possibilities is the elimination of opinion-based evaluation  and of any possible bias towards certain types of answers.  Moreover, the simple binary concept will allow quicker and more complex evaluation as it will not  require lengthy answers from countries. This, in turn, is assumed to accelerate and streamline the  process of providing answers and further evaluation. The idea is that the respondent will only confirm  the presence or lack of certain pre-identified cybersecurity solutions. An online survey mechanism,  which was used for gathering answers and uploading all relevant materials, enabled the extraction  of good practices.  The key difference in methodology between GCI 2014 and GCI Version 2017 is the use of a binary  system instead of a three-level system. The binary system evaluates the existence or absence of a  specific activity, department or measure. Unlike GCI Version 2014, it does not take 'partial' measures  into consideration. The facility for respondents to upload supporting documents and URLs is a way  of providing more information to substantiate the binary response. Furthermore, a number of new  questions have been added in each of the five pillars in order to refine the depth of research.  The GCI 2014 and GCI 2017 are not directly comparable due to a change in methodology. While the 2014  index used a simple average methodology, the 2017 index employs a weighting factor for each pillar.  The questionnaire, made available through an online survey from January to September 2016, was  administered to the 193 ITU Member States (plus State of Palestine) in the regions of Africa, Americas,  Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Europe. 134 countries  responded to the online survey while 59 countries did not provide primary data.  10  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Table 3.1: Numbers of responses received from all Members States regionally  Region Africa Americas Arab States Asia and the  Pacific CIS Europe Global  Responses 29 23 16 25 7 34 134  Non-responses 15 12 5 13 5 9 59  Total of  participants  44 35 21 38 12 43 193  The data collection process was implemented as follows:  1. A Letter of Invitation was sent by the ITU Secretariat to all Member States, informing them on  the initiative and requesting the identification of a country level GCI focal point with whom ITU  could liaise and who would be responsible for collecting all relevant data for completing the  online GCI questionnaire. A guideline to the online questionnaire which provided explanations  and examples for each question, was attached to the letter 1.  2. Primary data collection (for countries who responded to the questionnaire):  • Verification of the responses received by the specific Member State to identify possible  missing elements (no or missing responses, no or missing supporting documents, no or  missing links, etc.).  – For instance, if a Member State answered “No”, ITU researched to prove that they do  not have any documents in the ITU database or online.  – If a Member State answered “Yes”, ITU researched to verify that answers provided were  correct and corresponded to the question.  • The focal point identified by the concerned Member State was contacted and provided  with indications on how to improve the accuracy of the responses. Where necessary ITU  provided comments and guidance to improve the completed questionnaire.  • After the necessary rounds of iterations, the pre-final questionnaire was sent back to the  concerned Member State for final approval.  • Once formal approval was received, the questionnaire was considered validated and used  for the analysis, scoring and ranking.  3. Secondary data collection (for countries that did not respond to the questionnaire):  • ITU elaborated an initial draft of the response to the questionnaire using publicly available  data and online research.  • The draft was then sent to the concerned Member State for review.  • The reviewed response received, the focal point identified by the concerned Member  State was contacted and provided with indications on how to improve the accuracy of  the responses. Where necessary ITU provided comments and guidance to improve the  completed questionnaire.  • After the necessary rounds of iterations, the pre-final questionnaire was sent back to the  concerned Member State for final approval.  1 http:// www. itu. int/ en/ ITU- D/ Cybersecurity/ Documents/ QuestionnaireGuide- E. pdf  11  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  • Once formal approval was received, the questionnaire was considered validated and used  for the analysis, scoring and ranking.  The GCI 2017 methodology encompassed the use of a panel of experts, identified according to their  specific expertise on the subject, who acted in their personal capacity in order to provide an expert  view on the weighting to be used for the scoring.  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  13  4 Key Findings  4.1  Heat Map of National Cybersecurity Commitments  Out of the 193 Member States, there is a huge range in cybersecurity commitments, as the heat map  below illustrates.  Level of commitment: from Green (highest) to Red (lowest)  Figure 4.1.1: GCI Heat Map  4.2 GCI Groups  Member States were classified into three categories by their GCI score (Figure 4.2.1).  • Initiating stage refers to the 96 countries (i.e., GCI score less than the 50th percentile) that have  started to make commitments in cybersecurity.  • Maturing stage refers to the 77 countries (i.e., GCI score between the 50th and 89th percentile)  that have developed complex commitments, and engage in cybersecurity programmes and  initiatives.  • Leading stage refers to the 21 countries (i.e., GCI score in the 90th percentile) that demonstrate  high commitment in all five pillars of the index.  14  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 4.2.1: GCI Tiers  INITIATING  Afghanistan  Andorra  Angola  Antigua and Barbuda  Armenia  Bahamas  Barbados  Belize  Benin  Bhutan  Bolivia (Plurinational State of)  Bosnia & Herzegovina  Burkina Faso  Burundi  Cambodia  Cape Verde  Central African Republic.

There are three  from Asia and the Pacific, two each from Europe and the Americas, and one from Africa, the Arab  States, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.  This suggests that being highly committed is not strictly tied to geographic location.  Table 5.1: Top ten most committed countries, GCI (normalized score)  Country GCI Score Legal Technical Organizational Capacity  Building Cooperation  Singapore 0.92 0.95 0.96 0.88 0.97 0.87  United States 0.91 1 0.96 0.92 1 0.73  Malaysia 0.89 0.87 0.96 0.77 1 0.87  Oman 0.87 0.98 0.82 0.85 0.95 0.75  Estonia 0.84 0.99 0.82 0.85 0.94 0.64  Mauritius 0.82 0.85 0.96 0.74 0.91 0.70  Australia 0.82 0.94 0.96 0.86 0.94 0.44  Georgia 0.81 0.91 0.77 0.82 0.90 0.70  France 0.81 0.94 0.96 0.60 1 0.61  Canada 0.81 0.94 0.93 0.71 0.82 0.70  As the GCI shows, there is a wide gulf in cyber preparedness around the globe. This gap exists between  and within regions.  Further, cybersecurity related commitments are often unequally distributed with countries performing  well in some pillars and less so in others. Cybersecurity is an ecosystem where laws, organizations,  skills, cooperation and technical implementation need to be in harmony to be most effective.  Additionally, cybersecurity is not just a concern of the government but also needs commitment from  the private sector and consumers. Thus, it is important to develop a cybersecurity culture where  citizens are aware of the trade-off between risks and monitoring when using electronic networks.  5.1  Noteworthy figures  The GCI consists of 25 different indicators. Some relate to precise commitments that help to concretize  the status of specific cybersecurity activities throughout the world.  One of the strongest commitments is to outline a cybersecurity strategy describing how the country  will prepare and respond to attacks against its digital networks. Only 38% countries have a published  cybersecurity strategy and only 11% have a dedicated standalone strategy (Figure 5.1.1, left); another  12% have a cybersecurity strategy under development.  More effort is needed in this critical area, particularly since it conveys that the government considers  digital risks high priority. In the area of training, efforts need to be enhanced particularly for those  who are most likely going to legally handle cybersecurity crimes given that less than half the Member  States (43%) have capacity-building programmes for law enforcement and the judicial system (Figure  5.1.1, right).  18  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.1.1: Cybersecurity strategy and training commitments  Despite half of the Member States not having a cybersecurity strategy, 61% do have an emergency  response team (i.e., CIRT, CSRIT, and CERT) with national responsibility (Figure 5.1.2, left). However,  just over a fifth (21%) publish metrics on cybersecurity incidents (Figure 5.1.2, right). This makes it  difficult in most countries to objectively assess incidents based on the evidence and determine if  protection measures are working.  Figure 5.1.2: Computer emergency response teams and metrics  Just less than a third of countries (32%) replied affirmatively to the existence of a homegrown  cybersecurity industry (Figure 5.1.3, left). More efforts need to be devoted to this area as a local  industry will have knowledge of national circumstances and make the security ecosystem more  sustainable. The potential for global cooperation is heightened by participation in international  cybersecurity events. This is almost universal with 95% of countries replying affirmatively (Figure  5.1.3, right).  19  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.1.3: Home-grown industry and international participation  5.2 Comparing GCI with other indices  A qualitative comparison has been performed to raise awareness on the importance of investing on  cybersecurity, as an integral component of any national ICT for development strategy.  This paragraph is not intended to provide thorough, exhaustive statistical analysis, but rather an  indication on how cybersecurity can relate to existing national processes, in order to emphasize the  importance of investing and being committed.  Comparing GCI scores to notable ICT for Development Indices does not reveal an especially close  relationship as experience shows that countries which score high in term of ICT for Development do  not necessarily invest in cybersecurity with the same level of commitment, and vice versa.  For example, comparing the GCI with the ITU ICT for Development Index (IDI), shows that some  countries are performing much better in the GCI than their level of ICT development would suggest.  The following figures show the relation between the GCI and IDI with each graph identifying the top  three countries for each region.  20  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.1: Global comparison GCI and IDI  Figure 5.2.2: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Africa region  21  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.3: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Americas region  Figure 5.2.4: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Arab States  22  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.5: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Asia and the Pacific region  Figure 5.2.6: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Commonwealth of Independent States  23  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 5.2.7: Comparison GCI and IDI in the Europe region  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  25  6 Regional Outlook During the active data collection phase of the GCI 2017 exercise, there was a varied response from  countries in the ITU regions:  • Out of the 44 Member States in the Africa region, 29 responded to the survey.  • Out of 35 Member States in the Americas region, 23 responded to the survey  • Out of 21 Member States in the Arab States region, 17 including the State of Palestine responded  to the survey.  • Out of 38 Member States in the Asia and the Pacific region, 25 responded to the survey  • Out of the 12 Member States in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, 7 responded  to the survey  • Out of 43 Member States in the Europe region, 34 responded to the survey.  Figure 6.1 illustrates the average GCI score for all countries in a particular region for the respective  pillar. Scores that fall below the 33rd percentile have a red background, scores that are between the  33rd to 65th percentiles have a yellow background and scores that lie above the 65th percentile have  a green background. There is scope for improvement since most regions have an average score for  the different pillars (i.e., lying between 33rd and 65th percentiles).  The exception is Europe, where average scores are high across all pillars. The Africa region averages low  scores for the organizational pillar while the Commonwealth of Independent States region averages  a high score for the legal pillar.  The following sub-sections show the findings for each individual ITU region, highlighting the results and  findings for the three top-scoring countries in each region. As well, a “regional scorecard” summarizes  the countries’ level of commitment to every pillar and sub-pillars (green for high, yellow for medium,  and red for low).  Figure 6.1: Average pillar scores by region  26  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  6.1 Africa  Table 6.1.1: Top three ranked countries in Africa  Country GCI  Score Legal Technical Organizational Capacity  Building Cooperation  Mauritius 0.83 0.85 0.96 0.74 0.91 0.7  Rwanda 0.6 0.6 0.71 0.79 0.66 0.28  Kenya 0.57 0.75 0.73 0.36 0.41 0.6  Mauritius is the top ranked country in the Africa region. It scores particularly high in  the legal and the technical areas. The Botnet Tracking and Detection project allows  Computer Emergency Response Team of Mauritius (CERT-MU) to proactively take  measures to curtail threats on different networks within the country. Capacity building  is another area where Mauritius does well. The government IT Security Unit has  conducted 180 awareness sessions for some 2 000 civil servants in 32 government ministries and  departments.  Rwanda, ranked second in Africa, scores high in the organizational pillar and has a  standalone cybersecurity policy addressing both the public and private sector1. It is  also committed to develop a stronger cybersecurity industry to ensure a resilient  cyber space.  Kenya, ranked third in the region, provides a good example of cooperation through its  National Kenya Computer Incident Response Team Coordination Centre (National KE- CIRT/CC)2. The CIRT coordinates at national, regional and global levels with a range of  actors. Nationally this includes ISPs and the financial and educational sectors; regionally  it works with other CIRTs through the East African Communications Organization; and  internationally it liaises with ITU, FIRST, and bi-laterally with the United States and Japan CIRTs among  others.

The United States of America has the highest scores for the legal and capacity  building pillars. One notable aspect of both capacity building and cooperation in  the country is the initiatives to coordinate cybersecurity among all states. To that  end, the National Governor's Association established the Resource Center for State  Cybersecurity, which offers best practices, tools and guidelines 3.  Canada ranks second in the region with its highest score in the legal pillar. The  country's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)  features several sections relating to cybersecurity4. It requires organizations to notify  privacy authorities in the event of privacy breaches that could cause significant damage  with penalties for those who fail to report them.  Mexico is third and some 16 points behind Canada, illustrating the cybersecurity divide  in the region. Like the other top ranked countries in the region, it scores best in the  legal pillar with a full suite of cyber legislation covering criminality, data protection,  data privacy and electronic transactions.

Oman has a robust organizational structure,  including a high-level cybersecurity strategy and master plan and comprehensive  roadmap.  Egypt ranks second with a full range of cooperation initiatives. It is a member of the UN  Government Group of Experts (GGE) on cybersecurity5, has chaired the ITU Working  Group for Child Online Protection6, was a founding member of AfricaCERT7, and has  a number of bi-lateral and multilateral agreements on cybersecurity cooperation.  Qatar ranks third and has been building a cybersecurity culture through campaigns  such as Safer Internet Day and has spread warnings about online threats, such as fraud  and Internet scams, via print and social media. The Qatar Cyber Crimes Investigation  Center and Information Security Center support efforts to safeguard the public and  crack down on those who use technology to carry out criminal activities.

The island state has a long history  of cybersecurity initiatives. It launched its first cybersecurity master plan back in 2005.  The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore was created in 2015 as a dedicated entity  to oversee cybersecurity and the country issued a comprehensive strategy in 20168.  Malaysia is ranked second in the Asia and the Pacific region and scores a perfect 100  on capacity building due to a range of initiatives in that pillar. Cybersecurity Malaysia,  the government entity responsible for information security in the country, offers  professional training via higher education institutions in Malaysia. It maintains the  Cyberguru website, dedicated to professional security training9.  Australia10  is third ranked in the region and home to AusCERT, one of oldest CERTs  in the region formed in 199311. The highest scoring pillar is technical where there  is a certification programme for information security skills provided by the Council  of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST)12. Modelled after CREST, the council  offers assessment, accreditation, certification, education and training in cyber and  information security for individuals and corporate entities in both Australia and New Zealand.

After large-scale cyber-attacks on the country in  2008, the government has strongly supported protection of the country's information  systems13. The Information Security Law14 established a Cyber Security Bureau with a  particular emphasis on protecting critical information systems in the military sphere.  The Russian Federation, ranked second in the region, scores best in capacity building.  Its commitments range from developing cybersecurity standards to R&D and from  public awareness to a home-grown cybersecurity industry. An example of the latter is  Kaspersky Labs, founded in 1997 and whose software protects over 400 million users  and some 270 000 organizations15.  Belarus is the third ranked country, where child protection initiatives include public  and private partnerships. Mobile operator MTS has implemented a project with the  Ministry of Education to teach children about safe Internet practices that has so far  reached some 6 000 children16.

Like Georgia, Estonia  enhanced its cybersecurity commitment after a 2007 attack. This included the  introduction of an organizational structure that can respond quickly to attacks as well  as a legal act that requires all vital services to maintain a minimal level of operation  if they are cut off from the Internet17. The country also hosts the headquarters of the  NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence18.  France is the second highest ranked in the Europe region, scoring a perfect 100 in  capacity building. There is widespread cybersecurity training available in the country,  and the National Agency for Information System Security (ANSSI in French) publishes a  list of dozens of universities that provide accredited cybersecurity degrees recognized19.  Norway is ranked third in Europe with its highest score in the legal pillar. Apart  from laws dealing with cybersecurity, Norway has also conducted research on its  cybersecurity culture including surveying citizens about the degree to which they will  accept monitoring of their online activities.20  Figure 6.6.1: Top three ranked countries and an average score of all Europe  17 http:// www. nextgov. com/ cybersecurity/ 2015/ 01/ heres- what- us- could- learn- estonia- about- cybersecurity/ 103959/  18 https:// ccdcoe. org  19 https:// www. ssi. gouv. fr/ particulier/ formations/ formation- et- cybersecurite- en- france/  20 https:// norsis. no/ wp- content/ uploads/ 2016/ 09/ The- Norwegian- Cybersecurity- culture- web. pdf  http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/01/heres-what-us-could-learn-estonia-about-cybersecurity/103959/ https://ccdcoe.org https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/particulier/formations/formation-et-cybersecurite-en-france/ https://norsis.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Norwegian-Cybersecurity-culture-web.pdf  37  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  Figure 6.6.2: Europe region scorecard  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  39  7  Illustrative practices by pillar This chapter identifies noteworthy and thought-provoking practices in cybersecurity across the  various GCI pillars. Examples are drawn from a number of countries and provide an insight on the  cybersecurity commitment taken in their focus areas.  7.1  Legal  Examples for this pillar illustrate practices in national cybercrime legislation regarding unauthorized  access, data and system interference or interception, and misuse of computer systems.  7.1.1  Cybercrime legislation  Colombia became one of the first countries in the world when, in 2009, it enacted  a law specifically targeting cyberspace. Law 1273 (entitled \"By means of which the  Penal Code is amended, a new legal right is created - called ’protection of information  and data‘- and systems that use information and communication technologies are  fully preserved, among other provisions\"1) calls for a prison sentence or large fines  for anyone convicted of information systems or telecommunication network crimes. The law covers  areas such as illegally accessing personal information, intercepting data, destroying data or using  malicious software.  Georgia established cybercrime legislation in line with the principles and rules of the  Budapest Convention both in terms of substantive and procedural aspects.  Illegal  access to information systems, data and system interference, and misuse of devices  are criminalized by the Georgia criminal code. The Personal Data Protection Act was  enacted by Parliament in 2011 and is intended to ensure protection of human rights  and freedoms, including the right to privacy, in the course of personal data processing.2  7.1.2  Cybersecurity regulation  Sultanate of Oman established the eGovernance Framework, a set of standards / best  practices and process management systems to enhance the delivery of government  services in alignment with the mission of e.oman (Sultanate of Oman Digital Oman  Strategy and eGovernment). The framework spells out the rules and procedures that  ensure that government IT projects and systems are sustainable and in compliance  with the Information Technology Authority (ITA) strategies and objectives. It provides assurance about  the value of IT projects and framework for the management of IT-related risks. It helps in putting  controls to minimize risks and better delivery of IT initiatives3.  7.1.3 Cybersecurity training  Mauritius makes available training for law enforcement and judiciary which has  been conducted under the GLACY Project since 2013 and is still ongoing.  CERT-MU  also carried out cybersecurity trainings on digital forensic investigator professional  and network forensic (packet analysis) for law enforcement officers.

The New Zealand (NZ) Police is introducing a 3-tiered training program for specialist  cyber staff, investigators and then frontline staff. This is outlined in NZ Police's  Prevention First National Cybercrime Strategy 2014-2017 5. NZ Police also provides  training to the judiciary and prosecutors.  7.2 Technical  Examples for this pillar illustrate practices in areas such as existence of technical institutions, child  online protection and industry standards and certification.  7.2.1  National CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  Egypt provides computer emergency response team (EG-CERT) support to several  entities in the ICT sector, the financial sector as well as the government sector, in  order to help them tackle cybersecurity related threats. EG-CERT is expanding and is  currently upgrading its laboratories in the four key operational departments. Additional  laboratories are being planned for mobile cybersecurity and industrial control systems  cybersecurity6.  Brazil has three computer emergency response teams with different functions, namely:  the national CERT, a government CSIRT and a sector specific SCIRT. The Brazil Federal  Police participates in the I-24/7 global police communications system developed by  Interpol to connect law enforcement officers, including cybercrimes. There is also a  complementary Standard No. 17/IN01/DSIC/GSIPR that establishes guidelines for the  certification and accreditation for information and communication security professionals of the direct  and indirect Federal Public Administration.  7.2.2 Government CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  Luxembourg created a computer emergency response team (GOVCERT.LU) in 2011 to  help protect government computer systems and data as well as specific infrastructures  and is engaged at both national and international level under the name of NCERT. LU7. GOVCERT.LU is also a critical player in the event of a large cyber-attack affecting  country's ICT assets.  7.2.3 Sectoral CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  Sri Lanka created the Financial Sector Computer Security Incident Response Team  (FINCSIRT) in 2014 with responsibility for receiving, reviewing, processing and  responding to computer security alerts and incidents affecting banks and other licensed  financial institutions in the country8. FINCSIRT is a joint initiative of the Central Bank  of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka computer emergency response team and is steered and  funded by the banking sector. Related to FINCSIRT is LankaClear, the country's certification authority  owned by the Central Bank and commercial banks9.  4 http:// www. coe. int/ en/ web/ cybercrime/ news/-/ asset_ publisher/ S73WWxscOuZ5/ content/ glacy- support- to- mauritius-  judicial- training- courses- on- cybercrime- delivered  5 http:// www. dpmc. govt. nz/ sites/ all/ files/ publications/ nz- cyber- security- cybercrime- plan- december- 2015. pdf (page 10) 6 http:// www. egcert. org 7 https:// www. govcert. lu/ en/ ncert. html  8 http:// www. fincsirt. lk 9 http:// www. lankaclear. com/ about/ index. php  http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/news/-/asset_publisher/S73WWxscOuZ5/content/glacy-support-to-mauritius-judicial-training-courses-on-cybercrime-delivered http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/news/-/asset_publisher/S73WWxscOuZ5/content/glacy-support-to-mauritius-judicial-training-courses-on-cybercrime-delivered http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/publications/nz-cyber-security-cybercrime-plan-december-2015.pdf http://www.egcert.org https://www.govcert.lu/en/ncert.html http://www.lankaclear.com/about/index.php  41  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  7.2.4  Cybersecurity standards implementation framework for organizations  Malaysia created the Information Security Certification Body (ISCB), a department  of Cybersecurity Malaysia, which manages information security certification10. The  certification services are consistent with international standards and guidelines and  include among others the Malaysian Common Criteria Evaluation and Certification  (MyCC), which certifies security functions of ICT products based on the ISO/IEC 15408  international standard11.  Hungary national regulation lays out the framework for information security training for  state and local government officials12. The National University for Public Service (NKE)  is charged with training and establishing a certification system13. Certificates issued  include information security risk assessment and testing of electronic information  systems.  7.2.5  Child online protection  Singapore’s Internet Content Providers (ICPs) and Internet Access Service Providers  (IASPs) are licensable under the Broadcasting Act and they are required to comply  with the Internet Code of Practice to protect children online. Since 2012, all service  providers have been legally obligated to offer filtering services with Internet  subscriptions and to make this known to consumers when they subscribe or renew.  The Info-communications Media Development Authority also symbolically blocks 100 pornographic,  extremist or hate websites.  7.3  Organizational  Examples for this pillar illustrate practices where governments are organized by having a cybersecurity  strategy, a coordinating agency and compilation of indicators for tracking cybercrime.  7.3.1 Strategy  United Kingdom issued in 2016 its second five years National Cyber Security Strategy14.  The strategy, issued by the Cabinet Office, aims to make the country one of the  safest places in the world to carry out online business and doubles investment in  cybersecurity compared to the first plan.  Russian Federation officially adopted its National Security Strategy in 2000 and  National Security Concept of the Russian Federation as well as Concept of the Foreign  Policy of the Russian Federation in 2013. It established an Information Security  Doctrine of the Russian Federation in 2000 and each government entity in the Russian  Federation performs an annual audit of its own networks and systems in line with the  doctrine and the areas identified in the various strategies adopted.  10 http:// www. cybersecurity. my/ en/ our_ services/ iscb/ main/ detail/ 2327/ index. html  11 http:// www. iso. org/ iso/ catalogue_ detail. htm? csnumber= 50341  12 http:// njt. hu/ cgi_ bin/ njt_ doc. cgi? docid= 164331. 250717  13 http:// en. uni- nke. hu  14 https:// www. gov. uk/ government/ uploads/ system/ uploads/ attachment_ data/ file/ 567242/ national_ cyber_ security_  strategy_ 2016. pdf  http://www.cybersecurity.my/en/our_services/iscb/main/detail/2327/index.html http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50341 http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=164331.250717 http://en.uni-nke.hu https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf  42  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  7.3.2  Public consultation  Canada conducted a three-month public consultation on updating its cybersecurity  strategy, asking security professionals and citizens for inputs and views. The consultation  was done to help identify gaps and opportunities, bring forward new ideas to shape  Canada’s renewed approach to cybersecurity and capitalize on the advantages of new  technology and the digital economy15.  7.3.3 Responsible agency  Iceland created the Cyber Security Council, appointed by the Minister of the Interior  that is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the National Cyber Security  Strategy. In addition, a cyber security forum has been created as a collaborative venue  for representatives of public bodies who sit on the Cyber Security Council and of  private entities.  7.3.4 Cybersecurity metrics  Netherlands uses metrics annually in order to measure cybersecurity development at  a national level, summarized in the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands report16.  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) compiles disclosure reports, security  advisories and incidents using a registration system. The metrics allow trends to be  observed and acted on.  7.4 Capacity building  Examples of practices for capacity building include the aspects of developing the technical and human  resources for fighting cybercrime. This includes raising awareness about cybersecurity among the  public, the existence of cybersecurity standards and standards bodies, best practices guides, education  initiatives and research and development.  7.4.1  Standardization bodies  Romania created the National Standardization Organization17 to produce relevant  national standards on processes, tools and technologies for software products and  systems in the area of security in information technology. It also tests the standardization  integrity of encryption algorithms, authentication services and algorithms for  confidential services in compliance with accepted international standards18.  7.4.2  Good practice  Canada created the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization (IIROC) that is the  national self-regulatory organization overseeing investment dealers and their trading  activity in the country's debt and equity markets. IIROC published a cybersecurity best  practices guide for its members19.  15 http:// www. itworldcanada. com/ article/ breaking- news- ottawa- announces- public- consultation- on- cyber- security-  strategy/ 385740#ixzz4dm1QjsTu  16 https:// www. ncsc. nl/ english/ current- topics/ Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/ cyber- security- assessment-  netherlands- 2016. html  17 http:// www. asro. ro/  18 http:// www. asro. ro/ CTmementoSite. html#BM208  19 http:// www. iiroc. ca/ industry/ Documents/ CybersecurityBestPracticesGuide_ en. pdf  http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/breaking-news-ottawa-announces-public-consultation-on-cyber-security-strategy/385740#ixzz4dm1QjsTu http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/breaking-news-ottawa-announces-public-consultation-on-cyber-security-strategy/385740#ixzz4dm1QjsTu https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2016.html https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/Cyber+Security+Assessment+Netherlands/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-2016.html http://www.asro.ro/ http://www.asro.ro/CTmementoSite.html#BM208 http://www.iiroc.ca/industry/Documents/CybersecurityBestPracticesGuide_en.pdf  43  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  7.4.3 Cybersecurity research and development programmes  Germany signed an agreement in 2009 on cooperation in IT security research between  the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry of the  Interior (BMI). The IT Security Research programme covers research and development  in new information security technologies. The BMBF has been supporting three  research centres since 2011 that bring together leading university and non-university  establishments in cybersecurity 20.  Kenya Education Network, (KENET), is the National Research and Education Network  (NREN) of Kenya. KENET is the computer emergency response team (CERT) for the  academic community and is licensed by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA)  as a not-for-profit operator serving the education and research institutions. They most  notably provide affordable, cost-effective and low-congestion Internet bandwidth  services to member institution campuses in Kenya.  7.4.4 Public awareness campaigns  Latvia has published a series of articles on its national CERT portal about free-of- charge security solutions including anti-viruses, firewalls, NoScript, etc.21 Twice a year,  the national CERT organizes a campaign where people can bring their computers for  a check-up to see if they are infected, and it also distributes commercial anti-virus  installations during the campaigns that are made available free-of-charge for one year.  7.4.5 Cybersecurity professional training courses  Bulgaria established the International Cyber Investigation Training Academy in  2009, which is a non-governmental organization22. The academy aims to improve  the qualification of specialists working in the field of cybersecurity. It has trained over  1 300 people from both the public and private sectors.  7.4.6  National education programmes and academic curricula  Germany has several universities and institutes providing degrees and certificates  in information security23. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research funds the  KASTEL competence centre that offers training leading to a certificate equivalent to a  specialized master degree in IT security24. The Technical University of Darmstadt has  been offering a Master of Science Degree in IT security since 201025.  7.4.7  Incentive mechanisms  Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA) is committed to establishing a network  foundation for Internet users and Internet companies by improving competitiveness  of Internet services and reliability of Internet information and knowledge. KISA  supports start-ups to commercialize their business models and enhance competitive  edge in the field of security technology through programmes that aim to nurture  start-ups in the Internet-of-things, security, and Fintech industry. They also established the one-stop  20 https:// www. bmbf. de/ en/ cybersecurity- research- to- boost- germany- s- competitiveness- 1418. html  21 https:// www. esidross. lv/ category/ bezmaksas- risinajumi/ page/ 2/  22 http:// e- crimeacademy. com/  23 https:// www. bmbf. de/ en/ cybersecurity- research- to- boost- germany- s- competitiveness- 1418. html  24 http:// www. kastel. kit. edu  25 https:// www. tu- darmstadt. de/ studieren/ abschluesse/ master/ it- sicherheit- msc. en. jsp  https://www.bmbf.de/en/cybersecurity-research-to-boost-germany-s-competitiveness-1418.html https://www.esidross.lv/category/bezmaksas-risinajumi/page/2/ http://e-crimeacademy.com/ https://www.bmbf.de/en/cybersecurity-research-to-boost-germany-s-competitiveness-1418.html http://www.kastel.kit.edu https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/abschluesse/master/it-sicherheit-msc.en.jsp  44  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  service to support start-ups to gain ground not only in the domestic market but also the global market  to expand their business models.  7.4.8 Home-grown cybersecurity industry  Ireland has the largest proportion of the Information and Communication sector of its  economy compared to all other countries in Europe and is leveraging that advantage  to grow its cybersecurity industry. The country is drawing on existing incentives and  attractions with the aim of being a cybersecurity capital26. These incentives include a  favourable business environment and low taxes, a talented pool of highly skilled and  multilingual workers and a good base for access to European markets27.  7.5  Cooperation  This pillar considers collaborative efforts across national and international domains and between the  public and private sector.  7.5.1 Bilateral agreements  Finland is an active member of many organizations, such as the Council of Europe  (CoE), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United  Nations (UN). Finland has also joined the NATO Partnership for Peace and is engaged  in cooperation with the organization in, for example, crisis management. There is also  local partnership with Finnish company Codenomicon, which later was acquired by  Synopsys, to develop the national IDS system and automatic incident reporting service with FICORA28.  7.5.2  Multilateral agreements  Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden collaborate through the Nordic National CERT  Collaboration. This includes technical cooperation and cybersecurity exercises to assess and strengthen  cyber preparedness, examine incident response processes and enhance information sharing in the  region29.  7.5.3  Participation in international fora  Participation in international cybersecurity events, workshops and training is the one indicator where  virtually all countries score high on the GCI. Therefore, it is more revealing to describe one of the  most significant initiatives in this regard. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)30  was founded in 1990. Its members are security and incident response teams from the public, private  and academic sectors. It organizes an annual conference, technical colloquia and training workshops.  26 https:// www. siliconrepublic. com/ companies/ cybersecurity- hub- ireland  27 http:// www. idaireland. com/ how- we- help/ resources/ infographics/ ida- cyber- security/ IDA_ CYBER_ SECURITY. pdf  28 http:// formin. finland. fi/ public/ default. aspx? nodeid= 49303& contentlan= 2& culture= fi- FI  https:// www. synopsys. com/  services. html  29 https:// www. msb. se/ en/ Tools/ News/ Nordic- cyber- security- exercise- was- conducted- in- Linkoping/  30 www.

The partnership helped stop  34,550 potential attacks on government departments in the last six months of 2016,  or 200 incidents a day.  7.5.5 Interagency partnerships  The United States of America started its first cross-government security information  sharing agreement in 2015. The Multilateral Information Sharing Agreement (MISA)  binds government agencies from defence, health, justice, intelligence community and  energy to work collaboratively to enhance cybersecurity information sharing, with an  emphasis on information exchanges at machine speed33.  South Africa established the national cybersecurity hub to serve as a central point  for collaboration between industry, government and civil society on all cybersecurity  incidents. The cybersecurity hub is mandated by the National Cybersecurity Policy  Framework (NCPF) that was passed by Cabinet in 2012. The hub enhances interaction  and consultations as well as promoting a coordinated approach regarding engagements  with the private sector and civil society34.  31 https:// news. netcraft. com/ archives/ 2016/ 11/ 01/ the- chancellor- of- the- exchequer- sets- out- plans- for- the- uk-  government- to- work- with- netcraft. html  32 https:// www. ncsc. gov. uk/ blog- post/ active- cyber- defence- tackling- cyber- attacks- uk  33 https:// www. ise. gov/ blog/ kshemendra- paul/ coordinating- cybersecurity- programs 34 https:// www. cybersecurityhub. gov. za/  https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/11/01/the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-sets-out-plans-for-the-uk-government-to-work-with-netcraft.html https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2016/11/01/the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-sets-out-plans-for-the-uk-government-to-work-with-netcraft.html https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/active-cyber-defence-tackling-cyber-attacks-uk https://www.ise.gov/blog/kshemendra-paul/coordinating-cybersecurity-programs https://www.cybersecurityhub.gov.za/  Global Cybersecurity Index 2017  47  8 Conclusion Cybersecurity is an increasingly important part of our life today, and the degree of interconnectivity of  networks implies that anything and everything can be exposed, and everything from national critical  infrastructure to our basic human rights can be compromised. Governments are therefore urged to  consider policies that support continued growth in technology sophistication, access and security,  and as a crucial first step, to adopt a national cybersecurity strategy.  The GCI 2017 edition measured the commitment of the ITU Member States to cybersecurity and  highlighted a number of illustrative practices from around the world. As a logical continuation of the  first iteration of the GCI issued in 2014, this version has motivated countries to improve their work  related to cybersecurity, raised awareness in countries for the need to start bilateral, multilateral  and international cooperation, and increased the visibility of what countries are doing to improve  cybersecurity.  However, the research also revealed that while increased Internet access and more mature  technological development is correlated with improvement in cybersecurity at the global level, this  is not necessarily true for countries with developing economies and lower levels of technological  development. The data collection shows that developing countries lack well-trained cybersecurity  experts as well as a thorough appreciation and the necessary education on cybersecurity issues for  law enforcement, and continued challenges in the judiciary and legislative branches. There is a need  for the developed world to help train local experts in cybersecurity, and more cooperation should be  initiated between developed and developing countries to assist them in cybersecurity development.  For the Global Cybersecurity Index to have an impact on raising awareness on this crucial emerging  concern over time, continuity of the GCI effort is essential. ITU therefore welcomes all Member States  and industry stakeholders to actively participate in future efforts to enhance the current reference  model. As well, the success of future iterations of the GCI largely depends on the engagement of  Member States and the quality of their responses to the questionnaire, and ITU calls on all Member  States to take part in the next GCI survey.  ITU would like to thank all Member States for their valuable support for the conduct of the GCI survey  and the publication of this report as well as future ones.

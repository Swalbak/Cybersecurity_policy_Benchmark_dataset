They play a critical role not only in maintaining the continuity of industrial processes but also to  ensure functional and technical safety, preventing large industrial accidents and environmental disasters.  The criticality of control systems in vital sectors, and high impact in case of disruption, makes them a major target  for malicious activities. Based on the ICS-CERT Monitor (part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security)1, between  2009 and 2014 the number of reported cyber  security incidents in the ICS-SCADA area increased  more than 27 times. At the same time more than  half of the incidents (59% in 2013) were aimed at  the energy and critical manufacturing sectors and  around 55% involved advanced persistent threats  (APT). Still many ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents  stay undetected or unreported.  This study reveals the current maturity level of ICS- SCADA cyber security in Europe and identifies good  practices used by European Member States to  improve this area.  The first and second part of this study introduces us  to the ICS-SCADA cyber security topic, explains the  role of ICS-SCADA in critical sectors and summarizes the methodology of this study.  During the desk research, current activities of different Member States in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security were  identified, including related activities, legislation status, existing cyber security strategies and the responsibility  matrix of entities dedicated to improve the level of ICS-SCADA cyber security in each country.  Following the research, the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model was used while performing a series of  interviews with designated officials from eight Member States. As a result, four Maturity Profiles were identified and  described in the third part of this study:   Leading - Member States with strong legislation and supporting mechanisms dedicated to ICS SCADA cyber  security improvement   Proactive Supporters - Member States focused on strong Critical Infrastructure operators support and driving  the ICS SCADA cyber security improvement   Reactive Supporters - Member States focused on lessons learned and reactive means of improving ICS SCADA  cyber security   Early Developers - Member States in the process of developing of legislation and supporting system to protect  ICS SCADA in Critical Infrastructure  1 https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov  2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014  Incidents 9 41 204 198 256 245  0  50  100  150  200  250  300  Figure 1 ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents 2009-2014  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  07  The analysis of maturity level reveals areas for improvement which are concluded in the fifth and last part of this  study. As a result, a set of high level and context specific future recommendations to policy and decision makers are  issued that include, among others:  Recommendation 1: Align ICS-SCADA efforts with national cyber security strategies and CIIP effort. Currently ICS- SCADA cyber security is not aligned with National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) and Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) efforts. National Cyber Security Strategies create a baseline for defining cyber space,  cyber security objectives and areas of actions. As the ICS-SCADA area is an integral part of the National and EU  cyberspace and Critical Infrastructures, it should be aligned with the NCSS as well as CIIP efforts.  Recommendation 2: Develop good practices specific to ICS-SCADA cyber security. Many Member States do not use  industry good practices as a reference to set-up an ICS-SCADA cyber security baseline for Critical Sectors. Multiple  guidelines, ICS-SCADA security standards and good practices are already developed in the ICS community as well as  by individual Member States. It is recommended to leverage from this to develop a minimum security baseline and  good practices for ICS-SCADA in Critical Sectors in EU.  Recommendation 3: Standardize information sharing among critical sectors and Member States. Information  sharing on ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents and good practices are not communicated in a standardized and  frequent manner.  A special emphasis should be given on standardizing information sharing of good practices and  known threats across critical sectors. A single platform and process (e.g. ICS CERT) to report cyber security incidents  and good practices should be in place. Trust between Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators and the  platform should be built to ensure effective communication from as well as towards the operators.  Recommendation 4: Build ICS-SCADA cyber security awareness. Special emphasis should be given on building  awareness of ICS-SCADA cyber security aspects not only across CII operators, but also among decision and policy  makers. Nowadays the awareness is built mainly on serious security breaches and incidents. This underlines the  more reactive approach, which should be moved towards a continuous awareness growth. As a consequence the  ICS-SCADA cyber security threats should be well understood and considered separate from Information Technology  (IT) security. This could be achieved by organizing ICS-SCADA cyber security related events involving sector specific  platforms to share current challenges and good practices. Knowledge sharing and awareness building should result  directly from the ICS-SCADA cyber security strategies.  Recommendation 5: Foster expertise with ICS-SCADA cyber security trainings and educational programmes.  Current ICS-SCADA cyber security threats multiply at a very rapid pace. Also several more robust and technology  advanced attacks (e.g. Advanced Persistent Threat - APT) are aimed at ICS systems. Moreover a lot of ICS-SCADA  cyber security aspects are considered the same as in IT. This basic misunderstanding very often leads to security  flaws in ICS-SCADA environments. A deep understanding of the process as well as the technology is needed in order  to perceive the real risk and focus area for improving ICS-SCADA cyber security. This is why it is so important to  develop future experts and leaders in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. This could be done by setting up and  supporting new study programs for ICS-SCADA security as well as organizing and promoting related trainings among  public bodies.  Recommendation 6: Promote and support ICS-SCADA cyber security research and test beds. It is necessary to  involve ICS-SCADA experts and system vendors in the process of addressing current and future cyber security related  threats. Support in research programmes and creation of common test-beds can foster ICS-SCADA cyber security  innovation and improve security-by-design concept.  The recommendations shall assist, both the European Commission and the Member States, in the process of  building resilient ICS-SCADA environment in Europe.

Introduction  The security of ICS-SCADA (Industrial Control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems) is  increasingly recognized as a high priority area among European Critical Infrastructure operators due to its  strategic impact on processes essential for uninterrupted functioning of the EU industries and economy. A  rapidly increasing number of incidents in the ICS-SCADA domain, many of which are confirmed or believed  to result from cyber-attacks, reveals the vulnerability and fragility of this area and highlights the importance  of continuous improvement of ICS-SCADA security for critical service providers. Furthermore, dependencies  of Critical Infrastructure across the EU increases the attack surface and potential impact of cyber incidents.  ENISA, as part of its activities, released a series of reports and documents tackling the topic of cyber security  in industrial control systems2:   Protecting Industrial Control Systems, Recommendations for Europe and Member States (2011)3   Can we learn from SCADA security incidents? (2013)4   Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems (2013)5   Window of exposure… a real problem for SCADA systems? (2013)6   Good Practices for an EU ICS Testing Coordination Capability (2013)7   Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals (2015)8  Furthermore, ENISA has established in 2014 an ICS Stakeholder Group. The role of this group is to provide  the opportunity for ICS/SCADA experts to address important issues to ENISA in its efforts to enhance ICS  security in the EU. It creates a common platform to enable ENISA consult providers, gather requirements,  concerns and share new ideas9.  Along with the EICS, in 2015 ENISA took over the coordination of EuroSCSIE (European SCADA and Control  Systems Information Exchange). This platform was created in June 2005 with the aim of sharing mutually  beneficial information regarding electronic security threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, and solutions; acting  as cross-country facilitator for the exchange of good practices and information and supporting the EU- Countries policy makers on the matter of Critical Infrastructure Protection10.  2 Official ENISA Internet page - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure- and-services/scada-industrial-control-systems  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/protecting-industrial-control-systems.-recommendations-for-europe-and-member-states  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/can-we-learn-from-scada-security-incidents  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/ics-cerc/good-practice-guide-for-certs- in-the-area-of-industrial-control-systems  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/window-of-exposure-a-real-problem-for-scada-systems  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/good-practices-for-an-eu-ics-testing-coordination-capability  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/certification-of-cyber-security-skills-of-ics-scada-professionals  9 „Terms of reference for an ENISA ICS Security Stakeholder Group” -  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ics- security/EICSSGTermsofReference.pdf  10 https://espace.cern.ch/EuroSCSIE/default.aspx  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  10  Role of the ICS solutions in Critical Infrastructure security  ‘Critical Infrastructure’ means an asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential  for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of  people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a  result of the failure to maintain those functions11.  The ICS-SCADA environment is the fundamental component of European and national Critical  Infrastructures. Most sectors rely on ICS-SCADA to ensure process control and safety which ensure continuity  of national critical functions. Vital sectors such as energy, oil & gas, water or chemical, rely on industrial  control systems to supervise and control their key processes. As industries lean towards pervasive process  automation and maintenance-free operations, the role of ICS-SCADA in the business continuity aspect of  those sectors is even greater.  The latest transformation changed the ICS-SCADA environment from proprietary, isolated systems to open  architectures and standard technologies. Critical infrastructure operators demand high quality, real time  information to make more accurate and justified business decisions. The technological agenda of tomorrow  is focused among other things on the following topics: Internet of Things, smart infrastructures, E-Health,  Connected retail and Industry 4.0. A good example is the Industry 4.0, which is a collective term for  technologies and concepts of value chain organization' which draws together Cyber-Physical Systems, the  Internet of Things and the Internet of Services.12. The term “Industry 4.0” refers to the idea of a fourth  industrial revolution, and originates from the high-tech strategy of the German government, which  promotes the computerization of critical manufacturing13.  The move towards connecting ICS-SCADA and IT environments, however, results in an increased attack  surface, thus exposing the critical functions to higher cyber security risks. The priority of ICS-SCADA security  results from the great impact on national and European critical functions. The interdependencies of Critical  Infrastructures across the EU, may result in a cascading effect in case of a successful cyber-attack.  ICS-SCADA cyber-attacks, on the other hand, are becoming more robust and aimed at specific control system  technologies. The Aurora vulnerability14 and Stuxnet15 are examples of advanced and well prepared attacks,  which were dedicated to exploit unknown vulnerabilities of particular control systems.  11 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection.  12 http://www.snom.mb.tu-dortmund.de/cms/de/forschung/Arbeitsberichte/Design-Principles-for-Industrie-4_0- Scenarios.pdf  13 http://www.bmbf.de/en/19955.php  14 http://www.powermag.com/what-you-need-to-know-and-dont-about-the-aurora-vulnerability  15 http://www.langner.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/To-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  11  Objective of the study  In order to align, properly address and pave the road for future efforts in ICS-SCADA security, ENISA has  analysed the current maturity levels in ICS-SCADA across Europe and drawn conclusions on different national  approaches. The aim is to present the current national ICS-SCADA security status and to provide the  stakeholders with a set of recommendations on how they can improve their practices, especially regarding  critical sectors.  The objective of this study is to:   Address the current cyber security maturity levels as regards the ICS-SCADA protection in the  European Member States;   Identify, at European level, the thematic areas/indicators of maturity and lessons learnt from the ICS- SCADA security practices followed by Member States in critical sectors; and   Issue a set of high level and context specific future recommendations to policy and decision makers  that will assist, both the European Commission and the Member States, in the process of building  resilient ICS-SCADA in Europe.  Target Audience  The goal of this paper is to inform policy makers and critical service providers on the current ICS-SCADA  cyber security agenda in the EU Member States, and identify key areas for improvement. In particular the  intended target audience is:   Relevant national authorities   The European Commission   ICS- SCADA stakeholders   The CIIP community at large  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  12  2.  Methodology for the assessment of ICS Cyber Security maturity  The ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Analysis was conducted on the basis of publicly available information  and interviews with relevant national authorities in various Member States. For the purpose of this  assessment of maturity levels in each Member State, an ICS SCADA security maturity model was developed.  The entire study was divided into three tasks:  Task 1 - Desk research  The desk research was conducted on publicly available information which covered both Europe-wide and  Member State activities as well as legislation in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. Information was  collected on existing governance models, practices, policies and critical sectors activities followed by  Member States.  Task 2 - Series of interviews  Interviews were held with relevant experts about ICS-SCADA security practices and policies in eight selected  Member States. The interviews were conducted on government level with representatives responsible for  cyber security of Critical Infrastructure assets. Interviews were based on a questionnaire developed together  with an  ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model. For one Member State, the relevant authority submitted  the questionnaire without interview. The questionnaire was used to validate desk research, assess the  maturity level of the Member States and identify possible gaps and underline good practices. Thematic areas  used within the questionnaire were consistent with ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model and covered:   Legislation in the area of obligations of CI operators concerning ICS SCADA security,   Support provided by Member State administration to the Critical Infrastructure operators,   Local conditions of the ICS-SCADA security improvement process (progress, restraints, objectives).  Task 3 - Summary list of all security requirements  Development of an aggregated list of key findings and lessons learnt in the process of securing resilient ICS- SCADA for Europe’s critical sectors. Preparation of this report, which interprets and presents aggregated  results from the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model.  In order to facilitate the work 8 Member States were involved in this study:   Estonia (RIA – Estonian Information System Authority)   France (ANSSI - French Network and Information Security Agency)   Germany (BSI – German Federal Office for Information Security)   Lithuania (Ministry of National Defence)   Netherlands (NCSC – Dutch National Cyber Security Centrum)   Poland (RCB – Polish Government Centre for Security)   Spain (INCIBE – Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute)   Sweden (MSB – Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency)  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  13  All information on ICS-SCADA cyber security in the EU collected during the interviews were documented and  additionally confirmed with interviewees. As for the information gathered during desk research, only reliable  sources such as official publications of government entities or agencies were taken into consideration. The  full list of research sources is included in Bibliography.  The captured data were analysed with the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model in order to supplement  the qualitative research with quantitative analysis. The collected data was aggregated to identify existing  profiles which represent different approach to ICS-SCADA cyber security in the  EU. Additionally good  practices and lessons learned captured across different Member State were collected and highlighted in the  Report within chapters dedicated to particular aspects of ICS-SCADA maturity.  A draft of the study was sent for comment and preview to all the stakeholders involved and also to the  members of the ENISA ICS stakeholder group and EURO SCSIE. A validation workshop was held in  Luxembourg on the 30th of September 2015 and findings and recommendations were discussed and  validated.  Figure 2: Geographic distribution of Member States covered by the study  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  14  ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Assessment Model  To identify the level of cyber security maturity in Critical Sectors in the EU, the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security  Maturity Model was created. The maturity model is dedicated to ICS-SCADA security in Critical Infrastructure  and should be treated as an integral part of this analysis.  The model was built from three major operating  model dimensions further divided into nine operating model sub-dimensions. The three major dimensions  include:  The Legislation - Operating Model Dimension  describes how advanced is the legal model of  particular Member States in terms of ICS-SCADA  cyber security improvement. It covers  responsibilities, regulations and policy activities in  the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security at Member  States level.  The Support - Operating Model Dimension captures  how efficient Member States support critical service  providers in improving ICS-SCADA cyber security by  actively participating in cyber security assessments  and development processes. It identifies actions  aiming at increasing awareness, gathering and  propagation of information on existing good  practices.  The Local Conditions - Operating Model Dimension  reports the opportunities and challenges in terms of  ICS-SCADA cyber security improvement and  identifies focus areas for the future.  Operating Model Dimensions are further dived into Operating Model Sub-Dimensions to specify thematic  areas, structure the research and allow comparative analysis between different Member States.  Table 1: ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model Dimensions  OPERATING MODEL DIMENSION OPERATING MODEL SUB-DIMENSION DESCRIPTION  Legislation  EU Directives & State Legislation  How do the EU and Member States  create policy landscapes to support ICS- SCADA cyber security?  Leading Standards Adaptation  Do Member States utilize industry  standards to enhance ICS-SCADA  security in Critical Information  Infrastructure?  Good Practices Adaptation  Do Member States develop a systematic  approach to collect and exchange good  practices among Critical Service  providers?  Support Incentive System  Do Member States support Critical  Service providers and encourage them  to improve ICS-SCADA cyber security?  Figure 3: Dimensions of ICS-SCADA Security Maturity Model  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  15  OPERATING MODEL DIMENSION OPERATING MODEL SUB-DIMENSION DESCRIPTION  Education Solution  Do Member States support Academics  and promote ICS-SCADA cyber security  knowledge?  Cyber Security Agencies  Do Member States appoint dedicated  bodies to support ICS-SCADA cyber  security incidents?  Local Conditions  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  How efficiently do Member States plan  and execute ICS-SCADA cyber security  improvements?  Lessons Learned  Do Member States monitor the results  of their ICS-SCADA cyber security  improvement activities and take the  proper corrective actions?  Restraints  How well do Member States cope with  limitations affecting ICS-SCADA cyber  security improvements?  Operating Model Sub-Dimensions are the thematic areas which determine the maturity level of ICS-SCADA  cyber security in Member States. To capture the accurate level of maturity an underlying questionnaire was  prepared to describe and valuate each Operating Model Sub-Dimension. The questionnaire included 82  questions divided into parts corresponding to the nine sub dimensions described above and (where feasible)  with reference to the lifecycle of a process:   Create - How is the process developed?   Implement - How is the process deployed?   Monitor - How is the process reported and monitored?   Modify - How is the process adapted and changed?  Answers for each question were scored against a 5 level scale with clearly defined, question independent  criteria. To ensure reliability of the results, when answers were gathered during the interview, assessment  criteria were not shared with the interviewed stakeholders. The maturity levels used for the purpose of the  study were:   Basic – activities aren’t conducted,   Developing - activities are under development or conducted on ad-hoc manner,   Established - activities are regularly conducted on the basic level,   Advanced - activities are implemented with a deep understanding of ICS-SCADA specific requirements,   Leading - activities are implemented in the level that exceeds current, basic needs (are design to address  needs which arrival is foreseen).  To complement the analysis, information on additional non-standard activities around cyber security in ICS- SCADA area for individual Member States was taken into consideration. The mixed research methodology  (qualitative and quantitative) provides advantages by relegating qualitative analysis to an exploratory tool.  It gives a broader perspective over the cyber security maturity subject and enables to capture patterns and  make statistical analysis which makes the study more comprehensive.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  16  3. State of ICS security within the EU  ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels across EU Member States result from a number of variables which  make up the presented Maturity Model. Based on the multidimensional analysis, the following four ICS- SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Profiles where observed:  Table 2: Cyber Security Maturity Profiles  TABLE HEADING DESCRIPTION  Leading With  a strong legislation and supporting mechanisms dedicated to ICS SCADA cyber  security improvement  Proactive Supporters Focused on strong CI operators support and driving the ICS SCADA cyber security  improvement  Reactive Supporters Focus on lessons learned and reactive means of improving ICS SCADA cyber security  Early Developers In the process of developing of legislation and supporting system to protect ICS  SCADA in Critical Infrastructure  The profiles are based on the Desk Research as well as interviews with eight Member States who already  initiated actions related to ICS-SCADA cyber security. Some of Member States which were initially asked to  participate in the study openly declared that they were not ready to participate as they did not initiate any  activities in the ICS-SCADA security and they would not bring any value to the study. According to the  conducted desk research, it has been approximated that the percentage of such Member States is around  25% to 30%.  Each profile is characterized by a different focus on which the ICS-SCADA maturity is built. This is presented  on the “focus graph” for each Profile. Also determinants are presented to better understand the  characteristics of each ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity profile. Furthermore a SWOT analysis was  performed to identify strengths and weaknesses as well as seize opportunities to improve the level of ICS- SCADA cyber security.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  17  Profile 1: Leaders  Member States with the highest ICS-SCADA Cyber Security  Maturity Level. They are characterized by a developed  legal system and strategic vision which drives cyber  security improvement initiatives in Critical Sectors.  “Leaders” have a very controlled and settled approach  over ICS-SCADA cyber security and provide direct  legislation to support it. The CI Operators are obliged to  report incidents and incentive measures are in place to  ensure compliance with minimal security requirements in  the corresponding sector.  “Leaders” have significant ICS-SCADA cyber security  awareness (government, CI operators) and a high level of public-private collaboration in this area. Dedicated  groups responsible for CIP are skilled and trained in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. Academic and  scientific centres are involved in the research and development process of ICS-SCADA cyber security  countermeasures.  Leading ICS cyber security standards are utilized in order to create own guidelines for CI  Operators. Leaders are open to share knowledge and educate other Member States in this area.  Furthermore ICS-SCADA security is covered by Member States cyber security strategies, current security  level is monitored (e.g. by audits). In order to ensure “security by design” ICS-SCADA suppliers are involved  and certification processes for critical assets are being developed and planned to be implemented.  0  1  2  3  4  5 UE Directives & State Legislation  Leading Standards Adaptation  Best Practices Adaptation  Incentive System  Education solutionsCyber Security Agencies  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  Lessons Learned  Restrains  Leaders  Determinants of the profile:   Strong EU economies   High level of automation and  digitalization   Mature cyber security policy  Figure 4 Focus Graph - Profile 1  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  18  Below the SWOT analysis is presented for the Leaders Profile. It identifies strengths and weaknesses of the  profile as well as opportunities to improve the level of ICS-SCADA cyber security.  STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES  IN TE  R N  A L   Long-time planning on the ICS-SCADA  security improvement process   Deep understanding of ICS-SCADA role in the  CIP   Established cooperation between CI  operators and government   Security-by-design approach - asset  certification process in development   Lack of incentive systems to promote ICS SCADA cyber  security improvements   Still very few research programs to the ICS SCADA  security improvement  OPPORTUNITIES THREATS  EX TE  R N  A L  ICS-SCADA cyber security good practices  shared across EU (Member States with lower  maturity may benefit from Leaders  experiences)   Few number of experts on the market with ICS-SCADA  security background (ICS-SCADA security matters  handled by personnel with purely IT background)  The study describes Leaders as mature Member States with various efforts identified in the area of ICS- SCADA cyber security including long term planning, alignment with CIIP efforts, trust between responsible  government bodies and critical sectors as well as preventive activities including auditing and/or testing.  This role model can be followed among all Member States to leverage from previous experiences and is an  opportunity to support attempts towards higher level of ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity across EU.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  19  Profile 2: Proactive supporters  The “Proactive supporters” include Member States  whose main focus is on equipping Critical Infrastructure  operators with the necessary tools to continuously  improve ICS-SCADA cyber security level. Strong  government support and public-private partnership  distinguish this profile. Academic and scientific centres  are involved in the research and development process.  Proactive measures are being developed with a very close  cooperation with internal (government, CI operators) and  external (academics, private agencies) stakeholders. To  obtain this, information sharing platforms are developed  and working groups are settled.  The “Proactive supporters” put incentive systems in place in order to support CI operators and promote ICS- SCADA cyber security initiatives (e.g. use of EU funds for ICS-SCADA testing).  The Member States are strongly focused on building ICS-SCADA security awareness and understating among  CI operators and the society, by enabling access to knowledge and specialized trainings. They create ICS  cyber security guidelines in a cooperation with a wide ICS-SCADA community.

This “Proactive Supporters” create a good environment for knowledge and information sharing and may be  a good source of ICS-SCADA cyber security good practices.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  21  Profile 3: Reactive supporters  The “Reactive supporters” approach the ICS-SCADA cyber  security by taking reactive actions and answering the  rising need for cyber security on an ongoing basis. The  main focus is on improvement of identified vulnerabilities  or response after cyber security incidents (not  particularly in this Member State).  Most of the ICS-SCADA related activities result from the  awareness activities regarding relevant threats, not from  the legislation itself. Organized working groups divided  into individual critical sectors gather good practices and  lessons learned for improvement of the ICS-SCADA cyber  security level.  The role of monitoring and improving ICS-SCADA cyber security is often informal and is combined with IT  security activities.  The “Reactive supporters” understand the need for more specific legislation in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber  security and put this high on their future agenda.

This approach, however, does not provide sufficient means to leverage from this knowledge to ensure  proactive process of improving the level of ICS-SCADA cyber security in Critical Sectors.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  23  Profile 4: Early Developers  The “Early Developers” are characterized by a low  maturity level of ICS-SCADA cyber security.  Cyber security legislation to distinguish Critical  Infrastructure and developed ICS-SCADA related  cyber security agenda, exists for less than 3 or even  2 years.  The list of critical assets has either been identified  recently or has not been identified yet. Furthermore  no guidelines on ICS-SCADA security have been  developed yet.  The public-private partnership and academic involvement is in the very initial phase. There is little expertise  in the area of cyber security in industrial control systems, thus little awareness of good practices and leading  standards.  Determinants of the profile:   Cyber Security legislation  implemented less than 2-3  years ago   Limited awareness  activities and expertise in the  area of ICS-SCADA cyber  security  0 1 2 3 4 5 Legislation  SupportLocal Conditions  0  1  2  3  4  5  UE Directives & State Legislation  Leading Standards Adaptation  Best Practices Adaptation  Incentive System  Education solutionsCyber Security Agencies  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  Lessons Learned  Restrains  Early Developers  Figure 7 Focus Graph - Profile 4  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  24  Below a SWOT analysis is presented for the Early Developers Profile.

STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES  IN TE  R N  A L  Basic legislation background for Critical  Infrastructure Protection is usually already  in place   Long-time planning (but are on much earlier  stage than leaders)   Little or no private-public partnerships   ICS-SCADA treated as traditional IT   No guidelines of how to protect critical assets   Limited expertise (and experiences) in the area of ICS-  SCADA cyber security  OPPORTUNITIES THREATS  EX TE  R N  A L  Opportunities to benefit from experiences of  other, more mature Member States   Use of available materials and programmes  developed by other Member States in the  area of ICS-SCADA cyber security   Low trust between CI stakeholders may significantly  slower the ICS-SCADA improvement process  For “Early Developers” there are usually only few initiatives which can be identified to be ICS-SCADA specific.  Most of the early developing Member States begin with legislation which very often focuses on cyber  security in general instead of distinguishing ICS-SCADA as a separate topic.  “Early Developers”, however, often leverage from already existing legislation and good practices which is an  opportunity for more dynamic growth in ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity.  The difficulty which may be observed are resulting from low awareness, little ICS-SCADA cyber security  expertise and little trust for public-private partnership.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  25  4. ICS-SCADA cyber security activities in Member States  The following describes the activities and good practices among EU Member States in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber  security.  The activities presented in this part of the study result from the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model,  performed interviews with relevant Member States officials as well as desk research. They are divided into the  following thematic areas:   Organizational structures   Regulations and Policies   Assets covered   Auditing and certification   Incident handling   Incentives   Education   Trainings and courses   R&D   Information sharing   Public-Private Partnership   Objectives and restraints  Next to each thematic area an example of good practices is shown with the indication of a respective Member State.  Organizational structures  The “Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European  Critical Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection” not only points out the  need to designate and protect Critical Infrastructure but also identifies actors responsible for different  activities at high level.  At the EU level the European Commission acts as the executive body responsible for proposing legislation and  implementing decisions. The Commission may also support Member States in identifying Critical  Infrastructure on an ongoing basis.The Council Directive, however, acts only as a general framework for  Critical Infrastructure Protection. The details on taking specific actions are under the responsibility of each  Member State. This also includes the responsibility for specifying ICS-SCADA cyber security requirements for  CI operators.  The Council Directive also suggests the designation of Security Liaison Officers for all identified ECIs in order  to facilitate cooperation and communication with relevant national Critical Infrastructure protection  authorities.16  Next to the main EU institutions, dedicated agencies and organizations are driving ICS-SCADA cyber security  efforts. To enforce activities related to network and information security (also including ICS-SCADA) as well as  help European Commission, Member States and business community, to address, respond and prevent  network and information security problems, ENISA was established in 2004. Under ENISA, the ICS Stakeholder  16 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection (OJ L 345, 23.12.2008, p. 75–82).  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  26  Group was created, in order to enhance the current efforts in improving ICS-SCADA cyber security across the  EU. In 2015, ENISA took over also the coordination of EuroSCSIE (European SCADA and Control Systems  Information Exchange). The aim of EuroSCSIE was initially to share information on electronic security threats,  vulnerabilities, incidents and solutions as well as support Member States policy makers on the matter of  Critical Infrastructure Protection17.  At Member States’ level various approaches regarding organizational structures is observed. Different roles  within Member States can be divided into responsible, accountable, consulted and informed. Some Member  States (e.g. Poland) directly implemented EU recommendation from the Council Directive 2008/114/EC.  Poland  Activities related to ICS-SCADA cyber security in Critical Infrastructure is the responsibility of RCB18  (Rzadowe Centrum Bezpieczenstwa) who coordinates the creation of Critical Infrastructure Protection  Plans. RCB is subordinate to the President of the Council of Ministers. Moreover Security Liaison Officers  are designated in each Critical Infrastructure operator to inform RCB about major security incidents.  Others implemented their own, more extensive structures divided into each critical sector and including  incident response capabilities:  France; Germany  In France and Germany a single security authority is responsible for Critical Infrastructure cyber security  regulation, respectively German Federal Office for Information Security - BSI19 and French Network and  Information Security Agency - ANSSI20.  They establish working groups dedicated to critical sectors (and sub-sectors were relevant). The output  of these committees is further validated by the security authority and/or concerned ministries. A group  dedicated to ICS-SCADA cyber security is in place to study and adapt good practices across critical  sectors.  Regulations and Policies  The backbone for the ICS-SCADA cyber security has been established by “The Council Directive 2008/114/EC  of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the  assessment of the need to improve their protection” which defined European Critical Infrastructure (ECI), CI  protection, and the concept of the ECI owner (operator). The Directive also defines fundamental duties  imposed on Member States with regard to ECI protection. Since then, European Member States have started  to implement local regulations in the area of CIP, including those concerning cyber security of industrial assets  (ICS-SCADA). For now three main kinds of regulation are implemented:   Obligation of reporting on cyber incidents regarding Critical Infrastructure assets  17 http://www.gcsec.org/  18 http://rcb.gov.pl/eng/  19 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html  20 www.ssi.gouv.fr/  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  27  Such obligations have been implemented by all Member States covered by this study, which managed to  formally identify its CI assets. Depending from the Member State, the incident may be reported directly to the  entity responsible for the CI cyber security (e.g. in France, CI operators report security incidents to ANSSI) or  through the national CERT (e.g. Lithuania). Besides that, some countries developed a dedicated, regulated  communication channel between CI operators and responsible government entities. Such an example is  Poland.  Poland  According to the “Polish Act on Crisis Management 21 from April 26, 2007”, every CI operator is obliged  to have a clearly appointed person who acts as a primary contact with entities responsible for CI  protection. This obligation has been additionally clarified by an “Act from March 18, 2010”  which states,  that the Management Board of a particular critical systems owner (supply of fuels and energy  resources), in agreement with Director of RCB and the Ministry of State Treasury appoints a duly  authorised representative responsible for the CI protection. The representative is an employee of the  company, who monitors activities of the Management Board in relation to actions that may affect the  continuous functioning of critical systems. This representative can act as a contact person mentioned  in previous paragraph. Every quarter of the year, this representative drafts a report on the condition of  CI protection in the company in question (so much more than just reporting on incidents), including the  condition of cyber security. A copy of the report is sent to the Director of RCB.   Obligation of fulfilling minimal security requirements  Some countries have implemented industrial sector specific minimal security requirements with which  CI operators have to be compliant (e.g. France). Even more countries are currently working on  promulgating legal instruments on minimal security requirements.  Germany  In Germany, detailed regulations specific for each Critical Infrastructure sector are promulgated by  working committees (one committee for each sector) composed of BSI personnel and representatives  of CI operators. Each committee defines minimal requirements for securing ICS SCADA in each  corresponding sector.   Obligation to develop CIP plans  Some EU Member States require by means of a regulation the development of CIP plans (including cyber  security area). These regulations impose the obligation for CI owners to develop Critical Infrastructure  Protection Plans addressing  a description of threats, possible scenarios and implemented risk  mitigation measures. The regulation refers to security in different areas: legal, physical, personnel and  cyber. The advantage of such an approach is that protection of each CI site is treated as a whole system,  which elements correspond to each other.  Spain  According to Spanish regulations, every Critical Infrastructure Operator has to develop a security plan  or \"Plan de Seguridad (PSO)\" to lay out its Security Policy, Scope, Risk Assessment Methodology and  guidelines for implementing the proper security measures in its infrastructure.  21 http://rcb.gov.pl/eng/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACT-on-Crisis-Management-final-version-31-12-2010.pdf  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  28  Poland  CIP plans were introduced in Poland through “Regulation of the Council of Ministers on Critical  Infrastructure Protection Plans, April 30, 2010”. Every Critical Infrastructure Operator, who has been  identified as such, has to develop a Critical Infrastructure Protection plan. The plan has to be updated  every two years and it has to be agreed with national crisis management system stakeholders  (protection of CI is part of the national crisis management system).  Assets covered  In 2015, ENISA released a guide entitled: Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information  Infrastructure assets and services. Although the guide is focused on the identification of the data  communication networks, described methodologies can be used for identification of other CI assets, including  ICS-SCADA solutions supporting Critical Services22.  In this study, we focus on the problem of identification of ICS-SCADA assets only. Generally, the main problem  from the perspective of entities responsible for Member States cyber security in the context of CIP, is how to  ensure that all ICS-SCADA assets which support services considered critical from the Member States  perspective are identified and covered by CIP activities. Generally, Member States who have already identified  their critical assets choose one of the two following approaches:  4.3.1 The State-driven approach  The state creates definitions regarding the conditions under which assets are considered to be critical. These  definitions are being communicated to the CI operators who on this basis develop their list of critical assets.  4.3.2 The operator driven approach  The Member States are involved in the definition of Critical Infrastructure (physical locations) based on the  criticality of the services. Following the creation of such a list, the critical assets (e.g. ICS systems) are  identified by the Critical Infrastructure operator alone based on a risk analysis. In this approach, a list of  Critical Infrastructure is created in cooperation with government and CI operators. The list usually includes  the names and locations of physical sites responsible for Critical Services. Then, each CI operator on the basis  of risk analysis techniques identifies threats scenarios which can influence continuity of each site operations.  This covers all kind of threats, including cyber threats related to ICS-SCADA. On the basis of risk analysis, a  CIP plan is created, which later is agreed upon with national entities responsible for crisis management.  Observation:  Not all Member States identified their Cricial Assets, including ICS-SCADA.  Information sharing  Building up partnerships between Critical Infrastructure operators (including those privately owned) and  government institutions is crucial for successful building of CIP systems, as it allows for achieving mutual  understanding of needs, priorities and restraints. Entities responsible for CI cyber security on the national  level require a proper communication from CI operators to receive feedback on effectiveness of actions they  conduct and for proper identification of assets which are critical to the performance of processes which are  22 “Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets and services. Guidelines for  charting electronic data communication networks.” ENISA, 2014  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  29  important to society. CI operators on the other hand require a clear communication on government  requirements and the purpose of operations that are expected from them.  Most Member States choose to build up partnerships on the basis of working groups dedicated to the  development of some particular products, such us security guidelines or minimal security requirements  dedicated to the various industrial sectors.  For example, ANSSI (France) established 18 working groups dedicated to critical sectors (and sub-sectors when  deemed relevant). These committees are responsible for drafting proposals of regulations (specific  requirements) for cyber security measures in the corresponding sectors. These proposals are then validated  by several public administrations including ANSSI and the concerned ministries.  Apart from these working groups for regulation development, another wider working group exists which deals  specifically with ICS SCADA security and aims at gathering information and adapting good practices. This group  prepared inter alia a Protection Profile for industrial automation devices and systems such as PLC, SCADA  Server, MES Server, Engineering Software, etc. This group has also produced the guides “Cybersecurity for  industrial control systems: Classification method and key measures” and “Cybersecurity for industrial control  systems: Detailed measures”, and the document “Training guide for ICS cybersecurity”.  Some countries, apart from product focus groups, build up ICS SCADA security community on the basis of  periodic thematic meetings.  Netherlands  The Dutch Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) are usually CI-sector specific security  oriented public-private platforms. Organizations can exchange their cyber security problems  experiences (incidents and best practices) in confidence and anonymously. Following an analysis, a  warning can be issued to all participating organizations about a threat, vulnerability or incident, or  about a good practice that can be applied to mitigate a risk. Most ISACs organize tactical level  professionals from public or private CI operators. The technical and ISAC secretariat support is funded  facilitated by the NCSC-NL. ISAC communication runs via closed mailing lists, tele-conferences, and  physical meetings which are held on a regular basis.  As generally some sort of cooperation between CI operators and government entities responsible for ICS  SCADA exist in the majority of Member States covered by study, some Member States referred to lack of trust  between the two sites as a significant constraint in the process of ICS SCADA security improvement (or listed  of building such a trust in a priority goals for the nearest future). From the discussions with various CI  operators, it may be stated that such lack of trust originates from two sources:   CI operators are afraid of sharing the information about any existing security problems with  government, as they believe that at some point this information can be used against them (e.g. after  implementation of law which imposes penalties). This anxiety is especially strong in publicly own  companies, where management boards are to some extent dependent on political decisions,   CI operators do not believe that government entities understand constraints and needs of their business  processes. This may lead to the situation, when government representatives with some limited  knowledge on the processes conducted by operators and their dependencies will try to enforce security  controls, which from CI operator’s perspective are considered as non-cost-effective. To protect  themselves from such situation, absurdly some CI operators choose to share only very limited  information (only those which is required from them by law) to keep government in opinion that  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  30  “everything what is needed has already been done, there is nothing else to improve” (what is  interesting, this kind of approach was observed not only on only on government / operators level but  also even within large companies – e.g. company HQ / local branches).  As any Member State which already established a various working groups some time ago did not listed lack of  trust as significant problem, this shows how important it is to build a community around CIP, including area  of ICS-SCADA security. As building a trust takes time, the sooner any kind of cooperation is started, the greater  chance that it will contribute to the development of effective CIP program. Most of high quality ICS-SCADA  security guidebooks released in various Member States have been developed in cooperation between  government entities and CI operators.  Observation:  Low trust between CII operators and public bodies and non-standardized approach for information sharing  among Critical Sectors across Member States.  Auditing and certification  Implementation of auditing programmes always requires answering two questions:  1. What should be audited?  2. What should be the reference point to the audit?  This is why implementation of auditing and certification in the area of CIP is strictly related to the maturity of  particular MS in the area of critical assets identification and legislation. Independently from the results of the  maturity level assessment, most Member States consider future implementation of auditing and certification  programmes.  Germany  Germany is one example of MS currently in the process of implement an auditing system. As regulations  regarding the definition of critical assets and minimal security requirements are still being developed,  no audit process has been implemented yet. After the corresponding executive orders are published,  critical assets owners will have a 2 year period to implement the required controls. Audits will be  conducted every two years by commercial companies, which manage to obtain BSI accreditation. For  noncompliance with regulation penalties are foreseen up to 100 000€. The described model of  obligatory audits conducted by accredited companies is the approach which is considered or already  implemented by most Member States (in some cases however no penalties are foreseen).  A separate, but interesting and important case, is a certification program which is being currently developed  in France.  France  Unlike other initiatives, France initiated a program dedicated to certification of ICS devices and service  providers. The program is eventually going to bring benefits to both ICS vendors (who will be able to  get independent confirmation that their products are being developed with a certain level of security)  and users (who will be able to consciously choose devices which have been developed with security in  mind). If the program is successful, it may be reasonable to consider its expansion to the whole EU.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  31  Incident handling  The ability to respond to and mitigate the impact of ICS incidents is crucial to ensure security and continuity  of Critical Services in Member States. However to provide meaningful support to critical service providers,  appropriate resources need to be maintained.  Most of todays’ incident handling capabilities in the EU, however, are limited to IT cyber security only. Limited  resources are dedicated specifically to the industrial control environment. Sector specific agencies are often  involved in the process of investigation/monitoring/ response to ICS SCADA cyber security incidents.  Spain  The Secretaría de Estado de Telecomunicaciones y para la Sociedad de la Información (Secretary of State  for Telecommunications and the Information Society) has concluded an agreement in which, amongst  other matters, the terms for joint work between CNPIC and the Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad  (National Institute of Cybersecurity – INCIBE) in the field of Response to Incidents for Spanish-based  Information Technology Critical Infrastructures are laid out. This sets out how INCIBE functions as a tool  for supporting CNPIC in the management of cybersecurity incidents.  Together, both institutions have set up a Security Incident Response Team, which specializes in the  analysis and management of information technology security problems and incidents. This Response  Team functions as a CERT, specialized in the management of Critical Infrastructure incidents on a  national level. Whenever a Critical Infrastructure suffers a cybersecurity problem, the operator  responsible for such matters can avail himself of the response team’s services, making the incident  known by means of the Single Contact Point set up to this end.  The ICS-SCADA incident handling topic has been recognized by ENISA in 2013, when recommendations for  emergency response capabilities in the area of ICS-SCADA were published.23 The report presents advantages  and disadvantages of different types of organizations: ICS sector specific, national, regional and global. It also  discusses the technical and organizational operational capabilities required for the provisioning of emergency  response services. ENISA also points out the need for an on-going co-operation between CERTS’s providing  response services and other ICS stakeholders (ICS system providers and vendors, other CERT’s, international  initiatives in the area of ICS-SCADA protection).  Incentives  Application of incentive systems to promote ICS-SCADA cyber security and increase investments in this area  is a subject of discussion as different approaches are presented by various Member States. Many Member  States do not believe that financial incentives are the right direction to build awareness and ICS-SCADA cyber  security backbone for Critical Infrastructure operators. The general belief is that Critical Infrastructure cyber  security lays under the responsibility of the operator itself, therefore no incentive should be in place.  On the  other hand incentives were most frequently indicated by CII operators, as the expected means of Member  States or EU support.  Three types of incentives in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security were identified, as possible to implement in  the future:  23 “Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems - Computer Emergency Response  Capabilities considerations for ICS” - ENISA 2013-12-04  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  32   Direct subsidy - refinancing of ICS-SCADA cyber security activities   Tax exemption - tax relief towards Critical Infrastructure operators resulting from obtaining ICS-SCADA  cyber security measures   Discounts on insurance rates - lower insurance cost towards Critical Infrastructure operators resulting  from obtaining ICS-SCADA cyber security measures  According to the study, only direct subsidies have been identified to be implemented in Estonia.  Estonia  As part of Critical Information Infrastructure protection, ICS security assessments are performed on a  voluntary basis, sponsored by the Estonian Government. As part of the security testing, also  comprehensive IT assessment is included. The security assessments included:   Information gathering from public sources: what kind of tools is each company using   Networks perimeters: how is possible to protect different types of networks   Workstation & servers   Remote access: facing Internet   Physical security: how much time security company takes to come   Disaster recovery plans, architecture, security policies, etc.  Awareness raising  Numerous Member States identified improvement on ICS-SCADA security awareness as one of the biggest  priorities for upcoming years.24 Several activities have been conducted to achieve this goal, but obtained  results are difficult to measure. It is also clear that this area has a potential for further improvement. As high  level of awareness is normal within personnel with an IT background, ICS engineers naturally focus themselves  on the system functionalities and availability. However, as the number of ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents  around the globe is rising and becomes a better-known topic, security researchers’s efforts are increasing  visibility and interest on the area. Such events naturally increase basic awareness in much broader a way than  any other, government run or supported activities, however they lack of deeper expertise and real educational  value. This is what makes a role of government entities and private associations so important. The following  educational activities are currently being conducted by Member States to support Critical Infrastructure  operators on ICS-SCADA security:   Development of whitepapers and guidebooks dedicated to the ICS-SCADA security  A lot of Member States government entities have published materials dedicated to the ICS-SCADA  security. Some of those have been prepared in working groups with representatives of various ICS  SCADA security stakeholders, e.g.: government entities, Critical Infrastructure operators, ICS-SCADA  solution vendors and private security associations. In many cases such approach allowed for achieving  of high quality of the prepared publications. The fact that some of those materials have been publicly  released not only in national languages, but in English as well, makes them useful for the whole EU  society.  In Annex A is available the list of a few most worth mentioning publications publicly available.

Training  Currently, there is a very limited number of available courses on the ICS-SCADA cyber security. Below is an  overview of the most notables examples. Related to this area, ENISA covered in 2015 also the topic of available  certifications for skills in ICS SCADA25.  INCIBE (Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad, Spain) has carried out the first MOOC Cyber Security Advanced  Course in Control Systems and Industrial Automation. This course has been designed and developed in  collaboration with leading Spanish industrial sector organizations and cybersecurity, as well as national and  international expert highly, thus ensuring that the course includes both the required content, the experiences  and advice of the most skilled professionals on the international scene. This course is taught through the  MOOC approach (Massive Open Online Courses), namely, Online, massive and open to everyone so through  the new training platform INCIBE.26 The course required a student input of 50 hours over 6 weeks. The first  occurrence of the course was closed in February 2015, event was attended by 3,200 participants, 11% of  whom the completed the course successfully. The course was delivered in English and Spanish.  Another interesting Spanish initiative is development of two years cybersecurity research centric academic  degree on MSc Research in Cybersecurity from Universidad de León. This Master’s degree will be taught in  two courses. The first course allows students to obtain knowledge in the most relevant cybersecurity research  fields: systems (operating system and network) cybersecurity, software security, cyber-physical systems  security (including industrial security), human aspects and legal implications of cybersecurity, mathematics  for cybersecurity, and security auditing and forensics. All modules are mandatory, allowing students to gather  knowledge enough to know where they would like to start their future research. The second course is split  across two semesters; during the first one students choose elective subjects of their preference to expand  their knowledge in their field of choice: systems, software, industrial, human & legal, mathematics, auditing  and forensics, or even practical experience, a six month paid work experience in a cybersecurity related  company; during the second part of the year, they work on their master thesis. This Master’s degree will be  taught completely in English and the content will be offered both in-classroom and online (using the AVIP  platform of Spanish UNED). The Universidad de León is currently pending approval from Spanish ANECA  (Agencia Nacional de Evaluación de la Calidad y Acreditación).  France pointed out how to increase in the number of ICS SCADA security competent personnel is one of the  goals in its cyber security strategy27:  “The presence of information systems security experts in our industrial base must therefore be increased.  Orienting young people towards such jobs will be encouraged in order to expand the pool of expertise  available in the country.”  To achieve this goal ANSSI promotes the idea of creating courses dedicated to ICS-SCADA security.  For that  purpose, ANSSI developed a guide for the entities who would like to conduct such trainings. If the guide will  be successful, BSI (Germany) considers adapting this in the future for its own CIP programmes28.  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/certification-of-cyber-security-skills-of-ics-scada-professionals  26 www.incibe.es and information provided by INCIBE in OT assessment maturity form, 2015  27 “Information systems defence and security.

The trainings are planned to be continued in the  future29.  Observation:  Currently, there is a very limited number of available courses on the ICS-SCADA cyber security.  Research & Development  Only few scientific programs have been identified during the study. In most Member States, there is no real  cooperation between the scientific community and entities responsible for ICS SCADA security in Critical  Infrastructure, although most of interviewed stakeholders mentioned that they are planning to initiate such  cooperation in the future. In those few Member States where such cooperation exists, it seems that in the  longer period of time such cooperation can bring a significant value to the protection of Critical Infrastructure  in the whole EU. The most interesting identified research is a work of the SUPPRESS group of the University  of León has designed a laboratory for research in cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructures, which replicates  these control architectures in an environment that tries to replicate the real conditions.  This platform is  funded by the National Program of Scientific Infrastructures and Equipment, and it is currently in the  equipment acquisition phase. The five main goals aimed with this design are:  1. To include industrial control equipment and software that is widely used in Critical Infrastructures.  2. To achieve enough flexibility to allow reconfiguration of the networks as well as the application of  several combinations of security measures.  3. To allow replication of control and monitoring networks present in different sectors of Critical  Infrastructures, particularly, industrial control systems, power management, building management and  smart cities.  4. To allow testing at every level of the automation architecture, on heterogeneous equipment and on the  most widely used network protocols in each application area.  5. To include a management system that facilitates testing, enabling data acquisition (from the control  and monitoring system, network traffic, logs, alerts, statistics, etc.) and storage, as well as tools to  manage networks30.  Observation:  Few scientific programmes and no real cooperation between scientific community and entities responsible for  ICS SCADA security in Critical Infrastructure.  Public-Private Partnership  Public-Private Partnership include cooperation between government entities and various organizations which  specializes in delivering of cyber security services (e.g. vendors, consulting companies, private associations).  This approach allows for very fast and efficient gathering information about world leading standards and  trends.  Poland  The RCB is currently in the process of gathering information on leading standards by cooperation with  entities and companies competent in various areas of safety/security. Such collaboration results in the  29 Interview with RIA (Estonia) on 7 VII 2015  30 Information provided by INCIBE in OT assessment maturity form, 2015  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  35  development of series of handbooks, each focused on different angle of security (e.g. technical safety –  already released, cyber security – currently being developed).  Objectives and restraints  Representatives of entities responsible for the ICS-SCADA security in Member States covered by this study  most often listed following goals in this area for the near future:  1. Raising of the awareness about ICS-SCADA security among all stakeholders  2. Building the willingness and mechanisms for effective sharing of information between stakeholders  3. Increasing the quality of ICS-SCADA products on the market from the point of view of security features  The first two goals were listed by countries with a lower level of maturity, which have just or are currently  developing a fundament for the ICS-SCADA security improvement (regulations and mechanisms for good  practices adaptations). Building of ICS-SCADA security community is believed by representatives of those  Member States crucial for obtaining of CI operators understanding of need to increase security of industrial  control systems and accepting it. The experience of Member States that have already reached a higher level  of maturity prove that this is an appropriate approach.  The third and most popular goal has been quoted by countries which obtained higher scores in the maturity  assessment. These Member States have already managed to achieve a high level of trust between ICS-SCADA  security stakeholders and usually build up awareness with publications, seminaries, trainings, etc., often  developed in cooperation with CI operators.  Those Member States believe that they managed to implement  organizational measures on a sufficient level – now the main challenge is to provide CI operators with security  embedded technical solutions.  The list below includes restraints in the process of ICS-SCADA security improvement which were most often  mentioned during the interviews with Member States representatives. All of them create a significant barrier  in the improvement of ICS-SCADA security, but examples of achievements from various Member States  described in the previous chapters proves, that they can be overcome with a proper approach. The names of  corresponding chapters have been included in the brackets.  1. Lack of clearly identified Critical Infrastructure assets and their dependencies (see Assets covered).  2. The willingness to share information (see Information sharing and public/private partnership).  3. Lack of personnel with ICS SCADA security skills (see Education).  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  36  5. Recommendations  As a result of this study, six major recommendation were identified, which can significantly increase the level  of ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity level across Europe.  All the recommendations are considered necessary to ensure a higher level of maturity in the area of ICS-SCADA  cyber security and are in line with the EU vision towards Critical Information Infrastructure Protection. However  to ensure unanimity and high effectiveness in realization of these recommendations, an open discussion needs  to be initiated including all Member States, CII operators and academia. Moreover a joint effort during the  realization phase needs to be ensured to enable a steady growth in the ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity level.  Recommendation 1: Align ICS-SCADA efforts with national cyber security strategies and CIIP efforts  The evolution of the current ICS-SCADA environment, which exposes Critical Infrastructure to more robust  cyber threats, impose the need for coherent and planned actions towards higher security level. Current  regulations and policies are aimed at a reporting obligation, minimal security requirements compliance or  development of CIP plans.  At present ICS-SCADA cyber security is not aligned with National Cyber Security Strategies and CIIP efforts.  National Cyber Security Strategies create a baseline for defining cyber space, cyber security objectives and areas  of actions. As ICS-SCADA area is an integral part of the National and EU cyberspace and Critical Infrastructures,  Governmental decision makers responsible for industrial security/Critical Infrastructure Protection should  aligned all these activities with the NCSS as well as CIIP efforts.  Recommendation 2: Develop good practices specific to ICS-SCADA cyber security  Many Member States do not use industry good practices as a reference to set-up ICS-SCADA their cyber security  baseline for Critical Sectors. Multiple guidelines, ICS-SCADA security standards and good practices are already  developed in the ICS community as well as by individual Member States. It is recommended to leverage from  this to develop a minimum security baseline and good practices for ICS-SCADA in Critical Sectors in EU.  This activity should involve relevant Member States agencies, ICS SCADA operators, vendors and  standardization bodies. PPP initiatives using current ICS-SCADA forums aimed at ICS-SCADA cyber security  guidelines development could be used. The goal should be is to ensure minimum baseline for ICS-SCADA  security.  Recommendation 3: Standardize information sharing among critical sectors and Member States  Information sharing on ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents and good practices are not communicated in a  standardized and frequent manner.  Special emphasis should be given by ICS-SCADA operators and incident  handlers in standardizing information sharing of good practices and known threats across critical sectors.  A common approach to report cyber security incidents and good practices should be fostered.  For example,  relevant Member States authorities and ICS SCADA operators could agree on a specific incident data scheme  for ICS response and also incident report. Trust between CII operators and relevant Member States  organizations should be built to ensure effective communication from, as well as towards, the operators.  Recommendation 4: Build ICS-SCADA cyber security awareness  A special emphasis should be given relevant Member States authorities on building awareness of ICS-SCADA  cyber security aspects not only across CII operators, but also among decision and policy makers. Nowadays  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  37  awareness is built mainly on serious security breaches and incidents. This however showcase the more reactive  approach, which should be moved towards continuous awareness growth.  As a consequence the ICS-SCADA cyber security threats should be well understood and considered separate  from IT security. This could be obtained through organizing ICS-SCADA cyber security related events involving  sector specific platforms to share current challenges and good practices. Knowledge sharing and awareness  building should result directly from the ICS-SCADA cyber security strategies.  Recommendation 5: Foster expertise with ICS-SCADA cyber security trainings and educational programmes.  Current ICS-SCADA cyber security threats multiply at a very rapid pace. Also more robust and technology  advanced attacks (e.g. APT) are aimed at ICS systems. Moreover a lot of ICS-SCADA cyber security aspects are  considered the same as in IT. This basic misunderstanding very often leads to security flaws in ICS-SCADA  environment.  A deep understanding of the process as well as technology is needed in order to perceive the real risk and focus  area for improving ICS-SCADA cyber security. This is why it is so important that relevant Member States  authorities, operators and vendors of ICS-SCADA systems work together to raise future experts and leaders in  the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. This could be done by setting up and support new study programs for ICS- SCADA security as well as organize and promote related trainings among public bodies.  Recommendation 6: Promote and support ICS-SCADA cyber security research and test beds  Relevant Member States authorities, the European Commission and operators of Critical Infrastructure should  encourage research and development programmes for ICS-SCADA cyber security and security test bed focused  in ICS environments. The results of these activities will be beneficial for all operators of Critical Infrastructure  and could represent a competitive advantage at European level.  The current ICS test bed initiatives in Member States are not mature enough in terms of technical versatility  and fluency of work to assume immediate leadership of tasks testing in Europe. It is necessary to involve ICS- SCADA experts and system vendors in the process of addressing current and future cyber security related  threats. Support in research programmes and creation of common test-beds can foster ICS-SCADA cyber  security innovation and improve security-by-design concept.

They play a critical role not only in maintaining the continuity of industrial processes but also to  ensure functional and technical safety, preventing large industrial accidents and environmental disasters.  The criticality of control systems in vital sectors, and high impact in case of disruption, makes them a major target  for malicious activities. Based on the ICS-CERT Monitor (part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security)1, between  2009 and 2014 the number of reported cyber  security incidents in the ICS-SCADA area increased  more than 27 times. At the same time more than  half of the incidents (59% in 2013) were aimed at  the energy and critical manufacturing sectors and  around 55% involved advanced persistent threats  (APT). Still many ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents  stay undetected or unreported.  This study reveals the current maturity level of ICS- SCADA cyber security in Europe and identifies good  practices used by European Member States to  improve this area.  The first and second part of this study introduces us  to the ICS-SCADA cyber security topic, explains the  role of ICS-SCADA in critical sectors and summarizes the methodology of this study.  During the desk research, current activities of different Member States in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security were  identified, including related activities, legislation status, existing cyber security strategies and the responsibility  matrix of entities dedicated to improve the level of ICS-SCADA cyber security in each country.  Following the research, the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model was used while performing a series of  interviews with designated officials from eight Member States. As a result, four Maturity Profiles were identified and  described in the third part of this study:   Leading - Member States with strong legislation and supporting mechanisms dedicated to ICS SCADA cyber  security improvement   Proactive Supporters - Member States focused on strong Critical Infrastructure operators support and driving  the ICS SCADA cyber security improvement   Reactive Supporters - Member States focused on lessons learned and reactive means of improving ICS SCADA  cyber security   Early Developers - Member States in the process of developing of legislation and supporting system to protect  ICS SCADA in Critical Infrastructure  1 https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov  2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014  Incidents 9 41 204 198 256 245  0  50  100  150  200  250  300  Figure 1 ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents 2009-2014  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  07  The analysis of maturity level reveals areas for improvement which are concluded in the fifth and last part of this  study. As a result, a set of high level and context specific future recommendations to policy and decision makers are  issued that include, among others:  Recommendation 1: Align ICS-SCADA efforts with national cyber security strategies and CIIP effort. Currently ICS- SCADA cyber security is not aligned with National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) and Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) efforts. National Cyber Security Strategies create a baseline for defining cyber space,  cyber security objectives and areas of actions. As the ICS-SCADA area is an integral part of the National and EU  cyberspace and Critical Infrastructures, it should be aligned with the NCSS as well as CIIP efforts.  Recommendation 2: Develop good practices specific to ICS-SCADA cyber security. Many Member States do not use  industry good practices as a reference to set-up an ICS-SCADA cyber security baseline for Critical Sectors. Multiple  guidelines, ICS-SCADA security standards and good practices are already developed in the ICS community as well as  by individual Member States. It is recommended to leverage from this to develop a minimum security baseline and  good practices for ICS-SCADA in Critical Sectors in EU.  Recommendation 3: Standardize information sharing among critical sectors and Member States. Information  sharing on ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents and good practices are not communicated in a standardized and  frequent manner.  A special emphasis should be given on standardizing information sharing of good practices and  known threats across critical sectors. A single platform and process (e.g. ICS CERT) to report cyber security incidents  and good practices should be in place. Trust between Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators and the  platform should be built to ensure effective communication from as well as towards the operators.  Recommendation 4: Build ICS-SCADA cyber security awareness. Special emphasis should be given on building  awareness of ICS-SCADA cyber security aspects not only across CII operators, but also among decision and policy  makers. Nowadays the awareness is built mainly on serious security breaches and incidents. This underlines the  more reactive approach, which should be moved towards a continuous awareness growth. As a consequence the  ICS-SCADA cyber security threats should be well understood and considered separate from Information Technology  (IT) security. This could be achieved by organizing ICS-SCADA cyber security related events involving sector specific  platforms to share current challenges and good practices. Knowledge sharing and awareness building should result  directly from the ICS-SCADA cyber security strategies.  Recommendation 5: Foster expertise with ICS-SCADA cyber security trainings and educational programmes.  Current ICS-SCADA cyber security threats multiply at a very rapid pace. Also several more robust and technology  advanced attacks (e.g. Advanced Persistent Threat - APT) are aimed at ICS systems. Moreover a lot of ICS-SCADA  cyber security aspects are considered the same as in IT. This basic misunderstanding very often leads to security  flaws in ICS-SCADA environments. A deep understanding of the process as well as the technology is needed in order  to perceive the real risk and focus area for improving ICS-SCADA cyber security. This is why it is so important to  develop future experts and leaders in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. This could be done by setting up and  supporting new study programs for ICS-SCADA security as well as organizing and promoting related trainings among  public bodies.  Recommendation 6: Promote and support ICS-SCADA cyber security research and test beds. It is necessary to  involve ICS-SCADA experts and system vendors in the process of addressing current and future cyber security related  threats. Support in research programmes and creation of common test-beds can foster ICS-SCADA cyber security  innovation and improve security-by-design concept.  The recommendations shall assist, both the European Commission and the Member States, in the process of  building resilient ICS-SCADA environment in Europe.

Introduction  The security of ICS-SCADA (Industrial Control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems) is  increasingly recognized as a high priority area among European Critical Infrastructure operators due to its  strategic impact on processes essential for uninterrupted functioning of the EU industries and economy. A  rapidly increasing number of incidents in the ICS-SCADA domain, many of which are confirmed or believed  to result from cyber-attacks, reveals the vulnerability and fragility of this area and highlights the importance  of continuous improvement of ICS-SCADA security for critical service providers. Furthermore, dependencies  of Critical Infrastructure across the EU increases the attack surface and potential impact of cyber incidents.  ENISA, as part of its activities, released a series of reports and documents tackling the topic of cyber security  in industrial control systems2:   Protecting Industrial Control Systems, Recommendations for Europe and Member States (2011)3   Can we learn from SCADA security incidents? (2013)4   Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems (2013)5   Window of exposure… a real problem for SCADA systems? (2013)6   Good Practices for an EU ICS Testing Coordination Capability (2013)7   Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals (2015)8  Furthermore, ENISA has established in 2014 an ICS Stakeholder Group. The role of this group is to provide  the opportunity for ICS/SCADA experts to address important issues to ENISA in its efforts to enhance ICS  security in the EU. It creates a common platform to enable ENISA consult providers, gather requirements,  concerns and share new ideas9.  Along with the EICS, in 2015 ENISA took over the coordination of EuroSCSIE (European SCADA and Control  Systems Information Exchange). This platform was created in June 2005 with the aim of sharing mutually  beneficial information regarding electronic security threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, and solutions; acting  as cross-country facilitator for the exchange of good practices and information and supporting the EU- Countries policy makers on the matter of Critical Infrastructure Protection10.  2 Official ENISA Internet page - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure- and-services/scada-industrial-control-systems  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/protecting-industrial-control-systems.-recommendations-for-europe-and-member-states  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/can-we-learn-from-scada-security-incidents  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/ics-cerc/good-practice-guide-for-certs- in-the-area-of-industrial-control-systems  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/window-of-exposure-a-real-problem-for-scada-systems  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/good-practices-for-an-eu-ics-testing-coordination-capability  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/certification-of-cyber-security-skills-of-ics-scada-professionals  9 „Terms of reference for an ENISA ICS Security Stakeholder Group” -  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ics- security/EICSSGTermsofReference.pdf  10 https://espace.cern.ch/EuroSCSIE/default.aspx  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  10  Role of the ICS solutions in Critical Infrastructure security  ‘Critical Infrastructure’ means an asset, system or part thereof located in Member States which is essential  for the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic or social well-being of  people, and the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant impact in a Member State as a  result of the failure to maintain those functions11.  The ICS-SCADA environment is the fundamental component of European and national Critical  Infrastructures. Most sectors rely on ICS-SCADA to ensure process control and safety which ensure continuity  of national critical functions. Vital sectors such as energy, oil & gas, water or chemical, rely on industrial  control systems to supervise and control their key processes. As industries lean towards pervasive process  automation and maintenance-free operations, the role of ICS-SCADA in the business continuity aspect of  those sectors is even greater.  The latest transformation changed the ICS-SCADA environment from proprietary, isolated systems to open  architectures and standard technologies. Critical infrastructure operators demand high quality, real time  information to make more accurate and justified business decisions. The technological agenda of tomorrow  is focused among other things on the following topics: Internet of Things, smart infrastructures, E-Health,  Connected retail and Industry 4.0. A good example is the Industry 4.0, which is a collective term for  technologies and concepts of value chain organization' which draws together Cyber-Physical Systems, the  Internet of Things and the Internet of Services.12. The term “Industry 4.0” refers to the idea of a fourth  industrial revolution, and originates from the high-tech strategy of the German government, which  promotes the computerization of critical manufacturing13.  The move towards connecting ICS-SCADA and IT environments, however, results in an increased attack  surface, thus exposing the critical functions to higher cyber security risks. The priority of ICS-SCADA security  results from the great impact on national and European critical functions. The interdependencies of Critical  Infrastructures across the EU, may result in a cascading effect in case of a successful cyber-attack.  ICS-SCADA cyber-attacks, on the other hand, are becoming more robust and aimed at specific control system  technologies.

The aim is to present the current national ICS-SCADA security status and to provide the  stakeholders with a set of recommendations on how they can improve their practices, especially regarding  critical sectors.  The objective of this study is to:   Address the current cyber security maturity levels as regards the ICS-SCADA protection in the  European Member States;   Identify, at European level, the thematic areas/indicators of maturity and lessons learnt from the ICS- SCADA security practices followed by Member States in critical sectors; and   Issue a set of high level and context specific future recommendations to policy and decision makers  that will assist, both the European Commission and the Member States, in the process of building  resilient ICS-SCADA in Europe.  Target Audience  The goal of this paper is to inform policy makers and critical service providers on the current ICS-SCADA  cyber security agenda in the EU Member States, and identify key areas for improvement. In particular the  intended target audience is:   Relevant national authorities   The European Commission   ICS- SCADA stakeholders   The CIIP community at large  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  12  2.  Methodology for the assessment of ICS Cyber Security maturity  The ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Analysis was conducted on the basis of publicly available information  and interviews with relevant national authorities in various Member States. For the purpose of this  assessment of maturity levels in each Member State, an ICS SCADA security maturity model was developed.  The entire study was divided into three tasks:  Task 1 - Desk research  The desk research was conducted on publicly available information which covered both Europe-wide and  Member State activities as well as legislation in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. Information was  collected on existing governance models, practices, policies and critical sectors activities followed by  Member States.  Task 2 - Series of interviews  Interviews were held with relevant experts about ICS-SCADA security practices and policies in eight selected  Member States. The interviews were conducted on government level with representatives responsible for  cyber security of Critical Infrastructure assets. Interviews were based on a questionnaire developed together  with an  ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model. For one Member State, the relevant authority submitted  the questionnaire without interview. The questionnaire was used to validate desk research, assess the  maturity level of the Member States and identify possible gaps and underline good practices. Thematic areas  used within the questionnaire were consistent with ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model and covered:   Legislation in the area of obligations of CI operators concerning ICS SCADA security,   Support provided by Member State administration to the Critical Infrastructure operators,   Local conditions of the ICS-SCADA security improvement process (progress, restraints, objectives).  Task 3 - Summary list of all security requirements  Development of an aggregated list of key findings and lessons learnt in the process of securing resilient ICS- SCADA for Europe’s critical sectors. Preparation of this report, which interprets and presents aggregated  results from the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model.  In order to facilitate the work 8 Member States were involved in this study:   Estonia (RIA – Estonian Information System Authority)   France (ANSSI - French Network and Information Security Agency)   Germany (BSI – German Federal Office for Information Security)   Lithuania (Ministry of National Defence)   Netherlands (NCSC – Dutch National Cyber Security Centrum)   Poland (RCB – Polish Government Centre for Security)   Spain (INCIBE – Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute)   Sweden (MSB – Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency)  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  13  All information on ICS-SCADA cyber security in the EU collected during the interviews were documented and  additionally confirmed with interviewees. As for the information gathered during desk research, only reliable  sources such as official publications of government entities or agencies were taken into consideration. The  full list of research sources is included in Bibliography.  The captured data were analysed with the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model in order to supplement  the qualitative research with quantitative analysis. The collected data was aggregated to identify existing  profiles which represent different approach to ICS-SCADA cyber security in the  EU. Additionally good  practices and lessons learned captured across different Member State were collected and highlighted in the  Report within chapters dedicated to particular aspects of ICS-SCADA maturity.  A draft of the study was sent for comment and preview to all the stakeholders involved and also to the  members of the ENISA ICS stakeholder group and EURO SCSIE. A validation workshop was held in  Luxembourg on the 30th of September 2015 and findings and recommendations were discussed and  validated.  Figure 2: Geographic distribution of Member States covered by the study  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  14  ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Assessment Model  To identify the level of cyber security maturity in Critical Sectors in the EU, the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security  Maturity Model was created. The maturity model is dedicated to ICS-SCADA security in Critical Infrastructure  and should be treated as an integral part of this analysis.  The model was built from three major operating  model dimensions further divided into nine operating model sub-dimensions. The three major dimensions  include:  The Legislation - Operating Model Dimension  describes how advanced is the legal model of  particular Member States in terms of ICS-SCADA  cyber security improvement. It covers  responsibilities, regulations and policy activities in  the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security at Member  States level.  The Support - Operating Model Dimension captures  how efficient Member States support critical service  providers in improving ICS-SCADA cyber security by  actively participating in cyber security assessments  and development processes. It identifies actions  aiming at increasing awareness, gathering and  propagation of information on existing good  practices.  The Local Conditions - Operating Model Dimension  reports the opportunities and challenges in terms of  ICS-SCADA cyber security improvement and  identifies focus areas for the future.  Operating Model Dimensions are further dived into Operating Model Sub-Dimensions to specify thematic  areas, structure the research and allow comparative analysis between different Member States.  Table 1: ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model Dimensions  OPERATING MODEL DIMENSION OPERATING MODEL SUB-DIMENSION DESCRIPTION  Legislation  EU Directives & State Legislation  How do the EU and Member States  create policy landscapes to support ICS- SCADA cyber security?

Support Incentive System  Do Member States support Critical  Service providers and encourage them  to improve ICS-SCADA cyber security?  Figure 3: Dimensions of ICS-SCADA Security Maturity Model  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  15  OPERATING MODEL DIMENSION OPERATING MODEL SUB-DIMENSION DESCRIPTION  Education Solution  Do Member States support Academics  and promote ICS-SCADA cyber security  knowledge?

Lessons Learned  Do Member States monitor the results  of their ICS-SCADA cyber security  improvement activities and take the  proper corrective actions?  Restraints  How well do Member States cope with  limitations affecting ICS-SCADA cyber  security improvements?  Operating Model Sub-Dimensions are the thematic areas which determine the maturity level of ICS-SCADA  cyber security in Member States. To capture the accurate level of maturity an underlying questionnaire was  prepared to describe and valuate each Operating Model Sub-Dimension. The questionnaire included 82  questions divided into parts corresponding to the nine sub dimensions described above and (where feasible)  with reference to the lifecycle of a process:   Create - How is the process developed?   Implement - How is the process deployed?   Monitor - How is the process reported and monitored?   Modify - How is the process adapted and changed?  Answers for each question were scored against a 5 level scale with clearly defined, question independent  criteria. To ensure reliability of the results, when answers were gathered during the interview, assessment  criteria were not shared with the interviewed stakeholders. The maturity levels used for the purpose of the  study were:   Basic – activities aren’t conducted,   Developing - activities are under development or conducted on ad-hoc manner,   Established - activities are regularly conducted on the basic level,   Advanced - activities are implemented with a deep understanding of ICS-SCADA specific requirements,   Leading - activities are implemented in the level that exceeds current, basic needs (are design to address  needs which arrival is foreseen).  To complement the analysis, information on additional non-standard activities around cyber security in ICS- SCADA area for individual Member States was taken into consideration. The mixed research methodology  (qualitative and quantitative) provides advantages by relegating qualitative analysis to an exploratory tool.  It gives a broader perspective over the cyber security maturity subject and enables to capture patterns and  make statistical analysis which makes the study more comprehensive.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  16  3. State of ICS security within the EU  ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels across EU Member States result from a number of variables which  make up the presented Maturity Model. Based on the multidimensional analysis, the following four ICS- SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Profiles where observed:  Table 2: Cyber Security Maturity Profiles  TABLE HEADING DESCRIPTION  Leading With  a strong legislation and supporting mechanisms dedicated to ICS SCADA cyber  security improvement  Proactive Supporters Focused on strong CI operators support and driving the ICS SCADA cyber security  improvement  Reactive Supporters Focus on lessons learned and reactive means of improving ICS SCADA cyber security  Early Developers In the process of developing of legislation and supporting system to protect ICS  SCADA in Critical Infrastructure  The profiles are based on the Desk Research as well as interviews with eight Member States who already  initiated actions related to ICS-SCADA cyber security. Some of Member States which were initially asked to  participate in the study openly declared that they were not ready to participate as they did not initiate any  activities in the ICS-SCADA security and they would not bring any value to the study. According to the  conducted desk research, it has been approximated that the percentage of such Member States is around  25% to 30%.  Each profile is characterized by a different focus on which the ICS-SCADA maturity is built. This is presented  on the “focus graph” for each Profile. Also determinants are presented to better understand the  characteristics of each ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity profile. Furthermore a SWOT analysis was  performed to identify strengths and weaknesses as well as seize opportunities to improve the level of ICS- SCADA cyber security.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  17  Profile 1: Leaders  Member States with the highest ICS-SCADA Cyber Security  Maturity Level. They are characterized by a developed  legal system and strategic vision which drives cyber  security improvement initiatives in Critical Sectors.  “Leaders” have a very controlled and settled approach  over ICS-SCADA cyber security and provide direct  legislation to support it. The CI Operators are obliged to  report incidents and incentive measures are in place to  ensure compliance with minimal security requirements in  the corresponding sector.  “Leaders” have significant ICS-SCADA cyber security  awareness (government, CI operators) and a high level of public-private collaboration in this area. Dedicated  groups responsible for CIP are skilled and trained in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. Academic and  scientific centres are involved in the research and development process of ICS-SCADA cyber security  countermeasures.  Leading ICS cyber security standards are utilized in order to create own guidelines for CI  Operators. Leaders are open to share knowledge and educate other Member States in this area.  Furthermore ICS-SCADA security is covered by Member States cyber security strategies, current security  level is monitored (e.g. by audits). In order to ensure “security by design” ICS-SCADA suppliers are involved  and certification processes for critical assets are being developed and planned to be implemented.  0  1  2  3  4  5 UE Directives & State Legislation  Leading Standards Adaptation  Best Practices Adaptation  Incentive System  Education solutionsCyber Security Agencies  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  Lessons Learned  Restrains  Leaders  Determinants of the profile:   Strong EU economies   High level of automation and  digitalization   Mature cyber security policy  Figure 4 Focus Graph - Profile 1  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  18  Below the SWOT analysis is presented for the Leaders Profile. It identifies strengths and weaknesses of the  profile as well as opportunities to improve the level of ICS-SCADA cyber security.  STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES  IN TE  R N  A L   Long-time planning on the ICS-SCADA  security improvement process   Deep understanding of ICS-SCADA role in the  CIP   Established cooperation between CI  operators and government   Security-by-design approach - asset  certification process in development   Lack of incentive systems to promote ICS SCADA cyber  security improvements   Still very few research programs to the ICS SCADA  security improvement  OPPORTUNITIES THREATS  EX TE  R N  A L  ICS-SCADA cyber security good practices  shared across EU (Member States with lower  maturity may benefit from Leaders  experiences)   Few number of experts on the market with ICS-SCADA  security background (ICS-SCADA security matters  handled by personnel with purely IT background)  The study describes Leaders as mature Member States with various efforts identified in the area of ICS- SCADA cyber security including long term planning, alignment with CIIP efforts, trust between responsible  government bodies and critical sectors as well as preventive activities including auditing and/or testing.  This role model can be followed among all Member States to leverage from previous experiences and is an  opportunity to support attempts towards higher level of ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity across EU.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  19  Profile 2: Proactive supporters  The “Proactive supporters” include Member States  whose main focus is on equipping Critical Infrastructure  operators with the necessary tools to continuously  improve ICS-SCADA cyber security level. Strong  government support and public-private partnership  distinguish this profile. Academic and scientific centres  are involved in the research and development process.  Proactive measures are being developed with a very close  cooperation with internal (government, CI operators) and  external (academics, private agencies) stakeholders. To  obtain this, information sharing platforms are developed  and working groups are settled.  The “Proactive supporters” put incentive systems in place in order to support CI operators and promote ICS- SCADA cyber security initiatives (e.g. use of EU funds for ICS-SCADA testing).  The Member States are strongly focused on building ICS-SCADA security awareness and understating among  CI operators and the society, by enabling access to knowledge and specialized trainings. They create ICS  cyber security guidelines in a cooperation with a wide ICS-SCADA community.  Determinants of the profile:   Close private-public partnership   Academic and scientific  involvement   Structural funding of ICS-SCADA  security initiatives  0  1  2  3  4  5  UE Directives & State Legislation  Leading Standards Adaptation  Best Practices Adaptation  Incentive System  Education solutions Cyber Security  Agencies  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  Lessons Learned  Restrains  Proactive supporters  Figure 5 Focus Graph - Profile 2  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  20  Below the SWOT analysis is presented for the Proactive Supporters Profile.

STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES  IN TE  R N  A L   Close private-public partnership   Academic and scientific involvement   A lot of educational measures developed   Structural funding of ICS-SCADA security  initiatives   Only basic regulations implemented   ICS-SCADA security improvement process is less  systemized  OPPORTUNITIES THREATS  EX TE  R N  A L  High trust between CI operators and the  Member State allow for effective gathering  of good practices developed by private  sector   Weaker regulation and planning may lead to  conducting actions which in the future are likely to  prove inaccurate or ineffective  The proactive supporters are characterized by close cooperation with various organizations (including  private and public).These initiatives compensate the basic regulation and an ICS-SCADA cyber security  improvement process that is less elaborate.  This “Proactive Supporters” create a good environment for knowledge and information sharing and may be  a good source of ICS-SCADA cyber security good practices.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  21  Profile 3: Reactive supporters  The “Reactive supporters” approach the ICS-SCADA cyber  security by taking reactive actions and answering the  rising need for cyber security on an ongoing basis. The  main focus is on improvement of identified vulnerabilities  or response after cyber security incidents (not  particularly in this Member State).  Most of the ICS-SCADA related activities result from the  awareness activities regarding relevant threats, not from  the legislation itself. Organized working groups divided  into individual critical sectors gather good practices and  lessons learned for improvement of the ICS-SCADA cyber  security level.  The role of monitoring and improving ICS-SCADA cyber security is often informal and is combined with IT  security activities.  The “Reactive supporters” understand the need for more specific legislation in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber  security and put this high on their future agenda.  Determinants of the  profile:   High level of trust  between CI operators and  the Member State   Extensive auditing  and reporting process  0  1  2  3  4  5  UE Directives & State Legislation  Leading Standards Adaptation  Best Practices Adaptation  Incentive System  Education solutionsCyber Security Agencies  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  Lessons Learned  Restrains  Reactive supporters  Figure 6 Focus Graph - Profile 3  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  22  Below a SWOT analysis is presented for the Reactive Supporters Profile.

STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES  IN TE  R N  A L   Close private-public partnership   Strong auditing and reporting regulation   Focus on taking reactive actions rather that proactive  initiatives   Treating ICS-SCADA as traditional IT   Ad-hoc initiatives (weak planning)   No guidance or obligations towards ICS-SCADA security  OPPORTUNITIES THREATS  EX TE  R N  A L   Good understanding of existing threats in the  ICS-SCADA environment can be propagate  across other Member States   Weaker regulations and planning may lead to  conducting actions which in future will prove to be not  accurate or ineffective  The strength of “Reactive Supporters” is in the auditing and reporting capabilities, which gives the  opportunity to track and learn from past ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents.  This approach, however, does not provide sufficient means to leverage from this knowledge to ensure  proactive process of improving the level of ICS-SCADA cyber security in Critical Sectors.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  23  Profile 4: Early Developers  The “Early Developers” are characterized by a low  maturity level of ICS-SCADA cyber security.  Cyber security legislation to distinguish Critical  Infrastructure and developed ICS-SCADA related  cyber security agenda, exists for less than 3 or even  2 years.  The list of critical assets has either been identified  recently or has not been identified yet. Furthermore  no guidelines on ICS-SCADA security have been  developed yet.  The public-private partnership and academic involvement is in the very initial phase. There is little expertise  in the area of cyber security in industrial control systems, thus little awareness of good practices and leading  standards.  Determinants of the profile:   Cyber Security legislation  implemented less than 2-3  years ago   Limited awareness  activities and expertise in the  area of ICS-SCADA cyber  security  0 1 2 3 4 5 Legislation  SupportLocal Conditions  0  1  2  3  4  5  UE Directives & State Legislation  Leading Standards Adaptation  Best Practices Adaptation  Incentive System  Education solutionsCyber Security Agencies  Cyber Security Improvement Potential  Lessons Learned  Restrains  Early Developers  Figure 7 Focus Graph - Profile 4  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  24  Below a SWOT analysis is presented for the Early Developers Profile.

Most of the early developing Member States begin with legislation which very often focuses on cyber  security in general instead of distinguishing ICS-SCADA as a separate topic.  “Early Developers”, however, often leverage from already existing legislation and good practices which is an  opportunity for more dynamic growth in ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity.  The difficulty which may be observed are resulting from low awareness, little ICS-SCADA cyber security  expertise and little trust for public-private partnership.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  25  4. ICS-SCADA cyber security activities in Member States  The following describes the activities and good practices among EU Member States in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber  security.  The activities presented in this part of the study result from the ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Model,  performed interviews with relevant Member States officials as well as desk research. They are divided into the  following thematic areas:   Organizational structures   Regulations and Policies   Assets covered   Auditing and certification   Incident handling   Incentives   Education   Trainings and courses   R&D   Information sharing   Public-Private Partnership   Objectives and restraints  Next to each thematic area an example of good practices is shown with the indication of a respective Member State.  Organizational structures  The “Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European  Critical Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection” not only points out the  need to designate and protect Critical Infrastructure but also identifies actors responsible for different  activities at high level.  At the EU level the European Commission acts as the executive body responsible for proposing legislation and  implementing decisions. The Commission may also support Member States in identifying Critical  Infrastructure on an ongoing basis.The Council Directive, however, acts only as a general framework for  Critical Infrastructure Protection. The details on taking specific actions are under the responsibility of each  Member State. This also includes the responsibility for specifying ICS-SCADA cyber security requirements for  CI operators.  The Council Directive also suggests the designation of Security Liaison Officers for all identified ECIs in order  to facilitate cooperation and communication with relevant national Critical Infrastructure protection  authorities.16  Next to the main EU institutions, dedicated agencies and organizations are driving ICS-SCADA cyber security  efforts. To enforce activities related to network and information security (also including ICS-SCADA) as well as  help European Commission, Member States and business community, to address, respond and prevent  network and information security problems, ENISA was established in 2004. Under ENISA, the ICS Stakeholder  16 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical  Infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection (OJ L 345, 23.12.2008, p. 75–82).  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  26  Group was created, in order to enhance the current efforts in improving ICS-SCADA cyber security across the  EU. In 2015, ENISA took over also the coordination of EuroSCSIE (European SCADA and Control Systems  Information Exchange). The aim of EuroSCSIE was initially to share information on electronic security threats,  vulnerabilities, incidents and solutions as well as support Member States policy makers on the matter of  Critical Infrastructure Protection17.  At Member States’ level various approaches regarding organizational structures is observed. Different roles  within Member States can be divided into responsible, accountable, consulted and informed. Some Member  States (e.g. Poland) directly implemented EU recommendation from the Council Directive 2008/114/EC.  Poland  Activities related to ICS-SCADA cyber security in Critical Infrastructure is the responsibility of RCB18  (Rzadowe Centrum Bezpieczenstwa) who coordinates the creation of Critical Infrastructure Protection  Plans. RCB is subordinate to the President of the Council of Ministers. Moreover Security Liaison Officers  are designated in each Critical Infrastructure operator to inform RCB about major security incidents.  Others implemented their own, more extensive structures divided into each critical sector and including  incident response capabilities:  France; Germany  In France and Germany a single security authority is responsible for Critical Infrastructure cyber security  regulation, respectively German Federal Office for Information Security - BSI19 and French Network and  Information Security Agency - ANSSI20.  They establish working groups dedicated to critical sectors (and sub-sectors were relevant). The output  of these committees is further validated by the security authority and/or concerned ministries. A group  dedicated to ICS-SCADA cyber security is in place to study and adapt good practices across critical  sectors.  Regulations and Policies  The backbone for the ICS-SCADA cyber security has been established by “The Council Directive 2008/114/EC  of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the  assessment of the need to improve their protection” which defined European Critical Infrastructure (ECI), CI  protection, and the concept of the ECI owner (operator). The Directive also defines fundamental duties  imposed on Member States with regard to ECI protection. Since then, European Member States have started  to implement local regulations in the area of CIP, including those concerning cyber security of industrial assets  (ICS-SCADA). For now three main kinds of regulation are implemented:   Obligation of reporting on cyber incidents regarding Critical Infrastructure assets  17 http://www.gcsec.org/  18 http://rcb.gov.pl/eng/  19 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html  20 www.ssi.gouv.fr/  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  27  Such obligations have been implemented by all Member States covered by this study, which managed to  formally identify its CI assets. Depending from the Member State, the incident may be reported directly to the  entity responsible for the CI cyber security (e.g. in France, CI operators report security incidents to ANSSI) or  through the national CERT (e.g. Lithuania). Besides that, some countries developed a dedicated, regulated  communication channel between CI operators and responsible government entities. Such an example is  Poland.  Poland  According to the “Polish Act on Crisis Management 21 from April 26, 2007”, every CI operator is obliged  to have a clearly appointed person who acts as a primary contact with entities responsible for CI  protection. This obligation has been additionally clarified by an “Act from March 18, 2010”  which states,  that the Management Board of a particular critical systems owner (supply of fuels and energy  resources), in agreement with Director of RCB and the Ministry of State Treasury appoints a duly  authorised representative responsible for the CI protection. The representative is an employee of the  company, who monitors activities of the Management Board in relation to actions that may affect the  continuous functioning of critical systems. This representative can act as a contact person mentioned  in previous paragraph. Every quarter of the year, this representative drafts a report on the condition of  CI protection in the company in question (so much more than just reporting on incidents), including the  condition of cyber security. A copy of the report is sent to the Director of RCB.   Obligation of fulfilling minimal security requirements  Some countries have implemented industrial sector specific minimal security requirements with which  CI operators have to be compliant (e.g. France). Even more countries are currently working on  promulgating legal instruments on minimal security requirements.  Germany  In Germany, detailed regulations specific for each Critical Infrastructure sector are promulgated by  working committees (one committee for each sector) composed of BSI personnel and representatives  of CI operators. Each committee defines minimal requirements for securing ICS SCADA in each  corresponding sector.   Obligation to develop CIP plans  Some EU Member States require by means of a regulation the development of CIP plans (including cyber  security area). These regulations impose the obligation for CI owners to develop Critical Infrastructure  Protection Plans addressing  a description of threats, possible scenarios and implemented risk  mitigation measures. The regulation refers to security in different areas: legal, physical, personnel and  cyber. The advantage of such an approach is that protection of each CI site is treated as a whole system,  which elements correspond to each other.  Spain  According to Spanish regulations, every Critical Infrastructure Operator has to develop a security plan  or \"Plan de Seguridad (PSO)\" to lay out its Security Policy, Scope, Risk Assessment Methodology and  guidelines for implementing the proper security measures in its infrastructure.  21 http://rcb.gov.pl/eng/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACT-on-Crisis-Management-final-version-31-12-2010.pdf  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  28  Poland  CIP plans were introduced in Poland through “Regulation of the Council of Ministers on Critical  Infrastructure Protection Plans, April 30, 2010”. Every Critical Infrastructure Operator, who has been  identified as such, has to develop a Critical Infrastructure Protection plan. The plan has to be updated  every two years and it has to be agreed with national crisis management system stakeholders  (protection of CI is part of the national crisis management system).  Assets covered  In 2015, ENISA released a guide entitled: Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information  Infrastructure assets and services. Although the guide is focused on the identification of the data  communication networks, described methodologies can be used for identification of other CI assets, including  ICS-SCADA solutions supporting Critical Services22.  In this study, we focus on the problem of identification of ICS-SCADA assets only. Generally, the main problem  from the perspective of entities responsible for Member States cyber security in the context of CIP, is how to  ensure that all ICS-SCADA assets which support services considered critical from the Member States  perspective are identified and covered by CIP activities. Generally, Member States who have already identified  their critical assets choose one of the two following approaches:  4.3.1 The State-driven approach  The state creates definitions regarding the conditions under which assets are considered to be critical. These  definitions are being communicated to the CI operators who on this basis develop their list of critical assets.  4.3.2 The operator driven approach  The Member States are involved in the definition of Critical Infrastructure (physical locations) based on the  criticality of the services. Following the creation of such a list, the critical assets (e.g. ICS systems) are  identified by the Critical Infrastructure operator alone based on a risk analysis. In this approach, a list of  Critical Infrastructure is created in cooperation with government and CI operators. The list usually includes  the names and locations of physical sites responsible for Critical Services. Then, each CI operator on the basis  of risk analysis techniques identifies threats scenarios which can influence continuity of each site operations.  This covers all kind of threats, including cyber threats related to ICS-SCADA. On the basis of risk analysis, a  CIP plan is created, which later is agreed upon with national entities responsible for crisis management.  Observation:  Not all Member States identified their Cricial Assets, including ICS-SCADA.  Information sharing  Building up partnerships between Critical Infrastructure operators (including those privately owned) and  government institutions is crucial for successful building of CIP systems, as it allows for achieving mutual  understanding of needs, priorities and restraints. Entities responsible for CI cyber security on the national  level require a proper communication from CI operators to receive feedback on effectiveness of actions they  conduct and for proper identification of assets which are critical to the performance of processes which are  22 “Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets and services. Guidelines for  charting electronic data communication networks.” ENISA, 2014  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  29  important to society. CI operators on the other hand require a clear communication on government  requirements and the purpose of operations that are expected from them.  Most Member States choose to build up partnerships on the basis of working groups dedicated to the  development of some particular products, such us security guidelines or minimal security requirements  dedicated to the various industrial sectors.  For example, ANSSI (France) established 18 working groups dedicated to critical sectors (and sub-sectors when  deemed relevant). These committees are responsible for drafting proposals of regulations (specific  requirements) for cyber security measures in the corresponding sectors. These proposals are then validated  by several public administrations including ANSSI and the concerned ministries.  Apart from these working groups for regulation development, another wider working group exists which deals  specifically with ICS SCADA security and aims at gathering information and adapting good practices. This group  prepared inter alia a Protection Profile for industrial automation devices and systems such as PLC, SCADA  Server, MES Server, Engineering Software, etc. This group has also produced the guides “Cybersecurity for  industrial control systems: Classification method and key measures” and “Cybersecurity for industrial control  systems: Detailed measures”, and the document “Training guide for ICS cybersecurity”.  Some countries, apart from product focus groups, build up ICS SCADA security community on the basis of  periodic thematic meetings.  Netherlands  The Dutch Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) are usually CI-sector specific security  oriented public-private platforms. Organizations can exchange their cyber security problems  experiences (incidents and best practices) in confidence and anonymously. Following an analysis, a  warning can be issued to all participating organizations about a threat, vulnerability or incident, or  about a good practice that can be applied to mitigate a risk. Most ISACs organize tactical level  professionals from public or private CI operators. The technical and ISAC secretariat support is funded  facilitated by the NCSC-NL. ISAC communication runs via closed mailing lists, tele-conferences, and  physical meetings which are held on a regular basis.  As generally some sort of cooperation between CI operators and government entities responsible for ICS  SCADA exist in the majority of Member States covered by study, some Member States referred to lack of trust  between the two sites as a significant constraint in the process of ICS SCADA security improvement (or listed  of building such a trust in a priority goals for the nearest future). From the discussions with various CI  operators, it may be stated that such lack of trust originates from two sources:   CI operators are afraid of sharing the information about any existing security problems with  government, as they believe that at some point this information can be used against them (e.g. after  implementation of law which imposes penalties). This anxiety is especially strong in publicly own  companies, where management boards are to some extent dependent on political decisions,   CI operators do not believe that government entities understand constraints and needs of their business  processes. This may lead to the situation, when government representatives with some limited  knowledge on the processes conducted by operators and their dependencies will try to enforce security  controls, which from CI operator’s perspective are considered as non-cost-effective. To protect  themselves from such situation, absurdly some CI operators choose to share only very limited  information (only those which is required from them by law) to keep government in opinion that  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  30  “everything what is needed has already been done, there is nothing else to improve” (what is  interesting, this kind of approach was observed not only on only on government / operators level but  also even within large companies – e.g. company HQ / local branches).  As any Member State which already established a various working groups some time ago did not listed lack of  trust as significant problem, this shows how important it is to build a community around CIP, including area  of ICS-SCADA security. As building a trust takes time, the sooner any kind of cooperation is started, the greater  chance that it will contribute to the development of effective CIP program. Most of high quality ICS-SCADA  security guidebooks released in various Member States have been developed in cooperation between  government entities and CI operators.  Observation:  Low trust between CII operators and public bodies and non-standardized approach for information sharing  among Critical Sectors across Member States.  Auditing and certification  Implementation of auditing programmes always requires answering two questions:  1. What should be audited?  2. What should be the reference point to the audit?  This is why implementation of auditing and certification in the area of CIP is strictly related to the maturity of  particular MS in the area of critical assets identification and legislation. Independently from the results of the  maturity level assessment, most Member States consider future implementation of auditing and certification  programmes.  Germany  Germany is one example of MS currently in the process of implement an auditing system. As regulations  regarding the definition of critical assets and minimal security requirements are still being developed,  no audit process has been implemented yet. After the corresponding executive orders are published,  critical assets owners will have a 2 year period to implement the required controls. Audits will be  conducted every two years by commercial companies, which manage to obtain BSI accreditation. For  noncompliance with regulation penalties are foreseen up to 100 000€. The described model of  obligatory audits conducted by accredited companies is the approach which is considered or already  implemented by most Member States (in some cases however no penalties are foreseen).  A separate, but interesting and important case, is a certification program which is being currently developed  in France.  France  Unlike other initiatives, France initiated a program dedicated to certification of ICS devices and service  providers. The program is eventually going to bring benefits to both ICS vendors (who will be able to  get independent confirmation that their products are being developed with a certain level of security)  and users (who will be able to consciously choose devices which have been developed with security in  mind). If the program is successful, it may be reasonable to consider its expansion to the whole EU.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  31  Incident handling  The ability to respond to and mitigate the impact of ICS incidents is crucial to ensure security and continuity  of Critical Services in Member States. However to provide meaningful support to critical service providers,  appropriate resources need to be maintained.  Most of todays’ incident handling capabilities in the EU, however, are limited to IT cyber security only. Limited  resources are dedicated specifically to the industrial control environment. Sector specific agencies are often  involved in the process of investigation/monitoring/ response to ICS SCADA cyber security incidents.  Spain  The Secretaría de Estado de Telecomunicaciones y para la Sociedad de la Información (Secretary of State  for Telecommunications and the Information Society) has concluded an agreement in which, amongst  other matters, the terms for joint work between CNPIC and the Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad  (National Institute of Cybersecurity – INCIBE) in the field of Response to Incidents for Spanish-based  Information Technology Critical Infrastructures are laid out. This sets out how INCIBE functions as a tool  for supporting CNPIC in the management of cybersecurity incidents.  Together, both institutions have set up a Security Incident Response Team, which specializes in the  analysis and management of information technology security problems and incidents. This Response  Team functions as a CERT, specialized in the management of Critical Infrastructure incidents on a  national level. Whenever a Critical Infrastructure suffers a cybersecurity problem, the operator  responsible for such matters can avail himself of the response team’s services, making the incident  known by means of the Single Contact Point set up to this end.  The ICS-SCADA incident handling topic has been recognized by ENISA in 2013, when recommendations for  emergency response capabilities in the area of ICS-SCADA were published.23 The report presents advantages  and disadvantages of different types of organizations: ICS sector specific, national, regional and global. It also  discusses the technical and organizational operational capabilities required for the provisioning of emergency  response services. ENISA also points out the need for an on-going co-operation between CERTS’s providing  response services and other ICS stakeholders (ICS system providers and vendors, other CERT’s, international  initiatives in the area of ICS-SCADA protection).  Incentives  Application of incentive systems to promote ICS-SCADA cyber security and increase investments in this area  is a subject of discussion as different approaches are presented by various Member States. Many Member  States do not believe that financial incentives are the right direction to build awareness and ICS-SCADA cyber  security backbone for Critical Infrastructure operators. The general belief is that Critical Infrastructure cyber  security lays under the responsibility of the operator itself, therefore no incentive should be in place.  On the  other hand incentives were most frequently indicated by CII operators, as the expected means of Member  States or EU support.  Three types of incentives in the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security were identified, as possible to implement in  the future:  23 “Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems - Computer Emergency Response  Capabilities considerations for ICS” - ENISA 2013-12-04  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  32   Direct subsidy - refinancing of ICS-SCADA cyber security activities   Tax exemption - tax relief towards Critical Infrastructure operators resulting from obtaining ICS-SCADA  cyber security measures   Discounts on insurance rates - lower insurance cost towards Critical Infrastructure operators resulting  from obtaining ICS-SCADA cyber security measures  According to the study, only direct subsidies have been identified to be implemented in Estonia.  Estonia  As part of Critical Information Infrastructure protection, ICS security assessments are performed on a  voluntary basis, sponsored by the Estonian Government. As part of the security testing, also  comprehensive IT assessment is included. The security assessments included:   Information gathering from public sources: what kind of tools is each company using   Networks perimeters: how is possible to protect different types of networks   Workstation & servers   Remote access: facing Internet   Physical security: how much time security company takes to come   Disaster recovery plans, architecture, security policies, etc.  Awareness raising  Numerous Member States identified improvement on ICS-SCADA security awareness as one of the biggest  priorities for upcoming years.24 Several activities have been conducted to achieve this goal, but obtained  results are difficult to measure. It is also clear that this area has a potential for further improvement. As high  level of awareness is normal within personnel with an IT background, ICS engineers naturally focus themselves  on the system functionalities and availability. However, as the number of ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents  around the globe is rising and becomes a better-known topic, security researchers’s efforts are increasing  visibility and interest on the area. Such events naturally increase basic awareness in much broader a way than  any other, government run or supported activities, however they lack of deeper expertise and real educational  value. This is what makes a role of government entities and private associations so important. The following  educational activities are currently being conducted by Member States to support Critical Infrastructure  operators on ICS-SCADA security:   Development of whitepapers and guidebooks dedicated to the ICS-SCADA security  A lot of Member States government entities have published materials dedicated to the ICS-SCADA  security. Some of those have been prepared in working groups with representatives of various ICS  SCADA security stakeholders, e.g.: government entities, Critical Infrastructure operators, ICS-SCADA  solution vendors and private security associations. In many cases such approach allowed for achieving  of high quality of the prepared publications. The fact that some of those materials have been publicly  released not only in national languages, but in English as well, makes them useful for the whole EU  society.  In Annex A is available the list of a few most worth mentioning publications publicly available.  Observation:  24 Interviews with: RIA (Estonia) on 07 VII 2015, BSI (Germany) on 15 VI 2015, RCB (Poland) on 19 VI 2015,  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  33  Low awareness on ICS-SCADA cyber security topic and treating ICS-SCADA as regular IT.  Training  Currently, there is a very limited number of available courses on the ICS-SCADA cyber security. Below is an  overview of the most notables examples. Related to this area, ENISA covered in 2015 also the topic of available  certifications for skills in ICS SCADA25.  INCIBE (Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad, Spain) has carried out the first MOOC Cyber Security Advanced  Course in Control Systems and Industrial Automation. This course has been designed and developed in  collaboration with leading Spanish industrial sector organizations and cybersecurity, as well as national and  international expert highly, thus ensuring that the course includes both the required content, the experiences  and advice of the most skilled professionals on the international scene. This course is taught through the  MOOC approach (Massive Open Online Courses), namely, Online, massive and open to everyone so through  the new training platform INCIBE.26 The course required a student input of 50 hours over 6 weeks. The first  occurrence of the course was closed in February 2015, event was attended by 3,200 participants, 11% of  whom the completed the course successfully. The course was delivered in English and Spanish.  Another interesting Spanish initiative is development of two years cybersecurity research centric academic  degree on MSc Research in Cybersecurity from Universidad de León. This Master’s degree will be taught in  two courses. The first course allows students to obtain knowledge in the most relevant cybersecurity research  fields: systems (operating system and network) cybersecurity, software security, cyber-physical systems  security (including industrial security), human aspects and legal implications of cybersecurity, mathematics  for cybersecurity, and security auditing and forensics. All modules are mandatory, allowing students to gather  knowledge enough to know where they would like to start their future research. The second course is split  across two semesters; during the first one students choose elective subjects of their preference to expand  their knowledge in their field of choice: systems, software, industrial, human & legal, mathematics, auditing  and forensics, or even practical experience, a six month paid work experience in a cybersecurity related  company; during the second part of the year, they work on their master thesis. This Master’s degree will be  taught completely in English and the content will be offered both in-classroom and online (using the AVIP  platform of Spanish UNED). The Universidad de León is currently pending approval from Spanish ANECA  (Agencia Nacional de Evaluación de la Calidad y Acreditación).  France pointed out how to increase in the number of ICS SCADA security competent personnel is one of the  goals in its cyber security strategy27:  “The presence of information systems security experts in our industrial base must therefore be increased.  Orienting young people towards such jobs will be encouraged in order to expand the pool of expertise  available in the country.”  To achieve this goal ANSSI promotes the idea of creating courses dedicated to ICS-SCADA security.  For that  purpose, ANSSI developed a guide for the entities who would like to conduct such trainings. If the guide will  be successful, BSI (Germany) considers adapting this in the future for its own CIP programmes28.  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial- control-systems/certification-of-cyber-security-skills-of-ics-scada-professionals  26 www.incibe.es and information provided by INCIBE in OT assessment maturity form, 2015  27 “Information systems defence and security.

The trainings are planned to be continued in the  future29.  Observation:  Currently, there is a very limited number of available courses on the ICS-SCADA cyber security.  Research & Development  Only few scientific programs have been identified during the study. In most Member States, there is no real  cooperation between the scientific community and entities responsible for ICS SCADA security in Critical  Infrastructure, although most of interviewed stakeholders mentioned that they are planning to initiate such  cooperation in the future. In those few Member States where such cooperation exists, it seems that in the  longer period of time such cooperation can bring a significant value to the protection of Critical Infrastructure  in the whole EU. The most interesting identified research is a work of the SUPPRESS group of the University  of León has designed a laboratory for research in cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructures, which replicates  these control architectures in an environment that tries to replicate the real conditions.  This platform is  funded by the National Program of Scientific Infrastructures and Equipment, and it is currently in the  equipment acquisition phase. The five main goals aimed with this design are:  1. To include industrial control equipment and software that is widely used in Critical Infrastructures.  2. To achieve enough flexibility to allow reconfiguration of the networks as well as the application of  several combinations of security measures.  3. To allow replication of control and monitoring networks present in different sectors of Critical  Infrastructures, particularly, industrial control systems, power management, building management and  smart cities.  4. To allow testing at every level of the automation architecture, on heterogeneous equipment and on the  most widely used network protocols in each application area.  5. To include a management system that facilitates testing, enabling data acquisition (from the control  and monitoring system, network traffic, logs, alerts, statistics, etc.) and storage, as well as tools to  manage networks30.  Observation:  Few scientific programmes and no real cooperation between scientific community and entities responsible for  ICS SCADA security in Critical Infrastructure.  Public-Private Partnership  Public-Private Partnership include cooperation between government entities and various organizations which  specializes in delivering of cyber security services (e.g. vendors, consulting companies, private associations).  This approach allows for very fast and efficient gathering information about world leading standards and  trends.  Poland  The RCB is currently in the process of gathering information on leading standards by cooperation with  entities and companies competent in various areas of safety/security. Such collaboration results in the  29 Interview with RIA (Estonia) on 7 VII 2015  30 Information provided by INCIBE in OT assessment maturity form, 2015  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  35  development of series of handbooks, each focused on different angle of security (e.g. technical safety –  already released, cyber security – currently being developed).  Objectives and restraints  Representatives of entities responsible for the ICS-SCADA security in Member States covered by this study  most often listed following goals in this area for the near future:  1. Raising of the awareness about ICS-SCADA security among all stakeholders  2. Building the willingness and mechanisms for effective sharing of information between stakeholders  3. Increasing the quality of ICS-SCADA products on the market from the point of view of security features  The first two goals were listed by countries with a lower level of maturity, which have just or are currently  developing a fundament for the ICS-SCADA security improvement (regulations and mechanisms for good  practices adaptations). Building of ICS-SCADA security community is believed by representatives of those  Member States crucial for obtaining of CI operators understanding of need to increase security of industrial  control systems and accepting it. The experience of Member States that have already reached a higher level  of maturity prove that this is an appropriate approach.  The third and most popular goal has been quoted by countries which obtained higher scores in the maturity  assessment. These Member States have already managed to achieve a high level of trust between ICS-SCADA  security stakeholders and usually build up awareness with publications, seminaries, trainings, etc., often  developed in cooperation with CI operators.  Those Member States believe that they managed to implement  organizational measures on a sufficient level – now the main challenge is to provide CI operators with security  embedded technical solutions.  The list below includes restraints in the process of ICS-SCADA security improvement which were most often  mentioned during the interviews with Member States representatives. All of them create a significant barrier  in the improvement of ICS-SCADA security, but examples of achievements from various Member States  described in the previous chapters proves, that they can be overcome with a proper approach. The names of  corresponding chapters have been included in the brackets.  1. Lack of clearly identified Critical Infrastructure assets and their dependencies (see Assets covered).  2. The willingness to share information (see Information sharing and public/private partnership).  3. Lack of personnel with ICS SCADA security skills (see Education).  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  36  5. Recommendations  As a result of this study, six major recommendation were identified, which can significantly increase the level  of ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity level across Europe.  All the recommendations are considered necessary to ensure a higher level of maturity in the area of ICS-SCADA  cyber security and are in line with the EU vision towards Critical Information Infrastructure Protection. However  to ensure unanimity and high effectiveness in realization of these recommendations, an open discussion needs  to be initiated including all Member States, CII operators and academia. Moreover a joint effort during the  realization phase needs to be ensured to enable a steady growth in the ICS-SCADA cyber security maturity level.  Recommendation 1: Align ICS-SCADA efforts with national cyber security strategies and CIIP efforts  The evolution of the current ICS-SCADA environment, which exposes Critical Infrastructure to more robust  cyber threats, impose the need for coherent and planned actions towards higher security level. Current  regulations and policies are aimed at a reporting obligation, minimal security requirements compliance or  development of CIP plans.  At present ICS-SCADA cyber security is not aligned with National Cyber Security Strategies and CIIP efforts.  National Cyber Security Strategies create a baseline for defining cyber space, cyber security objectives and areas  of actions. As ICS-SCADA area is an integral part of the National and EU cyberspace and Critical Infrastructures,  Governmental decision makers responsible for industrial security/Critical Infrastructure Protection should  aligned all these activities with the NCSS as well as CIIP efforts.  Recommendation 2: Develop good practices specific to ICS-SCADA cyber security  Many Member States do not use industry good practices as a reference to set-up ICS-SCADA their cyber security  baseline for Critical Sectors. Multiple guidelines, ICS-SCADA security standards and good practices are already  developed in the ICS community as well as by individual Member States. It is recommended to leverage from  this to develop a minimum security baseline and good practices for ICS-SCADA in Critical Sectors in EU.  This activity should involve relevant Member States agencies, ICS SCADA operators, vendors and  standardization bodies. PPP initiatives using current ICS-SCADA forums aimed at ICS-SCADA cyber security  guidelines development could be used. The goal should be is to ensure minimum baseline for ICS-SCADA  security.  Recommendation 3: Standardize information sharing among critical sectors and Member States  Information sharing on ICS-SCADA cyber security incidents and good practices are not communicated in a  standardized and frequent manner.  Special emphasis should be given by ICS-SCADA operators and incident  handlers in standardizing information sharing of good practices and known threats across critical sectors.  A common approach to report cyber security incidents and good practices should be fostered.  For example,  relevant Member States authorities and ICS SCADA operators could agree on a specific incident data scheme  for ICS response and also incident report. Trust between CII operators and relevant Member States  organizations should be built to ensure effective communication from, as well as towards, the operators.  Recommendation 4: Build ICS-SCADA cyber security awareness  A special emphasis should be given relevant Member States authorities on building awareness of ICS-SCADA  cyber security aspects not only across CII operators, but also among decision and policy makers. Nowadays  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  37  awareness is built mainly on serious security breaches and incidents. This however showcase the more reactive  approach, which should be moved towards continuous awareness growth.  As a consequence the ICS-SCADA cyber security threats should be well understood and considered separate  from IT security. This could be obtained through organizing ICS-SCADA cyber security related events involving  sector specific platforms to share current challenges and good practices. Knowledge sharing and awareness  building should result directly from the ICS-SCADA cyber security strategies.  Recommendation 5: Foster expertise with ICS-SCADA cyber security trainings and educational programmes.  Current ICS-SCADA cyber security threats multiply at a very rapid pace. Also more robust and technology  advanced attacks (e.g. APT) are aimed at ICS systems. Moreover a lot of ICS-SCADA cyber security aspects are  considered the same as in IT. This basic misunderstanding very often leads to security flaws in ICS-SCADA  environment.  A deep understanding of the process as well as technology is needed in order to perceive the real risk and focus  area for improving ICS-SCADA cyber security. This is why it is so important that relevant Member States  authorities, operators and vendors of ICS-SCADA systems work together to raise future experts and leaders in  the area of ICS-SCADA cyber security. This could be done by setting up and support new study programs for ICS- SCADA security as well as organize and promote related trainings among public bodies.  Recommendation 6: Promote and support ICS-SCADA cyber security research and test beds  Relevant Member States authorities, the European Commission and operators of Critical Infrastructure should  encourage research and development programmes for ICS-SCADA cyber security and security test bed focused  in ICS environments. The results of these activities will be beneficial for all operators of Critical Infrastructure  and could represent a competitive advantage at European level.  The current ICS test bed initiatives in Member States are not mature enough in terms of technical versatility  and fluency of work to assume immediate leadership of tasks testing in Europe. It is necessary to involve ICS- SCADA experts and system vendors in the process of addressing current and future cyber security related  threats. Support in research programmes and creation of common test-beds can foster ICS-SCADA cyber  security innovation and improve security-by-design concept.  Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors  38  Annex  A – List of ICS publications  Below the list of a few most worth mentioning publications publicly available in English:  PUBLICATION PUBLISHED BY DESCRIPTION  “Cybersecurity for Industrial Control  Systems.

It include the overview of the  role and architecture of ICS-SCADA and  propose the list of 17 recommendations  for Critical Infrastructure operators to  achieve increased level of security.  “Critical Infrastructure Security – the ICT  Dimension”  The Kosciuszko Institute, RCB, EY, Poland,  2015  The report contains a collection of  articles on ICS-SCADA security in the  context of CIP. Although some chapters  concern Poland specific conditions,  report is a good introduction to the ICS- SCADA issues and challenges for people  who are begin to approach the topic.  There are some publications available in national languages only. Their quality was not assessed during this study,  however the level of details of those publications suggest, that their eventual translation into English would bring  significant profit to the EU society knowledge. These include:  PUBLICATION PUBLISHED BY DESCRIPTION  “ICS Security Kompendium” BSI, Germany, 2014 Includes description of fundamentals on  Security of Industrial Control System.

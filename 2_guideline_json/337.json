The Cybersecurity Act1 revamps  and strengthens ENISA’s role by granting it a permanent mandate, more  resources and new tasks. Furthermore, the agency is starting a new  chapter with a new executive director, a new strategy and a new  organisational structure. With all these changes taking place, it is time for  the ETL to change too and to adopt a new structure and a modern look  and feel, moving away from a lengthy and static type of report. With its  new visual identity and format, the ETL report has become a versatile,  dynamic and easy-to-use digital report, attempting to meet the  expectations of a growing and demanding audience.  _ 8 years reviewing the threat landscape  ETL 2012 ETL 2020  ENISA threat landscape journey from 2012 to 2020  2  This edition reviews the threat landscape for the period between  January 2019 and April 2020 and is structured in the following  way.

The report attempts to be  industry and vendor agnostic and references or cites the work from  various security researches, security blogs and news media articles,  clearly identified throughout the text in multiple endnotes.  For the production of ENISA Threat Landscape Report, we followed a  two-pronged approach. First, we conducted in-depth desk research of  available literature from open sources such as news media articles,  expert opinion, intelligence reports, incident analysis and security  research reports. Second, we conducted interviews with members of the  ETL stakeholders group who are experts in the field and members of the  EU Cyber Threat Intelligence Community. The latter helped us defining  the top 15 threats list and validating the assumptions over the trends  and future challenges in cybersecurity.  We also thank the members of the CTI Stakeholders Group for all the  support provided for the production of the reports during these eight  editions. The members of this group review and validate the analysis  produced for each ETL Report and vote on the annual list of top 15 cyber  threats.  _ Methodology  4  _ Who should read what  ETL REPORT TYPE OF  CONTENT TARGETED AUDIENCE  THE YEAR IN REVIEW Generic All  CTI OVERVIEW  Specific CTI community members and  practitioners.

Two distinct facts have significantly  contributed to these changes: the historically unique, abrupt  transformation forces released by the coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pandemic; and the continuous increasing trend in the  advanced adversary capabilities of threat actors. Remarkably, the  latter has come to amplify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in  cyberspace.  The COVID-19 pandemic forced large-scale adoption of technology to  master a variety of critical aspects of the crisis, such as coordination of  health services, the international response to spread of COVID-19,  adoption of teleworking regimes, distance learning, interpersonal  communication, control of lockdown measures, teleconferencing and  many others. Given this situation, business leaders have assessed the  emerging risks from abrupt (technological) adoption, which materialised  from the transformation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic 2 . And  cybersecurity has been faced with a paradox: it has been both the  challenge and the opportunity in this transformation. The changes  imposed in the information technology (IT) landscape weakened existing  cybersecurity measures, turning their speedy adaptation into a  challenge. At the same time, cybersecurity is the enabler of trust in  emerging use-cases for digital services and thus it has the  opportunity to facilitate the transformation.  _ What changed in the landscape  8  While working from home, cybersecurity specialists had to adapt  existing defences to a new infrastructure paradigm, attempting to  minimise the exposure to a variety of novel attacks where the entry points  are employees’ Internet-connected home and other smart devices. At the  same time and under high-pressure, they had to implement solutions  based on previously less trusted components, such as remote access  through the public Internet, cloud services, unsecured video streaming  services and mobile devices and apps. The necessary reaction to the  COVID-19 pandemic to guarantee safety and at the same reduce the  impact on businesses, has pushed organisations to the limits of their ability  to respond to changes. Furthermore, numerous modus operandi quickly  adapted to the changing work patterns, cybersecurity professionals  found themselves acting at the limits of their capacities.  In a short turnaround time, IT security professionals had to  quickly respond to the challenges introduced by working  from home arrangements such as enterprise data  movements whenever employees use their home Internet  to access cloud-based apps, corporate software,  videoconferencing, and file sharing.  As the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet entirely under control, and because of  the uncertainty of its future spread, it is expected that it will continue to  challenge cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, given the lapsed time  before incidents are spotted and analysed, it will leave its footprint on the  cyber threat landscape for a long time to come. The COVID-19 pandemic  showed that malicious actors had a level of capability that allowed them to  adapt to this transformation quickly. In 2019-2020, adversarial modus  operandi focused on the personalisation of attack vectors. Advanced  credential-stealing methods, credential-stuffing, highly targeted phishing  attacks, advanced social engineering attacks, advanced malware  obfuscation techniques and more extensive penetration of mobile  platforms are the main achievements of adversaries in the reporting  period. If cybercriminals start combining these advances with artificial  intelligence and machine learning, in the future we will see an increase in  successful attacks and undetectable campaigns.  9  _ Summary  The list below summarises the main trends observed in the cyber  threat landscape during the reporting period. These are also  reviewed in detail throughout the different reports composing the  threat landscape of 2020.  01_Attack surface in cybersecurity continues to  expand as we are entering a new phase of the digital  transformation.  02_There will be a new social and economic norm  after the COVID-19 pandemic even more dependent on  a secure and reliable cyberspace.  03_The use of social media platforms in targeted  attacks is a serious trend and reaches different  domains and types of threats.  04_Finely targeted and persistent attacks on high-  value data (e.g. intellectual property and state  secrets) are being meticulously planned and executed  by state-sponsored actors.  05_Massively distributed attacks with a short  duration and wide impact are used with multiple  objectives such as credential theft.  Overview  10  06_The motivation behind the majority of  cyberattacks is still financial.  07_Ransomware remains widespread with costly  consequences to many organisations.  08_Still many cybersecurity incidents go unnoticed  or take a long time to be detected.  09_With more security automation, organisations  will be invest more in preparedness using Cyber Threat  Intelligence as its main capability.  10_The number of phishing victims continues to  grow since it exploits the human dimension being the  weakest link.  _ Summary  11  With all the changes observed in the cyber threat  landscape and the challenges created by the COVID-19  pandemic, there is still a long way before cyberspace  becomes a trustworthy and safe environment for  everyone.  _ Are EU citizens more aware of the risks and  challenges cyberspace brings?  European Commission prepared a special  Eurobarometer survey4 in 2019 with the  aim of understanding EU citizens’  awareness, experiences and perceptions  of cybersecurity.  The results of this survey show that Internet use in Europe  continues to grow, particularly via smartphones, and citizens  are more aware of the potential dangers when going online.  According to the survey’s findings, concerns about online  privacy and security have already led more than 9 in 10  Internet users to change their online behaviour – most often  by not opening e-mails from unknown people, installing anti-  virus software, visiting only known and trusted websites and  using only their own computers.  While these results are quite encouraging, many users still fall  into online fraud and e-mail phishing baits. This reveals that  malicious actors are using sophisticated attacks that are  harder to detect and avoid. Hence, mitigation strategies have  to be updated regularly to accommodate the latest available  intelligence (CTI) on attack techniques.  EUROBAROMETER  Overview  12  13  “The threat landscape  is becoming extremely  difficult to map.

Malware  15  Conclusions and  Recommendations   During the last decades, policymakers and technologists inhabited two  separate worlds and spoke different languages. To address the challenges  from digitalisation, these should work together from the ground up and  develop a common approach. Since most of today’s technology is connected  to cyberspace, the contribution from cybersecurity experts in many of these  discussions is of paramount importance.   With the growing technological innovation and rapid expansion of  cyberspace, effective and comprehensive EU cybersecurity policies are of  critical importance. Mature cybersecurity policies will provide the  necessary security capacity at all levels of society: governments, critical  infrastructures, businesses, tertiary sector and individuals. Security capacity  must be effective and flexible to deal with new challenges as they arise to  cope with the ever-changing nature of cyberspace.   Given the increasing number of EU and Member States stakeholders involved  in CTI activities, cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI activities is  key. ENISA will promote cooperation with various stakeholders and make an  initial attempt to identify the CTI requirements of various stakeholder groups,  especially within EU (i.e. the Commission, EU bodies, agencies and Member  States).   CTI should be considered as the main tool for cybersecurity preparedness  and facilitation of risk-based approaches. Integrating CTI with security  management processes will help CTI to proliferate spreading in related areas  and will increase the agility of usually lengthy processes such as certification  and risk assessment. Moreover, CTI will be seen as a facilitator of emergency  decisions needed in crisis management.   The relevance of CTI for strategic and political decisions is widely accepted  and considered essential to facilitate the connection to geopolitical  information and cyber-physical systems. This will enable CTI to be included  in EU-wide decision-making processes but it will also allow its context to  expand to identify hybrid threats.  _ Policy conclusions/recommendations  16   During 2019, an increasing number of test labs and cyber-ranges 10  became  available on premises and with cloud offerings. These are important  resources for training staff, simulating attacks and testing multiple defence  strategies. All in a multipurpose virtual environment.   Although some CTI criteria and requirements have been developed for  various CTI user profiles, similar requirements will be necessary for further  CTI products, services and tools. CTI vendors will need to take greater  account of users’ requirements to facilitate the adoption of CTI products and  services.   Investment in some basic CTI concepts, in particular CTI maturity and  threat hierarchies, is very useful for the uptake of CTI. Vendors will need to  orient their offerings to various CTI maturity levels to facilitate efficient use of  CTI within organisations of various sizes and budgets.   In the long run, it looks as if OpenCTI 11  may be a good solution to the  fragmentation of CTI offerings, given its inherent capability to integrate CTI  sources of various types into a single tooling environment. CTI vendors will  need to provide the necessary ‘bridges’ from their products to enable their  integration with OpenCTI. The Cyber Range concept was initially defined in  2013 by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in the report “Common staff  target for military cooperation on cyber ranges in the European Union” as a  multipurpose environment in support of three primary processes: knowledge  development, assurance and dissemination.  _ Business conclusions/recommendations  17  Conclusions and  Recommendations   The EU should continue investing in cybersecurity R&D, with an emphasis  on long-term and high-risk research initiatives. Long-term research and  innovation is a costly exercise out of reach for most private sector  organisations.   The expansion of knowledge and expertise in cybersecurity is crucial to  improve preparedness and resilience. The EU should continue building  capacity through the investment in cybersecurity training programs,  professional certification, exercises and awareness campaigns.   Cybersecurity research should include expertise from social, behavioural,  and economic disciplines. Multidisciplinary research in cybersecurity  should be promoted and incentivised across the EU.   The results from research projects in the area of Cybersecurity and in  particular on CTI need to be assessed and mapped to a wider context to  identify overlaps and gaps and to make them comparable to existing  commercial products, services and practices. This will help to disseminate  these results to the user community.   Novel approaches for the uptake of CTI knowledge by domains that can  profit from it need to be developed. Examples are cyber-ranges, hybrid  threats and geopolitical assessments. The synergies achieved may boost  use-cases and content quality in a multidirectional manner.   The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within CTI  should be further investigated. This will reduce the number of manual steps  in analysing CTI and will increase the value of machine learning functions  within CTI activities.   The provision and use of open-source CTI material should be promoted. This  will facilitate knowledge transfer, but it will also lower the threshold for the  CTI skills required.  _ Research and educational conclusions  and recommendations  18  19  “The sophistication  of threat capabilities  increased in 2019,  with many  adversaries using  exploits, credential  stealing and multi-  stage attacks.” in ETL 2020  20  1. “EU Cybersecurity Act”.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - The year in Review  From January 2019 to April 2020  The year in  review ENISA Threat Landscape  ENEN  Before we start  This year, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)  celebrates one year of the new Cybersecurity Act and the eighth edition  of the Threat Landscape Report (ETL). The Cybersecurity Act1 revamps  and strengthens ENISA’s role by granting it a permanent mandate, more  resources and new tasks. Furthermore, the agency is starting a new  chapter with a new executive director, a new strategy and a new  organisational structure. With all these changes taking place, it is time for  the ETL to change too and to adopt a new structure and a modern look  and feel, moving away from a lengthy and static type of report. With its  new visual identity and format, the ETL report has become a versatile,  dynamic and easy-to-use digital report, attempting to meet the  expectations of a growing and demanding audience.  _ 8 years reviewing the threat landscape  ETL 2012 ETL 2020  ENISA threat landscape journey from 2012 to 2020  2  This edition reviews the threat landscape for the period between  January 2019 and April 2020 and is structured in the following  way.

The report attempts to be  industry and vendor agnostic and references or cites the work from  various security researches, security blogs and news media articles,  clearly identified throughout the text in multiple endnotes.  For the production of ENISA Threat Landscape Report, we followed a  two-pronged approach. First, we conducted in-depth desk research of  available literature from open sources such as news media articles,  expert opinion, intelligence reports, incident analysis and security  research reports. Second, we conducted interviews with members of the  ETL stakeholders group who are experts in the field and members of the  EU Cyber Threat Intelligence Community. The latter helped us defining  the top 15 threats list and validating the assumptions over the trends  and future challenges in cybersecurity.  We also thank the members of the CTI Stakeholders Group for all the  support provided for the production of the reports during these eight  editions. The members of this group review and validate the analysis  produced for each ETL Report and vote on the annual list of top 15 cyber  threats.  _ Methodology  4  _ Who should read what  ETL REPORT TYPE OF  CONTENT TARGETED AUDIENCE  THE YEAR IN REVIEW Generic All  CTI OVERVIEW  Specific CTI community members and  practitioners.

Two distinct facts have significantly  contributed to these changes: the historically unique, abrupt  transformation forces released by the coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pandemic; and the continuous increasing trend in the  advanced adversary capabilities of threat actors. Remarkably, the  latter has come to amplify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in  cyberspace.  The COVID-19 pandemic forced large-scale adoption of technology to  master a variety of critical aspects of the crisis, such as coordination of  health services, the international response to spread of COVID-19,  adoption of teleworking regimes, distance learning, interpersonal  communication, control of lockdown measures, teleconferencing and  many others. Given this situation, business leaders have assessed the  emerging risks from abrupt (technological) adoption, which materialised  from the transformation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic 2 . And  cybersecurity has been faced with a paradox: it has been both the  challenge and the opportunity in this transformation. The changes  imposed in the information technology (IT) landscape weakened existing  cybersecurity measures, turning their speedy adaptation into a  challenge. At the same time, cybersecurity is the enabler of trust in  emerging use-cases for digital services and thus it has the  opportunity to facilitate the transformation.  _ What changed in the landscape  8  While working from home, cybersecurity specialists had to adapt  existing defences to a new infrastructure paradigm, attempting to  minimise the exposure to a variety of novel attacks where the entry points  are employees’ Internet-connected home and other smart devices. At the  same time and under high-pressure, they had to implement solutions  based on previously less trusted components, such as remote access  through the public Internet, cloud services, unsecured video streaming  services and mobile devices and apps. The necessary reaction to the  COVID-19 pandemic to guarantee safety and at the same reduce the  impact on businesses, has pushed organisations to the limits of their ability  to respond to changes. Furthermore, numerous modus operandi quickly  adapted to the changing work patterns, cybersecurity professionals  found themselves acting at the limits of their capacities.  In a short turnaround time, IT security professionals had to  quickly respond to the challenges introduced by working  from home arrangements such as enterprise data  movements whenever employees use their home Internet  to access cloud-based apps, corporate software,  videoconferencing, and file sharing.  As the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet entirely under control, and because of  the uncertainty of its future spread, it is expected that it will continue to  challenge cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, given the lapsed time  before incidents are spotted and analysed, it will leave its footprint on the  cyber threat landscape for a long time to come. The COVID-19 pandemic  showed that malicious actors had a level of capability that allowed them to  adapt to this transformation quickly. In 2019-2020, adversarial modus  operandi focused on the personalisation of attack vectors. Advanced  credential-stealing methods, credential-stuffing, highly targeted phishing  attacks, advanced social engineering attacks, advanced malware  obfuscation techniques and more extensive penetration of mobile  platforms are the main achievements of adversaries in the reporting  period. If cybercriminals start combining these advances with artificial  intelligence and machine learning, in the future we will see an increase in  successful attacks and undetectable campaigns.  9  _ Summary  The list below summarises the main trends observed in the cyber  threat landscape during the reporting period. These are also  reviewed in detail throughout the different reports composing the  threat landscape of 2020.  01_Attack surface in cybersecurity continues to  expand as we are entering a new phase of the digital  transformation.  02_There will be a new social and economic norm  after the COVID-19 pandemic even more dependent on  a secure and reliable cyberspace.  03_The use of social media platforms in targeted  attacks is a serious trend and reaches different  domains and types of threats.  04_Finely targeted and persistent attacks on high-  value data (e.g. intellectual property and state  secrets) are being meticulously planned and executed  by state-sponsored actors.  05_Massively distributed attacks with a short  duration and wide impact are used with multiple  objectives such as credential theft.  Overview  10  06_The motivation behind the majority of  cyberattacks is still financial.  07_Ransomware remains widespread with costly  consequences to many organisations.  08_Still many cybersecurity incidents go unnoticed  or take a long time to be detected.  09_With more security automation, organisations  will be invest more in preparedness using Cyber Threat  Intelligence as its main capability.  10_The number of phishing victims continues to  grow since it exploits the human dimension being the  weakest link.  _ Summary  11  With all the changes observed in the cyber threat  landscape and the challenges created by the COVID-19  pandemic, there is still a long way before cyberspace  becomes a trustworthy and safe environment for  everyone.  _ Are EU citizens more aware of the risks and  challenges cyberspace brings?  European Commission prepared a special  Eurobarometer survey4 in 2019 with the  aim of understanding EU citizens’  awareness, experiences and perceptions  of cybersecurity.  The results of this survey show that Internet use in Europe  continues to grow, particularly via smartphones, and citizens  are more aware of the potential dangers when going online.  According to the survey’s findings, concerns about online  privacy and security have already led more than 9 in 10  Internet users to change their online behaviour – most often  by not opening e-mails from unknown people, installing anti-  virus software, visiting only known and trusted websites and  using only their own computers.  While these results are quite encouraging, many users still fall  into online fraud and e-mail phishing baits. This reveals that  malicious actors are using sophisticated attacks that are  harder to detect and avoid. Hence, mitigation strategies have  to be updated regularly to accommodate the latest available  intelligence (CTI) on attack techniques.  EUROBAROMETER  Overview  12  13  “The threat landscape  is becoming extremely  difficult to map.

Malware  15  Conclusions and  Recommendations   During the last decades, policymakers and technologists inhabited two  separate worlds and spoke different languages. To address the challenges  from digitalisation, these should work together from the ground up and  develop a common approach. Since most of today’s technology is connected  to cyberspace, the contribution from cybersecurity experts in many of these  discussions is of paramount importance.   With the growing technological innovation and rapid expansion of  cyberspace, effective and comprehensive EU cybersecurity policies are of  critical importance. Mature cybersecurity policies will provide the  necessary security capacity at all levels of society: governments, critical  infrastructures, businesses, tertiary sector and individuals. Security capacity  must be effective and flexible to deal with new challenges as they arise to  cope with the ever-changing nature of cyberspace.   Given the increasing number of EU and Member States stakeholders involved  in CTI activities, cooperation and coordination of EU-wide CTI activities is  key. ENISA will promote cooperation with various stakeholders and make an  initial attempt to identify the CTI requirements of various stakeholder groups,  especially within EU (i.e. the Commission, EU bodies, agencies and Member  States).   CTI should be considered as the main tool for cybersecurity preparedness  and facilitation of risk-based approaches. Integrating CTI with security  management processes will help CTI to proliferate spreading in related areas  and will increase the agility of usually lengthy processes such as certification  and risk assessment. Moreover, CTI will be seen as a facilitator of emergency  decisions needed in crisis management.   The relevance of CTI for strategic and political decisions is widely accepted  and considered essential to facilitate the connection to geopolitical  information and cyber-physical systems. This will enable CTI to be included  in EU-wide decision-making processes but it will also allow its context to  expand to identify hybrid threats.  _ Policy conclusions/recommendations  16   During 2019, an increasing number of test labs and cyber-ranges 10  became  available on premises and with cloud offerings. These are important  resources for training staff, simulating attacks and testing multiple defence  strategies. All in a multipurpose virtual environment.   Although some CTI criteria and requirements have been developed for  various CTI user profiles, similar requirements will be necessary for further  CTI products, services and tools. CTI vendors will need to take greater  account of users’ requirements to facilitate the adoption of CTI products and  services.   Investment in some basic CTI concepts, in particular CTI maturity and  threat hierarchies, is very useful for the uptake of CTI. Vendors will need to  orient their offerings to various CTI maturity levels to facilitate efficient use of  CTI within organisations of various sizes and budgets.   In the long run, it looks as if OpenCTI 11  may be a good solution to the  fragmentation of CTI offerings, given its inherent capability to integrate CTI  sources of various types into a single tooling environment. CTI vendors will  need to provide the necessary ‘bridges’ from their products to enable their  integration with OpenCTI. The Cyber Range concept was initially defined in  2013 by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in the report “Common staff  target for military cooperation on cyber ranges in the European Union” as a  multipurpose environment in support of three primary processes: knowledge  development, assurance and dissemination.  _ Business conclusions/recommendations  17  Conclusions and  Recommendations   The EU should continue investing in cybersecurity R&D, with an emphasis  on long-term and high-risk research initiatives. Long-term research and  innovation is a costly exercise out of reach for most private sector  organisations.   The expansion of knowledge and expertise in cybersecurity is crucial to  improve preparedness and resilience. The EU should continue building  capacity through the investment in cybersecurity training programs,  professional certification, exercises and awareness campaigns.   Cybersecurity research should include expertise from social, behavioural,  and economic disciplines. Multidisciplinary research in cybersecurity  should be promoted and incentivised across the EU.   The results from research projects in the area of Cybersecurity and in  particular on CTI need to be assessed and mapped to a wider context to  identify overlaps and gaps and to make them comparable to existing  commercial products, services and practices. This will help to disseminate  these results to the user community.   Novel approaches for the uptake of CTI knowledge by domains that can  profit from it need to be developed. Examples are cyber-ranges, hybrid  threats and geopolitical assessments. The synergies achieved may boost  use-cases and content quality in a multidirectional manner.   The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within CTI  should be further investigated. This will reduce the number of manual steps  in analysing CTI and will increase the value of machine learning functions  within CTI activities.   The provision and use of open-source CTI material should be promoted. This  will facilitate knowledge transfer, but it will also lower the threshold for the  CTI skills required.  _ Research and educational conclusions  and recommendations  18  19  “The sophistication  of threat capabilities  increased in 2019,  with many  adversaries using  exploits, credential  stealing and multi-  stage attacks.” in ETL 2020  20  1. “EU Cybersecurity Act”.

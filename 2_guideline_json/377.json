The purpose of the CSA in this regard is to give a new impetus to the  industry while meeting policy requirements at Member States’ level. Under the CSA, the key  role reserved for ENISA is to assist in the preparation of candidate cybersecurity certification  schemes. In doing so, ENISA needs to interact with both EU Member States (MS) and industry  stakeholders, to collect opinion and advice to feed into candidate schemes. ENISA looks  forward to bolstering its role and contribute further to cybersecurity in the EU.  INTRODUCTION  In June 2019, the Cybersecurity Act (hereinafter CSA)1 entered into force with a view to bring  together the current cybersecurity certification activities and policies across the Member States2.  The CSA follows an array of legal instruments that compose the legal framework of the Digital  Single Market while benefiting from the framework on standardisation, laid out by means of  Regulation (EU) 1025/20123, and provisions on conformity assessment, laid out in Regulation  (EC) 765/20084. This paper presents an outline of the evolving role of ENISA with regard to the  emerging functions and tasks associated with the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union  Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) PE/86/2018/REV/1.

In doing so, ENISA  needs to interact with  both EU Member  States and industry  stakeholders.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6759_en.htm http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2012/1025/oj http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2008/765/oj  BOLSTERING ENISA IN THE EU CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  Version 1.3 | July 2019  2  SCOPE OF CSA ON CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION VIS-A-VIS ENISA  The CSA is a multi-layered regulation that on the one hand addresses the updated ENISA  mandate and, on the other, lays out the EU cybersecurity certification framework. ENISA is  tasked with a new competence, namely to prepare candidate cybersecurity certification  schemes5. ENISA will also assist the Commission in carrying out certain tasks (e.g. in the  European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) and co-chair with the Commission the  Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)).  Thematic application areas likely to be affected by the cybersecurity certification provisions of  the CSA may include specific ICT products (e.g. semiconductors), services (e.g. cloud services)  and processes (e.g. information security related methods).  PROVISIONS IN THE REGULATION  Key limitations of the current state of affairs regarding cybersecurity certification stem from  market fragmentation and uncertainty with regard to the assurance provided by existing  arrangements and schemes. Concrete mitigation measures have also been deemed necessary  especially in the aftermath of massive cyberattacks e.g. in the area of ransomware. With a view  to pursuing the policy objective of a common cybersecurity certification framework across the  EU, this new area of activity for the EU seeks to enhance the ability of consumers and EU MS  governments to acquire more cybersecure ICT products, services and processes. By providing  rated assurance levels, it is expected that a degree of cybersecurity commensurate with the risk  profile of the application involved will be attained, thus reducing the risk footprint that would  have to be mitigated by end users. It is also expected that industry operating in the EU internal  market will benefit from this internal market framework and produce better outputs that stand up  to global competition. With reference to ENISA, the CSA has made the following provisions in  the area of certification:   Prepare candidate schemes or review existing ones, on the basis of:   The Union Rolling Work Programme (URWP) for EU Cybersecurity Certification (art 47).   A specific request of the Commission or of the ECCG (art. 48).   Maintain a dedicated website providing information on (art. 50):   EU cybersecurity certification schemes.   National certification schemes replaced by EU ones.   A store of EU cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of conformity.   While carrying out its tasks take into account the requirements on:   Security objectives of EU cybersecurity certification schemes (art. 51)   Assurance levels (art. 52)   Elements of EU cybersecurity certification schemes (art. 54)   Participate in the peer review of National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities (art. 59).   Assist the Commission to provide secretariat to the ECCG (art. 62(5)).   Along with the Commission, co-chair the SCCG (art. 22(4)).   Provide secretariat to the SCCG (art.22(4)).  5 CSA art. 48, 49 & 50.  It is expected  that industry  operating in the  EU internal  market will  benefit from this  internal market  framework and  produce better  outputs that  stand up to  global  competition.  BOLSTERING ENISA IN THE EU CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  Version 1.3 | July 2019  3   During the drafting of or each scheme, to establish an ad hoc Working Group to provide  ENISA with advice (art. 49(4)).  It must be noted that the EU cybersecurity certification framework as such, does not introduce  directly operational cybersecurity certification schemes.  In terms of a sequence of actions, the Commission prepares the URWP, taking into account the  opinion of the ECCG and the advice of the SCCG. Thereafter, ENISA prepares schemes taking  into account the advice provided by the ECCG and by an ad hoc working group per scheme.  ECCG will provide an opinion at the final draft of the scheme. While such opinion is not binding  upon ENISA, it is expected that it will be listened to, as a candidate certification scheme will be  scrutinised by EU Member States prior to being voted as an Implementing Act. Figure 1 below  illustrates this process.  Figure 1: Overview of the design of a European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme  STAKEHOLDERS  The role of ENISA relies on key stakeholders that include but are not limited to the following  ones:   the members of the ECCG and the SCCG,   the European Commission and competent authorities in the Member States represented  thereto,  BOLSTERING ENISA IN THE EU CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION FRAMEWORK  Version 1.3 | July 2019  4   National Accreditation Bodies, Certification Supervisory Authorities, Conformity Assessment  Bodies,   European standardisation organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) as well as international  and industry standardisation organisations,   product manufacturers and service providers who have an interest in EU schemes for the  certification of ICT products and services.  THE GOALS OF ENISA  At this stage, ENISA aligns itself with the framework and it is prepared to develop its capabilities  further to respond to the new tasks in relation to cybersecurity certification. The trust that the EU  Member States and the EU Institutions have vested in ENISA provides the basis to meet  evolving cybersecurity challenges.  It is important to facilitate Member States, particularly those with a robust presence in  information security certification, to transition to the new EU framework. The SOG-IS  agreement6 has provided the framework needed, and has proved a great success for EU  industry that now needs to be taken up at the EU level. ENISA stands clear to support the  transition to the new framework. Understanding the requirements of the key stakeholders in the  Member States, the EU Institutions and the industry remains an important target. ENISA has  been active in analysing prospective schemes, based on existing and new application areas  (e.g. consumer), classes of products (e.g. IoT) and types of services (e.g. Cloud), in a way that  will enable a quick response to requests to draw up candidate certification schemes.  MISSION  The mission of ENISA in the area of the EU cybersecurity certification framework is outlined as  follows: “To pro-actively contribute to the emerging EU framework for the ICT certification of  products and services and carry out the drawing up of candidate certification schemes in line  with the Cybersecurity Act, and additional services and tasks”.  Throughout its lifespan ENISA has received due recognition for its outputs. In a shift towards a  role that adds more value to the EU policy on network and information security, ENISA has  been singled out as the appropriate organisation to deliver on the promise of drawing up  candidate certification schemes in an EU cybersecurity certification framework. ENISA, with its  pivotal role as an agency that engages with public services as well as with industry and  standardisation organisations, provides a sound reference point to draw up candidate  cybersecurity certification schemes. The expected output of ENISA includes draft and finalised  candidate schemes for the certification of ICT products, services and processes, within the  meaning of the CSA.  CONCLUSIONS  The emerging EU cybersecurity certification framework provides ENISA with the opportunity to  step up its contribution to policy on cybersecurity in the EU. Stakeholder involvement is key,  6 The Senior Officials Group – Information Systems Security (SOG-IS) agreement has been developed pursuant to the EU  Council Decision 92/242/EEC of 31 March 1992 in the area of security of information systems; it also follows on Council  recommendation 1995/144/EC of 7 April 1995 on common information technology security evaluation criteria. The SOG-IS  agreement was last updated in 2010.  ENISA MISSION  To pro-actively  contribute to the  emerging EU  framework for the ICT  certification of  products and  services and carry  out the drawing up of  candidate certification  schemes in line with  the Cybersecurity  Act, and additional  services and tasks.

As ENISA has been  established as a support measure in the internal market,7 it underpins EU policy within its remit  to the benefit of the Member States. Key outputs of ENISA in relation to cybersecurity  certification are likely to enhance market conditions and help consumers and citizens alike enjoy  better opportunities presented by emerging technologies. The EU cybersecurity certification  framework is also an opportunity for the EU to broaden its influence far beyond its borders in a  highly competitive and lucrative market where European industry can play a leading role. With  this bolstered role, ENISA looks forward to supporting and enhancing the capability of the EU to  the benefit of the Member States.  7 Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (Grand Chamber) of 2 May 2006, United Kingdom of Great  Britain and Northern Ireland v European Parliament and Council of the European Union, Case C-217/04.",

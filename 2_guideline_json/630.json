This digitalisation provides opportunities and means to increase productivity and to modernise so  many aspects of our lives. However, at the same time, it brings new challenges for human rights  (privacy and data protection issues online), for human safety and security (cybercrime, cyberbullying,  cyberstalking) and for democracy (fear of hacked elections, fake news), to name a few.  It is obvious that even if we are facing significant challenges, there is no way back. The only  option is to continue to make the most of digitalisation and cyberspace opportunities — by  investing more in (cyber)security and in the protection of citizens and the information contained  in our infrastructure and networks.  Cybersecurity is an industry/market on its own that will continue to grow. The size of the  cybersecurity market in Europe 1 is estimated to increase with a 6 % compound annual growth  rate (CAGR) to EUR 24.4 billion in 2018, maintaining a share of over one quarter of the worldwide  cybersecurity market. In addition, if Europe does not use cybersecurity as an economic enabler the  opportunity costs between 2014 and 2020 are estimated at around EUR 640 billion.  The estimated worldwide economic impact of cyberattacks has now passed half a trillion USD2.  According to global surveys3, 15 % of businesses say they have faced a cyberattack in the past  year; businesses in the EU (19 %) and North America (18 %) have been most heavily targeted  according to the same source. Yet the measurement of the real impact of lack of proper  cybersecurity in terms of costs needed for full recovery is still challenging4. While some direct  costs associated with damaged assets and the investment needed to replace compromised  assets are easier to evaluate, the costs/impact of attacks on personal life, freedom, democracy  and intellectual property cannot be easily measured.  At the European level, there is an increased need for digital skills and cybersecurity skills in  particular. There is also a need for people who have experience of using modern information  security techniques within the work environment — this latter requirement is not an issue of  1 Cybersecurity as an Economic Enabler, ENISA, Published on April 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler 2 McAfee, Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime, report summary, 2014 3 Grant Thornton, Cyber-attacks cost global business $300bn+, available at:  http://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/cyber-attacks-cost-global-business-over-$300bn-a-year/ 4 ENISA, ‘The cost of incidents affecting CIIs’, August 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-cost-of-incidents-affecting-ciis/  education, but rather of experience. It is acknowledged currently that 44 % of European citizens  do not have basic digital skills5; Europe also lacks skilled ICT specialists to fill the growing number  of job vacancies in all sectors of the economy.  Standardisation and certification play an important role in securing modern systems and ENISA  continues to play an active role in both areas. In particular, ENISA has supported the European  Commission over the last year in its efforts to align current approaches to certification of security  products with the needs of today’s society and is looking forward to contributing further to this key area.  The cybersecurity talent shortage6 is estimated at more than a million openings worldwide while  competition for qualified cybersecurity professionals is driving up salaries and improving the  benefits offered. The problem is here and is likely to stay as the global shortage of cybersecurity  professionals is estimated by other sources to reach 2 million by 20197.  The EU needs to act and for that it needs a strong and agile cybersecurity agency  ENISA, the cybersecurity agency for the EU, should be in the position to support the EU and  Member States in addressing all the risks and challenges brought about by digitalisation. The  entire cyber ecosystem has changed. ENISA therefore welcomes the new proposed cybersecurity  strategy8 and the new proposed Cybersecurity Act9, which recognises this issue and proposes  a significant growth in the ENISA resources and budget in the next few years.  In the meantime, however, ENISA has the difficult task of coping with a significant increase in  demand for its services whilst operating within current budget and resource constraints. The  Agency has achieved this through prioritisation and cutting important tasks. This was not an  easy exercise. In order to achieve this, during the preparation of 2018 planning, the Agency  included a reduced list of activities, already prioritised with the support of the Management  Board. Those tasks which were not marked as being of high priority have been dropped from  the work programme in order to satisfy the priority requirements.  In this programming document the planned activities for 2018 to 2020 are presented alongside  the detailed work planning for 2018. The document follows the structure laid down by the new  Commission guidelines for programming documents provided in the context of the framework  financial regulation and the five pillars of ENISA strategy.  Finally, I welcome the new proposed ENISA regulation, the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA welcomes  the proposal for a strengthened ENISA with additional resources and staff.

As set out in 2013 in its renewed mandate, ENISA has  been set up ‘for the purpose of contributing to a high  level of Network and Information Security within the  Union […] thus contributing to the establishment  and proper functioning of the internal market’10,  contributing to growth and employment in Europe.  The mission of ENISA is to contribute to securing  Europe’s information society by raising ‘awareness  of network and information security and to  develop and promote a culture, of network and  information security in society for the benefit of  citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector  organisations in the Union’11.  10 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and  the Council of 21 May 2013, Article 1(1). 11 Article 1(1) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  In doing so, ENISA will act ‘without prejudice to the  competences of the Member States’ regarding their  national security12 and in compliance with the right  of initiative of the European Commission. In order to  achieve its mission, several objectives and tasks13 have  been attributed to ENISA, ‘without prejudice to the  competences of the Member States regarding network  and information security and in any case to activities  concerning public security, defence, national security’14.  In line with these objectives and tasks, the Agency  carries out its operations in accordance with  an annual and multiannual work programme,  containing all of its planned activities, drawn up  by the Executive Director of ENISA and adopted by  ENISA’s Management Board (MB).  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based  on the involvement of all relevant stakeholder  communities, with a strong emphasis on pragmatic  solutions that offer a sensible mix of short-term and  long-term improvements. The Agency also provides the  Union institutions, bodies and agencies (hereinafter:  ‘Union institutions’) and the Member States with  a mechanism allowing them to call upon its services to  support their network and information security (NIS)  capability development15, resulting in a more agile and  flexible approach to achieving its mission.  12 Article 1(2) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 13 Articles 2 and 3 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 14 Article 1(2) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 15 Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  MISSION STATEMENT  1  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 131212  ENISA strategy and the strategic  objectives  The strategic objectives of ENISA, set out in  ENISA’s strategy for 2016–2020 released in January  2016, are as follows:  #Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in  facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the  evolution of the digital environment.  #Policy. Promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the  European Union institutions and Member States in  developing and implementing EU policies and law  related to NIS.  #Capacity. Support Europe maintaining state- of-the-art network and information security  capacities, by assisting the Member States and  European bodies in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community. Foster the emerging European  network and information security community, by  reinforcing cooperation at EU level among Member  States, European Union bodies and relevant NIS  stakeholders, including the private sector.  #Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging  more efficiently with its stakeholders, including  Member States and Union institutions, as well as at  international level.  PRINCIPLES  In implementing its strategy, ENISA’s action will be  guided by the following principles:  Affirming itself as main point of reference of  the EU on NIS issues with a view to promoting  a coherent EU approach to NIS;  Adding value through complementarity with  Member State authorities and NIS experts,  primarily competent on cybersecurity matters  with whom it will reinforce its ties via the  development of sustainable cooperation in its  various domain of competence;  Liaising closely with competent EU  institutions, agencies, and bodies dealing with  other aspects of NIS (Europol, European Defence  Agency, European External Action Service, sectoral  agencies, etc.);  Achieving results by leveraging relevant  stakeholder communities, allowing ENISA  to strengthen its knowledge of national NIS  developments and facilitate the involvement of  NIS experts in its activities, including national NIS  competent authorities, the  private sector and  academia;  Supporting public and private cooperation,  with a view to reducing the fragmentation of the  DSM and supporting the development of the  digital security industry in Europe.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 15  THREAT LANDSCAPE  In a constantly evolving digital environment, threats  to the network and information systems in Europe  are growing rapidly. While all economic and societal  activities today rely upon information systems  and communication networks, the development  of European digital society can only be sustainably  achieved with the establishment of proper network  and information security (NIS) practices, policies,  organisations and capacities.  The ENISA threat landscape (ETL)16 for 2016 shows  that cyberthreats have undergone significant  evolution in terms of sophistication and impact, such  as extortion/ransom activities and user information  stealing. Data breaches have shown enormous  growth with hundreds of millions of items of user  data flooding the internet and being covered by  the front pages of the media on an almost weekly  or monthly basis. Security incidents involving the  internet of things (IoT) and large volume DDoS attacks  complement the threat landscape.  16 ENISA threat landscape report 2016, available at: https://www. enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016  Cyberthreat agents have performed a variety of  malicious acts greatly increasing the estimates  of cybercrime monetisation as illustrated by the  following cases:  Cybercrime capitalisation in 2016 almost reached  the level of the second most valuable US company.  Ransomware families are 175 % up and the  average ransom is 100 % up (USD 600-700).  Data breaches are 20 % up on last year.  The first 1Tbps DDoS attack has happened. It  has shown the impact DDoS-attacks may have  (internet service latencies).  Cyberspace is a recognised battlefield. This  creates a new centre of gravity for the whole  cybersecurity community.  In 2016 we have seen the impact and scale of  striking power of taking over IoT objects.  In 2016 the race between attackers and defenders  continues to suggest that cyberthreat agents are  always a step ahead of the defenders. Still, there are  some changes in the current state-of-play:  Defenders have expanded their knowledge  on modus operandi by using/implementing  cyberthreat intelligence and applying it to their  business products and processes in order to  enhance their proactive protection strategies.  Defenders have implemented deanonymisation  methods to identify adversaries hiding behind the  dark net.  PART I GENERAL CONTEXTI  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 1716  PART I. General context  Defenders have understood that defence is only  one side of the coin and are slowly beginning to  explore active/offensive defence capabilities.  Attackers have leveraged vast publicly available  intelligence, such as published malware source  code, to evolve their methods.  Attackers put quite a lot of effort into investing  and supporting their infrastructure as well as  marketing their products and services to maintain  their lucrative business.  In 2017 the frequency and impact of serious  incidents has been growing. Two major cybersecurity  incidents with EU-wide impact (WannaCry, NotPetya)  have drawn everyone’s attention to the reality of  cyberthreats and their possible critical impacts.  The cooperation between law enforcement agencies  and private sector organisations was an important  factor in identifying malicious activities and  infrastructure takedowns and it is likely that such  cooperation activities, between communities as well  as between Member States, will play an increasingly  important role both in the fight against cybercrime  and in the attempt to reinforce EU systems against  potential attacks.  In conclusion, on top of an active cybercrime scene,  the ETL has indicated that high-profile (state- sponsored) attackers have taken further action with  their involvement in highly sophisticated and stealthy  cyberattacks, cyberespionage, cybersabotage acts  and multi-layer attacks that have been considered to  possibly influence political developments.  POLICY INITIATIVES  Since it was set up with the name European Network  and Information Security Agency in 2004, ENISA  has actively contributed to the raising of awareness  of NIS challenges in Europe, to the development  of Member States’ NIS capacities and to the  reinforcement of the cooperation of Member States  and other NIS stakeholders.  Since NIS has featured high on the EU political agenda  — notably in the European cybersecurity strategy  (2013), the European cyberdefence policy framework  (2014) and the European digital single market (DSM)  (2015) — ENISA will in the future, more than ever,  need to accompany the efforts of Member States and  Union institutions to reinforce NIS across Europe.  Above all, the recent adoption of the directive of the  European Parliament and the Council concerning  measures to ensure a high common level of network  and information security calls for an enhanced  commitment of ENISA to supporting a coherent  approach towards NIS across Europe.  While ENISA should continue its well-established  activities — from support for the reinforcement of  Member States’ national capacities to the organisation  of cyber crisis exercises — the adoption of the NIS  directive will require the development of further areas  of action in order to accompany the evolution of NIS  in Europe. ENISA will, in particular, play a key role  in: steering NIS operational cooperation by actively  supporting Member States’ CSIRTs’ cooperation  within the future European CSIRTs Network between  the Member States and the institutions. ENISA will  provide thereby input and expertise to policy-level  collaboration between national competent authorities  in the framework of the Cooperation Group,  supporting the reinforcement of the NIS of Union  institutions close cooperation with CERT-EU and with  the institutions themselves. In parallel, ENISA will  continue to contribute to the reinforcement of NIS as  a driver of the DSM and more generally of economic  growth in Europe, including the development of NIS  and related ICT industries in Europe.  While many Union bodies are developing activities  related to cybersecurity(Europol, European Defence  Agency, European External Action Service, etc.), ENISA  aims to be the key point of reference for strategic  analysis and advice on NIS issues .The Agency seeks  to engage with other relevant actors and to use its  experience and expertise to support them in their  activities. Furthermore, ENISA will support other  stakeholders, in particular the private sector, to engage  in Europe’s efforts to ensure a significant improvement  of the state of its cyber security.  In this respect, the publication of the new EU  cybersecurity strategy, on 13 September 2017, has  identified ENISA as a key pillar of the EU’s ambition  to reinforce cybersecurity across Europe. The  strategy in particular foresees the strengthening and  reinforcing ENISA:  Section 2.1 addresses ENISA and the  strengthening of the Agency. A permanent  mandate for it is proposed.  ENISA’s role in the NIS directive is acknowledged.  An EU cybersecurity certification framework is  proposed. It is proposed that ENISA develop  certification schemes and provide secretariat  assistance to the EU cybersecurity certification  group. Frameworks are envisaged for:  • critical high-risk applications;  •  widely deployed digital products and services; and  • low-cost digital devices.  ENISA welcomes the renewed cybersecurity strategy17  and the new proposed Cybersecurity Act18.  17 European Commission, Joint communication to the European  Parliament and the Council Resilience, ‘Deterrence and  defence: building strong cybersecurity for the EU’, JOIN(2017)  450, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN 18 European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of  the European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the  ‘EU Cybersecurity Agency’, and repealing Regulation (EU)  526/2013, and on information and communication technology  cybersecurity certification (‘Cybersecurity Act’), COM(2017)  477, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN  2.1 MULTIANNUAL PROGRAMME  This section reflects mid-term priorities that should  guide the activities of the Agency for the next 3 years.

SUMMARISING THE KEY INDICATORS FOR  THE MULTIANNUAL ACTIVITIES  The Agency has developed key indicators to provide  the metrics to measure the performance, results and  impact of the Agency’s outcomes, outputs and impact.  A detailed presentation of key performance indicators  (KPIs), key results indicators (KRIs) and key impact  indicators (KIIs) is provided in Annex B.  2.3 HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCE  OUTLOOK FOR THE YEARS 2018-2020  Annex 1 provides an outlook for resources and  contains a brief description of new tasks and  efficiency gains.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 2928  The ENISA work programme for the year 2018 follows  the structure presented in the multiannual programming  in Part 2. In this section, clear objectives, results and  indicators are identified for each activity.  The activities presented in this section follow the  structure of the ENISA strategy document. After  a short description of the activity, the objectives are  presented. A short narrative is included, consisting  of a description and the added value of the activity,  the main challenges for 2018 and a link to the  multiannual objectives.  The main outputs/actions in the specific year, for this  case for 2018, are listed within each objective. Several  outputs are defined for each objective.  For each output, the following are included in this  document:  A description of the specific actions and  outcome which are expected to contribute to the  achievement of the objective,  The type of output (in a summary table at the end  of each activity):  • P: publication i.e. report, study, paper;  • E: event i.e. conference, workshop, seminar;  •  S: support activity, involving assistance to or  close collaboration with e.g. EU institutions or  bodies or Member States as appropriate, with  reference to a specific activity that features  defined and shared objectives.  Key performance indicators tailored for the type  of output (in summary table at the end of each  activity).  Resources and budget, in a summary table at  the end of the section in aggregated form at  activity level.  For each activity there is an objective defined that  covers the actions that the Agency is carrying out in  response to requests. Article 14 requests, named  after Article 14 of the ENISA regulation, allow the  Member State and the EU institutions to make direct  requests to ENISA seeking assistance or advice on  specific activities.  3.1 ACTIVITY 1 — EXPERTISE.  ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT EUROPE  IN FACING EMERGING NETWORK AND  INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES  3.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the  expertise related to network and  information security  Output O.1.1.1 — Good practices for security  of the internet of things (Priority 1)  IoT is at the core of operations for many essential  service operators as defined in the NIS directive,  especially considering recent initiatives concerning  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR THE YEAR 2018III  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3130  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  Smart Infrastructures, Industry 4.019, 5G20, Smart  Grids21, etc. IoT security should thus be considered in  this context22.  The Agency will identify and analyse existing security  practices and standards in the area of IoT security for  CII and Smart Infrastructure taking into consideration  existing national expertise and practices. ENISA will  compare these practices and standards and develop  good practices for security of IoT, with a particular  focus on the impact on end-users.  In this endeavour the Agency will take into account  and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives (the NIS directive, the ‘Internet of things —  An action plan for Europe’, the Alliance for the Internet  of Things (AIOTI)23 and the 5G Infrastructure Public– Private Partnership (5G PPP)24).  The Agency will develop targeted IoT case studies  to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by defining  appropriate attack scenarios, and providing relevant  recommendations and good practices. Moreover,  it will define IoT security requirements to ensure  ‘security for safety’.  The Agency will also validate the results of the study  (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national  and EU initiatives (e.g. AIOTI) and interact with all  important IoT stakeholders from the public sector,  such as DG Communications Networks, Content and  Technology and  the Joint Research Centre, and from  the private sector, including CII providers, integrators  and manufacturers.  This work item builds on the previous work of ENISA  in the area of IoT, Intelligent Cars, Smart Cities,  Smart Hospitals and Smart Airports (2015–2016  work programme).  19 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth- industrial-revolution 20 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/towards-5g 21 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and- consumers/smart-grids-and-meters 22 Nevertheless, non-critical operators, who might also be  involved in IoT activities, face no regulation and may have  little incentive to invest in securing their systems. Considering  the particularities of IoT, security should be seen as a primary  concern even for the latter operators. 23 More information on the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation (AIOTI) is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital- single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti 24 More information on the 5G Infrastructure Pubic–Private  Partnership (5G PPP) is available at: https://5g-ppp.eu/  3.1.2 Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape  and analysis  Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA threat landscape  (Priority 1)  This report will provide an overview of current  threats and their consequences for emerging  technology areas. It contains tactical and strategic  information about cyberthreats and also refers to  threat agents and attack vectors used. The report  is based on an intensive information collection  exercise, including annual incident reports, followed  by analysis and consolidation of publicly available  information on cyberthreats. It contains cyberthreat  intelligence by means of interrelated threat related  information objects.  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) provides  information regarding reduction of threat exposure.  This information will consist of available controls  that are appropriate in order to reduce the exposure  and consequently mitigate the resulting risks. In  addition to the report, ENISA will make available  to the public all relevant material that has been  collected during the year.  The visualisation and quick availability of threat  information will be in the focus in 2018. The ENISA  threat landscape will be accompanied by an end-user  application (web-based) that will provide available  information online. In this manner, ETL users will be  in a position to access ENISA threat information on  a permanent basis. In 2018 this platform will be used  for integration of additional relevant information.  In 2018 ENISA will continue its cooperation with  CERT-EU in the area of threat landscaping. This  will  be carried out by means of information exchanges,  use of CERT-EU services and organisation of common  meetings/events. In carrying out this work, synergies  with related experts (i.e. ENISA ETL Stakeholder  Group) and vendors (through memorandums of  understanding) will be maintained and expanded.  Output O.1.2.2 — Restricted and Public Info notes  on NIS (Priority 1)  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and  developments through Info Notes. As from 2018, the  Agency will produce two distinct types of note; ‘CSIRT  Info Notes’ and ‘General Info Notes’.  CSIRT Info Notes  CSIRT Info Notes cover incidents with an EU dimension  that are within the scope of the activities of the CSIRTs  Network. Such notes will only be published following  the agreement of the CSIRTs Network.  General Info Notes  General Info notes cover significant developments  and announcements in the field of cybersecurity.  General Info notes are not associated with the  response to incidents but are rather explanatory  notes, regarding — for example — events that have  a certain level of public and media attention. For  General Info notes, ENISA will consult the CSIRTs  Network as appropriate.  Both types of note will be logically integrated with  the cyberthreat information, building a single  interconnected knowledge base.  ENISA provides balanced and neutral information  regarding such events, covering issues, points of  action, mitigation measures, summaries, related  practices, etc. Hence the objective of this work is  to provide a neutral overview of the state of play  regarding an incident in a near-time manner.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing Info  Notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  ENISA will further assess the dissemination efficiency  of the procured cyberthreat information, in the form  of both ETL and Info Notes, by assessing their impact  among key stakeholder. This will be done by using  appropriate tools for analytics on user access and user  enrolment. In addition to the ENISA website, Info Notes  will be disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform in 2018.  Output O.1.2.3 — Support incident reporting  activities in the EU (Priority 1)  As incident reporting obligations become more  complex, one of the objectives of the activities  developed by ENISA in this sector is developing  efficient reporting schemes across sectors and across  geographical borders, thereby making sure they remain  simple, pragmatic and relevant for both the public and  private sector without increasing the cost of operation.  Current and foreseen activities in this area include:  Incident notification in the telecom sector (Article 13a  of the telecom package); currently ENISA supports  activities in this area by managing the informal  Article 13a Expert Group, keeping in touch with  industry and collecting incidents for the annual  incident report. Further support is needed as the  telecom package is currently under review and  significant improvements will be made to Article 13a.  Incident notification for the trust service providers  (Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation): in 2018 ENISA  will continue receiving the annual incident reports  from the competent authorities and will analyse  them and produce a consolidated, anonymised  incident analysis report. In addition, the Agency  will continue engaging with the competent  authorities towards a harmonised implementation  of this article and also engage with private  stakeholders to better understand the needs and  challenges of the sector.  Incident notification in the context of the NIS  directive: as the NIS directive entered into  force in August 2016, with a 2-year timeline  for implementation, all stakeholders involved  must prepare themselves for this step; further  guidelines and support are needed from ENISA  to facilitate a smooth transition towards the new  provisions. More specifically ENISA can assist  stakeholders in developing incident reporting  frameworks and procedures and agree on the  parameters and thresholds upon which an  incident is considered significant as well as the ex  post analysis of the reported data.  Any legal requirements in relation to reporting  stipulated in the draft regulation on ePrivacy.  ENISA has significant expertise in incident  reporting at the EU level through the work  carried out with Member States and telecoms  providers on the transposition of Article 13a of the  telecommunications framework directive of 2009.  The Agency also contributed to the interpretation of  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation and now helps trust  service providers in implementing this article.  As incident reporting  obligations become  more complex, one of  the objectives of the  activities developed  by ENISA in this  sector is developing  efficient reporting  schemes across  sectors and across  geographical borders.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3332  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  3.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and  development, innovation  Output O.1.3.1 — Guidelines for European  standardisation in the field of ICT security  (Priority 1)  Building on its own policy work, existing standards  and the requirements of the Member States, this  activity will seek to make available a gap analysis  and/or provide guidance to implement existing  NIS standards. Additionally ENISA manages the  relationship it has developed with the EU SDOs  (CEN/CENELEC and ETSI) by contributing to their  standardisation work at the strategic and tactical  levels (e.g. by joining the CEN/CENELEC Cybersecurity  Focus Group (CSCG), observing relevant technical  and conference programme committees, etc.). New  requirements associated with the transposition  or implementation of the legal framework in the  Member States will be taken into account, including  the NIS directive, the Commission’s communication  on cPPP, automated processes and systems, etc.  This output will seek to analyse the gaps and provide  guidelines for, in particular, the development or  repositioning of standards, facilitating the adoption  of standards and governance of EU standardisation  in the area of NIS. ENISA brings to this relationship  its technical and organisation know-how in NIS which  can be further leveraged into standards in terms of  extending or assessing them to render them more  appropriate to stakeholders and more compliant with  the prevailing regulatory framework. By bringing its  concrete NIS policy expertise, ENISA will produce ‘how  to’ and ‘what else’ guides in an effort to contribute to  European standardisation.  In carrying out this work, ENISA will consult with  the Member States, industry and organisations that  develop standards (e.g. ETSI, CEN, CENELEC), as well  as Commission services and agencies with policy  competence in these areas as appropriate.  Output O.1.3.2 — Priorities for EU research and  development (Priority 1)  This study will provide an analysis of areas covered  by the NIS directive, the general data protection  regulation and the Commission decision on cPPP and  will aim to show where R & D activities funded in the  context of Horizon 2020, CEF (Connecting Europe  Facility), TRANSITS and GEANT could achieve the  greatest impact.  ENISA will work closely with ECSO and cPPP on  cybersecurity in order to align the work being carried  by them with the ENISA work programme. In addition,  the Agency will offer support to the National Public  Authority Representatives Committee (NAPARC) by  offering a secretariat function.  ENISA will look into adapting the current best  practices and guidelines for protecting EU systems  and networks according to the evolving threats.  Additionally, ENISA will continue supporting  and advising the Commission and designated  organisations in this area (e.g. ECSO) as well as in  the Member States on how to meet their goals by  bringing in its concrete NIS policy expertise.  3.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response to Article  14 requests under expertise activity  Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests under  expertise activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and  EU institutions alike to make direct requests to  ENISA when seeking assistance or advice on specific  activities or policy issues. Under this objective, the  Agency will address all the requests related to its area  of expertise.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.

ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3534  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  3.2 ACTIVITY 2 — POLICY. PROMOTE  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  AS AN EU POLICY PRIORITY  3.2.1 Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy  development  Output O.2.1.1 — Support the policy discussions in  the area of certification of products and services  (Priority 1)25, 26  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy  developments, such as the adoption of the NIS  directive and the publication of the Commission  communication ‘Strengthening Europe’s cyber  resilience system and fostering a competitive and  innovative cybersecurity industry’, the Agency will  continue to support the Commission and the Member  States (taking account of the ‘cybersecurity Council  conclusions’) in identifying a certification framework  for ICT security products and services by promoting  mutual recognition or harmonisation of certification  practices up to a certain level. Any planned activity in  the area of IT security certification will respect existing  national efforts and interests.  ENISA will join ongoing initiatives and will seek to  stimulate standardisation initiatives with SDOs (ETSI,  IEC, etc.), ICT certification stakeholders (test labs,  certification and accreditation bodies, SOG-IS, CCRA,  etc.) as well as ICT security product users (ESMIG,  Eurosmart, etc.) as a means to enhance the dialogue  around security certification and build upon existing  results these initiatives have developed in the past.  Policy areas to be considered include but are not limited  to mapping existing European certification schemes,  recommendations on next steps to take at EU level,  analysis of impact of certification for manufacturers and  end-users etc. ENISA will carry out support activities in  the area of certification and if needed it will organise its  own workshops bringing together key stakeholders.  Output O.2.1.2 — Towards a framework for policy  development in cybersecurity (Priority 1)  The digitalisation of several critical and noncritical  sectors and the emergence of new technologies  such as IoT require a coherent policy framework on  NIS. This is likely to allow the integration of existing  policies (e.g. NISD, DSM, etc.) and the addition of new  ones (e.g. IoT policy, cPPP, etc.) within a common and  integrated framework.  25 Article 13a of the amended Framework  Directive 2002/21/EC (2002). 26 Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation (2014).  ENISA will take stock of existing policy initiatives  and assess the needs for new and emerging areas.  In cooperation with Member States and the private  sector the Agency will develop the key elements of  such a framework and seek validation of the idea  from all relevant stakeholders.  3.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy  implementation  Output O.2.2.1 — Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS regulation (Priority 1)  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public and  private bodies in implementing the eIDAS regulation by  addressing technological aspects and building blocks  for trust services. Aspects to be covered will be agreed  with the Commission and the Member States through  the eIDAS experts’ group. Specific implementation  guidelines and technical recommendations for  approval of which the eIDAS expert group will be  consulted will address operational aspects of trust  service providers, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. These recommendations  will complement the existing knowledge base that  ENISA has created for the trust service providers.  At the same time, ENISA will take utmost account of  recommendations and standards being developed by  CEN/ETSI/ISO and seek to avoid both duplication of  work and potentially opposing approaches.  Output O.2.2.2 — Supporting the implementation  of the NIS directive (priority 1)  The Agency will leverage its expertise and good  practices, among others, on critical information  infrastructures, national cybersecurity strategies,  CSIRTs, baseline security requirements in  numerous sectors (energy, transport, finance,  etc.), standardisation, ICT certification and others  to contribute to the work of the Cooperation  Group. That will be done by reusing or customising  existing results or by developing new, specific  results meeting the needs and requirements of the  Cooperation Group.  The Agency may analyse specific issues identified  in the work programme of the Cooperation Group,  consult with Member States’ competent authorities  and develop recommendations and suggestions that  would allow the Commission and Member States to  take informed decision on NIS matters.  In addition, ENISA will continue its efforts to support  Member States in the identification of OES. Through  stock taking and analysis ENISA will identify common  approaches, schemes and good practices. The Agency  will validate them with relevant public and private  sector entities to make sure they meet the needs  and requirements of both the public and private  sector. Such good practices may be used, as much as  possible, by Member States when defining, at national  level, their criteria for the identification of OES.  Output O.2.2.3 — Baseline security  recommendations for the OES sectors and DSPs  (Priority 1)  ENISA will develop guidelines for assisting Member  States to assess the compliance of DSPs and OES with  security requirements set by the NISD.  ENISA, building on its expertise in security  requirements developed for DSPs and OES, will work  closely with Member States and the private sector  to identify such cost-effective practices and maturity  security frameworks that would constitute the basis  for these guidelines.  In deriving such a set of common mechanisms, no  account will be taken of sector-specific needs as  these are likely to introduce conflicting priorities (for  example, the relative importance of availability and  integrity is likely to be different in the energy sector to  the banking sector, where different risks prevail).  However, the Agency will take note of such specific  requirements as and when they are identified during  the analysis phase and will then map them to the  needs and requirements of DSPs and OES.  The Agency will also compare and validate the results  with other relevant approaches in the area of OES (e.g.  C2M2, NICE-CMM) or the generic IT models (e.g. ISO  27001) and interact with all important stakeholders  from the public as well as the private sector.  The proper validation of the proposed self- assessment practices would pave the way for  widespread, de facto tacit adoption of them and thus  set the basis for sufficient convergence across the  Member States.  Output O.2.2.4 — Supporting the payment services  directive (PSD) implementation (Priority 1)  Payment Service Directive (PSD) 2 was adopted and  will be transposed by Member States by January 2018  at the latest. The European Banking Authority (EBA),  as the responsible Agency, in cooperation with ENISA  and the relevant competent authorities of the Member  States, develops guidelines for operational and security  risk management for payment service providers  (PSPs). These guidelines define the framework with  the appropriate mitigation measures and control  mechanisms to manage the operational and security  risks relating to the payment services they provide.  ENISA, drawing on its expertise in the field of risk  management, minimun security measures, resilience,  secure authentication mechanisms and others,  will contribute to this work, making sure there is  enough consistency between this and other related  frameworks, such as NIS directive.  In this context the Agency will continue its  cooperation with the EBA and the European  Central Bank (ECB) and Member States’ competent  authorities on other cybersecurity-related topics  including mandatory incident reporting, use of  cloud computing, mobile payments and the use of  blockchain by the finance sector. ENISA will also,  through this cooperation with these stakeholders,  align, as much as possible this work with the NISD  implementation because finance is one of the key  sector of this directive.  Output O.2.2.5 — Contribute to EU policy in the  area of privacy and data protection (Priority 2)  ENISA will continue promoting trust and security in  digital services in the DSM by means of technical  recommendations on the implementation of EU  legislation addressing privacy and personal data  protection. In particular, technical implementation of  the GDPR and ePrivacy directive will be addressed.  ENISA will support the implementation of the  regulatory aspects by acting as policy, technical and  organisational adviser of the Commission in the area  of security of personal data and confidentiality of  communications while seeking to elaborate privacy  certification schemes and data protection seals.  Moreover, ENISA will provide recommendations on  shaping technology according to GDPR provisions,  such as for example data security, data minimisation,  anonymisation and pseudonymisation. The Annual  Privacy Forum (APF) will be used as an instrument  to bring together key communities in the broader  area of privacy and data protection and identify best  practises and future challenges both at regulatory  and technological levels. Cooperation activities with  the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  national data protection authorities will be continued  and further enhanced.  Output O.2.2.6 — NIS directive transposition  (Priority 1)  According to Article 25(1) of the NIS directive, the  Member States shall adopt and publish, by 9 May  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3736  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  2018, the laws, regulations and administrative  provisions necessary to comply with this directive. In  order to support the Member States over this task,  ENISA will take stock of the NISD implementation  status together with other relevant stakeholders  (e.g. sectorial NIS regulations). Then the collected  data will be organised according to specific maturity  criteria (e.g. C2M2), in order for ENISA to identify  lessons learnt and recommend good practices to  the Member States, Cooperation Group and the  Commission concerning the transposition process.  This will further strengthen the cooperation  amongst Member States and at EU level, during  the period of transposition, and will provide them  with the appropriate knowledge for the successful  completion of the task.  3.2.3 Objective 2.3. Response to  Article 14 requests under policy activity  Output O.2.3.1 — Response to requests under  policy activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and  EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA  seeking assistance or advice on specific activities.  Under this objective, the Agency will address all the  requests related to the area of policy development  and policy implementation.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.  3.2.4 Type of outputs and  performance indicators for each  outputs of Activity 2 — Policy  3.3 ACTIVITY 3 — CAPACITY.

ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3938  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  Output O.3.1.1 — Update and provide technical  training for Member State and EU bodies (Priority 1)  In 2018 most of the activities in this area aim at  maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and training for CSIRT and other  operational personnel. The Agency will support the  development of Member States’ national incident  response preparedness by providing good practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building  with a focus on CSIRT training and services in order  to improve the skills of CSIRT teams and their  personnel. ENISA will further build upon successful  work in the area of ‘training methodologies and  impact assessment’.  In detail, the Agency will provide an update of the  training material, which is in high demand, and  provide a new set of materials based on emerging  technologies in order to reinforce Member State  CSIRT skills and capacities to efficiently manage  cybersecurity events. A special emphasis in this  output is laid on supporting Member State CISRTs and  EU bodies with concrete advice (like good practice  material) and concrete action (like CSIRT training).  ENISA will also offer, upon request, direct support  to individual Member States by providing technical  training and advisories.  In 2018 ENISA will further enhance its methodology,  seminars and training on: (a) cyber crisis  management and (b) the organisation and  management of exercises. This activity will include  the development of material and infrastructure  for onsite and online training on these subjects. In  addition, this activity will cover the delivery of these  training programmes upon request.  Output O.3.1.2 — Support EU Member States  in the development and assessment of NCSS  (Priority 1)  The NIS directive sets as priority for the Member  States to adopt a national NIS strategy and to monitor  its implementation. ENISA will continue assisting  Member States to develop their capabilities in the  area of national cybersecurity strategies (NCSS). The  Agency, building on previous years’ work in this area,  will assist Member States to deploy existing good  practices in the related areas and offer targeted and  focused assistance on specific NCSS objectives (e.g.  CIIP, creation of PPPs, etc.). A priority in this area  will be to ensure that NCSS adequately reflect the  priorities and requirements of the NIS directive.  ENISA will also act as a facilitator in this process by  bringing together Member States and the private  sector with varying degrees of experience to discuss  and exchange good practices, share lessons learnt  and identify challenges and possible solutions.  Through this interaction with Member States  ENISA will validate and update its existing NCSS  good practice guide and evaluation/assessment  framework for NCSS.  Finally, ENISA will continue updating ENISA’s map  of EU NCSS as well as enhancing this map with  information collected on the NIS objectives each  Member State targets. In that context, relevant  qualitative and quantitative metrics will be identified.  ENISA will further enhance the material provided in  the e-Learning tool launched in 2015.  Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU Member States in  their incident response development (Priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA will concentrate its efforts on  assisting Member States with their incident  response capabilities by providing a state-of-the-art  view of the CSIRT landscape and development in  Europe. In close cooperation with the NISD CSIRTs  Network, the Agency will support the development  of Member States’ national incident response  capabilities by providing recommendations on key  dimensions of NIS capability building with a focus  on the development and efficient functioning of  national and sectorial CSIRTs. ENISA will as well  offer, upon request, direct support to individual  Member States to assess and improve their incident  response capabilities.  The main objectives of this output in 2018 are to help  Member States and ENISA’s other incident response  stakeholders, such as the EU institutions, bodies  and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy their  incident response capabilities and services in order  to meet the ever-growing challenges in securing  their networks. Another objective of this output is to  further develop and apply ENISA recommendations  for the CSIRT baseline capabilities and maturity  framework. ENISA will continue supporting cross- border CSIRT community projects and tools  development, as well as the global dialogue about  common definitions and the maturity framework in  the incident response domain.  3.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support EU  institutions’ capacity building.  Output O.3.2.1 — Representation of ENISA on the  Steering Board of CERT-EU and representation  of the EU agencies using the CERT-EU service  (Priority 1)  In 2017, the operations of CERT-EU were put on  a formal legal basis by way of an arrangement among  a number of EU institutions. A Steering Board (SB)  has been created to supervise the activities of CERT- EU, and a number of EU bodies and institutions are  represented on it. A place for ENISA was also created  on the SB, to represent ENISA and the EU agencies  that use the services of CERT-EU.  CERT-EU was set up to provide CERT services to the  EU bodies and institutions. ENISA sits on the SB.  ENISA is appointed to the CERT-EU’s SB to represent  itself and a list of EU Agencies that may use their  services.  In this context ENISA will also liaise with the EU  agencies on operational issues related to CERT-EU’s  activities in order to ensure that the viewpoints of  the Agencies are adequately represented. ENISA will  also report in to the CERT-EU SB on the evolution of  Services required by the Agencies.  3.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist in improving  private sector capacity building and  general awareness  In close collaboration with Member States and  with the private sector, ENISA will help EU citizens  to gain essential cybersecurity knowledge and  skills to help protect their digital lives. Aspects like  cybersecurity culture, cyber hygiene liability and  insurance will be analysed.  In 2018 activities will include promoting the annual  European Cyber Security Month and working with  the Member States delivering projects like the Cyber  Security Challenges as well as national initiatives,  upon request from those Member States.  Output O.3.3.1 — Cyber Security Challenges  (Priority 1)  In order to promote capacity building and awareness  on NIS among the emerging young generation of  cybersecurity experts in Member States, ENISA  will continue to promote and advise the Member  States on running national cybersecurity challenge  competitions in 2018. The Agency will also continue  its European Cyber Security Challenge annual activity.  Its support to the national and European activities  will aim at schoolchildren, university students as well  as young talents and security practitioners from the  industry. The goal will be to increase the interest and  future opportunities in NIS for these communities by  promoting excellence in the form of competitions, as  well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest  from these stakeholders. In order to do so, ENISA  will try to attract a large number of participants from  different Member States for the final competition.  Output O.3.3.2 — European Cyber Security Month  deployment (Priority 1)  The metrics built into the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) have shown an increased number of  participants, and a better engagement level from year  to year. This is an achievement that was possible with  the support of an active community. In 2018, ENISA  intends to explore ways to make use of alternative  communication tools such as social media to reach  EU citizens. Previously proposed pillars remain:  support a multi-stakeholder governance approach;  encourage common public–private activities; and  assess the impact of activities, optimising and  adapting to new challenges as appropriate. Past work  on cybersecurity culture will be leveraged with a view  to testing guidelines in practice.  3.3.4 Objective 3.4. Response to Article  14 requests under capacity activity  Output O.3.4.1 — Response to requests under  capacity activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and EU  institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking  assistance or advice on specific activities. Under this  objective, the Agency will address all the requests  related to the area of capacity building.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.

FOSTER  THE EMERGING EUROPEAN NETWORK  AND INFORMATION SECURITY  COMMUNITY  3.4.1 Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis  cooperation  Output O.4.1.1 — Cyber Europe 2018 (Priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European  cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2018 (CE2018). This  exercise will closely follow up and build upon the  lessons learned and actions from previous exercises,  such as CE2016.  CE2018 will focus on testing capabilities and  procedures, namely large-scale incident management  cooperation procedures at EU and national levels. The  crisis escalation scenario will be realistic and focused  in order to capture better how incidents are managed  and cooperation happens in real life. The exercise will  include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs Network set  up under the NIS directive.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include  the strategic dimensions of the exercise and will be  prepared based on the lessons learned from CE2016,  to drive the whole planning process. The exercise brief  will be given for comments and approval to ENISA’s MB  after consultation with the Member State Cooperation  Group and the CSIRTs Network set up under the NIS  directive. Following this ENISA will assemble a group  of planners from the participating countries to work  closely towards developing a detailed exercise plan  (ExPlan) in 2017-2018. ENISA will involve the group of  planners in the relevant planning steps and take into  account their input. The exercise planning will avoid  overlaps with other major related activities.  ENISA will consult Member States and seek the  agreement of its MB after consultation with the  Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs Network on  a possible joint EU–NATO cyber exercise in the  coming year.  Finally, in 2018 ENISA will organise the EuroSOPEx  exercise for the EU public authorities’ points of  contact, as these will be represented in the CSIRTs  Network only to keep and even raise the momentum  of cooperation between them. As in previous years  the exercise will be planned with the support of  representatives from the organisations involved. The  exercise is expected again to have as high-level goals  to raise awareness of cooperation procedures, train  participants in using the cooperation infrastructure,  such as structures relating to communication and  information sharing, and ultimately contribute to  increased trust within the CSIRTs Network. Guidance  should be found within the CSIRTs Network on  planning the exercise. No private or other entities will  be involved in this exercise.  Output O.4.1.2 — Lessons learnt and advice  related to cyber crisis cooperation (Priority 1)  Since 2015 ENISA has provided the secretariat for  the Member States developing standard EU-level  operational and technical cooperation procedures.  The upcoming policy framework, the NIS directive,  is expected to strengthen this by making this  supporting role more formal as the secretariat for  the cooperation of the EU operational cybersecurity  network (CSIRTs Network).  In this context, ENISA will offer support for the  network, helping the further development of  EU-level cooperation with standard operation  procedures at both levels, including the point  of contact management. Alert exercises and  communication checks will also be organised based  on the defined procedures.  ENISA will also support the Commission and  Member States in the deployment of the EU cyber  crisis cooperation blueprint to enhance cross-border  cooperation related to preparedness for a large- scale cyber incident, as presented in the Commission  communication on strengthening Europe’s cyber  resilience system (COM(2016) 410). ENISA will  review and highlight the cyber crisis management  good practices. Already existing schemes will form  the basis of this work, in particular the work of the  European Cyber Crises Cooperation Framework  (ECCCF). In addition, the activities will be matched  with and possibly integrated into traditional crisis  cooperation such as the integrated political crisis  response (IPCR) arrangements.  Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for cyber  exercise planning and cyber crisis management  (Priority 1)  Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) development and  content management  ENISA has been developing the Cyber Exercise  Platform (CEP) since 2014. CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States  and EU institutions, such as exercise organisation  and management, an ‘exercise playground’ with  technical incidents, a map of exercises and hosting  of the exercise development community.

Work programme for the year 2018  ENISA will further  improve, develop and  secure the CSIRTs  Network infrastructure  for its members’  smooth collaboration  and administration  use (CSIRTs Network  portal and other  communication means).  activity, ENISA would like to maintain and enhance the  experience offered by CEP, including user support.  In addition, new content and exercise incident  challenges and material will be developed in order  to retain the interest of the stakeholders and make  CEP a central tool in cybersecurity exercising for  all stakeholders. The CEP platform opens new  opportunities for ENISA to enlarge the user base  and thus offer to the operational cybersecurity  communities opportunities to exercise and gain  experience and knowledge. One way to enlarge the  user base, and thus increase the impact of ENISA, is  to offer new and interesting functionalities that will  attract new CEP registrations.  EU-level cyber crisis and incident management  procedures and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)  Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)  In 2018 ENISA will have to start preparing to manage,  support and operate the centralised components  of the MeliCERTes platform, formerly known  as the CEF CSP Cybersecurity DSI Core Service  Platform. MeliCERTes is expected to be the key  cooperation mechanism for computer emergency  and response teams in the European Union and will  enhance the EU-wide capability for preparedness,  cooperation and information exchange for a better  coordination and response to cyberthreats and  crises. With the final responsibility for MeliCERTes,  and for its maintenance, ENISA is following closely  the development of the platform and is actively  supporting the Commission and the consortium in  the different activities which are being carried out.  By the end of 2018 ENISA will be expected to have  implemented some of the systems and functionalities  for the management, maintenance and further  development of the MeliCERTes platform, together  with the development of some of the related internal  and external operational processes.  Finally, following possible requests or support by  national authorities, EU bodies and organisations  on the organisation and planning of exercises,  ENISA may offer training on CEP and on cyber crisis  management (CCM).  3.4.2 Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building  Output O.4.2.1 — EU CSIRTs Network secretariat  and support for EU CSIRTs Network community  building (Priority 1)  ENISA will continue its support to the Commission  and Member States in the implementation of the  NIS directive, in particular in the area of CSIRTs. As  part of this activity, ENISA will continue its tasks as  the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively  support its functioning by suggesting ways to  improve cooperation and trust building among  CSIRTs. The Agency will also support this cooperation  by developing and providing guidance and good  practices in the area of operational community  efforts, such as on information exchange and secure  communication, on request of the members of  the CSIRTs Network. In particular, the Agency will  be proactive in stimulating discussions within the  network and will aim to provide content to support  discussions on policy and technical initiatives  according to the CSIRTs Network’s own work  programme (action plan 2017-2022).  In addition, ENISA will take an active role to support  CSIRTs in the CSIRTs Network in activities relevant to  the CEF work programme. ENISA will actively support  teams in deployment and use of the Common  Service Platform (CSP) of the Cybersecurity DSI to  be implemented during 2016-2019 under CEF work  programme2015, subject to the agreement of the  CSIRTs Network.  Trust is an important asset for CSIRT operations  and so ENISA will continue to improve the level  of trust in the network by providing trust-building  exercises and events in coordination with the CSIRTs  Network’s governance.  The Agency will further improve, develop and secure  the CSIRTs Network infrastructure for its members’  smooth collaboration and administration use (CSIRTs  Network portal and other communication means).  Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and  LEA (Priority 1)  In 2018 the key goal will be to build upon the progress  ENISA has made in supporting different operational  communities (e.g. CSIRTs, law enforcement, European  FI-ISAC) to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to  collaborate and support exchange of good practices  among different stakeholders in operational  communities in Europe. In detail, ENISA will continue  its effort to support the EU-wide objectives on the  fight against cybercrime by liaising with various  stakeholders at EU (e.g. Europol) as well as at Member  State level.  3.4.3 Objective 4.3. Response to Article  14 requests under community activity  Output O.4.3.1 — Response to requests under  community building activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and EU  institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking  assistance or advice on specific activities. Under this  objective, the Agency will address all the requests  related to the area of community building, exercises  and CSIRTs cooperation.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.

REINFORCE  ENISA’S IMPACT  3.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management  and compliance  Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the Agency. The Executive Director  has a personal assistant.  To support the Executive Director, an Executive  Director’s Office Unit (EDO) has been established.  The tasks covered by the EDO include: policy advice,  legal advice, MB Secretariat and coordination and  control of the work programme.  The policy and legal advice shall extend to all  aspects of the work of the Agency and includes  advice in relation to both its operational and  administration departments.  The EDO also supports the administration of the MB  meetings and the administrative correspondence  that takes place between meetings, including the  management of the MB portal.  The EDO supports the Executive Director in his  relations with the press.  In 2018 the EDO will continue to support the MB and  the Executive Board in their functions by providing  secretariat assistance.  In relation to the MB, following the applicable rules, one  ordinary meeting will be organised during 2018 and  informal meetings will be held as necessary. The MB  Portal will be supported for EB and MB. In relation to the  Executive Board, one formal meeting will be organised  per quarter and informal meetings when necessary.  The Stakeholder Relations and Administration  Department (SRAD) oversees a variety of  programmes, projects and services relating to the  overall management of the Agency, supporting  the Executive Director’s decisions in areas such  as personnel, finance, communications, press,  purchasing, technology, facilities management,  health, safety, security, protocol, liaison with local  authorities, etc.  The aim of the SRAD is to provide this assurance and  at the same time provide the best level of efficiency  and use of the resources that are made available  for the Agency. This also includes coordination with  the European Commission’s Internal Audit Service,  the European Court of Auditors, the European  Ombudsman, the European Anti-Fraud Office, DG  Human Resources and Security, DG Budget, DG  Communications Networks, Content and Technology,  etc. All internal policies related to transparency, anti- fraud policy, whistle-blowers protection, declarations  of interests, etc. are addressed within this activity.  SRAD strives to maintain and increase the efficiency  and effectiveness of the Agency, and provide  a continuous contribution to the ENISA strategy  both internally and externally, seeking the optimal  solutions for delivering on its mandate and providing  the required assurance over compliance.  The aim is to equip the Agency with adequate  and modern procedures and tools to minimise  the resources used across it, maximising the  intended delivery of the work programme and  statutory commitments.  Internal control  ENISA is in process of implemented a quality  management system (QMS) to support its regulatory  and strategic goals. It is following as indicative the  ISO 9001:2015 standards as they are designed  to help organisations ensure that they meet the  needs of customers and other stakeholders while  meeting statutory and regulatory requirements.  The methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check- Act (PDCA) cycle that has been duly documented in  a dedicated SOP and applied accordingly.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk  management, governance and internal control  processes of the Agency, in order to provide  independent and objective assurance to the Senior  Management, Executive Director and the MB.  IT  In 2015 ENISA set out to define its ICT strategy for the  years 2015-2018. The main thrust of this strategy is to  consolidate systems and applications on a maximum  of two platforms, maximise data sharing, make  applications available in a secure way on the most  widely used mobile devices and to progressively  move the Agency’s IT infrastructure to the Cloud.  Due to the size of the Agency and effective resources  management, the IT tasks will be outsourced as far as  possible to concentrate the available resources in the  operational area of the Agency.  By mid-2018 it is expected that all business applications  will be securely available on the most widely used mobile  Summary of outputs in Activity 4 — Community.

By this timeframe the platform consolidation  should be complete and mature, with adequate, flexible  and advance reporting and monitoring tools. It is  expected that the support technology in the Agency will  be consolidated in 2018, with modern, adequate and  flexible business applications.  Finance, accounting and procurement  The key objective here is to ensure the compliance  of the financial resources management with the  applicable rules, and in particular with sound  financial management, efficiency and economy  principles as set down in the financial regulation.  As the Agency resources are derived from the EU  budget, management is required to comply with a set  of regulations, rules and standards set out by the  competent EU institutions. The Finance, accounting  and procurement unit is responsible for high-quality  reporting (annual accounts) and contributions to the  audit and discharge procedures.  In 2018 the Agency expects to benefit from the  deployment of tools used to simplify and automate its  work including applications for budget management,  budget reporting and procurement planning and  e-Prior (EU Commission platform for the management  of the procurement lifecycle, from pre-award to  post-award of a contract), as well as the integration  of systems (staff missions, project management and  budget management).  The deployment of tools, coupled with outsourcing of  certain activities of low value, is expected to improve  the overall resources management and reporting  capacity of the Agency.  The aim is to contribute to the Agency’s annual  and multiannual programming from inception to  execution. The financial resources are allocated  according to the expressed needs of the  organisational units reflecting the priorities set by the  Agency’s management.  Key objectives for the year 2018 include high budget  commitment and payment rates, a low number of  budget transfers during the year, planned and justified  carry overs and reduced average payment delays.  Human resources  The ultimate goal of the human resources (HR) unit is  to attract, select, develop and retain highly qualified  staff, to put in place optimal organisational structures,  to promote a safe working environment and to create  a culture that reflects ENISA’s vision and values in  which staff can give their best towards achieving the  organisation’s objectives. By offering a broad array  of services (recruitment, performance management,  learning and development, career management,  working conditions, social rights, etc.) the objective  is to deliver a successful day-to-day management of  ENISA personnel and external staff (e.g. trainees) in  compliance with the Staff Regulations. This is why  more effort will be put into developing and deploying  tools and policies to streamline the efficiency of the  different HR processes.  Legal affairs, data protection and information  security coordination  Legal affairs  The Legal Affairs Unit will continue supporting the  legal aspects associated with the operation of the  Agency. This includes dealing with matters such as  contracts, procurement, employment-related issues,  data protection and corporate governance. The legal  affairs function also includes dealing with complaints  to the European Ombudsman and representing the  Agency before the Courts of the Union.  Data protection compliance tasks and data  protection office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO)  include the following:  Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations  pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC27 and  document this activity and the responses  received.  Monitor the implementation and application of  ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data.  Monitor the implementation and application of  Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the  requirements for data security, information of  data subjects and their requests for exercising  their rights under the Regulation, as well as  the requirements for prior checks or prior  consultation with EDPS.  Monitor the documentation, notification and  communication of personal data in the context of  ENISA’s operations.  Act as ENISA’s contact point for the EDPS on issues  related to the processing of personal data; cooperate  and consult with the EPDS whenever needed.  Information security coordination  The Information Security Officer (ISO) coordinates  the information security management system on  behalf of the Authorising Officer. In particular, the ISO  advises the ICT Unit on developing and implementing  information security policies, standards, guidelines  and baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality,  27 Regulation (EC) 45/2001 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of  individuals with regard to the processing of personal data  by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free  movement of such data, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/ LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:008:0001:0022:en:PDF .

Work programme for the year 2018  integrity and authentication of the information  systems of the Agency. The ISO is instrumental in  incident handling and incident response and security  event monitoring. It also leads the security training  for the Agency’s staff and provides security guidance  on all IT projects, including the evaluation and  recommendation of technical controls. In 2018 the  ISO will contribute to such goals as:  improving the security posture of ENISA by  planning penetration tests and vulnerability  assessments;  advising on security policies and updating existing  ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks;  improving the internal security training for ENISA  staff;  implementing new systems and tools that can  support improvements in IT security.  3.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement with  stakeholders and strong international  activities  Stakeholders communication and  dissemination activities  In 2018, ENISA will seek to improve its focus on key  activities and engage the higher possible number  of stakeholders including institutional and industry  representatives, academics, citizens etc.  Dissemination and outreach  The Agency will continue developing various tools and  channels including its website with a strong emphasis  on social media. Dissemination activities are the  responsibility of the stakeholders’ communication  team, which will seek the appropriate level of outreach  activities to take ENISA´s work to all interested parties  and to provide added value for Europe.  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount  for all stakeholders. It is of utmost importance  to have EU citizens from all backgrounds trust in  ENISA's work. The cybersecurity challenges are  increasing throughout the world and Europe is  no exception. With this objective, ENISA´s image  needs to be continuously reinforced. Outreach for  the Agency’s work is essential to create a strong  NIS culture among the various actors in Europe.  ENISA is well aware of this fact and will work with all  interested parties to reach the citizens that require  information about its work.  Activities are planned in several Member States to  engender cybersecurity awareness across Europe,  fulfilling ENISA´s mandate, mission and strategy up  until 2020.  Internal communications  Stakeholder communications cover both internal and  external groups. From an internal perspective the  team is responsible for supporting communication  activities that aim to keep all those working within the  Agency informed and to enable both management  and staff to fulfil their responsibilities effectively  and efficiently. A strong corporate culture improves  staff engagement and ultimately the implementation  of the work programme. An annual review of this  strategy is envisaged to ensure that it is kept up to  date and appropriate for the Agency.  Permanent Stakeholders Group  In 2018, ENISA will continue to reinforce the  contribution of the Permanent Stakeholders Group  (PSG) to the work programme.  The PSG is composed of ‘nominated members’ and  members appointed ‘ad persona’. The total number  of members is 33 and they come from EU and EFTA  countries. They constitute a multidisciplinary group  deriving from industry, academia and consumer  organisations and are selected upon the basis of their  own specific expertise and personal merits. Three  ‘nominated members’ represent national regulatory,  data protection and law enforcement authorities.  The PSG is established by the ENISA regulation ((EU)  No 526/2013). The MB, acting on a proposal by the  Executive Director, establishes a PSG for a term of  office of 2.5 years.  A new PSG was elected in 2017.Its role is to advise  the Executive Director on the development of  the Agency’s work programme, and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders on all  related issues.  National Liaison Officer network  ENISA kicked off various activities aiming at  strengthening cooperation with its National Liaison  Officers’ (NLO) network in 2017. NLOs are key actors  for the Agency’s daily work and they warrant the  interaction with select public sector entities in the  Member States while they provide assurance in terms  of outreach effective liaison with the Member States  and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  In 2018 ENISA will build upon these activities and  strengthen its cooperation with the NLO network, as  the first point of contact with the Member States, with  an emphasis on:  an NLO meeting to discuss possible  improvements in the collaboration with ENISA  and input to selected ENISA projects, aimed at  leveraging the NLO network for the dissemination  of ENISA’s work to the Member States and EFTA  countries;.  sending information to the members of the  NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming  ENISA project-related tenders, vacancy notices  and events organised by ENISA or to which it  contributes (for example as co-organiser, etc.);  maintaining and sharing with the NLO network  information on all relevant ENISA projects and  activities (e.g. the unit responsible for a particular  project, relevant tender results, etc.) while  maintaining and expanding  online resources  available as appropriate.  Additionally, guidelines provided by the MB on  missions, objectives and functioning of the NLO  network will guide the development of this important  tool for community building.  International relations  Under the Executive Director’s guidance and  initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level.  ENISA should participate in international  cybersecurity fora such as the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),  ICANN and the IGF in so far as these groups are  discussing items related to the Agency’s work  programme or strategy.  ENISA will develop contacts with important  cybersecurity bodies outside the EU when these  are likely to influence the EU cybersecurity  programme. The best example is NIST, the  National Institute of Standards and Technologies  in the US, which plays an important role in the  implementation of the US Executive Order and  can be seen as performing similar tasks to the  tasks that ENISA under takes for the NIS directive.  Starting in 2018 ENISA will follow standards  development and certification initiatives at the  international level, as some of the issues to be  solved in the EU have international scope (notably  common criteria certification).  ENISA will follow the development of relevant  subjects at the international level in order to align  EU activities with those of other global players.  An example here is provided by the work that the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is  doing with CSIRTs, which needs to be aligned and  will create added value and harmonisation for all.  ENISA staff will attend international conferences  on an ‘as needed’ basis. For instance, the Meridian  Conference is the main CIIP conference of the  year and the FIRST conference plays the same role  for CERTs.  The Executive Director should attend  international conferences in order to enhance  the Agency’s visibility.

A.1.1 OVERVIEW OF THE PAST AND  CURRENT SITUATION  The work programme for 2018 follows the COM  guidelines  C(2014) 9641 final from 16.12.2014 and  MB decisions. It is structured following the objectives  and the priorities of the Agency as described in the  new ENISA strategy.  Regarding ENISA’s budget, the variation between  the years 2015 and 2016 is neutral. The budget  remained with the same amount aligned with  COM communications.  In 2017, however, a slight increase in Title II was  adopted. In 2018, the budget of Title III will be optimised  in order to increase the budget in operations.  Regarding ENISA’s establishment plan, it is noted that  ENISA will lose one post in 2018. This will have a direct  impact on the capacity of the Agency to deliver and  will reduce outputs.  From 2015 until 2018, some reorganisations were  carried out in order to maximise the efficiency,  effectiveness and use of the posts attributed  to the Agency.  The human and financial resources in respect of  the past and current situation are presented in the  annexes to this report.  A.1.2 RESOURCE PROGRAMMING  FOR THE YEARS 2018–2020  The distribution of the budget and resources for 2018  for the activities A1 to A5 is presented in the charts  at the end of this section. The budget and resources  for each activity are presented in Annex A.1.3. The  budget and posts distribution is based on the activity- based budgeting (ABB) methodology of the Agency  detailed in Annex A.1.3.  Following the publication of the NIS directive the  Agency is reallocating budget and resources to the  new tasks/activities envisaged for the Agency in the  directive. Another area which will probably require  more budget/resources is the Cyber Security Public– Private partnership (cPPP). However, the impact on the  ENISA work programme has not yet been quantified.  This will be updated in future versions as will any other  relevant changes in ENISA's scope and tasks.  The Stakeholders Relations and Administration  Department has already optimised all its resources.  Improvements to achieve gains in effectiveness and  ANNEX 1 RESOURCE ALLOCATION PER  ACTIVITY 2018–2020  53  A  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 5554  ANNEX Resource allocation per activity 2018–2020  efficiency have been developed. ENISA performs  an internal check of relevance and optimisation  of workflows, procedures and rules, to seek  optimisation and efficiency. As an example the so- called ‘Paperless’, (electronic workflow IT tool) which  routes documents to staff involved in preparation,  review and approval of all kinds of documents and  transactions, represents a huge improvement and  cost savings in all processes of the Agency.  Moreover, the Stakeholders Relations and  Administration Department applies a strict policy  on the ratio between administrative support and  coordination staff and operational staff, according to  the methodology set by the European Commission  and the benchmarking exercise within the institutions  and EU agencies. In December 2016 only 19.04  % of staff occupied administrative support and  coordination functions, although the Commission  benchmark allows for a level of up to 25 %.  Job type 2016 2015  Total administrative support  and coordination 19.04 % 20.22 %  Administrative support 15.47 % 16.85 %  Coordination 3.57 % 3.37 %  Total operational 66.66 % 66.29 %  Top operational coordination 7.14 % 8.99 %  General operational 59.52 % 57.30 %  Total neutral 14.29 % 13.48 %  Finance and control 14.29 % 13.48 %  In addition, this version of the work programme takes  account of the prioritisation exercise carried out  during the consultation with the MB. Certain activities  had to be removed from the work programme as  there are not enough resources for the year 2018.  Such de-prioritising activities include:  activities to support a DSM for high-quality NIS  products and services;  support for the assessment of existing policies/ procedures/practices on NIS within EU  institutions;  planning and organisation of EuroSOPEx 2018.  For the years 2019-2020, the Agency will gradually  increase the share of Activity 2, Policy, if more  resources become available.  A.1.3 OVERVIEW OF ACTIVITIES’ BUDGET  AND RESOURCES  The budget and posts distribution is based on the  ABB methodology of the Agency, which is line with  the activity-based management (ABM) principle.  ABB focuses on integrated budgeting and financial  management, based on activities linked to the  Agency’s priorities and objectives.  To enable better estimation of resources needed for  each ENISA activity, the budget forecast should be  split into direct and indirect budget. The following  assumptions are used in the simplified ABB  methodology:  Direct budget is the cost estimate of each  operational activity (listed in Activities A1 to A5) in  terms of goods and services procured.  Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries,  mission costs and overhead costs, attributable  to each operational or compliance activity. The  indirect budget is redistributed against direct  budget in all activities.  Compliance posts from Activity A5 Enabling are  redistributed to Core Activities — A1 to A4, and  operational posts of the Activity A5.  Total ABB posts (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts  from all activities (A1 to A5) after the redistribution.  The table below presents the allocation of financial  and human resources to activities of the Agency  based on the abovementioned ABB methodology.

The non-automatic carry- over added to the committed appropriations at  year-end show that the appropriations of the year  2016 will be used at 100 % rate, which shows the  capacity of the Agency to fully implement its annual  appropriations. The same commitment rate achieved  in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 is  maintained for a seventh year in a row. The payment  rate reached 89.18 % (92.89 % in 2015) and the  amount carried forward to 2017 was EUR 968 198.32,  representing 9.29 % of total C1 appropriations 2016  (up from 7.11 % in 2015).  Cancellation of payment appropriations for the year No payment appropriations were cancelled.  Cancellation of payment appropriations carried over Fund source ‘C8’ — appropriations carried over  automatically from 2015 to 2016.  The appropriations of 2015 carried over to 2016  were utilised at a rate of 94.28 % (automatic  and non-automatic carry-overs) which indicates  a satisfactory capability of estimation of needs. From  the amount of EUR 674 520.54 carried forward, only  the amount of EUR 38 615.93 was cancelled, due  to the fact that the estimated expenditure deviated  from the actual paid amount.

ENISA is implementing actions including:  launching numerous calls and exploring effective  reserve lists;  enhanced visibility of career opportunities via  revamped job vacancy templates, targeted  dissemination of vacancies through traditional  routes across Member States and proactive use of  social media;  increased quality of recruitment documents with  new FAQs for candidates, new guidelines for  Selection Boards and new and simpler financial  rules for the reimbursement of candidates;  the acquisition in 2018 of a modern e-recruitment  tool;  development of modern competency-based  interview questions;  optimisation of internal procedures bringing  efficiency in delivering services and projecting  ENISA’s image in the European Job Market.  The job family and job category framework is being  consolidated in line with the Annex I of the SR:  Assistant Job Family:  Assistant Job Category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities such as  assistance and/or secretariat requiring a certain  degree of autonomy): typically, these posts are  filled by grades SC1-SC2, AST1-AST3, FGI, FGII  Technical Assistant Job Category (staff providing  support with a medium degree of autonomy in  the drafting of documents and assistance in the  implementation of policies/projects/procedures/ processes): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AST4-AST7, FG III  Senior Assistant Job Category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities requiring high  degree of autonomy and carrying out significant  responsibilities in terms of staff management,  budget implementation or coordination):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AST7- AST11 and only for the two Assistants to Head of  Departments by FG IV  Operational Job Family:  Junior Officer/Administrator Job Category (staff  providing junior expertise in a specific field of  knowledge): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AD5, FG IV 13  Officer/Administrator Job Category (staff providing  officer expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD6-AD7,  FG IV 14-18  Lead Officer/Administrator (staff providing top  level expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD8-AD9  Team Leader Job Category (staff providing  operational excellence with some managerial  responsibilities): typically, these posts are filed by  grades AD7-AD9, FG IV 14-18  Managerial Job Family:  Middle Manager Job Category (staff providing  operational vision and managerial expertise  including financial management): typically, these  posts are Head of Unit positions filled by grades  AD9-AD12  Senior Manager Job Category (staff providing  strategical vision and managerial expertise  including financial expertise): typically, these posts  are Head of Department position (filled by grades  AD11-AD13)  Executive Director (filled by grades AD14-15)  Following the 2014 SR reform, ENISA adopted and  is applying the new implementing rules on the  engagement and use of Temporary Staff for Agencies  (TA 2f), thus ensuring a more consistent staff policy  and allowing inter-mobility between EU agencies.  ANNEX 4 HUMAN RESOURCES —  QUALITATIVE  OF – Officials  6564  ANNEX Human resources — qualitative  Concerning the duration of employment, Temporary  Agents and Contract Agents are offered typically  long term contract of three years, renewable for  another limited period of 5 years. These contracts  are converted into contracts of indefinite period  if a second renewal is offered and accepted. All  contracts renewals are subject to an assessment of  the performance of the staff member and depend  on budget availability and the business needs for the  function occupied as stipulated in the ED Decision  38/2017 of 6 June 2017 concerning employment  contract renewal. In addition, ENISA is activating  short-term contract agents (2 years, renewable once  for a maximum 1 year) to be allocated depending  on business needs or any other human resources  constraints (such as long-term sick leave or part time,  etc.). This engagement of staff allows the Agency to  keep an adequate degree of flexibility and adapt the  workforce based in the business needs.  Non-statutory staff  ENISA welcomes Seconded National Experts (SNEs) as  an opportunity to foster the exchange of experience  and knowledge of the Agency working methods and to  widen the expertise network. Experts can be seconded  to ENISA for the duration of a minimum 6 months to  a maximum of 4 years. ENISA offers paid traineeship  opportunities to talented, highly qualified young  professionals at the start of their careers, in a field of  their choice. Trainees have the opportunity to immerse  themselves in the Agency’s work and in the European  system in general. The traineeship may last from  a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 12 months.  Finally, in compliance with both the EU legal  framework and Greek labour legislation,  ENISA’s policy is intended to rely on interim services  under specific circumstances and for a limited period  of time. The Agency holds a framework contract  which has been awarded to a temping agency.  A.4.2 APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE AND  RECLASSIFICATION/PROMOTIONS  ENISA has adopted the Implementing rules: MB  2016/10 on Reclassification of CA’s, MB 2016/11 on  Reclassification of TA’s.  For the forthcoming years, the organisation will strive  to see performance management as a business  process that improves employee engagement and  drives business results. It will enable staff to focus on  having a constructive dialogue with the manager and  to consider the exercise as a valuable developmental  tool, while clarifying that appraisal and promotion are  two different exercises.

A.4.3. MOBILITY POLICY  All internal moves are processed via Article 7 of the  Staff Regulations and for transparency purposes  are published internally on INTRAENISA. In order to  create a motivated and versatile workforce, ENISA has  adopted an ED Policy 01/2017 of 22 February 2017 on  Internal Mobility Policy. ENISA also joined the inter- agency job market (IAJM) with the view, as for all other  agencies, to offer possibilities of mobility to staff in  Agencies by assuring a continuation of careers and  grades. In 2016, 1 staff member moved via the IAJM.  Additionally, ENISA is also opened to mobility  between the Agencies and the EU Institutions. In 2016  no mobility was organised and in 2017 one mobility  was organised.  A.4.4. LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT  In order to make the most out of its internal  expertise and to develop mechanisms to retain  staff, the organisation is focusing on developing  an ENISA’s learning and development framework  2017-2020. The objective is to ensure the efficient  delivery of learning interventions, the compliance  with mandatory training (e.g. Ethics and Integrity) and  to support the acquisition of specific and strategic  knowledge.  A.4.5. GENDER AND GEOGRAPHICAL  BALANCE  Total number of Staff as of 31/12/2016: 69 (43 TA’s: 28  AD’s + 15 AST’s + 25 CA’s + 1 SNE).  The overall gender balance among ENISA staff shows  a male prevalence which is understandable given  the scope of the Agency’s work. As a measure to  promote equal opportunities, the terms of published  vacancy notices prevent any kind of discrimination  and the Selection Board’s composition is balanced in  term of gender and nationality as far as possible. For  instance, in 2016 the Management Team welcomed  a French female manager as Head of HR and ENISA  will pursuit this objective.  With regard to the geographical balance, while there  is no quota system in operation, the Staff Regulations  require when recruiting to strive for a broad balance  among nationalities and to adopt measures if there  is imbalance between nationalities among staff.  ENISA is paying great attention to this requirement as  reflected by the latest recruitments.

SCHOOLING  A European School is located in Heraklion and is used  by ENISA staff (for the school year 2016-2017, only  4 pupils attend nursery/primary school and 2 pupils  attend Secondary school).  The rest of ENISA pupils attend various schools in  Athens based on service level agreement concluded  with a number of international schools (for the  school year 2016-2017, 20 pupils attend nursery  school, 20 pupils attend kindergarten school and 18  pupils attend primary and secondary school). ENISA  considers schooling as an essential part of its Staff  Policy and thus, contribute to the expenses of school  care for the children.  42 %  4 %  54 %  Per Category  Contractual Agent  Seconded National Expert  Temporary Agent  35%  19 %  42 %  4 %  TA/AD  TA/AST  CA  SNESs  ENISA is currently negotiating a reduction in space  rented in Heraklion and an increase in the space  rented in Athens.

ANNEX 5 BUILDINGS  7170  ANNEX 6 PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES  Internal monitoring system MATRIX has been put in  place at ENISA and is used for project management by  ENISA staff. Regular progress reports are presented  at the meetings of the ENISA management team and  reviewed at the midterm review meetings.  Also, external consultant has been contracted to  carry annual ex post evaluation of core operational  activities. The scope of the evaluation focusses  on ENISA’s core operational activities, with an  estimated expenditure above 30.000 EUR. The overall  objective of the annual evaluations is to evaluate  the effectiveness, efficiency, added value, utility,  coordination and coherence.  The following table summarises the findings  per evaluation criteria and outlines actions  ENISA’s management considered as important.  The evaluation of 2014 core operational activities  is largely positive and the actions mainly relate to  a continuation of the work carried out.  Overall, the evaluation of activities foreseen in  the 2014 work programme concludes that ENISA  effectively cooperates and engages with its main  stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate. The  support provided by ENISA is seen as a complement  to that of other public interventions, and no adverse  effects were identified.  There is a clear pattern in terms of progress, where  targets under ENISA’s control (such a high-quality,  community building, good practice dissemination)  are largely achieved. The scope and objectives of  ENISA’s work is seen as relevant to respond to the  needs, but at the same time stakeholders see limits in  ENISA’s mandate and outreach. In particular, private  stakeholders and industry appear to strive towards  a more operational role for ENISA, going beyond  the advisory and facilitating mandate of the Agency,  in order to effectively achieve the overall objectives  of Network Information Security (NIS) and cyber  security.  Also, the findings and conclusions from the external  evaluation of ENISA’s core operational activities  in 2015 confirm that ENISA generally functions  efficiently; it is characterised by a clear delineation  of responsibilities and has cost-saving measures in  place, but one case of low efficiency was identified,  namely the insufficient dissemination of publications.  It was concluded that ENISA significantly enhanced  cooperation both between Member States of the  EU and between related NIS stakeholders in 2015  by bringing people from different operational  communities around the table to share information,  ideas and common areas of interest at an operational  level. ENISA thereby contributed to a great extent to  enhancing community building in Europe and beyond  and improved services, workflow and communication  among stakeholders to respond to crises. Moreover,  the ex post evaluation concluded that ENISA’s support  to cooperation between stakeholders complemented  other public interventions, clearly pointing to a role  for ENISA in this regard.  The reports of annual ex post evaluations have been  published on ENISA website https://www.enisa. europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of- enisa-activities  ANNEX 7 EVALUATIONS  Agency privileges Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities/  diplomatic status  Education /day care  In accordance with Article  23 of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 of the European  Parliament and of the Council  of 21 May 2013, the protocol  No 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the European  Union annexed to the TEU  and the TFEU applies to the  Agency and its staff.  In accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 21 May 2013, the protocol No 7 on the  privileges and immunities of the European Union  annexed to the TEU and the TFEU applies to the  Agency and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a Seat  Agreement in April 2005, which was ratified by Greek  Law 3572/2007 and is applicable to ENISA and its staff.  A public School of  European Education, Type  2, was founded in 2005  by the Greek government  in Heraklion — Crete for  the children of the staff of  ENISA.  There is no European  School operating in Athens.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of-enisa-activities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of-enisa-activities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of-enisa-activities  7372  Criteria Summary findings Possible actions  Relevance Based on the findings, it can be concluded that ENISA clearly responds  to a need in the European NIS landscape. The scope and objectives of  ENISA’s work are seen as relevant to respond to the needs, but at the  same time stakeholders see limits to ENISA’s mandate and outreach,  which affects the ability of the Agency to effectively meet the needs.  Continue to explore ways  to ensure ENISA’s work is  addressing real needs in  NIS in the EU. Map/assess gaps in current  NIS landscape, to feed  into discussions on future  mandate. It may be important in the  future to focus on activities  where there is a strong  demand from the NIS  communities to ensure  that ENISA’s deliverables  achieve a real impact.  Impact It appears that, despite ENISA’s limited mandate and also fairly small  resources, the Agency manages to make a real contribution towards  increased NIS in Europe, as perceived by key stakeholders.  N/A   Effectiveness  — KIIs and  downloads  All KIIs were achieved. The evaluation can conclude that some of  ENISA’s deliverables have generated a high number of downloads in  a short period of time (most reports were made available in Q1 2015  and thus downloads had only been available for a few months at the  time of writing).  Introduce more ambitious  KIIS which enable a tracking  of performance.  Effectiveness  — EU policy  The evaluation findings show that the work conducted under work  stream 1 has been successful in achieving most objectives. In  particular, the work undertaken to identify evolving threats, risks and  challenges, and the contribution to EU policy initiatives appear to have  achieved the intended results. For the work done in supporting the EU  in education, research and standardisation, results were more mixed,  in particular regarding the link to actual operational issues such as data  protection and secure services. These aspects are evidently not under  the direct control of ENISA but of national regulators and operators,  hence the need for further efforts in coordination and cooperation.  Continue efforts to build  relations with senior  decisions makers at  Member State and EU level  (public and private).  Effectiveness  — Capacity  building  ENISA’s work to develop capacity in Member States (to coordinate  and cooperate during crises, and the support to develop capacities  and strategies at Member State level) as part of work stream two has  been successful in achieving the objectives set out. The contribution to  private sector capacities looks more uncertain, based on the responses  from the stakeholder survey.  Continue to engage with  the private sector to  improve and increase  outreach.  Effectiveness  — Support  cooperation  Findings show that the work stream 3 has largely achieved the  objectives set, with stakeholders assessing a clear contribution of  ENISA to putting in place effective measures to cope with cyber  crises and incidents. In particular, ENISA’s support was considered  valuable to improve workflow and cooperation among involved  stakeholders. That said, as the CE2014 case study concludes, there is  still a long road ahead before an EU-level crisis management process  is put in place in the cybersecurity area, with a lack of trust among  stakeholders, weaknesses and differences in national capabilities,  weak communication structures, insufficient exchanges of information  in ‘real life’ etc., representing hurdles that need to be surmounted over  the medium to long term.  Continue trust building  and cooperation activities  as a means to overcome  barriers to cooperation  during crisis.  Efficiency The operational budget of ENISA is limited, and the main expenditure  relates to staff costs. In the light of the resources available (staff and  expenditures), ENISA manages to produce quite a high number of  deliverables which also have generated considerable outreach in terms  of downloads. No indication of low efficiency was identified in the  evaluation period, though specific cost saving measures could not be  established.  N/A   Coordination  and  coherence  Overall, it can be concluded that ENISA effectively cooperates and  engages with its main stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate. The  support provided by ENISA is seen as a complement to that of other  public interventions, and no adverse effects were identified.

A Permanent Stakeholders’ Group: The PSG  advises the Executive Director in the performance  of his/her duties under this Regulation.  An Executive Director: The Executive Director  is responsible for managing the Agency and  performs his/her duties independently.  Internally, ENISA is organised as follows (staffing as  31. 12. 2016):  ANNEX 10 ENISA’S ORGANISATION  EDO  Executive  Director  Office  Management  Board  Chairperson  Executive  Board  Chairperson  SRAD  Stakeholder  Relations and  Administration  Department  Permanent  Stakeholders  Group  COD  Core Operations  Department  CSS  Corporate  Services &  Stakeholders  FAP  Finance,  Accounting and  Procurement  COD 1 Secure  Infrastructure  and Services  COD 2  Data Security &  Standardisation  COD 3  Operational  Security  HR  Human  Resources  Executive  director  AD 1 AST 1 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 1 AST 0 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 1 AST 1 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 3 AST 0 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 1 AST 4 CA 4  SNE 0  AD 8 AST 1 CA 9  SNE 0  AD 0 AST 5 CA 3  SNE 0  AD 5 AST 0 CA 3  SNE 0  AD 1 AST 2 CA 1  SNE 0  AD 8 AST 1 CA 4  SNE 1  7776  ANNEX 11 SUMMARISING THE KEY  INDICATORS FOR THE  MULTIANNUAL ACTIVITIES  The Agency is in a continuous process of improving  the standing of its key indicators for the purpose of  measuring and reporting better and more accurately  against its annual work programme, in line with the  prescribed Commission approach.  The purpose of key indicators for ENISA is to provide  the metrics to measure against performance, results  and impact of the Agency’s outcome, output and  impact. Key indicators seek to better support policy  dynamics on network and information security,  an area of policy that largely still remains under  development at the EU level, as technology and  business models evolve.  The chosen approach initially sets the designated  levels of key indicators; each type of indicator  is grouped alongside other similar ones at the  appropriate level. This approach has been developed  taking into account the capability of the Agency to  report, and the need to avoid any unnecessary burden  on the Agency. The Agency’s capability to report  reflects effort and organisational measures as well as  tools available or that can be obtained relatively easily.  Measuring operational performance that concerns  the policy raison d’être of the Agency remains the  focal point for the key indicators introduced. The key  notions and main vectors of annual and multiannual  measurements are presented hereunder:  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:  Performance that is a concern at the output level  when deliverables are produced. Metrics used, are  project management-based and they include:  •  Adherence to the scope of the deliverable or project  •  Budget (or financial resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin  •  People (or human resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin  •  Time available to carry out the output or project  remaining within prescribed levels with a ± 5 %  margin  •  Quality of performance depending on the type of  output, according to the classification of output  in the work programme (being, publication,  event, support).  Results that are a concern at the annual and at  multiannual activities’ level. The indicators used  are as follows:  •  Delivery indicator aiming at delivery of at least  95 % against work programme planning. This  is equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma) organisation  (reaching between 93.3 % and 99.3 %); clearly  the Agency has historically proven its operational  ability to deliver at much higher level, meeting 6σ  (6 Sigma) specification requirements (at 99.99 %).  However allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  above-mentioned deviation rate of ± 5 %29. The  criteria used, being scope, budget, people, time  and quality, they all refer to the proper execution  of the project leading up to the production of  output. This evaluation is done at the end of the  project within ENISA.  •  Following the production process that leads  up to an output, feedback from stakeholders  is collected on each output. Results are further  aggregated on a multiannual basis by the  Agency.  29 In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance  between the mean value and the inflexion point. Shortening this  distance is an indicator of enhanced quality of performance.  While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of  the current version of the QMS of the Agency portions thereof,  are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the  reference Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) hereto is the  SOP PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) that is a simplified version of  the DMAIC (define-measure-analyse-improve-control) approach  typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice for simplicity is  obviously desirable while the implementation of a quality system  is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses on process control for  the purpose of reducing or eliminating waste. Six Sigma utilises  historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and  improve a company’s operational performance e.g. processes,  practices, and support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of  process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard  deviations from the mean.  Impact is measured at the Agency level only;  it is based on feedback received from the  evaluation of the Agency’s performance (own  initiatives and commissioned consulting at the  Agency’s initiative) and/or institutional third party  evaluations such as those commissioned by the  European Commission, the European Court of  Auditors, etc.  The key indicators broken down at the output level,  the activities level and the Agency level, are presented  on the following page.  All rating indicators follow a variable Traffic Light  Rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows:  Green, that reflects 5 % deviation meaning that  the planning /performance are appropriate and  within prescribed levels.  Yellow, that reflects 20 % deviation meaning that  the planning /performance need to be revisited.  Red, which reflects deviation above 20 % meaning  that the planning /performance need thorough  review.  Feedback is collected by means of surveys. It is  envisaged that the deliverables part of the website  will be leveraged to channel targeted feedback  against each deliverable downloaded. This is a task  however that will be made available as from 2018, at  the earliest.

This digitalisation provides opportunities and means to increase productivity and to modernise so  many aspects of our lives. However, at the same time, it brings new challenges for human rights  (privacy and data protection issues online), for human safety and security (cybercrime, cyberbullying,  cyberstalking) and for democracy (fear of hacked elections, fake news), to name a few.  It is obvious that even if we are facing significant challenges, there is no way back. The only  option is to continue to make the most of digitalisation and cyberspace opportunities — by  investing more in (cyber)security and in the protection of citizens and the information contained  in our infrastructure and networks.  Cybersecurity is an industry/market on its own that will continue to grow. The size of the  cybersecurity market in Europe 1 is estimated to increase with a 6 % compound annual growth  rate (CAGR) to EUR 24.4 billion in 2018, maintaining a share of over one quarter of the worldwide  cybersecurity market. In addition, if Europe does not use cybersecurity as an economic enabler the  opportunity costs between 2014 and 2020 are estimated at around EUR 640 billion.  The estimated worldwide economic impact of cyberattacks has now passed half a trillion USD2.  According to global surveys3, 15 % of businesses say they have faced a cyberattack in the past  year; businesses in the EU (19 %) and North America (18 %) have been most heavily targeted  according to the same source. Yet the measurement of the real impact of lack of proper  cybersecurity in terms of costs needed for full recovery is still challenging4. While some direct  costs associated with damaged assets and the investment needed to replace compromised  assets are easier to evaluate, the costs/impact of attacks on personal life, freedom, democracy  and intellectual property cannot be easily measured.  At the European level, there is an increased need for digital skills and cybersecurity skills in  particular. There is also a need for people who have experience of using modern information  security techniques within the work environment — this latter requirement is not an issue of  1 Cybersecurity as an Economic Enabler, ENISA, Published on April 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler 2 McAfee, Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime, report summary, 2014 3 Grant Thornton, Cyber-attacks cost global business $300bn+, available at:  http://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/cyber-attacks-cost-global-business-over-$300bn-a-year/ 4 ENISA, ‘The cost of incidents affecting CIIs’, August 2016, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-cost-of-incidents-affecting-ciis/  education, but rather of experience. It is acknowledged currently that 44 % of European citizens  do not have basic digital skills5; Europe also lacks skilled ICT specialists to fill the growing number  of job vacancies in all sectors of the economy.  Standardisation and certification play an important role in securing modern systems and ENISA  continues to play an active role in both areas. In particular, ENISA has supported the European  Commission over the last year in its efforts to align current approaches to certification of security  products with the needs of today’s society and is looking forward to contributing further to this key area.  The cybersecurity talent shortage6 is estimated at more than a million openings worldwide while  competition for qualified cybersecurity professionals is driving up salaries and improving the  benefits offered. The problem is here and is likely to stay as the global shortage of cybersecurity  professionals is estimated by other sources to reach 2 million by 20197.  The EU needs to act and for that it needs a strong and agile cybersecurity agency  ENISA, the cybersecurity agency for the EU, should be in the position to support the EU and  Member States in addressing all the risks and challenges brought about by digitalisation. The  entire cyber ecosystem has changed. ENISA therefore welcomes the new proposed cybersecurity  strategy8 and the new proposed Cybersecurity Act9, which recognises this issue and proposes  a significant growth in the ENISA resources and budget in the next few years.  In the meantime, however, ENISA has the difficult task of coping with a significant increase in  demand for its services whilst operating within current budget and resource constraints. The  Agency has achieved this through prioritisation and cutting important tasks. This was not an  easy exercise. In order to achieve this, during the preparation of 2018 planning, the Agency  included a reduced list of activities, already prioritised with the support of the Management  Board. Those tasks which were not marked as being of high priority have been dropped from  the work programme in order to satisfy the priority requirements.  In this programming document the planned activities for 2018 to 2020 are presented alongside  the detailed work planning for 2018. The document follows the structure laid down by the new  Commission guidelines for programming documents provided in the context of the framework  financial regulation and the five pillars of ENISA strategy.  Finally, I welcome the new proposed ENISA regulation, the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA welcomes  the proposal for a strengthened ENISA with additional resources and staff.

As set out in 2013 in its renewed mandate, ENISA has  been set up ‘for the purpose of contributing to a high  level of Network and Information Security within the  Union […] thus contributing to the establishment  and proper functioning of the internal market’10,  contributing to growth and employment in Europe.  The mission of ENISA is to contribute to securing  Europe’s information society by raising ‘awareness  of network and information security and to  develop and promote a culture, of network and  information security in society for the benefit of  citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector  organisations in the Union’11.  10 Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and  the Council of 21 May 2013, Article 1(1). 11 Article 1(1) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  In doing so, ENISA will act ‘without prejudice to the  competences of the Member States’ regarding their  national security12 and in compliance with the right  of initiative of the European Commission. In order to  achieve its mission, several objectives and tasks13 have  been attributed to ENISA, ‘without prejudice to the  competences of the Member States regarding network  and information security and in any case to activities  concerning public security, defence, national security’14.  In line with these objectives and tasks, the Agency  carries out its operations in accordance with  an annual and multiannual work programme,  containing all of its planned activities, drawn up  by the Executive Director of ENISA and adopted by  ENISA’s Management Board (MB).  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based  on the involvement of all relevant stakeholder  communities, with a strong emphasis on pragmatic  solutions that offer a sensible mix of short-term and  long-term improvements. The Agency also provides the  Union institutions, bodies and agencies (hereinafter:  ‘Union institutions’) and the Member States with  a mechanism allowing them to call upon its services to  support their network and information security (NIS)  capability development15, resulting in a more agile and  flexible approach to achieving its mission.  12 Article 1(2) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 13 Articles 2 and 3 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 14 Article 1(2) of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 15 Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  MISSION STATEMENT  1  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 131212  ENISA strategy and the strategic  objectives  The strategic objectives of ENISA, set out in  ENISA’s strategy for 2016–2020 released in January  2016, are as follows:  #Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in  facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the  evolution of the digital environment.  #Policy. Promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the  European Union institutions and Member States in  developing and implementing EU policies and law  related to NIS.  #Capacity. Support Europe maintaining state- of-the-art network and information security  capacities, by assisting the Member States and  European bodies in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community. Foster the emerging European  network and information security community, by  reinforcing cooperation at EU level among Member  States, European Union bodies and relevant NIS  stakeholders, including the private sector.  #Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging  more efficiently with its stakeholders, including  Member States and Union institutions, as well as at  international level.  PRINCIPLES  In implementing its strategy, ENISA’s action will be  guided by the following principles:  Affirming itself as main point of reference of  the EU on NIS issues with a view to promoting  a coherent EU approach to NIS;  Adding value through complementarity with  Member State authorities and NIS experts,  primarily competent on cybersecurity matters  with whom it will reinforce its ties via the  development of sustainable cooperation in its  various domain of competence;  Liaising closely with competent EU  institutions, agencies, and bodies dealing with  other aspects of NIS (Europol, European Defence  Agency, European External Action Service, sectoral  agencies, etc.);  Achieving results by leveraging relevant  stakeholder communities, allowing ENISA  to strengthen its knowledge of national NIS  developments and facilitate the involvement of  NIS experts in its activities, including national NIS  competent authorities, the  private sector and  academia;  Supporting public and private cooperation,  with a view to reducing the fragmentation of the  DSM and supporting the development of the  digital security industry in Europe.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 15  THREAT LANDSCAPE  In a constantly evolving digital environment, threats  to the network and information systems in Europe  are growing rapidly. While all economic and societal  activities today rely upon information systems  and communication networks, the development  of European digital society can only be sustainably  achieved with the establishment of proper network  and information security (NIS) practices, policies,  organisations and capacities.  The ENISA threat landscape (ETL)16 for 2016 shows  that cyberthreats have undergone significant  evolution in terms of sophistication and impact, such  as extortion/ransom activities and user information  stealing. Data breaches have shown enormous  growth with hundreds of millions of items of user  data flooding the internet and being covered by  the front pages of the media on an almost weekly  or monthly basis. Security incidents involving the  internet of things (IoT) and large volume DDoS attacks  complement the threat landscape.  16 ENISA threat landscape report 2016, available at: https://www. enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016  Cyberthreat agents have performed a variety of  malicious acts greatly increasing the estimates  of cybercrime monetisation as illustrated by the  following cases:  Cybercrime capitalisation in 2016 almost reached  the level of the second most valuable US company.  Ransomware families are 175 % up and the  average ransom is 100 % up (USD 600-700).  Data breaches are 20 % up on last year.  The first 1Tbps DDoS attack has happened. It  has shown the impact DDoS-attacks may have  (internet service latencies).  Cyberspace is a recognised battlefield. This  creates a new centre of gravity for the whole  cybersecurity community.  In 2016 we have seen the impact and scale of  striking power of taking over IoT objects.  In 2016 the race between attackers and defenders  continues to suggest that cyberthreat agents are  always a step ahead of the defenders. Still, there are  some changes in the current state-of-play:  Defenders have expanded their knowledge  on modus operandi by using/implementing  cyberthreat intelligence and applying it to their  business products and processes in order to  enhance their proactive protection strategies.  Defenders have implemented deanonymisation  methods to identify adversaries hiding behind the  dark net.  PART I GENERAL CONTEXTI  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 1716  PART I. General context  Defenders have understood that defence is only  one side of the coin and are slowly beginning to  explore active/offensive defence capabilities.  Attackers have leveraged vast publicly available  intelligence, such as published malware source  code, to evolve their methods.  Attackers put quite a lot of effort into investing  and supporting their infrastructure as well as  marketing their products and services to maintain  their lucrative business.  In 2017 the frequency and impact of serious  incidents has been growing. Two major cybersecurity  incidents with EU-wide impact (WannaCry, NotPetya)  have drawn everyone’s attention to the reality of  cyberthreats and their possible critical impacts.  The cooperation between law enforcement agencies  and private sector organisations was an important  factor in identifying malicious activities and  infrastructure takedowns and it is likely that such  cooperation activities, between communities as well  as between Member States, will play an increasingly  important role both in the fight against cybercrime  and in the attempt to reinforce EU systems against  potential attacks.  In conclusion, on top of an active cybercrime scene,  the ETL has indicated that high-profile (state- sponsored) attackers have taken further action with  their involvement in highly sophisticated and stealthy  cyberattacks, cyberespionage, cybersabotage acts  and multi-layer attacks that have been considered to  possibly influence political developments.  POLICY INITIATIVES  Since it was set up with the name European Network  and Information Security Agency in 2004, ENISA  has actively contributed to the raising of awareness  of NIS challenges in Europe, to the development  of Member States’ NIS capacities and to the  reinforcement of the cooperation of Member States  and other NIS stakeholders.  Since NIS has featured high on the EU political agenda  — notably in the European cybersecurity strategy  (2013), the European cyberdefence policy framework  (2014) and the European digital single market (DSM)  (2015) — ENISA will in the future, more than ever,  need to accompany the efforts of Member States and  Union institutions to reinforce NIS across Europe.  Above all, the recent adoption of the directive of the  European Parliament and the Council concerning  measures to ensure a high common level of network  and information security calls for an enhanced  commitment of ENISA to supporting a coherent  approach towards NIS across Europe.  While ENISA should continue its well-established  activities — from support for the reinforcement of  Member States’ national capacities to the organisation  of cyber crisis exercises — the adoption of the NIS  directive will require the development of further areas  of action in order to accompany the evolution of NIS  in Europe. ENISA will, in particular, play a key role  in: steering NIS operational cooperation by actively  supporting Member States’ CSIRTs’ cooperation  within the future European CSIRTs Network between  the Member States and the institutions. ENISA will  provide thereby input and expertise to policy-level  collaboration between national competent authorities  in the framework of the Cooperation Group,  supporting the reinforcement of the NIS of Union  institutions close cooperation with CERT-EU and with  the institutions themselves. In parallel, ENISA will  continue to contribute to the reinforcement of NIS as  a driver of the DSM and more generally of economic  growth in Europe, including the development of NIS  and related ICT industries in Europe.  While many Union bodies are developing activities  related to cybersecurity(Europol, European Defence  Agency, European External Action Service, etc.), ENISA  aims to be the key point of reference for strategic  analysis and advice on NIS issues .The Agency seeks  to engage with other relevant actors and to use its  experience and expertise to support them in their  activities. Furthermore, ENISA will support other  stakeholders, in particular the private sector, to engage  in Europe’s efforts to ensure a significant improvement  of the state of its cyber security.  In this respect, the publication of the new EU  cybersecurity strategy, on 13 September 2017, has  identified ENISA as a key pillar of the EU’s ambition  to reinforce cybersecurity across Europe. The  strategy in particular foresees the strengthening and  reinforcing ENISA:  Section 2.1 addresses ENISA and the  strengthening of the Agency. A permanent  mandate for it is proposed.  ENISA’s role in the NIS directive is acknowledged.  An EU cybersecurity certification framework is  proposed. It is proposed that ENISA develop  certification schemes and provide secretariat  assistance to the EU cybersecurity certification  group. Frameworks are envisaged for:  • critical high-risk applications;  •  widely deployed digital products and services; and  • low-cost digital devices.  ENISA welcomes the renewed cybersecurity strategy17  and the new proposed Cybersecurity Act18.  17 European Commission, Joint communication to the European  Parliament and the Council Resilience, ‘Deterrence and  defence: building strong cybersecurity for the EU’, JOIN(2017)  450, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN 18 European Commission, Proposal for a regulation of  the European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the  ‘EU Cybersecurity Agency’, and repealing Regulation (EU)  526/2013, and on information and communication technology  cybersecurity certification (‘Cybersecurity Act’), COM(2017)  477, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:477:FIN  2.1 MULTIANNUAL PROGRAMME  This section reflects mid-term priorities that should  guide the activities of the Agency for the next 3 years.  Priorities are completed with indications on;  guidelines which should underpin  ENISA’s implementation of the multiannual and  annual programming document;  the expected added value of the Agency’s work in  achieving these priorities.  Annual outputs will derive from these priorities.  2.1.1 Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate  and support Europe in facing emerging  network and information security  challenges  Multiannual priorities (2018-2020) for Objective  1.1. Improving the expertise related to NIS  Priorities  Undertake regular stocktaking of existing expertise  within the EU on NIS challenges related to existing  or future services and technologies, and make that  information available to the EU NIS community.  Among these challenges, focus on key issues  on which to offer analyses and general  recommendations.  Seek to explore in particular issues related  to software (e.g. mobile), ICS/SCADA, smart  infrastructure and the IoT.  Guidelines  Collate and analyse as a priority available  expertise provided by national NIS competent  authorities, closely liaise with them to support its  stocktaking activity and when making analyses  and recommendations offer the opportunity to  voluntary experts from these authorities as well  as from other relevant stakeholders to take part  to its work.  Focus on challenges of significant added value  for the EU NIS community and on aspects taking  into account the impact that they may have on  the functioning of critical economic and societal  functions with the EU, as foreseen in the NIS  directive (e.g. expertise relevant to operators of  essential services (OES)).  Take a holistic approach encompassing the  technical, organisational, regulatory and policy  dimensions of NIS as well as different relevant  approaches, including the user’s perspective, and  work whenever possible on a multiannual basis to  deepen understanding of identified issues.  Added value  Provide European-wide visibility to existing NIS  expertise, in particular developed at national level.  PART II MULTIANNUAL  PROGRAMMING  2018–2020 II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 19  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 2120 2120  PART II. Multiannual programming 2018–2020  Foster convergent understanding of NIS  challenges across the EU NIS community as well  as best practices to address them, by offering  tailored, high-quality and up-to-date analysis and  recommendations.  Raise awareness of operators, European  institutions and national public authorities on  rising security challenges that should be taken  into account at technical and policy levels.  Support its work under Activity 2 (Policy), 3 (Capacity)  and 4 (Community) by advising on challenges that  may influence EU NIS policy developments and  implementation, national and European capacity  building and crisis and CSIRT cooperation.  Multiannual priorities (2018-2020) for Objective  1.2. NIS threat landscape and analysis  Priorities  Produce annual analyses of national  incident reports within the framework of the  implementation of the telecoms package, eIDAS  and the NIS directive.  Deliver an annual EU threat landscape offering  a general technical assessment of existing and  anticipated threats and their root causes.  In addition to the general threat assessment,  focus as well on a specific dimension (e.g. sector  or cross-sector threats in the context of the NIS  directive, or threats to existing technologies  whose usage is increasing, e.g. IPV6,  and threats  that are underestimated today but  may increase  in the future).  Guidelines  Seek synergies among national incident reports in  its analyses mentioned above.  Ensure that the EU threat landscape benefits from  these analyses as well as from other relevant  sources of information, in particular existing national  threat assessments as well as information stemming  from the CSIRTs Network subject to its approval.  Seek to enhance visibility of these results to the  EU NIS community.  Added value  Offer an EU-wide independent synthesis on  technical threats of general interest for the EU, in  particular in the context of the implementation of  the NIS directive (OES, digital service providers).

SUMMARISING THE KEY INDICATORS FOR  THE MULTIANNUAL ACTIVITIES  The Agency has developed key indicators to provide  the metrics to measure the performance, results and  impact of the Agency’s outcomes, outputs and impact.  A detailed presentation of key performance indicators  (KPIs), key results indicators (KRIs) and key impact  indicators (KIIs) is provided in Annex B.  2.3 HUMAN AND FINANCIAL RESOURCE  OUTLOOK FOR THE YEARS 2018-2020  Annex 1 provides an outlook for resources and  contains a brief description of new tasks and  efficiency gains.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 2928  The ENISA work programme for the year 2018 follows  the structure presented in the multiannual programming  in Part 2. In this section, clear objectives, results and  indicators are identified for each activity.  The activities presented in this section follow the  structure of the ENISA strategy document. After  a short description of the activity, the objectives are  presented. A short narrative is included, consisting  of a description and the added value of the activity,  the main challenges for 2018 and a link to the  multiannual objectives.  The main outputs/actions in the specific year, for this  case for 2018, are listed within each objective. Several  outputs are defined for each objective.  For each output, the following are included in this  document:  A description of the specific actions and  outcome which are expected to contribute to the  achievement of the objective,  The type of output (in a summary table at the end  of each activity):  • P: publication i.e. report, study, paper;  • E: event i.e. conference, workshop, seminar;  •  S: support activity, involving assistance to or  close collaboration with e.g. EU institutions or  bodies or Member States as appropriate, with  reference to a specific activity that features  defined and shared objectives.  Key performance indicators tailored for the type  of output (in summary table at the end of each  activity).  Resources and budget, in a summary table at  the end of the section in aggregated form at  activity level.  For each activity there is an objective defined that  covers the actions that the Agency is carrying out in  response to requests. Article 14 requests, named  after Article 14 of the ENISA regulation, allow the  Member State and the EU institutions to make direct  requests to ENISA seeking assistance or advice on  specific activities.  3.1 ACTIVITY 1 — EXPERTISE.  ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT EUROPE  IN FACING EMERGING NETWORK AND  INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES  3.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the  expertise related to network and  information security  Output O.1.1.1 — Good practices for security  of the internet of things (Priority 1)  IoT is at the core of operations for many essential  service operators as defined in the NIS directive,  especially considering recent initiatives concerning  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR THE YEAR 2018III  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3130  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  Smart Infrastructures, Industry 4.019, 5G20, Smart  Grids21, etc. IoT security should thus be considered in  this context22.  The Agency will identify and analyse existing security  practices and standards in the area of IoT security for  CII and Smart Infrastructure taking into consideration  existing national expertise and practices. ENISA will  compare these practices and standards and develop  good practices for security of IoT, with a particular  focus on the impact on end-users.  In this endeavour the Agency will take into account  and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives (the NIS directive, the ‘Internet of things —  An action plan for Europe’, the Alliance for the Internet  of Things (AIOTI)23 and the 5G Infrastructure Public– Private Partnership (5G PPP)24).  The Agency will develop targeted IoT case studies  to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by defining  appropriate attack scenarios, and providing relevant  recommendations and good practices. Moreover,  it will define IoT security requirements to ensure  ‘security for safety’.  The Agency will also validate the results of the study  (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national  and EU initiatives (e.g. AIOTI) and interact with all  important IoT stakeholders from the public sector,  such as DG Communications Networks, Content and  Technology and  the Joint Research Centre, and from  the private sector, including CII providers, integrators  and manufacturers.  This work item builds on the previous work of ENISA  in the area of IoT, Intelligent Cars, Smart Cities,  Smart Hospitals and Smart Airports (2015–2016  work programme).  19 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth- industrial-revolution 20 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/towards-5g 21 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and- consumers/smart-grids-and-meters 22 Nevertheless, non-critical operators, who might also be  involved in IoT activities, face no regulation and may have  little incentive to invest in securing their systems. Considering  the particularities of IoT, security should be seen as a primary  concern even for the latter operators. 23 More information on the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation (AIOTI) is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital- single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti 24 More information on the 5G Infrastructure Pubic–Private  Partnership (5G PPP) is available at: https://5g-ppp.eu/  3.1.2 Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape  and analysis  Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA threat landscape  (Priority 1)  This report will provide an overview of current  threats and their consequences for emerging  technology areas. It contains tactical and strategic  information about cyberthreats and also refers to  threat agents and attack vectors used. The report  is based on an intensive information collection  exercise, including annual incident reports, followed  by analysis and consolidation of publicly available  information on cyberthreats. It contains cyberthreat  intelligence by means of interrelated threat related  information objects.  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) provides  information regarding reduction of threat exposure.  This information will consist of available controls  that are appropriate in order to reduce the exposure  and consequently mitigate the resulting risks. In  addition to the report, ENISA will make available  to the public all relevant material that has been  collected during the year.  The visualisation and quick availability of threat  information will be in the focus in 2018. The ENISA  threat landscape will be accompanied by an end-user  application (web-based) that will provide available  information online. In this manner, ETL users will be  in a position to access ENISA threat information on  a permanent basis. In 2018 this platform will be used  for integration of additional relevant information.  In 2018 ENISA will continue its cooperation with  CERT-EU in the area of threat landscaping. This  will  be carried out by means of information exchanges,  use of CERT-EU services and organisation of common  meetings/events. In carrying out this work, synergies  with related experts (i.e. ENISA ETL Stakeholder  Group) and vendors (through memorandums of  understanding) will be maintained and expanded.  Output O.1.2.2 — Restricted and Public Info notes  on NIS (Priority 1)  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and  developments through Info Notes. As from 2018, the  Agency will produce two distinct types of note; ‘CSIRT  Info Notes’ and ‘General Info Notes’.  CSIRT Info Notes  CSIRT Info Notes cover incidents with an EU dimension  that are within the scope of the activities of the CSIRTs  Network. Such notes will only be published following  the agreement of the CSIRTs Network.  General Info Notes  General Info notes cover significant developments  and announcements in the field of cybersecurity.  General Info notes are not associated with the  response to incidents but are rather explanatory  notes, regarding — for example — events that have  a certain level of public and media attention. For  General Info notes, ENISA will consult the CSIRTs  Network as appropriate.  Both types of note will be logically integrated with  the cyberthreat information, building a single  interconnected knowledge base.  ENISA provides balanced and neutral information  regarding such events, covering issues, points of  action, mitigation measures, summaries, related  practices, etc. Hence the objective of this work is  to provide a neutral overview of the state of play  regarding an incident in a near-time manner.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing Info  Notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  ENISA will further assess the dissemination efficiency  of the procured cyberthreat information, in the form  of both ETL and Info Notes, by assessing their impact  among key stakeholder. This will be done by using  appropriate tools for analytics on user access and user  enrolment. In addition to the ENISA website, Info Notes  will be disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform in 2018.  Output O.1.2.3 — Support incident reporting  activities in the EU (Priority 1)  As incident reporting obligations become more  complex, one of the objectives of the activities  developed by ENISA in this sector is developing  efficient reporting schemes across sectors and across  geographical borders, thereby making sure they remain  simple, pragmatic and relevant for both the public and  private sector without increasing the cost of operation.  Current and foreseen activities in this area include:  Incident notification in the telecom sector (Article 13a  of the telecom package); currently ENISA supports  activities in this area by managing the informal  Article 13a Expert Group, keeping in touch with  industry and collecting incidents for the annual  incident report. Further support is needed as the  telecom package is currently under review and  significant improvements will be made to Article 13a.  Incident notification for the trust service providers  (Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation): in 2018 ENISA  will continue receiving the annual incident reports  from the competent authorities and will analyse  them and produce a consolidated, anonymised  incident analysis report. In addition, the Agency  will continue engaging with the competent  authorities towards a harmonised implementation  of this article and also engage with private  stakeholders to better understand the needs and  challenges of the sector.  Incident notification in the context of the NIS  directive: as the NIS directive entered into  force in August 2016, with a 2-year timeline  for implementation, all stakeholders involved  must prepare themselves for this step; further  guidelines and support are needed from ENISA  to facilitate a smooth transition towards the new  provisions. More specifically ENISA can assist  stakeholders in developing incident reporting  frameworks and procedures and agree on the  parameters and thresholds upon which an  incident is considered significant as well as the ex  post analysis of the reported data.  Any legal requirements in relation to reporting  stipulated in the draft regulation on ePrivacy.  ENISA has significant expertise in incident  reporting at the EU level through the work  carried out with Member States and telecoms  providers on the transposition of Article 13a of the  telecommunications framework directive of 2009.  The Agency also contributed to the interpretation of  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation and now helps trust  service providers in implementing this article.  As incident reporting  obligations become  more complex, one of  the objectives of the  activities developed  by ENISA in this  sector is developing  efficient reporting  schemes across  sectors and across  geographical borders.

Research and  development, innovation  Output O.1.3.1 — Guidelines for European  standardisation in the field of ICT security  (Priority 1)  Building on its own policy work, existing standards  and the requirements of the Member States, this  activity will seek to make available a gap analysis  and/or provide guidance to implement existing  NIS standards. Additionally ENISA manages the  relationship it has developed with the EU SDOs  (CEN/CENELEC and ETSI) by contributing to their  standardisation work at the strategic and tactical  levels (e.g. by joining the CEN/CENELEC Cybersecurity  Focus Group (CSCG), observing relevant technical  and conference programme committees, etc.). New  requirements associated with the transposition  or implementation of the legal framework in the  Member States will be taken into account, including  the NIS directive, the Commission’s communication  on cPPP, automated processes and systems, etc.  This output will seek to analyse the gaps and provide  guidelines for, in particular, the development or  repositioning of standards, facilitating the adoption  of standards and governance of EU standardisation  in the area of NIS. ENISA brings to this relationship  its technical and organisation know-how in NIS which  can be further leveraged into standards in terms of  extending or assessing them to render them more  appropriate to stakeholders and more compliant with  the prevailing regulatory framework. By bringing its  concrete NIS policy expertise, ENISA will produce ‘how  to’ and ‘what else’ guides in an effort to contribute to  European standardisation.  In carrying out this work, ENISA will consult with  the Member States, industry and organisations that  develop standards (e.g. ETSI, CEN, CENELEC), as well  as Commission services and agencies with policy  competence in these areas as appropriate.  Output O.1.3.2 — Priorities for EU research and  development (Priority 1)  This study will provide an analysis of areas covered  by the NIS directive, the general data protection  regulation and the Commission decision on cPPP and  will aim to show where R & D activities funded in the  context of Horizon 2020, CEF (Connecting Europe  Facility), TRANSITS and GEANT could achieve the  greatest impact.  ENISA will work closely with ECSO and cPPP on  cybersecurity in order to align the work being carried  by them with the ENISA work programme. In addition,  the Agency will offer support to the National Public  Authority Representatives Committee (NAPARC) by  offering a secretariat function.  ENISA will look into adapting the current best  practices and guidelines for protecting EU systems  and networks according to the evolving threats.  Additionally, ENISA will continue supporting  and advising the Commission and designated  organisations in this area (e.g. ECSO) as well as in  the Member States on how to meet their goals by  bringing in its concrete NIS policy expertise.  3.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response to Article  14 requests under expertise activity  Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests under  expertise activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and  EU institutions alike to make direct requests to  ENISA when seeking assistance or advice on specific  activities or policy issues. Under this objective, the  Agency will address all the requests related to its area  of expertise.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.

ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3534  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  3.2 ACTIVITY 2 — POLICY. PROMOTE  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  AS AN EU POLICY PRIORITY  3.2.1 Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy  development  Output O.2.1.1 — Support the policy discussions in  the area of certification of products and services  (Priority 1)25, 26  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy  developments, such as the adoption of the NIS  directive and the publication of the Commission  communication ‘Strengthening Europe’s cyber  resilience system and fostering a competitive and  innovative cybersecurity industry’, the Agency will  continue to support the Commission and the Member  States (taking account of the ‘cybersecurity Council  conclusions’) in identifying a certification framework  for ICT security products and services by promoting  mutual recognition or harmonisation of certification  practices up to a certain level. Any planned activity in  the area of IT security certification will respect existing  national efforts and interests.  ENISA will join ongoing initiatives and will seek to  stimulate standardisation initiatives with SDOs (ETSI,  IEC, etc.), ICT certification stakeholders (test labs,  certification and accreditation bodies, SOG-IS, CCRA,  etc.) as well as ICT security product users (ESMIG,  Eurosmart, etc.) as a means to enhance the dialogue  around security certification and build upon existing  results these initiatives have developed in the past.  Policy areas to be considered include but are not limited  to mapping existing European certification schemes,  recommendations on next steps to take at EU level,  analysis of impact of certification for manufacturers and  end-users etc. ENISA will carry out support activities in  the area of certification and if needed it will organise its  own workshops bringing together key stakeholders.  Output O.2.1.2 — Towards a framework for policy  development in cybersecurity (Priority 1)  The digitalisation of several critical and noncritical  sectors and the emergence of new technologies  such as IoT require a coherent policy framework on  NIS. This is likely to allow the integration of existing  policies (e.g. NISD, DSM, etc.) and the addition of new  ones (e.g. IoT policy, cPPP, etc.) within a common and  integrated framework.  25 Article 13a of the amended Framework  Directive 2002/21/EC (2002). 26 Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation (2014).  ENISA will take stock of existing policy initiatives  and assess the needs for new and emerging areas.  In cooperation with Member States and the private  sector the Agency will develop the key elements of  such a framework and seek validation of the idea  from all relevant stakeholders.  3.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy  implementation  Output O.2.2.1 — Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS regulation (Priority 1)  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public and  private bodies in implementing the eIDAS regulation by  addressing technological aspects and building blocks  for trust services. Aspects to be covered will be agreed  with the Commission and the Member States through  the eIDAS experts’ group. Specific implementation  guidelines and technical recommendations for  approval of which the eIDAS expert group will be  consulted will address operational aspects of trust  service providers, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. These recommendations  will complement the existing knowledge base that  ENISA has created for the trust service providers.  At the same time, ENISA will take utmost account of  recommendations and standards being developed by  CEN/ETSI/ISO and seek to avoid both duplication of  work and potentially opposing approaches.  Output O.2.2.2 — Supporting the implementation  of the NIS directive (priority 1)  The Agency will leverage its expertise and good  practices, among others, on critical information  infrastructures, national cybersecurity strategies,  CSIRTs, baseline security requirements in  numerous sectors (energy, transport, finance,  etc.), standardisation, ICT certification and others  to contribute to the work of the Cooperation  Group. That will be done by reusing or customising  existing results or by developing new, specific  results meeting the needs and requirements of the  Cooperation Group.  The Agency may analyse specific issues identified  in the work programme of the Cooperation Group,  consult with Member States’ competent authorities  and develop recommendations and suggestions that  would allow the Commission and Member States to  take informed decision on NIS matters.  In addition, ENISA will continue its efforts to support  Member States in the identification of OES. Through  stock taking and analysis ENISA will identify common  approaches, schemes and good practices. The Agency  will validate them with relevant public and private  sector entities to make sure they meet the needs  and requirements of both the public and private  sector. Such good practices may be used, as much as  possible, by Member States when defining, at national  level, their criteria for the identification of OES.  Output O.2.2.3 — Baseline security  recommendations for the OES sectors and DSPs  (Priority 1)  ENISA will develop guidelines for assisting Member  States to assess the compliance of DSPs and OES with  security requirements set by the NISD.  ENISA, building on its expertise in security  requirements developed for DSPs and OES, will work  closely with Member States and the private sector  to identify such cost-effective practices and maturity  security frameworks that would constitute the basis  for these guidelines.  In deriving such a set of common mechanisms, no  account will be taken of sector-specific needs as  these are likely to introduce conflicting priorities (for  example, the relative importance of availability and  integrity is likely to be different in the energy sector to  the banking sector, where different risks prevail).  However, the Agency will take note of such specific  requirements as and when they are identified during  the analysis phase and will then map them to the  needs and requirements of DSPs and OES.  The Agency will also compare and validate the results  with other relevant approaches in the area of OES (e.g.  C2M2, NICE-CMM) or the generic IT models (e.g. ISO  27001) and interact with all important stakeholders  from the public as well as the private sector.  The proper validation of the proposed self- assessment practices would pave the way for  widespread, de facto tacit adoption of them and thus  set the basis for sufficient convergence across the  Member States.  Output O.2.2.4 — Supporting the payment services  directive (PSD) implementation (Priority 1)  Payment Service Directive (PSD) 2 was adopted and  will be transposed by Member States by January 2018  at the latest. The European Banking Authority (EBA),  as the responsible Agency, in cooperation with ENISA  and the relevant competent authorities of the Member  States, develops guidelines for operational and security  risk management for payment service providers  (PSPs). These guidelines define the framework with  the appropriate mitigation measures and control  mechanisms to manage the operational and security  risks relating to the payment services they provide.  ENISA, drawing on its expertise in the field of risk  management, minimun security measures, resilience,  secure authentication mechanisms and others,  will contribute to this work, making sure there is  enough consistency between this and other related  frameworks, such as NIS directive.  In this context the Agency will continue its  cooperation with the EBA and the European  Central Bank (ECB) and Member States’ competent  authorities on other cybersecurity-related topics  including mandatory incident reporting, use of  cloud computing, mobile payments and the use of  blockchain by the finance sector. ENISA will also,  through this cooperation with these stakeholders,  align, as much as possible this work with the NISD  implementation because finance is one of the key  sector of this directive.  Output O.2.2.5 — Contribute to EU policy in the  area of privacy and data protection (Priority 2)  ENISA will continue promoting trust and security in  digital services in the DSM by means of technical  recommendations on the implementation of EU  legislation addressing privacy and personal data  protection. In particular, technical implementation of  the GDPR and ePrivacy directive will be addressed.  ENISA will support the implementation of the  regulatory aspects by acting as policy, technical and  organisational adviser of the Commission in the area  of security of personal data and confidentiality of  communications while seeking to elaborate privacy  certification schemes and data protection seals.  Moreover, ENISA will provide recommendations on  shaping technology according to GDPR provisions,  such as for example data security, data minimisation,  anonymisation and pseudonymisation. The Annual  Privacy Forum (APF) will be used as an instrument  to bring together key communities in the broader  area of privacy and data protection and identify best  practises and future challenges both at regulatory  and technological levels. Cooperation activities with  the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  national data protection authorities will be continued  and further enhanced.  Output O.2.2.6 — NIS directive transposition  (Priority 1)  According to Article 25(1) of the NIS directive, the  Member States shall adopt and publish, by 9 May  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3736  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  2018, the laws, regulations and administrative  provisions necessary to comply with this directive. In  order to support the Member States over this task,  ENISA will take stock of the NISD implementation  status together with other relevant stakeholders  (e.g. sectorial NIS regulations). Then the collected  data will be organised according to specific maturity  criteria (e.g. C2M2), in order for ENISA to identify  lessons learnt and recommend good practices to  the Member States, Cooperation Group and the  Commission concerning the transposition process.  This will further strengthen the cooperation  amongst Member States and at EU level, during  the period of transposition, and will provide them  with the appropriate knowledge for the successful  completion of the task.  3.2.3 Objective 2.3. Response to  Article 14 requests under policy activity  Output O.2.3.1 — Response to requests under  policy activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and  EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA  seeking assistance or advice on specific activities.  Under this objective, the Agency will address all the  requests related to the area of policy development  and policy implementation.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.  3.2.4 Type of outputs and  performance indicators for each  outputs of Activity 2 — Policy  3.3 ACTIVITY 3 — CAPACITY.

ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 3938  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  Output O.3.1.1 — Update and provide technical  training for Member State and EU bodies (Priority 1)  In 2018 most of the activities in this area aim at  maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and training for CSIRT and other  operational personnel. The Agency will support the  development of Member States’ national incident  response preparedness by providing good practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building  with a focus on CSIRT training and services in order  to improve the skills of CSIRT teams and their  personnel. ENISA will further build upon successful  work in the area of ‘training methodologies and  impact assessment’.  In detail, the Agency will provide an update of the  training material, which is in high demand, and  provide a new set of materials based on emerging  technologies in order to reinforce Member State  CSIRT skills and capacities to efficiently manage  cybersecurity events. A special emphasis in this  output is laid on supporting Member State CISRTs and  EU bodies with concrete advice (like good practice  material) and concrete action (like CSIRT training).  ENISA will also offer, upon request, direct support  to individual Member States by providing technical  training and advisories.  In 2018 ENISA will further enhance its methodology,  seminars and training on: (a) cyber crisis  management and (b) the organisation and  management of exercises. This activity will include  the development of material and infrastructure  for onsite and online training on these subjects. In  addition, this activity will cover the delivery of these  training programmes upon request.  Output O.3.1.2 — Support EU Member States  in the development and assessment of NCSS  (Priority 1)  The NIS directive sets as priority for the Member  States to adopt a national NIS strategy and to monitor  its implementation. ENISA will continue assisting  Member States to develop their capabilities in the  area of national cybersecurity strategies (NCSS). The  Agency, building on previous years’ work in this area,  will assist Member States to deploy existing good  practices in the related areas and offer targeted and  focused assistance on specific NCSS objectives (e.g.  CIIP, creation of PPPs, etc.). A priority in this area  will be to ensure that NCSS adequately reflect the  priorities and requirements of the NIS directive.  ENISA will also act as a facilitator in this process by  bringing together Member States and the private  sector with varying degrees of experience to discuss  and exchange good practices, share lessons learnt  and identify challenges and possible solutions.  Through this interaction with Member States  ENISA will validate and update its existing NCSS  good practice guide and evaluation/assessment  framework for NCSS.  Finally, ENISA will continue updating ENISA’s map  of EU NCSS as well as enhancing this map with  information collected on the NIS objectives each  Member State targets. In that context, relevant  qualitative and quantitative metrics will be identified.  ENISA will further enhance the material provided in  the e-Learning tool launched in 2015.  Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU Member States in  their incident response development (Priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA will concentrate its efforts on  assisting Member States with their incident  response capabilities by providing a state-of-the-art  view of the CSIRT landscape and development in  Europe. In close cooperation with the NISD CSIRTs  Network, the Agency will support the development  of Member States’ national incident response  capabilities by providing recommendations on key  dimensions of NIS capability building with a focus  on the development and efficient functioning of  national and sectorial CSIRTs. ENISA will as well  offer, upon request, direct support to individual  Member States to assess and improve their incident  response capabilities.  The main objectives of this output in 2018 are to help  Member States and ENISA’s other incident response  stakeholders, such as the EU institutions, bodies  and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy their  incident response capabilities and services in order  to meet the ever-growing challenges in securing  their networks. Another objective of this output is to  further develop and apply ENISA recommendations  for the CSIRT baseline capabilities and maturity  framework. ENISA will continue supporting cross- border CSIRT community projects and tools  development, as well as the global dialogue about  common definitions and the maturity framework in  the incident response domain.  3.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support EU  institutions’ capacity building.  Output O.3.2.1 — Representation of ENISA on the  Steering Board of CERT-EU and representation  of the EU agencies using the CERT-EU service  (Priority 1)  In 2017, the operations of CERT-EU were put on  a formal legal basis by way of an arrangement among  a number of EU institutions. A Steering Board (SB)  has been created to supervise the activities of CERT- EU, and a number of EU bodies and institutions are  represented on it. A place for ENISA was also created  on the SB, to represent ENISA and the EU agencies  that use the services of CERT-EU.  CERT-EU was set up to provide CERT services to the  EU bodies and institutions. ENISA sits on the SB.  ENISA is appointed to the CERT-EU’s SB to represent  itself and a list of EU Agencies that may use their  services.  In this context ENISA will also liaise with the EU  agencies on operational issues related to CERT-EU’s  activities in order to ensure that the viewpoints of  the Agencies are adequately represented. ENISA will  also report in to the CERT-EU SB on the evolution of  Services required by the Agencies.  3.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist in improving  private sector capacity building and  general awareness  In close collaboration with Member States and  with the private sector, ENISA will help EU citizens  to gain essential cybersecurity knowledge and  skills to help protect their digital lives. Aspects like  cybersecurity culture, cyber hygiene liability and  insurance will be analysed.  In 2018 activities will include promoting the annual  European Cyber Security Month and working with  the Member States delivering projects like the Cyber  Security Challenges as well as national initiatives,  upon request from those Member States.  Output O.3.3.1 — Cyber Security Challenges  (Priority 1)  In order to promote capacity building and awareness  on NIS among the emerging young generation of  cybersecurity experts in Member States, ENISA  will continue to promote and advise the Member  States on running national cybersecurity challenge  competitions in 2018. The Agency will also continue  its European Cyber Security Challenge annual activity.  Its support to the national and European activities  will aim at schoolchildren, university students as well  as young talents and security practitioners from the  industry. The goal will be to increase the interest and  future opportunities in NIS for these communities by  promoting excellence in the form of competitions, as  well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest  from these stakeholders. In order to do so, ENISA  will try to attract a large number of participants from  different Member States for the final competition.  Output O.3.3.2 — European Cyber Security Month  deployment (Priority 1)  The metrics built into the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) have shown an increased number of  participants, and a better engagement level from year  to year. This is an achievement that was possible with  the support of an active community. In 2018, ENISA  intends to explore ways to make use of alternative  communication tools such as social media to reach  EU citizens. Previously proposed pillars remain:  support a multi-stakeholder governance approach;  encourage common public–private activities; and  assess the impact of activities, optimising and  adapting to new challenges as appropriate. Past work  on cybersecurity culture will be leveraged with a view  to testing guidelines in practice.  3.3.4 Objective 3.4. Response to Article  14 requests under capacity activity  Output O.3.4.1 — Response to requests under  capacity activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and EU  institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking  assistance or advice on specific activities. Under this  objective, the Agency will address all the requests  related to the area of capacity building.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.

FOSTER  THE EMERGING EUROPEAN NETWORK  AND INFORMATION SECURITY  COMMUNITY  3.4.1 Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis  cooperation  Output O.4.1.1 — Cyber Europe 2018 (Priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European  cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2018 (CE2018). This  exercise will closely follow up and build upon the  lessons learned and actions from previous exercises,  such as CE2016.  CE2018 will focus on testing capabilities and  procedures, namely large-scale incident management  cooperation procedures at EU and national levels. The  crisis escalation scenario will be realistic and focused  in order to capture better how incidents are managed  and cooperation happens in real life. The exercise will  include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs Network set  up under the NIS directive.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include  the strategic dimensions of the exercise and will be  prepared based on the lessons learned from CE2016,  to drive the whole planning process. The exercise brief  will be given for comments and approval to ENISA’s MB  after consultation with the Member State Cooperation  Group and the CSIRTs Network set up under the NIS  directive. Following this ENISA will assemble a group  of planners from the participating countries to work  closely towards developing a detailed exercise plan  (ExPlan) in 2017-2018. ENISA will involve the group of  planners in the relevant planning steps and take into  account their input. The exercise planning will avoid  overlaps with other major related activities.  ENISA will consult Member States and seek the  agreement of its MB after consultation with the  Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs Network on  a possible joint EU–NATO cyber exercise in the  coming year.  Finally, in 2018 ENISA will organise the EuroSOPEx  exercise for the EU public authorities’ points of  contact, as these will be represented in the CSIRTs  Network only to keep and even raise the momentum  of cooperation between them. As in previous years  the exercise will be planned with the support of  representatives from the organisations involved. The  exercise is expected again to have as high-level goals  to raise awareness of cooperation procedures, train  participants in using the cooperation infrastructure,  such as structures relating to communication and  information sharing, and ultimately contribute to  increased trust within the CSIRTs Network. Guidance  should be found within the CSIRTs Network on  planning the exercise. No private or other entities will  be involved in this exercise.  Output O.4.1.2 — Lessons learnt and advice  related to cyber crisis cooperation (Priority 1)  Since 2015 ENISA has provided the secretariat for  the Member States developing standard EU-level  operational and technical cooperation procedures.  The upcoming policy framework, the NIS directive,  is expected to strengthen this by making this  supporting role more formal as the secretariat for  the cooperation of the EU operational cybersecurity  network (CSIRTs Network).  In this context, ENISA will offer support for the  network, helping the further development of  EU-level cooperation with standard operation  procedures at both levels, including the point  of contact management. Alert exercises and  communication checks will also be organised based  on the defined procedures.  ENISA will also support the Commission and  Member States in the deployment of the EU cyber  crisis cooperation blueprint to enhance cross-border  cooperation related to preparedness for a large- scale cyber incident, as presented in the Commission  communication on strengthening Europe’s cyber  resilience system (COM(2016) 410). ENISA will  review and highlight the cyber crisis management  good practices. Already existing schemes will form  the basis of this work, in particular the work of the  European Cyber Crises Cooperation Framework  (ECCCF). In addition, the activities will be matched  with and possibly integrated into traditional crisis  cooperation such as the integrated political crisis  response (IPCR) arrangements.  Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for cyber  exercise planning and cyber crisis management  (Priority 1)  Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) development and  content management  ENISA has been developing the Cyber Exercise  Platform (CEP) since 2014. CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States  and EU institutions, such as exercise organisation  and management, an ‘exercise playground’ with  technical incidents, a map of exercises and hosting  of the exercise development community.

ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 4342  PART III. Work programme for the year 2018  ENISA will further  improve, develop and  secure the CSIRTs  Network infrastructure  for its members’  smooth collaboration  and administration  use (CSIRTs Network  portal and other  communication means).  activity, ENISA would like to maintain and enhance the  experience offered by CEP, including user support.  In addition, new content and exercise incident  challenges and material will be developed in order  to retain the interest of the stakeholders and make  CEP a central tool in cybersecurity exercising for  all stakeholders. The CEP platform opens new  opportunities for ENISA to enlarge the user base  and thus offer to the operational cybersecurity  communities opportunities to exercise and gain  experience and knowledge. One way to enlarge the  user base, and thus increase the impact of ENISA, is  to offer new and interesting functionalities that will  attract new CEP registrations.  EU-level cyber crisis and incident management  procedures and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)  Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)  In 2018 ENISA will have to start preparing to manage,  support and operate the centralised components  of the MeliCERTes platform, formerly known  as the CEF CSP Cybersecurity DSI Core Service  Platform. MeliCERTes is expected to be the key  cooperation mechanism for computer emergency  and response teams in the European Union and will  enhance the EU-wide capability for preparedness,  cooperation and information exchange for a better  coordination and response to cyberthreats and  crises. With the final responsibility for MeliCERTes,  and for its maintenance, ENISA is following closely  the development of the platform and is actively  supporting the Commission and the consortium in  the different activities which are being carried out.  By the end of 2018 ENISA will be expected to have  implemented some of the systems and functionalities  for the management, maintenance and further  development of the MeliCERTes platform, together  with the development of some of the related internal  and external operational processes.  Finally, following possible requests or support by  national authorities, EU bodies and organisations  on the organisation and planning of exercises,  ENISA may offer training on CEP and on cyber crisis  management (CCM).  3.4.2 Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building  Output O.4.2.1 — EU CSIRTs Network secretariat  and support for EU CSIRTs Network community  building (Priority 1)  ENISA will continue its support to the Commission  and Member States in the implementation of the  NIS directive, in particular in the area of CSIRTs. As  part of this activity, ENISA will continue its tasks as  the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively  support its functioning by suggesting ways to  improve cooperation and trust building among  CSIRTs. The Agency will also support this cooperation  by developing and providing guidance and good  practices in the area of operational community  efforts, such as on information exchange and secure  communication, on request of the members of  the CSIRTs Network. In particular, the Agency will  be proactive in stimulating discussions within the  network and will aim to provide content to support  discussions on policy and technical initiatives  according to the CSIRTs Network’s own work  programme (action plan 2017-2022).  In addition, ENISA will take an active role to support  CSIRTs in the CSIRTs Network in activities relevant to  the CEF work programme. ENISA will actively support  teams in deployment and use of the Common  Service Platform (CSP) of the Cybersecurity DSI to  be implemented during 2016-2019 under CEF work  programme2015, subject to the agreement of the  CSIRTs Network.  Trust is an important asset for CSIRT operations  and so ENISA will continue to improve the level  of trust in the network by providing trust-building  exercises and events in coordination with the CSIRTs  Network’s governance.  The Agency will further improve, develop and secure  the CSIRTs Network infrastructure for its members’  smooth collaboration and administration use (CSIRTs  Network portal and other communication means).  Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and  LEA (Priority 1)  In 2018 the key goal will be to build upon the progress  ENISA has made in supporting different operational  communities (e.g. CSIRTs, law enforcement, European  FI-ISAC) to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to  collaborate and support exchange of good practices  among different stakeholders in operational  communities in Europe. In detail, ENISA will continue  its effort to support the EU-wide objectives on the  fight against cybercrime by liaising with various  stakeholders at EU (e.g. Europol) as well as at Member  State level.  3.4.3 Objective 4.3. Response to Article  14 requests under community activity  Output O.4.3.1 — Response to requests under  community building activity (Priority 1)  Article 14 requests allow the Member States and EU  institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking  assistance or advice on specific activities. Under this  objective, the Agency will address all the requests  related to the area of community building, exercises  and CSIRTs cooperation.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators  will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately  estimate the exact number or the output and outcome  of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are  indicated in the summary section at the end.

REINFORCE  ENISA’S IMPACT  3.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management  and compliance  Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the Agency. The Executive Director  has a personal assistant.  To support the Executive Director, an Executive  Director’s Office Unit (EDO) has been established.  The tasks covered by the EDO include: policy advice,  legal advice, MB Secretariat and coordination and  control of the work programme.  The policy and legal advice shall extend to all  aspects of the work of the Agency and includes  advice in relation to both its operational and  administration departments.  The EDO also supports the administration of the MB  meetings and the administrative correspondence  that takes place between meetings, including the  management of the MB portal.  The EDO supports the Executive Director in his  relations with the press.  In 2018 the EDO will continue to support the MB and  the Executive Board in their functions by providing  secretariat assistance.  In relation to the MB, following the applicable rules, one  ordinary meeting will be organised during 2018 and  informal meetings will be held as necessary. The MB  Portal will be supported for EB and MB. In relation to the  Executive Board, one formal meeting will be organised  per quarter and informal meetings when necessary.  The Stakeholder Relations and Administration  Department (SRAD) oversees a variety of  programmes, projects and services relating to the  overall management of the Agency, supporting  the Executive Director’s decisions in areas such  as personnel, finance, communications, press,  purchasing, technology, facilities management,  health, safety, security, protocol, liaison with local  authorities, etc.  The aim of the SRAD is to provide this assurance and  at the same time provide the best level of efficiency  and use of the resources that are made available  for the Agency. This also includes coordination with  the European Commission’s Internal Audit Service,  the European Court of Auditors, the European  Ombudsman, the European Anti-Fraud Office, DG  Human Resources and Security, DG Budget, DG  Communications Networks, Content and Technology,  etc. All internal policies related to transparency, anti- fraud policy, whistle-blowers protection, declarations  of interests, etc. are addressed within this activity.  SRAD strives to maintain and increase the efficiency  and effectiveness of the Agency, and provide  a continuous contribution to the ENISA strategy  both internally and externally, seeking the optimal  solutions for delivering on its mandate and providing  the required assurance over compliance.  The aim is to equip the Agency with adequate  and modern procedures and tools to minimise  the resources used across it, maximising the  intended delivery of the work programme and  statutory commitments.  Internal control  ENISA is in process of implemented a quality  management system (QMS) to support its regulatory  and strategic goals. It is following as indicative the  ISO 9001:2015 standards as they are designed  to help organisations ensure that they meet the  needs of customers and other stakeholders while  meeting statutory and regulatory requirements.  The methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check- Act (PDCA) cycle that has been duly documented in  a dedicated SOP and applied accordingly.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk  management, governance and internal control  processes of the Agency, in order to provide  independent and objective assurance to the Senior  Management, Executive Director and the MB.  IT  In 2015 ENISA set out to define its ICT strategy for the  years 2015-2018. The main thrust of this strategy is to  consolidate systems and applications on a maximum  of two platforms, maximise data sharing, make  applications available in a secure way on the most  widely used mobile devices and to progressively  move the Agency’s IT infrastructure to the Cloud.  Due to the size of the Agency and effective resources  management, the IT tasks will be outsourced as far as  possible to concentrate the available resources in the  operational area of the Agency.  By mid-2018 it is expected that all business applications  will be securely available on the most widely used mobile  Summary of outputs in Activity 4 — Community.

By this timeframe the platform consolidation  should be complete and mature, with adequate, flexible  and advance reporting and monitoring tools. It is  expected that the support technology in the Agency will  be consolidated in 2018, with modern, adequate and  flexible business applications.  Finance, accounting and procurement  The key objective here is to ensure the compliance  of the financial resources management with the  applicable rules, and in particular with sound  financial management, efficiency and economy  principles as set down in the financial regulation.  As the Agency resources are derived from the EU  budget, management is required to comply with a set  of regulations, rules and standards set out by the  competent EU institutions. The Finance, accounting  and procurement unit is responsible for high-quality  reporting (annual accounts) and contributions to the  audit and discharge procedures.  In 2018 the Agency expects to benefit from the  deployment of tools used to simplify and automate its  work including applications for budget management,  budget reporting and procurement planning and  e-Prior (EU Commission platform for the management  of the procurement lifecycle, from pre-award to  post-award of a contract), as well as the integration  of systems (staff missions, project management and  budget management).  The deployment of tools, coupled with outsourcing of  certain activities of low value, is expected to improve  the overall resources management and reporting  capacity of the Agency.  The aim is to contribute to the Agency’s annual  and multiannual programming from inception to  execution. The financial resources are allocated  according to the expressed needs of the  organisational units reflecting the priorities set by the  Agency’s management.  Key objectives for the year 2018 include high budget  commitment and payment rates, a low number of  budget transfers during the year, planned and justified  carry overs and reduced average payment delays.  Human resources  The ultimate goal of the human resources (HR) unit is  to attract, select, develop and retain highly qualified  staff, to put in place optimal organisational structures,  to promote a safe working environment and to create  a culture that reflects ENISA’s vision and values in  which staff can give their best towards achieving the  organisation’s objectives. By offering a broad array  of services (recruitment, performance management,  learning and development, career management,  working conditions, social rights, etc.) the objective  is to deliver a successful day-to-day management of  ENISA personnel and external staff (e.g. trainees) in  compliance with the Staff Regulations. This is why  more effort will be put into developing and deploying  tools and policies to streamline the efficiency of the  different HR processes.  Legal affairs, data protection and information  security coordination  Legal affairs  The Legal Affairs Unit will continue supporting the  legal aspects associated with the operation of the  Agency. This includes dealing with matters such as  contracts, procurement, employment-related issues,  data protection and corporate governance. The legal  affairs function also includes dealing with complaints  to the European Ombudsman and representing the  Agency before the Courts of the Union.  Data protection compliance tasks and data  protection office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO)  include the following:  Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations  pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC27 and  document this activity and the responses  received.  Monitor the implementation and application of  ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data.  Monitor the implementation and application of  Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the  requirements for data security, information of  data subjects and their requests for exercising  their rights under the Regulation, as well as  the requirements for prior checks or prior  consultation with EDPS.  Monitor the documentation, notification and  communication of personal data in the context of  ENISA’s operations.  Act as ENISA’s contact point for the EDPS on issues  related to the processing of personal data; cooperate  and consult with the EPDS whenever needed.  Information security coordination  The Information Security Officer (ISO) coordinates  the information security management system on  behalf of the Authorising Officer. In particular, the ISO  advises the ICT Unit on developing and implementing  information security policies, standards, guidelines  and baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality,  27 Regulation (EC) 45/2001 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of  individuals with regard to the processing of personal data  by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free  movement of such data, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/ LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:008:0001:0022:en:PDF .

Work programme for the year 2018  integrity and authentication of the information  systems of the Agency. The ISO is instrumental in  incident handling and incident response and security  event monitoring. It also leads the security training  for the Agency’s staff and provides security guidance  on all IT projects, including the evaluation and  recommendation of technical controls. In 2018 the  ISO will contribute to such goals as:  improving the security posture of ENISA by  planning penetration tests and vulnerability  assessments;  advising on security policies and updating existing  ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks;  improving the internal security training for ENISA  staff;  implementing new systems and tools that can  support improvements in IT security.  3.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement with  stakeholders and strong international  activities  Stakeholders communication and  dissemination activities  In 2018, ENISA will seek to improve its focus on key  activities and engage the higher possible number  of stakeholders including institutional and industry  representatives, academics, citizens etc.  Dissemination and outreach  The Agency will continue developing various tools and  channels including its website with a strong emphasis  on social media. Dissemination activities are the  responsibility of the stakeholders’ communication  team, which will seek the appropriate level of outreach  activities to take ENISA´s work to all interested parties  and to provide added value for Europe.  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount  for all stakeholders. It is of utmost importance  to have EU citizens from all backgrounds trust in  ENISA's work. The cybersecurity challenges are  increasing throughout the world and Europe is  no exception. With this objective, ENISA´s image  needs to be continuously reinforced. Outreach for  the Agency’s work is essential to create a strong  NIS culture among the various actors in Europe.  ENISA is well aware of this fact and will work with all  interested parties to reach the citizens that require  information about its work.  Activities are planned in several Member States to  engender cybersecurity awareness across Europe,  fulfilling ENISA´s mandate, mission and strategy up  until 2020.  Internal communications  Stakeholder communications cover both internal and  external groups. From an internal perspective the  team is responsible for supporting communication  activities that aim to keep all those working within the  Agency informed and to enable both management  and staff to fulfil their responsibilities effectively  and efficiently. A strong corporate culture improves  staff engagement and ultimately the implementation  of the work programme. An annual review of this  strategy is envisaged to ensure that it is kept up to  date and appropriate for the Agency.  Permanent Stakeholders Group  In 2018, ENISA will continue to reinforce the  contribution of the Permanent Stakeholders Group  (PSG) to the work programme.  The PSG is composed of ‘nominated members’ and  members appointed ‘ad persona’. The total number  of members is 33 and they come from EU and EFTA  countries. They constitute a multidisciplinary group  deriving from industry, academia and consumer  organisations and are selected upon the basis of their  own specific expertise and personal merits. Three  ‘nominated members’ represent national regulatory,  data protection and law enforcement authorities.  The PSG is established by the ENISA regulation ((EU)  No 526/2013). The MB, acting on a proposal by the  Executive Director, establishes a PSG for a term of  office of 2.5 years.  A new PSG was elected in 2017.Its role is to advise  the Executive Director on the development of  the Agency’s work programme, and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders on all  related issues.  National Liaison Officer network  ENISA kicked off various activities aiming at  strengthening cooperation with its National Liaison  Officers’ (NLO) network in 2017. NLOs are key actors  for the Agency’s daily work and they warrant the  interaction with select public sector entities in the  Member States while they provide assurance in terms  of outreach effective liaison with the Member States  and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  In 2018 ENISA will build upon these activities and  strengthen its cooperation with the NLO network, as  the first point of contact with the Member States, with  an emphasis on:  an NLO meeting to discuss possible  improvements in the collaboration with ENISA  and input to selected ENISA projects, aimed at  leveraging the NLO network for the dissemination  of ENISA’s work to the Member States and EFTA  countries;.  sending information to the members of the  NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming  ENISA project-related tenders, vacancy notices  and events organised by ENISA or to which it  contributes (for example as co-organiser, etc.);  maintaining and sharing with the NLO network  information on all relevant ENISA projects and  activities (e.g. the unit responsible for a particular  project, relevant tender results, etc.) while  maintaining and expanding  online resources  available as appropriate.  Additionally, guidelines provided by the MB on  missions, objectives and functioning of the NLO  network will guide the development of this important  tool for community building.  International relations  Under the Executive Director’s guidance and  initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level.  ENISA should participate in international  cybersecurity fora such as the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),  ICANN and the IGF in so far as these groups are  discussing items related to the Agency’s work  programme or strategy.  ENISA will develop contacts with important  cybersecurity bodies outside the EU when these  are likely to influence the EU cybersecurity  programme. The best example is NIST, the  National Institute of Standards and Technologies  in the US, which plays an important role in the  implementation of the US Executive Order and  can be seen as performing similar tasks to the  tasks that ENISA under takes for the NIS directive.  Starting in 2018 ENISA will follow standards  development and certification initiatives at the  international level, as some of the issues to be  solved in the EU have international scope (notably  common criteria certification).  ENISA will follow the development of relevant  subjects at the international level in order to align  EU activities with those of other global players.  An example here is provided by the work that the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is  doing with CSIRTs, which needs to be aligned and  will create added value and harmonisation for all.  ENISA staff will attend international conferences  on an ‘as needed’ basis. For instance, the Meridian  Conference is the main CIIP conference of the  year and the FIRST conference plays the same role  for CERTs.  The Executive Director should attend  international conferences in order to enhance  the Agency’s visibility.

A.1.1 OVERVIEW OF THE PAST AND  CURRENT SITUATION  The work programme for 2018 follows the COM  guidelines  C(2014) 9641 final from 16.12.2014 and  MB decisions. It is structured following the objectives  and the priorities of the Agency as described in the  new ENISA strategy.  Regarding ENISA’s budget, the variation between  the years 2015 and 2016 is neutral. The budget  remained with the same amount aligned with  COM communications.  In 2017, however, a slight increase in Title II was  adopted. In 2018, the budget of Title III will be optimised  in order to increase the budget in operations.  Regarding ENISA’s establishment plan, it is noted that  ENISA will lose one post in 2018. This will have a direct  impact on the capacity of the Agency to deliver and  will reduce outputs.  From 2015 until 2018, some reorganisations were  carried out in order to maximise the efficiency,  effectiveness and use of the posts attributed  to the Agency.  The human and financial resources in respect of  the past and current situation are presented in the  annexes to this report.  A.1.2 RESOURCE PROGRAMMING  FOR THE YEARS 2018–2020  The distribution of the budget and resources for 2018  for the activities A1 to A5 is presented in the charts  at the end of this section. The budget and resources  for each activity are presented in Annex A.1.3. The  budget and posts distribution is based on the activity- based budgeting (ABB) methodology of the Agency  detailed in Annex A.1.3.  Following the publication of the NIS directive the  Agency is reallocating budget and resources to the  new tasks/activities envisaged for the Agency in the  directive. Another area which will probably require  more budget/resources is the Cyber Security Public– Private partnership (cPPP). However, the impact on the  ENISA work programme has not yet been quantified.  This will be updated in future versions as will any other  relevant changes in ENISA's scope and tasks.  The Stakeholders Relations and Administration  Department has already optimised all its resources.  Improvements to achieve gains in effectiveness and  ANNEX 1 RESOURCE ALLOCATION PER  ACTIVITY 2018–2020  53  A  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2018–2020 5554  ANNEX Resource allocation per activity 2018–2020  efficiency have been developed. ENISA performs  an internal check of relevance and optimisation  of workflows, procedures and rules, to seek  optimisation and efficiency. As an example the so- called ‘Paperless’, (electronic workflow IT tool) which  routes documents to staff involved in preparation,  review and approval of all kinds of documents and  transactions, represents a huge improvement and  cost savings in all processes of the Agency.  Moreover, the Stakeholders Relations and  Administration Department applies a strict policy  on the ratio between administrative support and  coordination staff and operational staff, according to  the methodology set by the European Commission  and the benchmarking exercise within the institutions  and EU agencies. In December 2016 only 19.04  % of staff occupied administrative support and  coordination functions, although the Commission  benchmark allows for a level of up to 25 %.  Job type 2016 2015  Total administrative support  and coordination 19.04 % 20.22 %  Administrative support 15.47 % 16.85 %  Coordination 3.57 % 3.37 %  Total operational 66.66 % 66.29 %  Top operational coordination 7.14 % 8.99 %  General operational 59.52 % 57.30 %  Total neutral 14.29 % 13.48 %  Finance and control 14.29 % 13.48 %  In addition, this version of the work programme takes  account of the prioritisation exercise carried out  during the consultation with the MB. Certain activities  had to be removed from the work programme as  there are not enough resources for the year 2018.  Such de-prioritising activities include:  activities to support a DSM for high-quality NIS  products and services;  support for the assessment of existing policies/ procedures/practices on NIS within EU  institutions;  planning and organisation of EuroSOPEx 2018.  For the years 2019-2020, the Agency will gradually  increase the share of Activity 2, Policy, if more  resources become available.  A.1.3 OVERVIEW OF ACTIVITIES’ BUDGET  AND RESOURCES  The budget and posts distribution is based on the  ABB methodology of the Agency, which is line with  the activity-based management (ABM) principle.  ABB focuses on integrated budgeting and financial  management, based on activities linked to the  Agency’s priorities and objectives.  To enable better estimation of resources needed for  each ENISA activity, the budget forecast should be  split into direct and indirect budget. The following  assumptions are used in the simplified ABB  methodology:  Direct budget is the cost estimate of each  operational activity (listed in Activities A1 to A5) in  terms of goods and services procured.  Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries,  mission costs and overhead costs, attributable  to each operational or compliance activity. The  indirect budget is redistributed against direct  budget in all activities.  Compliance posts from Activity A5 Enabling are  redistributed to Core Activities — A1 to A4, and  operational posts of the Activity A5.  Total ABB posts (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts  from all activities (A1 to A5) after the redistribution.  The table below presents the allocation of financial  and human resources to activities of the Agency  based on the abovementioned ABB methodology.

In 2016 ENISA demonstrated a commitment rate of  98.47 %, of C1 appropriation of the year at the year- end (31.12), and the non-automatic carry-over of the  remaining 1.53 % for a project to be contracted in  2017 and to be implemented in 2017 for the office  refurbishment in Athens. The non-automatic carry- over added to the committed appropriations at  year-end show that the appropriations of the year  2016 will be used at 100 % rate, which shows the  capacity of the Agency to fully implement its annual  appropriations. The same commitment rate achieved  in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 is  maintained for a seventh year in a row. The payment  rate reached 89.18 % (92.89 % in 2015) and the  amount carried forward to 2017 was EUR 968 198.32,  representing 9.29 % of total C1 appropriations 2016  (up from 7.11 % in 2015).  Cancellation of payment appropriations for the year No payment appropriations were cancelled.  Cancellation of payment appropriations carried over Fund source ‘C8’ — appropriations carried over  automatically from 2015 to 2016.  The appropriations of 2015 carried over to 2016  were utilised at a rate of 94.28 % (automatic  and non-automatic carry-overs) which indicates  a satisfactory capability of estimation of needs. From  the amount of EUR 674 520.54 carried forward, only  the amount of EUR 38 615.93 was cancelled, due  to the fact that the estimated expenditure deviated  from the actual paid amount.

ENISA is implementing actions including:  launching numerous calls and exploring effective  reserve lists;  enhanced visibility of career opportunities via  revamped job vacancy templates, targeted  dissemination of vacancies through traditional  routes across Member States and proactive use of  social media;  increased quality of recruitment documents with  new FAQs for candidates, new guidelines for  Selection Boards and new and simpler financial  rules for the reimbursement of candidates;  the acquisition in 2018 of a modern e-recruitment  tool;  development of modern competency-based  interview questions;  optimisation of internal procedures bringing  efficiency in delivering services and projecting  ENISA’s image in the European Job Market.  The job family and job category framework is being  consolidated in line with the Annex I of the SR:  Assistant Job Family:  Assistant Job Category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities such as  assistance and/or secretariat requiring a certain  degree of autonomy): typically, these posts are  filled by grades SC1-SC2, AST1-AST3, FGI, FGII  Technical Assistant Job Category (staff providing  support with a medium degree of autonomy in  the drafting of documents and assistance in the  implementation of policies/projects/procedures/ processes): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AST4-AST7, FG III  Senior Assistant Job Category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities requiring high  degree of autonomy and carrying out significant  responsibilities in terms of staff management,  budget implementation or coordination):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AST7- AST11 and only for the two Assistants to Head of  Departments by FG IV  Operational Job Family:  Junior Officer/Administrator Job Category (staff  providing junior expertise in a specific field of  knowledge): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AD5, FG IV 13  Officer/Administrator Job Category (staff providing  officer expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD6-AD7,  FG IV 14-18  Lead Officer/Administrator (staff providing top  level expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD8-AD9  Team Leader Job Category (staff providing  operational excellence with some managerial  responsibilities): typically, these posts are filed by  grades AD7-AD9, FG IV 14-18  Managerial Job Family:  Middle Manager Job Category (staff providing  operational vision and managerial expertise  including financial management): typically, these  posts are Head of Unit positions filled by grades  AD9-AD12  Senior Manager Job Category (staff providing  strategical vision and managerial expertise  including financial expertise): typically, these posts  are Head of Department position (filled by grades  AD11-AD13)  Executive Director (filled by grades AD14-15)  Following the 2014 SR reform, ENISA adopted and  is applying the new implementing rules on the  engagement and use of Temporary Staff for Agencies  (TA 2f), thus ensuring a more consistent staff policy  and allowing inter-mobility between EU agencies.  ANNEX 4 HUMAN RESOURCES —  QUALITATIVE  OF – Officials  6564  ANNEX Human resources — qualitative  Concerning the duration of employment, Temporary  Agents and Contract Agents are offered typically  long term contract of three years, renewable for  another limited period of 5 years. These contracts  are converted into contracts of indefinite period  if a second renewal is offered and accepted. All  contracts renewals are subject to an assessment of  the performance of the staff member and depend  on budget availability and the business needs for the  function occupied as stipulated in the ED Decision  38/2017 of 6 June 2017 concerning employment  contract renewal. In addition, ENISA is activating  short-term contract agents (2 years, renewable once  for a maximum 1 year) to be allocated depending  on business needs or any other human resources  constraints (such as long-term sick leave or part time,  etc.). This engagement of staff allows the Agency to  keep an adequate degree of flexibility and adapt the  workforce based in the business needs.  Non-statutory staff  ENISA welcomes Seconded National Experts (SNEs) as  an opportunity to foster the exchange of experience  and knowledge of the Agency working methods and to  widen the expertise network. Experts can be seconded  to ENISA for the duration of a minimum 6 months to  a maximum of 4 years. ENISA offers paid traineeship  opportunities to talented, highly qualified young  professionals at the start of their careers, in a field of  their choice. Trainees have the opportunity to immerse  themselves in the Agency’s work and in the European  system in general. The traineeship may last from  a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 12 months.  Finally, in compliance with both the EU legal  framework and Greek labour legislation,  ENISA’s policy is intended to rely on interim services  under specific circumstances and for a limited period  of time. The Agency holds a framework contract  which has been awarded to a temping agency.  A.4.2 APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE AND  RECLASSIFICATION/PROMOTIONS  ENISA has adopted the Implementing rules: MB  2016/10 on Reclassification of CA’s, MB 2016/11 on  Reclassification of TA’s.  For the forthcoming years, the organisation will strive  to see performance management as a business  process that improves employee engagement and  drives business results. It will enable staff to focus on  having a constructive dialogue with the manager and  to consider the exercise as a valuable developmental  tool, while clarifying that appraisal and promotion are  two different exercises.

A.4.3. MOBILITY POLICY  All internal moves are processed via Article 7 of the  Staff Regulations and for transparency purposes  are published internally on INTRAENISA. In order to  create a motivated and versatile workforce, ENISA has  adopted an ED Policy 01/2017 of 22 February 2017 on  Internal Mobility Policy. ENISA also joined the inter- agency job market (IAJM) with the view, as for all other  agencies, to offer possibilities of mobility to staff in  Agencies by assuring a continuation of careers and  grades. In 2016, 1 staff member moved via the IAJM.  Additionally, ENISA is also opened to mobility  between the Agencies and the EU Institutions. In 2016  no mobility was organised and in 2017 one mobility  was organised.  A.4.4. LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT  In order to make the most out of its internal  expertise and to develop mechanisms to retain  staff, the organisation is focusing on developing  an ENISA’s learning and development framework  2017-2020. The objective is to ensure the efficient  delivery of learning interventions, the compliance  with mandatory training (e.g. Ethics and Integrity) and  to support the acquisition of specific and strategic  knowledge.  A.4.5. GENDER AND GEOGRAPHICAL  BALANCE  Total number of Staff as of 31/12/2016: 69 (43 TA’s: 28  AD’s + 15 AST’s + 25 CA’s + 1 SNE).  The overall gender balance among ENISA staff shows  a male prevalence which is understandable given  the scope of the Agency’s work. As a measure to  promote equal opportunities, the terms of published  vacancy notices prevent any kind of discrimination  and the Selection Board’s composition is balanced in  term of gender and nationality as far as possible. For  instance, in 2016 the Management Team welcomed  a French female manager as Head of HR and ENISA  will pursuit this objective.  With regard to the geographical balance, while there  is no quota system in operation, the Staff Regulations  require when recruiting to strive for a broad balance  among nationalities and to adopt measures if there  is imbalance between nationalities among staff.  ENISA is paying great attention to this requirement as  reflected by the latest recruitments.

SCHOOLING  A European School is located in Heraklion and is used  by ENISA staff (for the school year 2016-2017, only  4 pupils attend nursery/primary school and 2 pupils  attend Secondary school).  The rest of ENISA pupils attend various schools in  Athens based on service level agreement concluded  with a number of international schools (for the  school year 2016-2017, 20 pupils attend nursery  school, 20 pupils attend kindergarten school and 18  pupils attend primary and secondary school). ENISA  considers schooling as an essential part of its Staff  Policy and thus, contribute to the expenses of school  care for the children.  42 %  4 %  54 %  Per Category  Contractual Agent  Seconded National Expert  Temporary Agent  35%  19 %  42 %  4 %  TA/AD  TA/AST  CA  SNESs  ENISA is currently negotiating a reduction in space  rented in Heraklion and an increase in the space  rented in Athens.

ANNEX 5 BUILDINGS  7170  ANNEX 6 PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES  Internal monitoring system MATRIX has been put in  place at ENISA and is used for project management by  ENISA staff. Regular progress reports are presented  at the meetings of the ENISA management team and  reviewed at the midterm review meetings.  Also, external consultant has been contracted to  carry annual ex post evaluation of core operational  activities. The scope of the evaluation focusses  on ENISA’s core operational activities, with an  estimated expenditure above 30.000 EUR. The overall  objective of the annual evaluations is to evaluate  the effectiveness, efficiency, added value, utility,  coordination and coherence.  The following table summarises the findings  per evaluation criteria and outlines actions  ENISA’s management considered as important.  The evaluation of 2014 core operational activities  is largely positive and the actions mainly relate to  a continuation of the work carried out.  Overall, the evaluation of activities foreseen in  the 2014 work programme concludes that ENISA  effectively cooperates and engages with its main  stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate. The  support provided by ENISA is seen as a complement  to that of other public interventions, and no adverse  effects were identified.  There is a clear pattern in terms of progress, where  targets under ENISA’s control (such a high-quality,  community building, good practice dissemination)  are largely achieved. The scope and objectives of  ENISA’s work is seen as relevant to respond to the  needs, but at the same time stakeholders see limits in  ENISA’s mandate and outreach. In particular, private  stakeholders and industry appear to strive towards  a more operational role for ENISA, going beyond  the advisory and facilitating mandate of the Agency,  in order to effectively achieve the overall objectives  of Network Information Security (NIS) and cyber  security.  Also, the findings and conclusions from the external  evaluation of ENISA’s core operational activities  in 2015 confirm that ENISA generally functions  efficiently; it is characterised by a clear delineation  of responsibilities and has cost-saving measures in  place, but one case of low efficiency was identified,  namely the insufficient dissemination of publications.  It was concluded that ENISA significantly enhanced  cooperation both between Member States of the  EU and between related NIS stakeholders in 2015  by bringing people from different operational  communities around the table to share information,  ideas and common areas of interest at an operational  level. ENISA thereby contributed to a great extent to  enhancing community building in Europe and beyond  and improved services, workflow and communication  among stakeholders to respond to crises. Moreover,  the ex post evaluation concluded that ENISA’s support  to cooperation between stakeholders complemented  other public interventions, clearly pointing to a role  for ENISA in this regard.  The reports of annual ex post evaluations have been  published on ENISA website https://www.enisa. europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of- enisa-activities  ANNEX 7 EVALUATIONS  Agency privileges Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities/  diplomatic status  Education /day care  In accordance with Article  23 of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 of the European  Parliament and of the Council  of 21 May 2013, the protocol  No 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the European  Union annexed to the TEU  and the TFEU applies to the  Agency and its staff.  In accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 21 May 2013, the protocol No 7 on the  privileges and immunities of the European Union  annexed to the TEU and the TFEU applies to the  Agency and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a Seat  Agreement in April 2005, which was ratified by Greek  Law 3572/2007 and is applicable to ENISA and its staff.  A public School of  European Education, Type  2, was founded in 2005  by the Greek government  in Heraklion — Crete for  the children of the staff of  ENISA.  There is no European  School operating in Athens.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of-enisa-activities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of-enisa-activities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/annual-ex-post-evaluation-of-enisa-activities  7372  Criteria Summary findings Possible actions  Relevance Based on the findings, it can be concluded that ENISA clearly responds  to a need in the European NIS landscape. The scope and objectives of  ENISA’s work are seen as relevant to respond to the needs, but at the  same time stakeholders see limits to ENISA’s mandate and outreach,  which affects the ability of the Agency to effectively meet the needs.  Continue to explore ways  to ensure ENISA’s work is  addressing real needs in  NIS in the EU. Map/assess gaps in current  NIS landscape, to feed  into discussions on future  mandate. It may be important in the  future to focus on activities  where there is a strong  demand from the NIS  communities to ensure  that ENISA’s deliverables  achieve a real impact.  Impact It appears that, despite ENISA’s limited mandate and also fairly small  resources, the Agency manages to make a real contribution towards  increased NIS in Europe, as perceived by key stakeholders.  N/A   Effectiveness  — KIIs and  downloads  All KIIs were achieved. The evaluation can conclude that some of  ENISA’s deliverables have generated a high number of downloads in  a short period of time (most reports were made available in Q1 2015  and thus downloads had only been available for a few months at the  time of writing).  Introduce more ambitious  KIIS which enable a tracking  of performance.  Effectiveness  — EU policy  The evaluation findings show that the work conducted under work  stream 1 has been successful in achieving most objectives. In  particular, the work undertaken to identify evolving threats, risks and  challenges, and the contribution to EU policy initiatives appear to have  achieved the intended results. For the work done in supporting the EU  in education, research and standardisation, results were more mixed,  in particular regarding the link to actual operational issues such as data  protection and secure services. These aspects are evidently not under  the direct control of ENISA but of national regulators and operators,  hence the need for further efforts in coordination and cooperation.  Continue efforts to build  relations with senior  decisions makers at  Member State and EU level  (public and private).  Effectiveness  — Capacity  building  ENISA’s work to develop capacity in Member States (to coordinate  and cooperate during crises, and the support to develop capacities  and strategies at Member State level) as part of work stream two has  been successful in achieving the objectives set out. The contribution to  private sector capacities looks more uncertain, based on the responses  from the stakeholder survey.  Continue to engage with  the private sector to  improve and increase  outreach.  Effectiveness  — Support  cooperation  Findings show that the work stream 3 has largely achieved the  objectives set, with stakeholders assessing a clear contribution of  ENISA to putting in place effective measures to cope with cyber  crises and incidents. In particular, ENISA’s support was considered  valuable to improve workflow and cooperation among involved  stakeholders. That said, as the CE2014 case study concludes, there is  still a long road ahead before an EU-level crisis management process  is put in place in the cybersecurity area, with a lack of trust among  stakeholders, weaknesses and differences in national capabilities,  weak communication structures, insufficient exchanges of information  in ‘real life’ etc., representing hurdles that need to be surmounted over  the medium to long term.  Continue trust building  and cooperation activities  as a means to overcome  barriers to cooperation  during crisis.  Efficiency The operational budget of ENISA is limited, and the main expenditure  relates to staff costs. In the light of the resources available (staff and  expenditures), ENISA manages to produce quite a high number of  deliverables which also have generated considerable outreach in terms  of downloads. No indication of low efficiency was identified in the  evaluation period, though specific cost saving measures could not be  established.  N/A   Coordination  and  coherence  Overall, it can be concluded that ENISA effectively cooperates and  engages with its main stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate. The  support provided by ENISA is seen as a complement to that of other  public interventions, and no adverse effects were identified.

The purpose of key indicators for ENISA is to provide  the metrics to measure against performance, results  and impact of the Agency’s outcome, output and  impact. Key indicators seek to better support policy  dynamics on network and information security,  an area of policy that largely still remains under  development at the EU level, as technology and  business models evolve.  The chosen approach initially sets the designated  levels of key indicators; each type of indicator  is grouped alongside other similar ones at the  appropriate level. This approach has been developed  taking into account the capability of the Agency to  report, and the need to avoid any unnecessary burden  on the Agency. The Agency’s capability to report  reflects effort and organisational measures as well as  tools available or that can be obtained relatively easily.  Measuring operational performance that concerns  the policy raison d’être of the Agency remains the  focal point for the key indicators introduced. The key  notions and main vectors of annual and multiannual  measurements are presented hereunder:  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:  Performance that is a concern at the output level  when deliverables are produced. Metrics used, are  project management-based and they include:  •  Adherence to the scope of the deliverable or project  •  Budget (or financial resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin  •  People (or human resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin  •  Time available to carry out the output or project  remaining within prescribed levels with a ± 5 %  margin  •  Quality of performance depending on the type of  output, according to the classification of output  in the work programme (being, publication,  event, support).  Results that are a concern at the annual and at  multiannual activities’ level. The indicators used  are as follows:  •  Delivery indicator aiming at delivery of at least  95 % against work programme planning. This  is equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma) organisation  (reaching between 93.3 % and 99.3 %); clearly  the Agency has historically proven its operational  ability to deliver at much higher level, meeting 6σ  (6 Sigma) specification requirements (at 99.99 %).  However allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  above-mentioned deviation rate of ± 5 %29. The  criteria used, being scope, budget, people, time  and quality, they all refer to the proper execution  of the project leading up to the production of  output. This evaluation is done at the end of the  project within ENISA.  •  Following the production process that leads  up to an output, feedback from stakeholders  is collected on each output. Results are further  aggregated on a multiannual basis by the  Agency.  29 In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance  between the mean value and the inflexion point. Shortening this  distance is an indicator of enhanced quality of performance.  While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of  the current version of the QMS of the Agency portions thereof,  are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the  reference Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) hereto is the  SOP PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) that is a simplified version of  the DMAIC (define-measure-analyse-improve-control) approach  typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice for simplicity is  obviously desirable while the implementation of a quality system  is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses on process control for  the purpose of reducing or eliminating waste. Six Sigma utilises  historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and  improve a company’s operational performance e.g. processes,  practices, and support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of  process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard  deviations from the mean.  Impact is measured at the Agency level only;  it is based on feedback received from the  evaluation of the Agency’s performance (own  initiatives and commissioned consulting at the  Agency’s initiative) and/or institutional third party  evaluations such as those commissioned by the  European Commission, the European Court of  Auditors, etc.  The key indicators broken down at the output level,  the activities level and the Agency level, are presented  on the following page.  All rating indicators follow a variable Traffic Light  Rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows:  Green, that reflects 5 % deviation meaning that  the planning /performance are appropriate and  within prescribed levels.  Yellow, that reflects 20 % deviation meaning that  the planning /performance need to be revisited.  Red, which reflects deviation above 20 % meaning  that the planning /performance need thorough  review.  Feedback is collected by means of surveys. It is  envisaged that the deliverables part of the website  will be leveraged to channel targeted feedback  against each deliverable downloaded. This is a task  however that will be made available as from 2018, at  the earliest.

ENISA works with these groups to develop advice and  recommendations on good practice in information security. It assists EU Member States in  implementing relevant EU legislation and works to improve the resilience of Europe’s critical  information infrastructure and networks. ENISA seeks to enhance existing expertise in EU  Member States by supporting the development of cross-border communities committed  to improving network and information security throughout the EU.

In 2011, ENISA started to collaborate with Europol and the first joint workshop was held in Prague  that year. The next years the annual ENISA workshop was split in two parts, one part aimed only at  n/g CERTs that had a more technical focus and one part aimed at both n/g CERTs and law  enforcement representatives, organised together with Europol. The topic of the latter meetings  were on cooperation in the fight against cybercrime.  This year too, the first part of the workshop focused on hands-on technical training for n/g CERTs in  Europe.  Doing so, ENISA enhances CERTs capabilities in the EU Member States by provision of good  operational practice and the facilitation of suitable training and exercises. Hands-on training for  CERT team members on operational topics is essential to improve the capabilities of the team as a  whole.  Part II of the workshop, the ENISA/EC3 workshop, served as a foreseen follow up event of the  workshop held last year together with Europol. It kept the same focus on cooperation between n/g  CERTs in Europe and their national law enforcement counterparts. The topic this year was  (automated) information sharing.  In both events 106 participants were gathered. Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,  Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom were the 24 EU  Member States that were represented as well as Norway and Switzerland. The following  organisations were also represented: CEPOL, ECB, ENISA, European Commission (DG Home), Council  of Europe, CERT EU and Europol (EC3).  Both events were well received. According to the feedback from the participants given in the  evaluation forms, they scored the meeting of their expectations of these workshops on average 4.4  out of 5.  This document serves as a means to report on the purpose of these two meetings and is not meant  to serve as a set of  detailed minutes, especially as a large part of these workshops was focused on  trainings as well as invitation-only information sharing through the Traffic Light Protocol - TLP RED.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 Introduction 1  2 Methodology 3  3 8th Workshop Part I – Technical Hands-on Training – 21-22.05.2013 5  4 8th Workshop Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop – 02-03.10.2013 8  5 Evaluation and lessons learnt 11  6 Action points 13  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  1  1 Introduction  ENISA’s traditional workshop “CERTs in Europe” has been organised every year since 2005 for the  national/governmental (n/g) CERTs in Europe and is one of the most efficient and indispensable  methods for ENISA for supporting the teams in their daily work and improving their capabilities.  Back in 2011 ENISA started to collaborate with Europol on this topic.  The first joint workshop was  held in Prague that year and had a focus on CERT cooperation with law enforcement. The need to  continue with meetings on this topic was identified during this first meeting.  In addition, the ENISA study on CERT Operational Gaps and Overlaps1 from 2011 pointed out that  training and education is considered most important by the majority of the CERTs, indicating the  insufficient amount of training opportunities for the CERTs currently within the community.  ENISA already partially fills this void by supporting TRANSITS trainings and also by facilitating the  pan-European incident response exercises which are aimed at the different CERTs, amongst others,  because of their role in CIIP2. These exercises are of strategic importance in enhancing the security  and resilience of the CII sector, in particular by focusing on flexible strategies and processes for  dealing with the unpredictability of potential cyber-attacks.  ENISA also currently investigates how further technical training could be organised for the  operational security specialists (CERTs) and ENISA’s role in this process. By providing this particular  training to members of n/g CERTs, ENISA continues to support the CERT community.  This is the reasoning behind the decision to split the annual ENISA workshop in two parts since 2012,  one part aimed only at n/g CERTs and had a more technical focus and the second part aimed at n/g  CERTs and law enforcement representatives, organised together with Europol.  This year too, the first part of the workshop focused on hands-on technical training for n/g CERTs in  Europe.  Doing so, ENISA enhanced CERTs capabilities in the EU MS by provision of good operational  practice and the facilitation of suitable training and exercises. Hands-on training for CERT team  members on operational topics is essential to improve the capabilities of the team as a whole.  Part II of the workshop, the ENISA/EC3 workshop, served as a foreseen follow up event to the  workshop held last year together with Europol. It kept the same focus on cooperation between n/g  CERTs in Europe and their national Law Enforcement counterparts. The topic this year was on  (automated) information sharing.

This was also one of the recommendations in  another ENISA study on Cooperation between CERTs and Law Enforcement Agencies in the fight  against cybercrime - A first collection of practices3 from 2011.  The recommendation made in this  report was that “cooperation between conference and meeting organisers should be encouraged  and meetings should be coordinated as much as possible, to reduce travel and time costs to the  minimum”.  The TF-CSIRT meetings regularly gather a large number of experts from the CERT operational  community in Europe. With this in mind, ENISA addressed RoEduNet, the national research and  education network in Romania, and the host of the 39th TF-CSIRT meeting in order to discuss  opportunities regarding a suitable venue for this workshop.  Cooperation with the RoEduNet was  fruitful and they agreed to host this workshop in the hotel Radisson Blu in Bucharest.  Based on ENISA CERT exercise material and Tean Cymrus4 training portfolio, a two day training  agenda was created including for the first time ENISA trainers presenting a part of the ENISA CERT  Exercises5.  The agenda covered two full days of in depth technical training.  ENISA’s CERT-relations team  worked together with Team Cymru, a not-for-profit Internet security firm that is well known in the  CERT community, to deliver a high reputable training for the n/g CERTs representatives. The sessions  provided in-depth technical diving into several current security topics including botnets and reverse  engineering. Team Cymru Research NFP is an Illinois non-profit and a US Federal 501(c)3  organization.  They are a group of technologists dedicated to making the Internet more secure.  They  work closely with and within Internet security communities, as well as with all kinds of other  organisations – recognising the fact that almost every organization in the modern world is connected  to the Internet in some way or another, and they all need help to ensure that their parts of the  network remain safe and secure. Team Cymru supports the global CERT community on regular basis.  The two experienced trainers from Team Cymru, Cecil Goldstein6 and Kevin Henry, ensured that all  participants receive well prepared and accurate content and training.  ENISA/EC3 Workshop hosted by Europol  The ENISA/Europol event was hosted by Europol in 2012.  As most of the participants seemed to find  this venue very suitable for these type of meetings and as the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  was established in January of 2013 Europol offered to host this meeting for a second time.  The structure of this meeting changed in comparison to the meeting last year. It was decided to have  in the first part keynotes from both ENISA and EC3 as well as presentations by ACDC7, DG Home8 and  the Dutch NCSC9.  3  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/supporting-fight-against-cybercrime  4  http://www.team-cymru.org/  5  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  6  http://au.linkedin.com/pub/cecil-goldstein/6/24a/b57  7  http://www.botfree.eu/  8  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/  9  https://www.ncsc.nl/  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/supporting-fight-against-cybercrime http://www.team-cymru.org/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise http://au.linkedin.com/pub/cecil-goldstein/6/24a/b57  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  4  In the second part of this meeting trainings were provided by ENISA trainers.  The training used new  material10 produced in 2013. It was considered valuable to have this training, also to initiate the  discussion and to look at the training material with both the prespective from CERTs and law  enforcement.  The third part of this meeting was organised as a round table discussion under Traffic Light Protocol  11(TLP) Code Red. Among the topics discussed were issues, cases and (good) practices on  cooperation between CERTs and law enforcement.  Further details are provided below.  10  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  11  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling- process/information-disclosure  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  5  3 8th Workshop Part I – Technical Hands-on Training – 21-22.05.2013  ENISA CERT Workshop part I was in many aspects unique.  It was the first time that ENISA CERT  training was delivered to the European CERT community by ENISA. The topics were chosen in a way  that best suited most of the participants and based on the feedback of the community12. The  workshop was carried out in two parallel tracks, one track focused on honeypots, while the other  group received trained in the area of SCADA security and mobile malware.  ENISA CERT training scenario 13: Incident handling during an attack on  Critical Information Infrastructure13  In this exercise, more than 20 participants were able to familiarise themselves with specifics on how  to conduct incident handling during an attack against Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  systems.  The training contained a role-playing part, with the  ENISA trainer acting as “operator”. Additionally the  exercise had technical features that required examining  network and log information.  During the course of the exercise, a broad range of  indicators of compromise and material for  investigation  was presented. This enabled the participants to develop  different approaches and paths from the start to the end  to make the story more realistic.  In the beginning ENISA presented a general introduction  to the basics of industrial control systems, that enabled  the participants to develop a general technical  understanding of SCADA/CII environments and get more  familiar with how to handle the organisational obstacles  met in typical industrial units.  The presentation was followed by a technical case study  where ENISA presented evidence in a Virtual Image to  build up a case in order for participants to have hands-on experience. The time allocated for the  hands-on part was limited and proved to be the bottleneck of the exercise as participants noted on  the feedback sheets that there should have been more time allocated to the exercise.  This is a  learning point for future exercises of this type.  12  ENISA asked the n/g CERT community about their preferences prior to the training.  13  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  6  ENISA CERT training scenario 16: Mobile threats incident handling14  The aim of this training session was to bring into  this workshop a “flavour” of mobile devices and  their specifications. This part of the workshop was  mostly hands-on and focused on a known malware  related to Zeus that was placed inside an emulated  Android phone. The malware (Zitmo) was created  to intercept SMS messages containing transaction  authentication numbers (TAN) and forward them  to a server controlled by the attackers. During the  investigation participants could clearly see the  malicious transaction that application initiated.  There was additionally a reverse engineering part  where participants used different tools to rebuild  Android application source code as close to  original code as possible.  Apart from the technical challenge, this training  covered also legal challenges impacting the ability  to handle incidents, acquire and analyse data.  Especially in combination with “Bring Your Own  Device” (BYOD) or the usage of company owned  devices for private purposes that might impact the  ability to handle incidents.  Some participants gave very good feedback to this  exercise, but a general remark was the limited  time allocated to the hands on part and that the  tutor progressed too quickly as a result of this.  ENISA CERT training scenario 23: Honeypots15  Honeypots provide for a proactive approach in detecting security  incidents before they happen without any impact on the production  environment.  The objective of the training was to familiarise students with two  kinds of honeypots: client-side and server-side honeypots.  In the first part of the training a couple of scenarios related to the  client-side honeypots posing as vulnerable browsers trying to visit  compromised websites URL which had different behaviours  depending on the browser. The attendees had to analyse the output  of the honeypot and find which browser version was targeted by the  webpage.  In the second part other scenarios related to server-side honeypots  14  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  15  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  7  were presented. In this case the honeypots behaved like vulnerable servers which were attacked and  compromised. Again the attendees had to analyse the events and identify the type of attacks, attack  vectors and source of the attacks.  A day in the life of malware-example  On the second day Team Cymru  focused on understanding the  operations and nature of malware by  following the life cycle of a piece of  malware from compromising a target  machine and creation of a botnet, to  the observation and identification of  malware, its capture, extraction and  subsequent analysis. In the analysis  phase emphasis was given on how to  understand if the analysis can  provide clues and information to  assist tracking the botnet.  Participants were heavily engaged in  the identification of the botnet  through network based analysis,  followed by extraction and analysis of malware using both static and dynamic processes. The  exercises were conducted on virtual machines.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  8  4 8th Workshop Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop – 02-03.10.2013  This workshop followed up on last year’s event and was held in the Europol premises on 2nd and 3rd  of October in The Hague, The Netherlands.  As already mentioned, the structure of this meeting changed this year compared to the meeting last  year.  This year it was decided to have in the first part keynotes from both ENISA and EC3 as well as  presentations by the ACDC project, DG Home and the Dutch NCSC. These presentations and  keynotes served as a “warm-up” exercise for the participants and to identify some upcoming  relevant regulations.  The second part of this meeting consisted of training sessions provided by ENISA trainers.  The  training used new training material  produced in 2013. It was considered valuable to have this  training also to initiate the discussion and to look at the training topics with both from the  prespectives from CERTs and from law enforcement. There were two separate training sessions,  namely:  - Presenting, correlating and filtering logs and various security feeds; and  - Identification and handling of electronic evidence.  A third part of this meeting consisted of a round table discussion under Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)  Red.  Keynotes  Both organising organisations, ENISA and Europol (EC3), gave a keynote.  For ENISA, Steve Purser, Head of the Core Operations Department talked about the EU Cyber  Security Strategy16 and the Proposal for an NIS Directive and the impact this Strategy and Directive  will have. He also mentioned the importance of meetings such as this ENISA/EC3 meeting.  Troels Oerting, Head of European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), talked about the importance of  collaboration and of the newly set up European Cybercrime Centre and its recent activities. He also  stressed the importance of cooperation and mentioned that EC3 is actively cooperating with for  example the Dutch NCSC.  Presentations  a) The European Commission (DG HOME, César Alonso Iriarte and Cathrin Bauer-Bulst) gave a  brief update on the legislative and practical framework for cooperation and information  exchange between the public and private sectors. César Alonso Iriarte reported on the  findings of his fellowship research on public-private cooperation, highlighting the need for  setting up arrangements allowing to overcome potential hurdles to the activities involved in  the partnership under each legal order, such as those deriving from rules on privacy,  classified information, liability and competition; incentives for both sides to participate; a  certain stability of the interaction; and, perhaps most importantly, a measure of trust  between the participants. Cathrin Bauer-Bulst spoke about the current rules on reporting  and legislative proposals in the pipeline that include reporting obligations, such as the  proposal for a Network and Information Security directive recently made by DG Connect.  She also gave an overview of a few coordination initiatives and of EU funding in this area.  16  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  9  b) Elly van den Heuvel, General Manager at the Dutch National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)  presented on the Dutch perspective. The NCSC is a government initiative and aims at  bringing several existing initiatives together. In general, secure networks are the  responsibility of various different parties in The Netherlands, and its NCSCs task to provide  links between these parties. From the organisational point of view the centre falls under the  responsibility of the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security of the Ministry  of Security and Justice.  Its foundations however are organised in a public-private  cooperation.  Elly van den Heuvel stressed the importance of cooperation and collaboration.  c) Wout de Natris and Thorsten Kraft on the Advanced Cyber Defence Centre (ACDC).  ACDC  aims to set up national support centres in Europe with the German botfrei.de17 initiative as  an example. The project consists of two parts.   The first basic idea is to clean up end user systems through an alert to the affected  end user system. This initiative would include the aid of a support centre and would  also involve a corresponding website and free disinfection tools which would be  provided through this website.   The second part of the project is about gathering, analysing and distributing data on  botnet generated traffic and abuse in and through a central database.  The ACDC project seeked for partners in the (mainly CERT) community.  Training sessions  One full morning was spent on a technical training given by ENISA trainers from the CERT relations  team.  The training used new training material produced in the year 2013, namely:  - Presenting, correlating and filtering logs and various security feeds; and  - Identification and handling of electronic evidence.  Presenting, correlating and filtering logs and various security feeds  In this training the participants learned through practical examples, how to correlate different logs  and several security feeds, in order to identify on-going attacks, investigate past attacks and  automate the incident handling process.  Identification and handling of electronic evidence  In this part the trainees were presented with the principles of evidence gathering. A common  knowledge of the requirements regarding evidence admissibility in a court of law was established.  The exercise also gave an overview of malware characteristics, methods of identification and tools  that may be used at the scene.  Round table discussion  The biggest part of this workshop was a round table discussion under TLP Code Red to discuss about  the current issues on cooperation between CERTs and LEA in Europe. The session was moderated by  ENISA. Due to the TLP Red status,it is not possible to summarise this debate in this report. However,  before the round table discussion started, Jaap van Oss, head of Focal Point Cyborg of the EC3, was  invited to present a proposal about the necessity to have new and innovative ways of conducting  investigations between law enforcement and non-law enforcement entities (e.g. CERTs). The  question at hand was if it would be possible to set up operations together with CERTs to take down  17  https://www.botfrei.de/  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  10  botnets. On the one hand, this encourages CERTs to help law enforcement and keep them up to date  and on the other, it provides law enforcement to benefit from the expertise of CERTs. EC3 offered to  facilitate and guide these ‘joint operations’. The question was if there is an interest in such  cooperation and if CERTs and law enforcement would be able to participate in the near future?  Additionally, which information and legislation is necessary for such cooperation and what would be  needed to combine/exchange information? The process would include the exchange of intelligences  packages and could have three different levels of escalating mitigation measures in mind.  From the discussion it became clear that for law enforcement and (most of the) CERTs represented  in the room there is a clear willingness for such cooperation. To actually organise a ‘joint operation’,  it is necessary to have proper coordination to overcome the legal and operational challenges.  Additionally it is necessary to create a framework to exchange information. This will take time and  will not be perfect the first time, but is a system that needs to grow. The difficulty is that CERTs do  not have the same organisation or mandate in the different countries; these particularities must be  taken into account in such cooperation efforts. Nevertheless, the relationship between law  enforcement and CERTs needs to deepen.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  11  5 Evaluation and lessons learnt  Spread over both events 106 participants were representing  24 EU Member States as well as  Norway and Switzerland. Also CEPOL, ECB, ENISA, European Commission, Council of Europe, CERT EU  and Europol (EC3) had sent representatives.  The workshops were a great success. According to the feedback from the participants given in the  evaluation forms, they scored the meeting of their expectations of these workshops on average 4.4  out of 5.  With regards to the overall evaluation of the event ENISA is satisfied with the level of  active participation in the trainings.  Orally, ENISA received some very good feedback on the quality  of the training from the participants directly during the events.  Their satisfaction was also confirmed  in their evaluation with high scores of their expectations of the workshops.  8th Workshop Part I – Technical Hands-on Training  For Part I of the Workshop ENISA received overall a score of 4,41 out of 5, which is an excellent  result, especially taking into account that this was the first time that ENISA experts gave such  trainings! All participants who filled in the feedback gave very positive impression with regards to  the current and future workshops.  Some recommendations from participants for further improvement included the following thoughts:  a) open source tools should be more extensively used during training;  b) there should be more assurance that all participants can follow the content, there were  occasions where the tempo was too quick;  c) training should always be lifelike and as close to reality as possible;  d) interaction with participants should be more encouraged;  Team Cymru was also very pleased with the level of experience of the group.  According to the  trainer, Cecil Goldstein from Team Cymru, they were a good group to work with and for the most  part, more experienced than they had anticipated. It is always very hard to assess the level of  experience of the participants before the training.  That’s why we asked Team Cymru to be flexible in  0  0,5  1  1,5  2  2,5  3  3,5  4  4,5  5  Honeypots SCADA&Mobile Training  Team Cymru Training  Results per session - Part I  Results per session  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  12  this regard and to be able to adapt to a more experienced group.  However, a comment we heard a  lot, both orally but also written in the evaluation forms, is that people would prefer to have two  tracks with different level of difficulty.  This is certainly something we have to keep in mind for a next  training workshop.  8th Workshop Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  The total average score the participants gave for this workshop in the evaluation was 4.21 out of 5.  The presentations, keynotes and especially the round table discussion was found interesting by most  participants.  Regarding the trainings the opinions were more divided.  This was also the most prominent feedback  that was provided, namely that for the next workshop we should specify more precisely in our  invitations which kind of representatives we expect.  At this workshop there was a mix of more  technical and managerial people.  Most participants expressed their interest to participate in the follow up of this event and found the  venue very suitable for these kind of meetings.  3,4  3,6  3,8  4  4,2  4,4  4,6  Results per session - Part I  Results per session - Part I  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  13  6 Action points  There are no action points for Part I of the workshop. The following sessions hence only covers  action points from the ENISA/EC3 Workshop (Part II).  1. EC3, together with ENISA, will come up with a proposal of what exactly they request from  the CERTs with regards to the cooperation on the takedown of botnets. This would be sent to the  participants of the meeting, as well to the ENISA n/g CERTs mailing list to reach out to teams that  were not represented. The CERTs should from their part analyse if this proposal is possible and  provide feedback.  2. An analysis should be made of the target audience for these meetings. A clear goal and  agenda should be created to make sure the right people are attending. This analysis should be done  by the EC3 and ENISA when preparing for next years meeting.  3. The question was raised if training opportunities are useful in these CERT-LEA meetings? The  answer to this question heavily depends on the analysis of the target audience. This question should  be answered by ENISA and EC3when preparing for next years meeting.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  14  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  15  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  doi: 10.2824/30515  TP -04  -13 -183  -EN -N  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

In 2011, ENISA started to collaborate with Europol and the first joint workshop was held in Prague  that year. The next years the annual ENISA workshop was split in two parts, one part aimed only at  n/g CERTs that had a more technical focus and one part aimed at both n/g CERTs and law  enforcement representatives, organised together with Europol. The topic of the latter meetings  were on cooperation in the fight against cybercrime.  This year too, the first part of the workshop focused on hands-on technical training for n/g CERTs in  Europe.  Doing so, ENISA enhances CERTs capabilities in the EU Member States by provision of good  operational practice and the facilitation of suitable training and exercises. Hands-on training for  CERT team members on operational topics is essential to improve the capabilities of the team as a  whole.  Part II of the workshop, the ENISA/EC3 workshop, served as a foreseen follow up event of the  workshop held last year together with Europol. It kept the same focus on cooperation between n/g  CERTs in Europe and their national law enforcement counterparts. The topic this year was  (automated) information sharing.  In both events 106 participants were gathered. Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,  Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom were the 24 EU  Member States that were represented as well as Norway and Switzerland. The following  organisations were also represented: CEPOL, ECB, ENISA, European Commission (DG Home), Council  of Europe, CERT EU and Europol (EC3).  Both events were well received. According to the feedback from the participants given in the  evaluation forms, they scored the meeting of their expectations of these workshops on average 4.4  out of 5.  This document serves as a means to report on the purpose of these two meetings and is not meant  to serve as a set of  detailed minutes, especially as a large part of these workshops was focused on  trainings as well as invitation-only information sharing through the Traffic Light Protocol - TLP RED.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 Introduction 1  2 Methodology 3  3 8th Workshop Part I – Technical Hands-on Training – 21-22.05.2013 5  4 8th Workshop Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop – 02-03.10.2013 8  5 Evaluation and lessons learnt 11  6 Action points 13  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  1  1 Introduction  ENISA’s traditional workshop “CERTs in Europe” has been organised every year since 2005 for the  national/governmental (n/g) CERTs in Europe and is one of the most efficient and indispensable  methods for ENISA for supporting the teams in their daily work and improving their capabilities.  Back in 2011 ENISA started to collaborate with Europol on this topic.  The first joint workshop was  held in Prague that year and had a focus on CERT cooperation with law enforcement. The need to  continue with meetings on this topic was identified during this first meeting.  In addition, the ENISA study on CERT Operational Gaps and Overlaps1 from 2011 pointed out that  training and education is considered most important by the majority of the CERTs, indicating the  insufficient amount of training opportunities for the CERTs currently within the community.  ENISA already partially fills this void by supporting TRANSITS trainings and also by facilitating the  pan-European incident response exercises which are aimed at the different CERTs, amongst others,  because of their role in CIIP2. These exercises are of strategic importance in enhancing the security  and resilience of the CII sector, in particular by focusing on flexible strategies and processes for  dealing with the unpredictability of potential cyber-attacks.  ENISA also currently investigates how further technical training could be organised for the  operational security specialists (CERTs) and ENISA’s role in this process. By providing this particular  training to members of n/g CERTs, ENISA continues to support the CERT community.  This is the reasoning behind the decision to split the annual ENISA workshop in two parts since 2012,  one part aimed only at n/g CERTs and had a more technical focus and the second part aimed at n/g  CERTs and law enforcement representatives, organised together with Europol.  This year too, the first part of the workshop focused on hands-on technical training for n/g CERTs in  Europe.  Doing so, ENISA enhanced CERTs capabilities in the EU MS by provision of good operational  practice and the facilitation of suitable training and exercises. Hands-on training for CERT team  members on operational topics is essential to improve the capabilities of the team as a whole.  Part II of the workshop, the ENISA/EC3 workshop, served as a foreseen follow up event to the  workshop held last year together with Europol. It kept the same focus on cooperation between n/g  CERTs in Europe and their national Law Enforcement counterparts. The topic this year was on  (automated) information sharing.

This was also one of the recommendations in  another ENISA study on Cooperation between CERTs and Law Enforcement Agencies in the fight  against cybercrime - A first collection of practices3 from 2011.  The recommendation made in this  report was that “cooperation between conference and meeting organisers should be encouraged  and meetings should be coordinated as much as possible, to reduce travel and time costs to the  minimum”.  The TF-CSIRT meetings regularly gather a large number of experts from the CERT operational  community in Europe. With this in mind, ENISA addressed RoEduNet, the national research and  education network in Romania, and the host of the 39th TF-CSIRT meeting in order to discuss  opportunities regarding a suitable venue for this workshop.  Cooperation with the RoEduNet was  fruitful and they agreed to host this workshop in the hotel Radisson Blu in Bucharest.  Based on ENISA CERT exercise material and Tean Cymrus4 training portfolio, a two day training  agenda was created including for the first time ENISA trainers presenting a part of the ENISA CERT  Exercises5.  The agenda covered two full days of in depth technical training.  ENISA’s CERT-relations team  worked together with Team Cymru, a not-for-profit Internet security firm that is well known in the  CERT community, to deliver a high reputable training for the n/g CERTs representatives. The sessions  provided in-depth technical diving into several current security topics including botnets and reverse  engineering. Team Cymru Research NFP is an Illinois non-profit and a US Federal 501(c)3  organization.  They are a group of technologists dedicated to making the Internet more secure.  They  work closely with and within Internet security communities, as well as with all kinds of other  organisations – recognising the fact that almost every organization in the modern world is connected  to the Internet in some way or another, and they all need help to ensure that their parts of the  network remain safe and secure. Team Cymru supports the global CERT community on regular basis.  The two experienced trainers from Team Cymru, Cecil Goldstein6 and Kevin Henry, ensured that all  participants receive well prepared and accurate content and training.  ENISA/EC3 Workshop hosted by Europol  The ENISA/Europol event was hosted by Europol in 2012.  As most of the participants seemed to find  this venue very suitable for these type of meetings and as the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  was established in January of 2013 Europol offered to host this meeting for a second time.  The structure of this meeting changed in comparison to the meeting last year. It was decided to have  in the first part keynotes from both ENISA and EC3 as well as presentations by ACDC7, DG Home8 and  the Dutch NCSC9.  3  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/supporting-fight-against-cybercrime  4  http://www.team-cymru.org/  5  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  6  http://au.linkedin.com/pub/cecil-goldstein/6/24a/b57  7  http://www.botfree.eu/  8  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/  9  https://www.ncsc.nl/  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/supporting-fight-against-cybercrime http://www.team-cymru.org/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise http://au.linkedin.com/pub/cecil-goldstein/6/24a/b57  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  4  In the second part of this meeting trainings were provided by ENISA trainers.  The training used new  material10 produced in 2013. It was considered valuable to have this training, also to initiate the  discussion and to look at the training material with both the prespective from CERTs and law  enforcement.  The third part of this meeting was organised as a round table discussion under Traffic Light Protocol  11(TLP) Code Red. Among the topics discussed were issues, cases and (good) practices on  cooperation between CERTs and law enforcement.  Further details are provided below.  10  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  11  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling- process/information-disclosure  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  5  3 8th Workshop Part I – Technical Hands-on Training – 21-22.05.2013  ENISA CERT Workshop part I was in many aspects unique.  It was the first time that ENISA CERT  training was delivered to the European CERT community by ENISA. The topics were chosen in a way  that best suited most of the participants and based on the feedback of the community12. The  workshop was carried out in two parallel tracks, one track focused on honeypots, while the other  group received trained in the area of SCADA security and mobile malware.  ENISA CERT training scenario 13: Incident handling during an attack on  Critical Information Infrastructure13  In this exercise, more than 20 participants were able to familiarise themselves with specifics on how  to conduct incident handling during an attack against Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  systems.  The training contained a role-playing part, with the  ENISA trainer acting as “operator”. Additionally the  exercise had technical features that required examining  network and log information.  During the course of the exercise, a broad range of  indicators of compromise and material for  investigation  was presented. This enabled the participants to develop  different approaches and paths from the start to the end  to make the story more realistic.  In the beginning ENISA presented a general introduction  to the basics of industrial control systems, that enabled  the participants to develop a general technical  understanding of SCADA/CII environments and get more  familiar with how to handle the organisational obstacles  met in typical industrial units.  The presentation was followed by a technical case study  where ENISA presented evidence in a Virtual Image to  build up a case in order for participants to have hands-on experience. The time allocated for the  hands-on part was limited and proved to be the bottleneck of the exercise as participants noted on  the feedback sheets that there should have been more time allocated to the exercise.  This is a  learning point for future exercises of this type.  12  ENISA asked the n/g CERT community about their preferences prior to the training.  13  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  6  ENISA CERT training scenario 16: Mobile threats incident handling14  The aim of this training session was to bring into  this workshop a “flavour” of mobile devices and  their specifications. This part of the workshop was  mostly hands-on and focused on a known malware  related to Zeus that was placed inside an emulated  Android phone. The malware (Zitmo) was created  to intercept SMS messages containing transaction  authentication numbers (TAN) and forward them  to a server controlled by the attackers. During the  investigation participants could clearly see the  malicious transaction that application initiated.  There was additionally a reverse engineering part  where participants used different tools to rebuild  Android application source code as close to  original code as possible.  Apart from the technical challenge, this training  covered also legal challenges impacting the ability  to handle incidents, acquire and analyse data.  Especially in combination with “Bring Your Own  Device” (BYOD) or the usage of company owned  devices for private purposes that might impact the  ability to handle incidents.  Some participants gave very good feedback to this  exercise, but a general remark was the limited  time allocated to the hands on part and that the  tutor progressed too quickly as a result of this.  ENISA CERT training scenario 23: Honeypots15  Honeypots provide for a proactive approach in detecting security  incidents before they happen without any impact on the production  environment.  The objective of the training was to familiarise students with two  kinds of honeypots: client-side and server-side honeypots.  In the first part of the training a couple of scenarios related to the  client-side honeypots posing as vulnerable browsers trying to visit  compromised websites URL which had different behaviours  depending on the browser. The attendees had to analyse the output  of the honeypot and find which browser version was targeted by the  webpage.  In the second part other scenarios related to server-side honeypots  14  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  15  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  7  were presented. In this case the honeypots behaved like vulnerable servers which were attacked and  compromised. Again the attendees had to analyse the events and identify the type of attacks, attack  vectors and source of the attacks.  A day in the life of malware-example  On the second day Team Cymru  focused on understanding the  operations and nature of malware by  following the life cycle of a piece of  malware from compromising a target  machine and creation of a botnet, to  the observation and identification of  malware, its capture, extraction and  subsequent analysis. In the analysis  phase emphasis was given on how to  understand if the analysis can  provide clues and information to  assist tracking the botnet.  Participants were heavily engaged in  the identification of the botnet  through network based analysis,  followed by extraction and analysis of malware using both static and dynamic processes. The  exercises were conducted on virtual machines.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  8  4 8th Workshop Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop – 02-03.10.2013  This workshop followed up on last year’s event and was held in the Europol premises on 2nd and 3rd  of October in The Hague, The Netherlands.  As already mentioned, the structure of this meeting changed this year compared to the meeting last  year.  This year it was decided to have in the first part keynotes from both ENISA and EC3 as well as  presentations by the ACDC project, DG Home and the Dutch NCSC. These presentations and  keynotes served as a “warm-up” exercise for the participants and to identify some upcoming  relevant regulations.  The second part of this meeting consisted of training sessions provided by ENISA trainers.  The  training used new training material  produced in 2013. It was considered valuable to have this  training also to initiate the discussion and to look at the training topics with both from the  prespectives from CERTs and from law enforcement. There were two separate training sessions,  namely:  - Presenting, correlating and filtering logs and various security feeds; and  - Identification and handling of electronic evidence.  A third part of this meeting consisted of a round table discussion under Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)  Red.  Keynotes  Both organising organisations, ENISA and Europol (EC3), gave a keynote.  For ENISA, Steve Purser, Head of the Core Operations Department talked about the EU Cyber  Security Strategy16 and the Proposal for an NIS Directive and the impact this Strategy and Directive  will have. He also mentioned the importance of meetings such as this ENISA/EC3 meeting.  Troels Oerting, Head of European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), talked about the importance of  collaboration and of the newly set up European Cybercrime Centre and its recent activities. He also  stressed the importance of cooperation and mentioned that EC3 is actively cooperating with for  example the Dutch NCSC.  Presentations  a) The European Commission (DG HOME, César Alonso Iriarte and Cathrin Bauer-Bulst) gave a  brief update on the legislative and practical framework for cooperation and information  exchange between the public and private sectors. César Alonso Iriarte reported on the  findings of his fellowship research on public-private cooperation, highlighting the need for  setting up arrangements allowing to overcome potential hurdles to the activities involved in  the partnership under each legal order, such as those deriving from rules on privacy,  classified information, liability and competition; incentives for both sides to participate; a  certain stability of the interaction; and, perhaps most importantly, a measure of trust  between the participants. Cathrin Bauer-Bulst spoke about the current rules on reporting  and legislative proposals in the pipeline that include reporting obligations, such as the  proposal for a Network and Information Security directive recently made by DG Connect.  She also gave an overview of a few coordination initiatives and of EU funding in this area.  16  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  9  b) Elly van den Heuvel, General Manager at the Dutch National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)  presented on the Dutch perspective. The NCSC is a government initiative and aims at  bringing several existing initiatives together. In general, secure networks are the  responsibility of various different parties in The Netherlands, and its NCSCs task to provide  links between these parties. From the organisational point of view the centre falls under the  responsibility of the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security of the Ministry  of Security and Justice.  Its foundations however are organised in a public-private  cooperation.  Elly van den Heuvel stressed the importance of cooperation and collaboration.  c) Wout de Natris and Thorsten Kraft on the Advanced Cyber Defence Centre (ACDC).  ACDC  aims to set up national support centres in Europe with the German botfrei.de17 initiative as  an example. The project consists of two parts.   The first basic idea is to clean up end user systems through an alert to the affected  end user system. This initiative would include the aid of a support centre and would  also involve a corresponding website and free disinfection tools which would be  provided through this website.   The second part of the project is about gathering, analysing and distributing data on  botnet generated traffic and abuse in and through a central database.  The ACDC project seeked for partners in the (mainly CERT) community.  Training sessions  One full morning was spent on a technical training given by ENISA trainers from the CERT relations  team.  The training used new training material produced in the year 2013, namely:  - Presenting, correlating and filtering logs and various security feeds; and  - Identification and handling of electronic evidence.  Presenting, correlating and filtering logs and various security feeds  In this training the participants learned through practical examples, how to correlate different logs  and several security feeds, in order to identify on-going attacks, investigate past attacks and  automate the incident handling process.  Identification and handling of electronic evidence  In this part the trainees were presented with the principles of evidence gathering. A common  knowledge of the requirements regarding evidence admissibility in a court of law was established.  The exercise also gave an overview of malware characteristics, methods of identification and tools  that may be used at the scene.  Round table discussion  The biggest part of this workshop was a round table discussion under TLP Code Red to discuss about  the current issues on cooperation between CERTs and LEA in Europe. The session was moderated by  ENISA. Due to the TLP Red status,it is not possible to summarise this debate in this report. However,  before the round table discussion started, Jaap van Oss, head of Focal Point Cyborg of the EC3, was  invited to present a proposal about the necessity to have new and innovative ways of conducting  investigations between law enforcement and non-law enforcement entities (e.g. CERTs). The  question at hand was if it would be possible to set up operations together with CERTs to take down  17  https://www.botfrei.de/  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  10  botnets. On the one hand, this encourages CERTs to help law enforcement and keep them up to date  and on the other, it provides law enforcement to benefit from the expertise of CERTs. EC3 offered to  facilitate and guide these ‘joint operations’. The question was if there is an interest in such  cooperation and if CERTs and law enforcement would be able to participate in the near future?  Additionally, which information and legislation is necessary for such cooperation and what would be  needed to combine/exchange information? The process would include the exchange of intelligences  packages and could have three different levels of escalating mitigation measures in mind.  From the discussion it became clear that for law enforcement and (most of the) CERTs represented  in the room there is a clear willingness for such cooperation. To actually organise a ‘joint operation’,  it is necessary to have proper coordination to overcome the legal and operational challenges.  Additionally it is necessary to create a framework to exchange information. This will take time and  will not be perfect the first time, but is a system that needs to grow. The difficulty is that CERTs do  not have the same organisation or mandate in the different countries; these particularities must be  taken into account in such cooperation efforts. Nevertheless, the relationship between law  enforcement and CERTs needs to deepen.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  11  5 Evaluation and lessons learnt  Spread over both events 106 participants were representing  24 EU Member States as well as  Norway and Switzerland. Also CEPOL, ECB, ENISA, European Commission, Council of Europe, CERT EU  and Europol (EC3) had sent representatives.  The workshops were a great success. According to the feedback from the participants given in the  evaluation forms, they scored the meeting of their expectations of these workshops on average 4.4  out of 5.  With regards to the overall evaluation of the event ENISA is satisfied with the level of  active participation in the trainings.  Orally, ENISA received some very good feedback on the quality  of the training from the participants directly during the events.  Their satisfaction was also confirmed  in their evaluation with high scores of their expectations of the workshops.  8th Workshop Part I – Technical Hands-on Training  For Part I of the Workshop ENISA received overall a score of 4,41 out of 5, which is an excellent  result, especially taking into account that this was the first time that ENISA experts gave such  trainings! All participants who filled in the feedback gave very positive impression with regards to  the current and future workshops.  Some recommendations from participants for further improvement included the following thoughts:  a) open source tools should be more extensively used during training;  b) there should be more assurance that all participants can follow the content, there were  occasions where the tempo was too quick;  c) training should always be lifelike and as close to reality as possible;  d) interaction with participants should be more encouraged;  Team Cymru was also very pleased with the level of experience of the group.  According to the  trainer, Cecil Goldstein from Team Cymru, they were a good group to work with and for the most  part, more experienced than they had anticipated. It is always very hard to assess the level of  experience of the participants before the training.  That’s why we asked Team Cymru to be flexible in  0  0,5  1  1,5  2  2,5  3  3,5  4  4,5  5  Honeypots SCADA&Mobile Training  Team Cymru Training  Results per session - Part I  Results per session  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  12  this regard and to be able to adapt to a more experienced group.  However, a comment we heard a  lot, both orally but also written in the evaluation forms, is that people would prefer to have two  tracks with different level of difficulty.  This is certainly something we have to keep in mind for a next  training workshop.  8th Workshop Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  The total average score the participants gave for this workshop in the evaluation was 4.21 out of 5.  The presentations, keynotes and especially the round table discussion was found interesting by most  participants.  Regarding the trainings the opinions were more divided.  This was also the most prominent feedback  that was provided, namely that for the next workshop we should specify more precisely in our  invitations which kind of representatives we expect.  At this workshop there was a mix of more  technical and managerial people.  Most participants expressed their interest to participate in the follow up of this event and found the  venue very suitable for these kind of meetings.  3,4  3,6  3,8  4  4,2  4,4  4,6  Results per session - Part I  Results per session - Part I  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  13  6 Action points  There are no action points for Part I of the workshop. The following sessions hence only covers  action points from the ENISA/EC3 Workshop (Part II).  1. EC3, together with ENISA, will come up with a proposal of what exactly they request from  the CERTs with regards to the cooperation on the takedown of botnets. This would be sent to the  participants of the meeting, as well to the ENISA n/g CERTs mailing list to reach out to teams that  were not represented. The CERTs should from their part analyse if this proposal is possible and  provide feedback.  2. An analysis should be made of the target audience for these meetings. A clear goal and  agenda should be created to make sure the right people are attending. This analysis should be done  by the EC3 and ENISA when preparing for next years meeting.  3. The question was raised if training opportunities are useful in these CERT-LEA meetings? The  answer to this question heavily depends on the analysis of the target audience. This question should  be answered by ENISA and EC3when preparing for next years meeting.  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  14  8th ENISA Workshop ‘CERTs in Europe’  Report  Part I – Technical Hands-on Workshop ; Part II – ENISA/EC3 Workshop  Page  15  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  doi: 10.2824/30515  TP -04  -13 -183  -EN -N  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

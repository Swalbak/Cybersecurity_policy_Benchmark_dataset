By consulting this  report the reader will be introduced to the context of ECSM deployment, the policy context, the  stakeholder model of engagement,  the activities that were implemented and the results of the fully  fledged EU advocacy campaign on NIS topics. This report presents the model of building together a  joint EU advocacy campaign, a campaign on cybersecurity topics of interest for all digital citizens,  and at the same time for institutions and Small Medium Enterprises.  The main recommendations regarding future editions of the advocacy campaign are mentioned in  the conclusions of the evaluation effort and are structured in three pillars as below.  Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level:  o Plan in advance all steps and communicate them  o Improve content and participation  o Improve interactivity  Enhance Content of ECSM:  o Continue the development of repository of materials  o Keep encouraging private-public common activities  o Introduce a best practice section on the website  Improve International Cooperation:  o Exploring common webinars and e-learning solutions  o Develop an International training kit for NIS activities  o Advance planning  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy campaign that takes place in October. The  main objective of the ECSM is to promote cyber security awareness among citizens, to modify their  perception of cyber threats and to provide updated security information through education, good  practices and competitions. Coordination efforts were managed by the Commission (DG CONNECT)  and ENISA, and a large number of NIS stakeholders  participated as a result of the open call  published early during 20131.  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/european-cyber-security-month-2013-get-involved  [accessed in October 2013]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/european-cyber-security-month-2013-get-involved  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 The general policy context 1  1.2 The context of ECSM 2013 2  1.3 The stakeholder model of engagement 3  2 The ECSM 2013 deployment 4  2.1 Participation rate of public-private stakeholders 4  2.2 International cooperation 6  2.3 European level kick-off event 6  2.4 Campaign Analytics and Benefits 7  3 The Roadmap 8  4 Conclusions 10  References 11  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  In October 2013, the first fully-fledged European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) took place all over  Europe with the aim to promote cyber security education and sharing of good practices.  Furthermore, synergies were built with Africa2 and world-wide cyber security efforts were embarked  on by a shared release of top 12 Mobile Safety Tips3.  The Goal of this report is to describe what has been achieved, taking account of the policy context  and making reference to country profiles and analytics. Furthermore, a number of  recommendations are made and a best practice path is proposed in order to set a roadmap for  future deployments.  The Target Audience consists of ECSM country coordinators, public and private stakeholders  involved in the campaign, policy makers and all those that participated to ECSM activities.  The document is structured in 3 parts:   The introduction with general considerations on the context;   The ECSM 2013 deployment with details on coordination and activities. This section  includes annexes with important details on each ECSM country, analytics and a report of the  Kick-off event;   The Roadmap for future deployments;  For the specific purpose of this report, data was collected from ECSM coordinators talks, ECSM kick  off evaluation meeting, webforms with activity evaluations, reports from stakeholders and team  meeting evaluations.  1.1 The general policy context  In this section we describe the general Network Information Security (NIS) background and the  specific context surrounding the ECSM as a method of raising awareness and empowering the digital  user.  This concept was piloted and developed in Europe taking into account the experience  gathered from worldwide actors that have been implementing it4.  The work is in line with the  Awareness Raising work stream of the EU-U.S. Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-crime  established in the context of the EU-U.S. Summit of 20 November 2010 held in Lisbon5. Additionally,  the work benefited from a multiannual planning.  2  Training sessions in Nigeria http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/africa-1 [accessed in October  2013]  3  Safety tips for mobiles - ENISA supporting world-wide cyber security efforts  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world-wide-cyber- security-efforts [accessed in November 2013]  4  More on the National Cyber Security Awareness Month and the National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign  -Stop.Think.

This is being put in  practice in a yearly Cyber Security Month advocacy campaign deployed currently in 27 countries. The  basis being a Feasibility Study conducted in 2011 and an initial Pilot with 8 participating countries in  2012. As an example of the common responsibility practice, more than 60 public and private  stakeholders supported the month, including  ENISA, together with the European Commission and  vice president Neelie Kroes and the Directorate General CONNECT.  1.2 The context of ECSM 2013  Following the publication of the 2011 Feasibility Study7 and the 2012’s pilot8 phase, European Cyber  Security Month 2013 was deployed to reach to new partners. ECSM is set to promote cybersecurity  among citizens of the EU, change their perception of cyber threats, and provide current security  information through education and the sharing of good practices.  The ENISA Work Programme for 2013 mentions that work should continue together with the  Member States and the Commission to further develop the campaign. The approach was established  to widen the number of participating Member States, to ensure sufficient focus on a number of key  themes and to profile the event as a joint EU campaign with global outreach. Moreover it is  anticipated to increase the involvement of the private sector in this initiative by working through  industry representation bodies to make full use of material that has been developed already and to  build upon this material when necessary.  The objectives were brought into line with the final recommendations and objectives of the 2012  pilot:   generate general awareness about cyber security, which is one of the priorities identified in  the EU Cyber Security Strategy;   generate specific awareness on Network and Information Security (NIS), which is addressed  in the proposed NIS Directive;   promote safer use of the Internet for all users;   build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   involve relevant stakeholders;   increase national media interest through the European and global dimension of the project;   enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and  media coordination.  6  February 2013 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  [accessed in October 2013] For previous relevant Policy documents please consult CIIP action plan for Europe  [2009] and The Digital Agenda for Europe [2010]  7  ENISA report 2011 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-  cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth [accessed in October 2013]  8  ENISA report 2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-  cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012 [accessed in October 2013]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/security-month/deliverables/2012 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/ http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/ http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  3  1.3 The stakeholder model of engagement  At a time when cybersecurity is increasingly important, our challenge is to update the skills of end  users, increase the capabilities of SMEs and improve trust in public and private services. All these  goals can be achieved by building synergies with EU organizations9 , professional associations10 and  industry representatives. Following the model of stakeholder involvement depicted in the graph  below, the ECSM team acted as an information broker, supporting stakeholder mapping and building  public-private partnerships for activities.  Furthermore, the support from the European level contributed to make the work more efficient, and  build up a strong NIS community behind the campaign. This role is central in advocacy. Additionally,  the concrete activities that bring added value happen most of the time at local level, with public  bodies, private stakeholders, professional associations and citizens, all working together for greater  cyber security in the digital environment. All these sustained efforts aim to create active  involvement in the promotion of cyber security for citizens, placing the topic firmly on the agendas  for both citizens and governments.  Where can you intervene? Are you interested in getting involved  in the European and global effort towards this common challenge? We all should engage and ask  these questions since everyday life in a digitally connected society requires better informed users  and more aware decision makers.  Be aware, be secure!  9  E.g.

We consider the  multi- stakeholder approach as being the appropriate path to follow also for future years, whilst continuing  to refine the level of interactions and permantly searching for tailored solutions that may be  requested.  2.1 Participation rate of public-private stakeholders  One of the strong points of the 2013 deployment was the number of stakeholders that were  involved in the campaign( a record number of 27 countries, consisting of 23 EU MSs and 4 partner  countries).  In order to have a general overview on the level of participation and the type of activities that were  organized we summarize below data for the 27 participating countries11:  Austria: Security awareness, data protection in enterprises and public campaigns: “Safe Usage of the  Internet”  Belgium: Online campaign, Information Security Solutions Conference  Bulgaria: InfoSec and data storage  Czech Republic: Online and outdoor campaigns, workshop for NGOs operating helplines  Germany: Internet Day, Security Fair and Congress, online campaigns: secure surfing, mobile-secure,  and shopping-secure; use of social networks, activities for SMEs, journalists and citizen  Estonia: ICT for Business, lectures on cyber security  Greece: Security trends and CIIP workshop for students and young professionals  Spain: Impact of cyber security, security campaigns, university lectures  Finland: Digitour, web and social media, network behaviour education for rural stakeholders  France : Online campaigns «Rester alerte, rester serein: la sécurité informatique se construit avec  vous», meetings with students  Hungary: Mysec Talk, Cybersecurity conferences  Ireland: Launch of CyberPsychology Research Centre  Iceland: Insights in InfoSec industry ‘Hacker Halted’  Italy: Regulatory Framework on Cyber Security workshop, online fraud, social networks; online child  protection  Latvia: Social networks used as a method for targeted attacks, free computer check-ups: removal of  computer viruses and malware  Lithuania: Network information security  Luxembourg: Ecommerce, Ebanking and Cyberbullying quizzes  11  27 country profiles may be consulted in the annexes  http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/austria http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/belgium http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/bulgaria http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/czech-republic http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/germany http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/estonia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/greece http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/spain http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/finland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/france http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/hungary http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/ireland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/iceland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/italy http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/latvia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/lithuania http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/luxembourg  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  5  Moldova: Cyber Security in Government Week  Netherlands: Cyber Security Awareness & Integrity Help and Hotline, Alert online, college tour  Norway: Online and outdoor campaigns, security tips  Poland: ICT in education, online quizzes  Portugal: Information Security training, round table discussions, workshops  Romania: Series of technical workshops, online campaign, Cyber Security conference  Serbia: Exhibitions and Cyber Security discussions  Sweden: Advice on the protection of personal information, identity, PC/handheld devices, secure  use of Wi-Fi, how to create strong passwords  Slovenia: Online campaign-Safe On the Internet  United Kingdom: Poster competition, awareness week on behaviour, ethical hacking, viruses and  malware, using your home computer, social media, emails.  With the occasion of the launch of the campaign the Executive Director of ENISA, professor Udo  Helmbrecht commented:  “Cyber security is about the possibility to live your digital life. We encourage  you to get involved in the campaign: online security requires your active  participation!”  In adition to the data collected we present below the visual presence of ECSM in activities meant to  update the citizens on cyber security topics.  http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/republic-of-moldova http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/netherlands http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/norway http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/poland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/portugal http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/romania http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/serbia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/sweden/awareness-campaign http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/slovenia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/united-kingdom  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  6  2.2 International cooperation  The international cooperation in ECSM had its climax on 29th of October with the coordinated  release of  12 Mobile Safety Tips12 .  ENISA supported the global efforts for achieving improved Network and Information Security for  users worldwide, either in their capacities as business users, home users or peers. Together with the  National Cyber Security Awareness Month in US, the National Cyber Security Alliance in Singapore  and many partner countries the top 12 Mobile Safety Tips  were released.  Furthermore, the release was to coincide with European Cyber Security Month 2013, the 10th  year  of National Cyber Security Awareness Month in the United States and the 4th annual Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation Telecommunications and Information Working Group (APEC-TEL) Cyber  Security Awareness Day.  2.3 European level kick-off event  Sharing of experiences and further recommendations for the implementation of the campaign were  exchanged in a kick-off event on 11th  of October.  Here ECSM community members discussed  methods for involving the citizens. The main questions asked were in which way may the digital  citizen get engaged effectively, how should we measure the impact and which performance  indicators to include? We’ve also learnt that multidisciplinary training in NIS education is emerging in  top universities over the world, also that we should be heading towards both technology aware  users and user aware technologies. Moreover, as a key message for cyber security advocacy we  mention the concept of security by design and user empowerment through better education. All  these and more details may be read in the annex where we edited the report of the Kick-Off event.  12  ENISA release http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting- world-wide-cyber-security-efforts  Connect with Care &  Be A good Online  Citizen  Protect Your  Personal  Information  Keep a clean  Machine  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world-wide-cyber-security-efforts http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world-wide-cyber-security-efforts  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  7  2.4 Campaign Analytics and Benefits  In the 2011 Feasibility study we foresaw the benefits associated with a fully fledged campaign. Table  6 and the graphics above from the report mention increased impact and visibility, increased  efficiency, potential use of ready-to-use material, reduced costs and investments, all advantages of a  coordinated approach.  Once with the implementation of the fully fledged campaign we may add from experience the  following advantages reported to us by participants in different occasions:  Strengthening ties with EU bodies  Networking with NIS actors in the country and internationally  Gaining EU visibility for grass root actions e.g. website presence and events participation  Brokerage support from the side of ENISA and from the side of DG CONNECT to EU policy makers  Sharing of best practices  Access to an inventory of NIS materials useful for NIS work  Broader outreach and impact towards digital citizens, e-users  According to the country rate of participation [27] and the number of activities13 organized [more  than 50], twitter ECSM community14 [approx. 1000], website visits [more than 9.500], Media reach  [approx. 60 million peak] the 2013 deployment went as planned.  13  European overview from www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  14  In permanent increase  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  8  Furthermore a detailed overview from meetings, social media, website, rate of involvement of  stakeholders may be consulted in annex B.  By participating in ECSM advocacy campaign it did simplify the work and  achieved a greater impact …time, effort and resource wise!  3  The Roadmap  Taking into account the multi-annual framework in which the campaign is deployed, we put forward  below concrete ideas for the advanced planning of 2014 campaign. It is important to mention that  the ideas were inspired from the evaluation meetings, completed evaluation forms and also from  the direct interactions with stakehoders. The evaluation work will be the main source for feeding  information into the future editions of European Cyber Security Month.  Coordination considerations   The team meetings ENISA-CONNECT were essential. For 2014 they should continue already  setting the objectives to mapping stakeholders and building synergies with other  stakeholders and other initiatives. ECSM countries may be invited to participate in the EU  coordination, rotating over the years.   The ECSM coordinators calls/meeting proved to be efficient and appreciated by the  coordinators. The format should be developed further.   The EU level kick-off event should be organized at the beginning of the month with more  ECSM coordinators invited and more materials.  International collaboration   Advanced planning is needed.   Exploring common webinars and e-learning solutions.   Develop an International training kit for NIS activities.  Feedback ideas for implementation  o It would be helpful to produce some small number of ECSM posters, official Factsheets and  FAQs about ECSM and have them translated in all official EU languages.  o It should coordinate a common message for the campaign translated in all languages.  o Aim to achieve a stronger collaboration with industry and between bodies at country level.  o Improve interactivity by all means.  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  9  In order to further develop a stable model of coordination at European level and MS level the team  should firstly plan in advance all steps and communicate them, secondly improve content and  participation, thirdly outline action points templates and develop the “Guidelines for stakeholders”.  It should be mentioned that resources are scarce, however when budget is not available in kind  offers should be agreed.  In order to continue the implementation of ECSM, further ideas should be taken on board to  increase the overall impact and start creating an ECSM footprint in the European society.  Enhanced content of ECSM   Continue the development of repository of materials with:  1. Most watched NIS videos  2. Reports and Briefs world wide   Launching the NIS Driving Licence roadmap in October together with a pilot application for  testing basic/advanced  NIS knowledge   Prepare Online templates and few give away materials  Building synergies   Keep encouraging private-public common activities   Partnering with more universities in order to reach out to students   Continue the mapping of NIS initiatives and active stakeholders  Evaluate and scale up the results   Introduce a best practice section on the website   Create a basic training kit for NIS multipliers   Improve the interactions between Participants-coordinators-visitors  ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented in regards to ECSM importance:  “ENISA is a broker of cyber security knowledge. The European Cyber Security Month campaign  makes it possible to share best practices, and to increase the results of the security communities’  work. It’s about your security, and in your best interest; online security requires your active  participation”.15 He added  “In a time when cyber security is of increasing importance for society and the  economy, the challenge is to bring the skills of citizens and SMEs up to speed,  to improve the trust in public and private IT services, used in everyday lives.”  15  Press release 10.09.2013 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security-it2019s-in- your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october [accessed in October 2013]  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security-it2019s-in-your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security-it2019s-in-your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  10  4 Conclusions  To conclude, it should be stresed that the European Cyber Security Month future role is to reach out  to increasingly more European citizens and update their knowledge on how to stay safe and secure  online. In addition to the feasiblity and pilot the previous years, 2013 was succesful at increasing the  level of stakeholder reach and placing the initiative firmly on the agendas of both public and policy–  makers. The multi-stakeholder approach will be kept and the dynamic nature of the network and  information security topics will be addressed through tailored solutions. Further effort will follow in  order to:  Develop a stable Model of coordination at  European level and MS level:  o Plan in advance all steps  and communicate them  o Improve content and  participation  o Improve interactivity  Enhance Content of ECSM:  o Continue the  development of  repository of materials  o Keep encouraging  private-public common  activities  o Introduce a best  practice section on the  website  Improve International Cooperation:  o Exploring common  webinars and e-learning  solutions  o Develop an International  training kit for NIS  activities  o Advance planning  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  11  References  [1] European Cyber Security Month www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  [2] ENISA news item Call for ECSM  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/european- cyber-security-month-2013-get-involved  [3] Safety tips for mobiles - ENISA supporting world-wide cyber security efforts  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world- wide-cyber-security-efforts  [4] ENISA report 2011 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage- 1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth  [5] ENISA report 2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage- 1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012  [6] ENISA Press release  2013 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security- it2019s-in-your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october  [7] National Cyber Security Awareness Month and the National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign - Stop.Think.

Numerous  topics were discussed but they all had in common the growing importance of sharing information,  knowledge, expertise and responsibility across Europe to improve its resilience to the numerous and  worldwide Cyber Security  threats. The  agenda  of the event  was  balanced  between  presentations  and panels from public  bodies with  experience  in  raising  network  and  information  security  (NIS)  awareness  and  private bodies with initiatives or public–private partnerships (PPPs) in the field. In  the opening session, Steve Purser (ENISA) underlined that 2013 was the first fully fledged edition of  the European Cyber Security Month and thanked the Lithuanian presidency for its support to  promote its visibility. Paul Timmers and Giuseppe Abbamonte (EU DG CONNECT) highlighted the  importance of a comprehensive longterm and common strategy for cybersecurity (e.g. ECSM, NIS  platform, Directives, eIDAS Regulation, Horizon 2020). Rytis Rainys (RRT- Lithuanian Presidency of  the Council of EU) focused on the work already achieved to make the Lithuanian cyberspace more  secure. He reiterated their strong support to promote cybersecurity initiatives across EU.  In the keynote, Nick Coleman (IBM) asserted on the need to build a risk aware culture across the  different stakeholders.  16  Rapporteur Jean-Christophe Pazzaglia (SAP, Product Security Research)  17  67 in presence/ 44 remotely by web stream  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  13  The panel \"International Good Practices in Securing the Digital Citizen\" highlighted the need of a  pan-european collaborative approach and it continued on the need of a paradigm shift for the  design and protection of cyber systems. A parallel was established with the common control process  of the aviation industry that may be a role model for the cyberspace and that may help to fight  against a cyber protection divide within Europe.  The afternoon started with the presentation of some ECSM activities happening within this year  edition of the European Cyber Security Month, the campaigns held in Belgium, Germany, Norway,  and Sweden complemented with the report on the French “Forum Intenational de la Cybersecurite”.  The last panel “Cyber Security Professional\" presented the evolution of the cybersecurity  professionals’ skills and their career lifecycle. They supported the existing certifications but also  praised the emerging curriculums (e.g. Royal Holloway, Hague University of Applied Sciences, EPITA  and ParisTech) in order to equipe Europe with professionals mastering the necessary  multidisciplinary scope of technicques to face cybersecurity challenges. The day finished with a  visual overview of the main topics addressed during the day done by the rapporteur Jean-Christophe  Pazzaglia (SAP). Finally, Steve Purser described the role that ENISA plays for the ECSM and the  chosen approach “learning by doing” that may also be used in the new initiatives like the NIS  platform. The rest of this report will look into the different sessions one by one.  A.1.1 The difference that ECSM common effort can make   ECSM 2013 was a considerable increase in stakeholder participation since last year's pilot  and DG CONNECT aims to make this an attractive month for all EU countries to participate in  2014. The Cyber security Month initiative exists because of the combined efforts of all of  those involved: Governments, businesses, academia, NGOs, professionals in information  security, in communications etc. The events illustrate the wealth of knowledge that exists  throughout Europe on cyber security.  We must tap into this collective knowledge to make ourselves more aware of  and protect ourselves better against the risks and threats said Paul Timmers.  This is where a joint European Cybersecurity Month can make a difference.   On the Cyber security Month website one can find information and events relating to a wide  variety of themes. For instance: information to the workforce, both in public and private  sector; information to end-users and citizens; the importance of cyber security to industrial  control systems and nuclear installations; the latest malware analysis and cyber forensics.   We can share experiences and build on awareness raising models that have been proven to  work well. We can share messages, re-use them and thereby spare resources. We can instil a  sense of joint challenge and enthusiasm. We can make sure that all actors are involved and  nobody is left behind.  And we can discuss how to measure the success of our activities, putting  efforts into developing metrics for the Cybersecurity Month.   EC overview on cyber security:  o The European Commission, together with the High Representative on Foreign and Security  Policy, adopted the EU Cyber security Strategy in February 2013. It has since then been  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  14  endorsed by the Council of the European Union in June. The European Parliament in its  September resolution welcomed the initiative to organise a European Cyber Security Month.  o DG CONNECT in particular focussing on resilience: How to enhance capabilities and  cooperation: NIS Directive; How to identify best practices throughout the value chain: NIS  Platform; Funding of new technologies: Horizon 2020; another important on-going activity is  the negotiation of the eIDAS Regulation on mutual recognition of electronic identification  means and trust services.  o There are more activities that are ongoing in other departments, for instance within DG  Home Affairs to fight cybercrime and within the European External Action Service to  promote dialogue between civilian and military actors in the EU and to establish  international dialogues and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.  o ENISA's mandate was renewed in 2013 as well. This is important because of the central role  the Agency has in supporting Member States and the Commission in enhancing cyber  security capabilities.   The state of play of the EU Cyber security Strategy, in particular the resilience chapter, and  the accompanying legislative proposal on network and information security:  o Growth and jobs agenda depends on the resilience of the ICT systems and networks  underpinning the various economic processes of our modern societies.  Enhancing the  security of the European value chain is of fundamental importance for the Digital Agenda  and the completion of the Internal Market.  o The Strategy announced that the Commission would set up a public-private platform – the  NIS platform - to identify good cyber security practices across the value chain and create the  favourable market conditions for the development and adoption of secure ICT solutions. The  NIS platform will as a matter of priority aim to identify technologically neutral best practices  to enhance cyber security and develop incentives to abide by those best practices and adopt  secure ICT solutions. Such best practices will be identified by two Working Groups: the first  WG comprises awareness rising, which is of particular interest.  o The Directive will promote a security culture across the value chain so that all players across  the chain can reap the benefits of new online services. Users are at the moment hesitating  to embrace such services, because of security concerns. Such a security culture should  include dynamic risk management, but also participation in the exchange of information on  threats and vulnerabilities.  o The EU Cyber security Strategy and R&D: HORIZON 2020, which will be the EU's research and  innovation funding programme from 1.01.2014 will fund cyber security research. Cyber  security in HORIZON 2020 will be addressed in two pillars: The Societal Challenge of \"Secure  societies\" and Industrial Leadership Challenge of Future Internet (LEIT.  “Priorities for cyber security”  The Lithuanian Presidency was characterized by a heavy agenda due to the end of a political cycle  before the European Parliament elections in 2014 and the finalization of the Multiannual Financial  Framework 2014-2020. The focus of this presidency was Europe, to restore confidence in EU  economy, to boost employment and competitiveness and to strengthen openness and security.  In the area of the telecom and cybersecurity, Lithuania strongly supported different initiatives such  as: TEN-TELE -  Proposal for a Regulation on guidelines for trans-European telecoms networks; eIDAS  - Proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification and trust services in the internal market; NIS-  Proposal for a Directive on Network and Information Security; BB Cost Reduction - Proposal for a  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  15  Regulation on reducing the costs of broadband infrastructure deployment; WEB Accessibility -  Proposal for a Directive on the harmonization measures of the MS related to making Public sector  websites available; STM, EC initiative on Single Telecoms Market - Proposal for a Council Decision on  the EU Position for the ITRs and EU representation in ITU.  Furthermore, the establishment of the Lithuanian CERT enabled to monitor the incidents, the  botnets activity and enable to neutralize a botnet that controlled 5400 bots in September 2013.  Proactive measures have been taken to generate automatically alarms for malware, malicious scripts  and other anomalies. To assist in the resilience of the Lithuanian internet network infrastructure,  research has been conducted to enable:  o Description of the model of the Lithuanian Internet network topology  o Identification of critical network interconnection nodes  o Development of the core of Lithuanian Internet monitoring model  This model was linked with national critical infrastructures and its information systems on the  internet for 7 domains (ICT sector, Governmental sector, Finance sector, Energy sector, Health  sector, Water and food supply, Transport sector) enabling to monitor with different probes.  “Involving the Citizen”  The landscape for citizens is changing, the adoption of new business models (eg. mobility, social  business, outsourcing, SaaS) embracing new technologies (eg. cloud, connected objects, BYOD) is  causing an exponential growth of the interconnected digital universe (eg. 30 billions RFID, 1 trillion  connected objects). While attacks are becoming more sophisticated and may happen in minutes,  cyber hygiene can prevent more than 80% of basic vulnerabilities and may be done quickly (eg.  frequent software update).  The landscape for security is changing from a threat and a technology perspective: CISO perceive  that External threats are rated as a bigger challenge than internal threats, new technology or  compliance; more than one-half say mobile security is their greatest near-term technology concern  and 2/3 expect to spend more on security over the next two years.  People are changing the way they connect, and with who they connect.  They frequently exchanged roles as Bank Customer, Online Shopper, Parent, Citizen, Tax Payer,  Passenger, Employee, Teacher, Volunteer... within their different roles their needs, their concerns  and their behaviours may be extremely different.  To raise citizen awareness the quality of the communication is essential,  channel should then be pertinent, the message should be relevant and should  enable citizen to identify themselfes.  IT professionals should also rethink their way to design IT solution and put security in the different  stages especially in the Cloud/SaaS perspective : Design phase- Establish a design strategy and  implementation plan to get there; Secure by Design - Focus on building security into the fabric of the  cloud; Deploy phase-Build services, in the enterprise and/or as a services provider; Workload Driven  -Secure resources with innovative features and products; Consume phase- Manage and optimize  consumption of services; Service Enabled- Govern through ongoing security operations and  workflow.  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  16  The aim is to create a risk aware-culture where a public private partnership  can engage citizen, manage incidents with intelligence and promote  automated security hygiene.  Q&A   The initiative of the Lithuanian authorithy to build an exhaustive map of their internet and to  map it against critical services by sector was highly appreciated and commented over  twitter.   The notion of trust and notably trust toward cloud services run by government was debated;  What transparency measures and what meaningful certification schemes can enhance their  level of security?   The complexity, the discolsure of vulnerabilities and mismatch between the level of  technical skills required to keep device up to date, are all source of concerns  and raise the  question: who is the CISO of every citizen?   Quick lifecycle and automated updates are usually good for security, but who is keeping the  pace? How many of us are upgrading daily our apps? How can we explain that security  policies are mainly technically driven and not informative for the users irrelevant of his/her  expertise? Why security related upgrade are not highlighted? Why condition check are not  embedded?  A.1.2 Policy panel, \"International Good Practices in Securing the Digital Citizen\"  o Figthing cybercrime: The mission of EC3 is to fight cybercrime, crimes committed by  organised groups to generate large criminal profits such as online fraud, crimes which causes  serious harm to the victim such as online child sexual exploitation, crimes which affect  critical infrastructure and information systems in the European Union. The efficiency relies  on the closed pan-european collaborations between police and justice but also involved  private companies (e.g. IT/Telco providers) and other agencies targeting cyber security with  for example exchanges with ENISA. EC3 invests in R&D to provide a way to gather and  process data during crime investigation. EC3 can neither afford to be only reactive and  resources are mobilized to identify future trends, to assess future threats and to raise  awareness. EC3 however cannot be trigerred by the private citizen as potential crimes  should be reported at national level.  Claire Vishik from INTEL starting by empasing that IT Security should be as easy  to use than a security belt.  o IT security: due to the growth of data traffic and the interconnection of multiple devices the  people may loss the control. Some new services will require to be always connected with no  clear path to opt out and that the difference between local and cloud storage will fade out  making nearly impossible to track data.  o As of today, too many parameters are necessary to master the secure construction of such  applications and a new approach is needed to built in security and privacy mechanisms.  These mechanisms should take into account new threats models caused by the multiplicity  of use cases, and professionals should tackle them from a multi disciplinary angle. While  applications should be secure and respect the right of privacy by default, users should be  aware of the consequence of interacting and sharing information continuously. This will  require education to provide solid technical background. Finally, Thinking Global is necessar  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  17  and adherence to standards and interoperability are necessary but not enough to deliver  such solutions.  o Current legislation evolution: Thomas McDonogh and Padraig Kenny gave their perspective  about the current evolution of the directives and legislation around cybersecurity. If they  praised the ongoing effort they also pointed out that the fragmentation of EU is a problem in  the fight against cybercrimes and that the foreseen budget decrease may harm it. The fear is  that a cyberfighting divide may appear with only half of the EU states in the leading group.  They also defended the opinion that the cybercrime regulation should require a systematic  risk management for critical services and that a public repository about the legal entity  covered by cybersecurity obligations should be established. This transparency will help the  citizen and all stakeholders to better evaluate the effectiveness of the required protection  measures.  Q&A   The perceived shortage of cybersecurity experts raises the point of dedicated curriculum and  asks for better leveraging training initiatives. e.g. Several trainings are emerging in UK,  Nederlands, France, and Europol and Interpol started a collaboration to share training  material, agencies like ENISA are also key contributors to this area.   If risk management should be at the root of legislation, the question is to understand if  current tools are suitable and if they are able to include the dynamic of changes in  technology but also their usage? Similarly if a public repository of critical service exists, what  will be its added value for citizen? Which KPIs should be relevant and how should they be  disclosed publicly without avoiding risk like generalized mistrust or panic or without being  sure to not help cyber criminal looking for vulnerabilities ?  The fragmentation of Europe is perceived as problematic to fight the  international threats of cybercrimes, there is a need for collaboration.  A.1.3 Presentations of activities ECSM 2013   In the perspective of the upcoming 6th edition of the International Forum on Cyber  Security18, the FIC Observatory invited the participants to the event.   ECSM activities presented19 (e.g. Germany, Norway, Sweden and Belgium): All the activities  have in common the use of multiple communication channels (e.g. social network, seminar,  traditional press and videos) to address a majority of citizens. Story telling and effective  advertisements are used to raise awareness outside the cybersecurity gettho. To be more  effective, the german strategy was to split the month per week focusing on a particular topic  (e.g. password hygiene, social engineering) but also to involve Media to host Q&A sessions  with experts. Ederly and kids also deserved a specific treatment with respectively a contest  and a dedicated web site using cartoons code. The Norway initiative has choosen the  humour to carry the message and to raise awareness. Like the Belgian and German  initiatives the campaigns are global and span the whole society with numerous actions  including technical vulgarisation but also more advanced lectures. The Swedish ECSM  campaign is smaller and it should be understood as a way of gaining experiences for a larger  campaign next year. Still the campaign runs in cooperation with the The Swedish Post and  Telecom Authority (PTS) and target home users and employees and focus on Secure  passwords, Mobile devices, Back up your files, Malicious code and Wireless networks.  18  http://www.forum-fic.com/2014/en/  19  Details on the activities here www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  http://www.forum-fic.com/2014/en/ http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  18  Q&A   The scope of the intiatives is ambitious and it is both supported by different communication  channels and by creative and innovative material. Still the main question remaining is how to  measure the impact of the campaigns, how will they affect the daily behaviour of citizens?  How many people will change their cyber hygiene, how many will use different passwords?  On the other side of the spectrum, how many providers will promote stronger  authentication mean, how many of them will restrain to collect data that may be improperly  use to harm their customers without an evident immediate added value?  A.1.4 Practice panel, \"The Cyber Security Professional\"  o The evolution of the cybersecurity professionals’ skills and their career lifecycle: analysis  “European trends form the 2013 Global Information Security Workforce Study” of the  seniority of the cyber security showed a deficit in young talent, one possible explanation  coud be the lack of standardized education despite the emergence of dedicated curriculums  in Europe and world wide (e.g. Royal Holloway, Hague University of Applied Sciences, EPITA  and ParisTech) while one can also argue that (cyber)security professionals are coming from  broader initial skills and specialized later.  o In this context professional certifications may be a way to gradually recognize the  professional skills acquired by doing security tasks. In order to equip Europe with  professionals mastering the necessary broad scope  of techniques to face cyber security  challenges, intiative like CYSPA maybe a way to match the different stakeholders (e.g.  government, agencies, critical sectors and IT provider) expectations and to further define  the necessary skills matching specific duties.  Life long learning offer clear career level and paths may also boost the interest  of young practitioners.  A.1.5 Summary  Numerous topics were discussed during the day all having in common the growing importance of  sharing information, knowledge, expertise and responsibility across Europe to improve its resilience  to the numerous and worldwide Cyber Security threats.  “Shared responsibility” was a message carried by all presentations:   Reponsibility to make the citizen aware of potential risks with continuous and relevant  information where this first fully fledged ECSM is key;   Responsibility to provide the legal framework and research and development tools sustained  by the EU with directives, NIS and H2020 program;   Responsibilty to act today with resourceful national CERTs and to think about proactive  measures to lower the risks;   Responsibility for providers to propose solutions embedding security and privacy by design  during the project’s lifecycle;   Responsibility to be cybersecure and  fight cybercrime at the EU-wide level by sharing the  right information between all stakeholders;   Responsibility to train highly educated people with the appropriate skillsets.  “ENISA role to brokerage”  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  19  A.2 The agenda  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  20  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  21  Annex B:  ECSM Analytics  B.1 Coordinators meetings   The ECSM Coordinators’ meeting I took place on the 27th of May in ENISA’s Athens office.

By consulting this  report the reader will be introduced to the context of ECSM deployment, the policy context, the  stakeholder model of engagement,  the activities that were implemented and the results of the fully  fledged EU advocacy campaign on NIS topics. This report presents the model of building together a  joint EU advocacy campaign, a campaign on cybersecurity topics of interest for all digital citizens,  and at the same time for institutions and Small Medium Enterprises.  The main recommendations regarding future editions of the advocacy campaign are mentioned in  the conclusions of the evaluation effort and are structured in three pillars as below.  Develop a stable Model of coordination at European level and MS level:  o Plan in advance all steps and communicate them  o Improve content and participation  o Improve interactivity  Enhance Content of ECSM:  o Continue the development of repository of materials  o Keep encouraging private-public common activities  o Introduce a best practice section on the website  Improve International Cooperation:  o Exploring common webinars and e-learning solutions  o Develop an International training kit for NIS activities  o Advance planning  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy campaign that takes place in October. The  main objective of the ECSM is to promote cyber security awareness among citizens, to modify their  perception of cyber threats and to provide updated security information through education, good  practices and competitions. Coordination efforts were managed by the Commission (DG CONNECT)  and ENISA, and a large number of NIS stakeholders  participated as a result of the open call  published early during 20131.  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/european-cyber-security-month-2013-get-involved  [accessed in October 2013]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/european-cyber-security-month-2013-get-involved  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 The general policy context 1  1.2 The context of ECSM 2013 2  1.3 The stakeholder model of engagement 3  2 The ECSM 2013 deployment 4  2.1 Participation rate of public-private stakeholders 4  2.2 International cooperation 6  2.3 European level kick-off event 6  2.4 Campaign Analytics and Benefits 7  3 The Roadmap 8  4 Conclusions 10  References 11  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  In October 2013, the first fully-fledged European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) took place all over  Europe with the aim to promote cyber security education and sharing of good practices.  Furthermore, synergies were built with Africa2 and world-wide cyber security efforts were embarked  on by a shared release of top 12 Mobile Safety Tips3.  The Goal of this report is to describe what has been achieved, taking account of the policy context  and making reference to country profiles and analytics. Furthermore, a number of  recommendations are made and a best practice path is proposed in order to set a roadmap for  future deployments.  The Target Audience consists of ECSM country coordinators, public and private stakeholders  involved in the campaign, policy makers and all those that participated to ECSM activities.  The document is structured in 3 parts:   The introduction with general considerations on the context;   The ECSM 2013 deployment with details on coordination and activities. This section  includes annexes with important details on each ECSM country, analytics and a report of the  Kick-off event;   The Roadmap for future deployments;  For the specific purpose of this report, data was collected from ECSM coordinators talks, ECSM kick  off evaluation meeting, webforms with activity evaluations, reports from stakeholders and team  meeting evaluations.  1.1 The general policy context  In this section we describe the general Network Information Security (NIS) background and the  specific context surrounding the ECSM as a method of raising awareness and empowering the digital  user.  This concept was piloted and developed in Europe taking into account the experience  gathered from worldwide actors that have been implementing it4.  The work is in line with the  Awareness Raising work stream of the EU-U.S. Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-crime  established in the context of the EU-U.S. Summit of 20 November 2010 held in Lisbon5. Additionally,  the work benefited from a multiannual planning.  2  Training sessions in Nigeria http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/africa-1 [accessed in October  2013]  3  Safety tips for mobiles - ENISA supporting world-wide cyber security efforts  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world-wide-cyber- security-efforts [accessed in November 2013]  4  More on the National Cyber Security Awareness Month and the National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign  -Stop.Think.

This is being put in  practice in a yearly Cyber Security Month advocacy campaign deployed currently in 27 countries. The  basis being a Feasibility Study conducted in 2011 and an initial Pilot with 8 participating countries in  2012. As an example of the common responsibility practice, more than 60 public and private  stakeholders supported the month, including  ENISA, together with the European Commission and  vice president Neelie Kroes and the Directorate General CONNECT.  1.2 The context of ECSM 2013  Following the publication of the 2011 Feasibility Study7 and the 2012’s pilot8 phase, European Cyber  Security Month 2013 was deployed to reach to new partners. ECSM is set to promote cybersecurity  among citizens of the EU, change their perception of cyber threats, and provide current security  information through education and the sharing of good practices.  The ENISA Work Programme for 2013 mentions that work should continue together with the  Member States and the Commission to further develop the campaign. The approach was established  to widen the number of participating Member States, to ensure sufficient focus on a number of key  themes and to profile the event as a joint EU campaign with global outreach. Moreover it is  anticipated to increase the involvement of the private sector in this initiative by working through  industry representation bodies to make full use of material that has been developed already and to  build upon this material when necessary.  The objectives were brought into line with the final recommendations and objectives of the 2012  pilot:   generate general awareness about cyber security, which is one of the priorities identified in  the EU Cyber Security Strategy;   generate specific awareness on Network and Information Security (NIS), which is addressed  in the proposed NIS Directive;   promote safer use of the Internet for all users;   build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   involve relevant stakeholders;   increase national media interest through the European and global dimension of the project;   enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and  media coordination.  6  February 2013 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  [accessed in October 2013] For previous relevant Policy documents please consult CIIP action plan for Europe  [2009] and The Digital Agenda for Europe [2010]  7  ENISA report 2011 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-  cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth [accessed in October 2013]  8  ENISA report 2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-  cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012 [accessed in October 2013]  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/security-month/deliverables/2012 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/ http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/ http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  3  1.3 The stakeholder model of engagement  At a time when cybersecurity is increasingly important, our challenge is to update the skills of end  users, increase the capabilities of SMEs and improve trust in public and private services. All these  goals can be achieved by building synergies with EU organizations9 , professional associations10 and  industry representatives. Following the model of stakeholder involvement depicted in the graph  below, the ECSM team acted as an information broker, supporting stakeholder mapping and building  public-private partnerships for activities.  Furthermore, the support from the European level contributed to make the work more efficient, and  build up a strong NIS community behind the campaign. This role is central in advocacy. Additionally,  the concrete activities that bring added value happen most of the time at local level, with public  bodies, private stakeholders, professional associations and citizens, all working together for greater  cyber security in the digital environment. All these sustained efforts aim to create active  involvement in the promotion of cyber security for citizens, placing the topic firmly on the agendas  for both citizens and governments.  Where can you intervene? Are you interested in getting involved  in the European and global effort towards this common challenge? We all should engage and ask  these questions since everyday life in a digitally connected society requires better informed users  and more aware decision makers.  Be aware, be secure!  9  E.g.

We consider the  multi- stakeholder approach as being the appropriate path to follow also for future years, whilst continuing  to refine the level of interactions and permantly searching for tailored solutions that may be  requested.  2.1 Participation rate of public-private stakeholders  One of the strong points of the 2013 deployment was the number of stakeholders that were  involved in the campaign( a record number of 27 countries, consisting of 23 EU MSs and 4 partner  countries).  In order to have a general overview on the level of participation and the type of activities that were  organized we summarize below data for the 27 participating countries11:  Austria: Security awareness, data protection in enterprises and public campaigns: “Safe Usage of the  Internet”  Belgium: Online campaign, Information Security Solutions Conference  Bulgaria: InfoSec and data storage  Czech Republic: Online and outdoor campaigns, workshop for NGOs operating helplines  Germany: Internet Day, Security Fair and Congress, online campaigns: secure surfing, mobile-secure,  and shopping-secure; use of social networks, activities for SMEs, journalists and citizen  Estonia: ICT for Business, lectures on cyber security  Greece: Security trends and CIIP workshop for students and young professionals  Spain: Impact of cyber security, security campaigns, university lectures  Finland: Digitour, web and social media, network behaviour education for rural stakeholders  France : Online campaigns «Rester alerte, rester serein: la sécurité informatique se construit avec  vous», meetings with students  Hungary: Mysec Talk, Cybersecurity conferences  Ireland: Launch of CyberPsychology Research Centre  Iceland: Insights in InfoSec industry ‘Hacker Halted’  Italy: Regulatory Framework on Cyber Security workshop, online fraud, social networks; online child  protection  Latvia: Social networks used as a method for targeted attacks, free computer check-ups: removal of  computer viruses and malware  Lithuania: Network information security  Luxembourg: Ecommerce, Ebanking and Cyberbullying quizzes  11  27 country profiles may be consulted in the annexes  http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/austria http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/belgium http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/bulgaria http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/czech-republic http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/germany http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/estonia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/greece http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/spain http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/finland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/france http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/hungary http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/ireland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/iceland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/italy http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/latvia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/lithuania http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/luxembourg  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  5  Moldova: Cyber Security in Government Week  Netherlands: Cyber Security Awareness & Integrity Help and Hotline, Alert online, college tour  Norway: Online and outdoor campaigns, security tips  Poland: ICT in education, online quizzes  Portugal: Information Security training, round table discussions, workshops  Romania: Series of technical workshops, online campaign, Cyber Security conference  Serbia: Exhibitions and Cyber Security discussions  Sweden: Advice on the protection of personal information, identity, PC/handheld devices, secure  use of Wi-Fi, how to create strong passwords  Slovenia: Online campaign-Safe On the Internet  United Kingdom: Poster competition, awareness week on behaviour, ethical hacking, viruses and  malware, using your home computer, social media, emails.  With the occasion of the launch of the campaign the Executive Director of ENISA, professor Udo  Helmbrecht commented:  “Cyber security is about the possibility to live your digital life. We encourage  you to get involved in the campaign: online security requires your active  participation!”  In adition to the data collected we present below the visual presence of ECSM in activities meant to  update the citizens on cyber security topics.  http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/republic-of-moldova http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/netherlands http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/norway http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/poland http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/portugal http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/romania http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/serbia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/sweden/awareness-campaign http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/slovenia http://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ecsm-countries/united-kingdom  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  6  2.2 International cooperation  The international cooperation in ECSM had its climax on 29th of October with the coordinated  release of  12 Mobile Safety Tips12 .  ENISA supported the global efforts for achieving improved Network and Information Security for  users worldwide, either in their capacities as business users, home users or peers. Together with the  National Cyber Security Awareness Month in US, the National Cyber Security Alliance in Singapore  and many partner countries the top 12 Mobile Safety Tips  were released.  Furthermore, the release was to coincide with European Cyber Security Month 2013, the 10th  year  of National Cyber Security Awareness Month in the United States and the 4th annual Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation Telecommunications and Information Working Group (APEC-TEL) Cyber  Security Awareness Day.  2.3 European level kick-off event  Sharing of experiences and further recommendations for the implementation of the campaign were  exchanged in a kick-off event on 11th  of October.  Here ECSM community members discussed  methods for involving the citizens. The main questions asked were in which way may the digital  citizen get engaged effectively, how should we measure the impact and which performance  indicators to include? We’ve also learnt that multidisciplinary training in NIS education is emerging in  top universities over the world, also that we should be heading towards both technology aware  users and user aware technologies. Moreover, as a key message for cyber security advocacy we  mention the concept of security by design and user empowerment through better education. All  these and more details may be read in the annex where we edited the report of the Kick-Off event.  12  ENISA release http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting- world-wide-cyber-security-efforts  Connect with Care &  Be A good Online  Citizen  Protect Your  Personal  Information  Keep a clean  Machine  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world-wide-cyber-security-efforts http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world-wide-cyber-security-efforts  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  7  2.4 Campaign Analytics and Benefits  In the 2011 Feasibility study we foresaw the benefits associated with a fully fledged campaign. Table  6 and the graphics above from the report mention increased impact and visibility, increased  efficiency, potential use of ready-to-use material, reduced costs and investments, all advantages of a  coordinated approach.  Once with the implementation of the fully fledged campaign we may add from experience the  following advantages reported to us by participants in different occasions:  Strengthening ties with EU bodies  Networking with NIS actors in the country and internationally  Gaining EU visibility for grass root actions e.g. website presence and events participation  Brokerage support from the side of ENISA and from the side of DG CONNECT to EU policy makers  Sharing of best practices  Access to an inventory of NIS materials useful for NIS work  Broader outreach and impact towards digital citizens, e-users  According to the country rate of participation [27] and the number of activities13 organized [more  than 50], twitter ECSM community14 [approx. 1000], website visits [more than 9.500], Media reach  [approx. 60 million peak] the 2013 deployment went as planned.  13  European overview from www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  14  In permanent increase  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  8  Furthermore a detailed overview from meetings, social media, website, rate of involvement of  stakeholders may be consulted in annex B.  By participating in ECSM advocacy campaign it did simplify the work and  achieved a greater impact …time, effort and resource wise!  3  The Roadmap  Taking into account the multi-annual framework in which the campaign is deployed, we put forward  below concrete ideas for the advanced planning of 2014 campaign. It is important to mention that  the ideas were inspired from the evaluation meetings, completed evaluation forms and also from  the direct interactions with stakehoders. The evaluation work will be the main source for feeding  information into the future editions of European Cyber Security Month.  Coordination considerations   The team meetings ENISA-CONNECT were essential. For 2014 they should continue already  setting the objectives to mapping stakeholders and building synergies with other  stakeholders and other initiatives. ECSM countries may be invited to participate in the EU  coordination, rotating over the years.   The ECSM coordinators calls/meeting proved to be efficient and appreciated by the  coordinators. The format should be developed further.   The EU level kick-off event should be organized at the beginning of the month with more  ECSM coordinators invited and more materials.  International collaboration   Advanced planning is needed.   Exploring common webinars and e-learning solutions.   Develop an International training kit for NIS activities.  Feedback ideas for implementation  o It would be helpful to produce some small number of ECSM posters, official Factsheets and  FAQs about ECSM and have them translated in all official EU languages.  o It should coordinate a common message for the campaign translated in all languages.  o Aim to achieve a stronger collaboration with industry and between bodies at country level.  o Improve interactivity by all means.  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  9  In order to further develop a stable model of coordination at European level and MS level the team  should firstly plan in advance all steps and communicate them, secondly improve content and  participation, thirdly outline action points templates and develop the “Guidelines for stakeholders”.  It should be mentioned that resources are scarce, however when budget is not available in kind  offers should be agreed.  In order to continue the implementation of ECSM, further ideas should be taken on board to  increase the overall impact and start creating an ECSM footprint in the European society.  Enhanced content of ECSM   Continue the development of repository of materials with:  1. Most watched NIS videos  2. Reports and Briefs world wide   Launching the NIS Driving Licence roadmap in October together with a pilot application for  testing basic/advanced  NIS knowledge   Prepare Online templates and few give away materials  Building synergies   Keep encouraging private-public common activities   Partnering with more universities in order to reach out to students   Continue the mapping of NIS initiatives and active stakeholders  Evaluate and scale up the results   Introduce a best practice section on the website   Create a basic training kit for NIS multipliers   Improve the interactions between Participants-coordinators-visitors  ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented in regards to ECSM importance:  “ENISA is a broker of cyber security knowledge. The European Cyber Security Month campaign  makes it possible to share best practices, and to increase the results of the security communities’  work. It’s about your security, and in your best interest; online security requires your active  participation”.15 He added  “In a time when cyber security is of increasing importance for society and the  economy, the challenge is to bring the skills of citizens and SMEs up to speed,  to improve the trust in public and private IT services, used in everyday lives.”  15  Press release 10.09.2013 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security-it2019s-in- your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october [accessed in October 2013]  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security-it2019s-in-your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security-it2019s-in-your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  10  4 Conclusions  To conclude, it should be stresed that the European Cyber Security Month future role is to reach out  to increasingly more European citizens and update their knowledge on how to stay safe and secure  online. In addition to the feasiblity and pilot the previous years, 2013 was succesful at increasing the  level of stakeholder reach and placing the initiative firmly on the agendas of both public and policy–  makers. The multi-stakeholder approach will be kept and the dynamic nature of the network and  information security topics will be addressed through tailored solutions. Further effort will follow in  order to:  Develop a stable Model of coordination at  European level and MS level:  o Plan in advance all steps  and communicate them  o Improve content and  participation  o Improve interactivity  Enhance Content of ECSM:  o Continue the  development of  repository of materials  o Keep encouraging  private-public common  activities  o Introduce a best  practice section on the  website  Improve International Cooperation:  o Exploring common  webinars and e-learning  solutions  o Develop an International  training kit for NIS  activities  o Advance planning  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  11  References  [1] European Cyber Security Month www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  [2] ENISA news item Call for ECSM  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/european- cyber-security-month-2013-get-involved  [3] Safety tips for mobiles - ENISA supporting world-wide cyber security efforts  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/safety-tips-for-mobiles-enisa-supporting-world- wide-cyber-security-efforts  [4] ENISA report 2011 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage- 1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2011/europeansecuritymonth  [5] ENISA report 2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage- 1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2012  [6] ENISA Press release  2013 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/online-security- it2019s-in-your-interest-1st-european-cyber-security-month-coming-up-in-october  [7] National Cyber Security Awareness Month and the National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign - Stop.Think.

Numerous  topics were discussed but they all had in common the growing importance of sharing information,  knowledge, expertise and responsibility across Europe to improve its resilience to the numerous and  worldwide Cyber Security  threats. The  agenda  of the event  was  balanced  between  presentations  and panels from public  bodies with  experience  in  raising  network  and  information  security  (NIS)  awareness  and  private bodies with initiatives or public–private partnerships (PPPs) in the field. In  the opening session, Steve Purser (ENISA) underlined that 2013 was the first fully fledged edition of  the European Cyber Security Month and thanked the Lithuanian presidency for its support to  promote its visibility. Paul Timmers and Giuseppe Abbamonte (EU DG CONNECT) highlighted the  importance of a comprehensive longterm and common strategy for cybersecurity (e.g. ECSM, NIS  platform, Directives, eIDAS Regulation, Horizon 2020). Rytis Rainys (RRT- Lithuanian Presidency of  the Council of EU) focused on the work already achieved to make the Lithuanian cyberspace more  secure. He reiterated their strong support to promote cybersecurity initiatives across EU.  In the keynote, Nick Coleman (IBM) asserted on the need to build a risk aware culture across the  different stakeholders.  16  Rapporteur Jean-Christophe Pazzaglia (SAP, Product Security Research)  17  67 in presence/ 44 remotely by web stream  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  13  The panel \"International Good Practices in Securing the Digital Citizen\" highlighted the need of a  pan-european collaborative approach and it continued on the need of a paradigm shift for the  design and protection of cyber systems. A parallel was established with the common control process  of the aviation industry that may be a role model for the cyberspace and that may help to fight  against a cyber protection divide within Europe.  The afternoon started with the presentation of some ECSM activities happening within this year  edition of the European Cyber Security Month, the campaigns held in Belgium, Germany, Norway,  and Sweden complemented with the report on the French “Forum Intenational de la Cybersecurite”.  The last panel “Cyber Security Professional\" presented the evolution of the cybersecurity  professionals’ skills and their career lifecycle. They supported the existing certifications but also  praised the emerging curriculums (e.g. Royal Holloway, Hague University of Applied Sciences, EPITA  and ParisTech) in order to equipe Europe with professionals mastering the necessary  multidisciplinary scope of technicques to face cybersecurity challenges. The day finished with a  visual overview of the main topics addressed during the day done by the rapporteur Jean-Christophe  Pazzaglia (SAP). Finally, Steve Purser described the role that ENISA plays for the ECSM and the  chosen approach “learning by doing” that may also be used in the new initiatives like the NIS  platform. The rest of this report will look into the different sessions one by one.  A.1.1 The difference that ECSM common effort can make   ECSM 2013 was a considerable increase in stakeholder participation since last year's pilot  and DG CONNECT aims to make this an attractive month for all EU countries to participate in  2014. The Cyber security Month initiative exists because of the combined efforts of all of  those involved: Governments, businesses, academia, NGOs, professionals in information  security, in communications etc. The events illustrate the wealth of knowledge that exists  throughout Europe on cyber security.  We must tap into this collective knowledge to make ourselves more aware of  and protect ourselves better against the risks and threats said Paul Timmers.  This is where a joint European Cybersecurity Month can make a difference.   On the Cyber security Month website one can find information and events relating to a wide  variety of themes. For instance: information to the workforce, both in public and private  sector; information to end-users and citizens; the importance of cyber security to industrial  control systems and nuclear installations; the latest malware analysis and cyber forensics.   We can share experiences and build on awareness raising models that have been proven to  work well. We can share messages, re-use them and thereby spare resources. We can instil a  sense of joint challenge and enthusiasm. We can make sure that all actors are involved and  nobody is left behind.  And we can discuss how to measure the success of our activities, putting  efforts into developing metrics for the Cybersecurity Month.   EC overview on cyber security:  o The European Commission, together with the High Representative on Foreign and Security  Policy, adopted the EU Cyber security Strategy in February 2013. It has since then been  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  14  endorsed by the Council of the European Union in June. The European Parliament in its  September resolution welcomed the initiative to organise a European Cyber Security Month.  o DG CONNECT in particular focussing on resilience: How to enhance capabilities and  cooperation: NIS Directive; How to identify best practices throughout the value chain: NIS  Platform; Funding of new technologies: Horizon 2020; another important on-going activity is  the negotiation of the eIDAS Regulation on mutual recognition of electronic identification  means and trust services.  o There are more activities that are ongoing in other departments, for instance within DG  Home Affairs to fight cybercrime and within the European External Action Service to  promote dialogue between civilian and military actors in the EU and to establish  international dialogues and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.  o ENISA's mandate was renewed in 2013 as well. This is important because of the central role  the Agency has in supporting Member States and the Commission in enhancing cyber  security capabilities.   The state of play of the EU Cyber security Strategy, in particular the resilience chapter, and  the accompanying legislative proposal on network and information security:  o Growth and jobs agenda depends on the resilience of the ICT systems and networks  underpinning the various economic processes of our modern societies.  Enhancing the  security of the European value chain is of fundamental importance for the Digital Agenda  and the completion of the Internal Market.  o The Strategy announced that the Commission would set up a public-private platform – the  NIS platform - to identify good cyber security practices across the value chain and create the  favourable market conditions for the development and adoption of secure ICT solutions. The  NIS platform will as a matter of priority aim to identify technologically neutral best practices  to enhance cyber security and develop incentives to abide by those best practices and adopt  secure ICT solutions. Such best practices will be identified by two Working Groups: the first  WG comprises awareness rising, which is of particular interest.  o The Directive will promote a security culture across the value chain so that all players across  the chain can reap the benefits of new online services. Users are at the moment hesitating  to embrace such services, because of security concerns. Such a security culture should  include dynamic risk management, but also participation in the exchange of information on  threats and vulnerabilities.  o The EU Cyber security Strategy and R&D: HORIZON 2020, which will be the EU's research and  innovation funding programme from 1.01.2014 will fund cyber security research. Cyber  security in HORIZON 2020 will be addressed in two pillars: The Societal Challenge of \"Secure  societies\" and Industrial Leadership Challenge of Future Internet (LEIT.  “Priorities for cyber security”  The Lithuanian Presidency was characterized by a heavy agenda due to the end of a political cycle  before the European Parliament elections in 2014 and the finalization of the Multiannual Financial  Framework 2014-2020. The focus of this presidency was Europe, to restore confidence in EU  economy, to boost employment and competitiveness and to strengthen openness and security.  In the area of the telecom and cybersecurity, Lithuania strongly supported different initiatives such  as: TEN-TELE -  Proposal for a Regulation on guidelines for trans-European telecoms networks; eIDAS  - Proposal for a Regulation on electronic identification and trust services in the internal market; NIS-  Proposal for a Directive on Network and Information Security; BB Cost Reduction - Proposal for a  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  15  Regulation on reducing the costs of broadband infrastructure deployment; WEB Accessibility -  Proposal for a Directive on the harmonization measures of the MS related to making Public sector  websites available; STM, EC initiative on Single Telecoms Market - Proposal for a Council Decision on  the EU Position for the ITRs and EU representation in ITU.  Furthermore, the establishment of the Lithuanian CERT enabled to monitor the incidents, the  botnets activity and enable to neutralize a botnet that controlled 5400 bots in September 2013.  Proactive measures have been taken to generate automatically alarms for malware, malicious scripts  and other anomalies. To assist in the resilience of the Lithuanian internet network infrastructure,  research has been conducted to enable:  o Description of the model of the Lithuanian Internet network topology  o Identification of critical network interconnection nodes  o Development of the core of Lithuanian Internet monitoring model  This model was linked with national critical infrastructures and its information systems on the  internet for 7 domains (ICT sector, Governmental sector, Finance sector, Energy sector, Health  sector, Water and food supply, Transport sector) enabling to monitor with different probes.  “Involving the Citizen”  The landscape for citizens is changing, the adoption of new business models (eg. mobility, social  business, outsourcing, SaaS) embracing new technologies (eg. cloud, connected objects, BYOD) is  causing an exponential growth of the interconnected digital universe (eg. 30 billions RFID, 1 trillion  connected objects). While attacks are becoming more sophisticated and may happen in minutes,  cyber hygiene can prevent more than 80% of basic vulnerabilities and may be done quickly (eg.  frequent software update).  The landscape for security is changing from a threat and a technology perspective: CISO perceive  that External threats are rated as a bigger challenge than internal threats, new technology or  compliance; more than one-half say mobile security is their greatest near-term technology concern  and 2/3 expect to spend more on security over the next two years.  People are changing the way they connect, and with who they connect.  They frequently exchanged roles as Bank Customer, Online Shopper, Parent, Citizen, Tax Payer,  Passenger, Employee, Teacher, Volunteer... within their different roles their needs, their concerns  and their behaviours may be extremely different.  To raise citizen awareness the quality of the communication is essential,  channel should then be pertinent, the message should be relevant and should  enable citizen to identify themselfes.  IT professionals should also rethink their way to design IT solution and put security in the different  stages especially in the Cloud/SaaS perspective : Design phase- Establish a design strategy and  implementation plan to get there; Secure by Design - Focus on building security into the fabric of the  cloud; Deploy phase-Build services, in the enterprise and/or as a services provider; Workload Driven  -Secure resources with innovative features and products; Consume phase- Manage and optimize  consumption of services; Service Enabled- Govern through ongoing security operations and  workflow.  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  16  The aim is to create a risk aware-culture where a public private partnership  can engage citizen, manage incidents with intelligence and promote  automated security hygiene.  Q&A   The initiative of the Lithuanian authorithy to build an exhaustive map of their internet and to  map it against critical services by sector was highly appreciated and commented over  twitter.   The notion of trust and notably trust toward cloud services run by government was debated;  What transparency measures and what meaningful certification schemes can enhance their  level of security?   The complexity, the discolsure of vulnerabilities and mismatch between the level of  technical skills required to keep device up to date, are all source of concerns  and raise the  question: who is the CISO of every citizen?   Quick lifecycle and automated updates are usually good for security, but who is keeping the  pace? How many of us are upgrading daily our apps? How can we explain that security  policies are mainly technically driven and not informative for the users irrelevant of his/her  expertise? Why security related upgrade are not highlighted? Why condition check are not  embedded?  A.1.2 Policy panel, \"International Good Practices in Securing the Digital Citizen\"  o Figthing cybercrime: The mission of EC3 is to fight cybercrime, crimes committed by  organised groups to generate large criminal profits such as online fraud, crimes which causes  serious harm to the victim such as online child sexual exploitation, crimes which affect  critical infrastructure and information systems in the European Union. The efficiency relies  on the closed pan-european collaborations between police and justice but also involved  private companies (e.g. IT/Telco providers) and other agencies targeting cyber security with  for example exchanges with ENISA. EC3 invests in R&D to provide a way to gather and  process data during crime investigation. EC3 can neither afford to be only reactive and  resources are mobilized to identify future trends, to assess future threats and to raise  awareness. EC3 however cannot be trigerred by the private citizen as potential crimes  should be reported at national level.  Claire Vishik from INTEL starting by empasing that IT Security should be as easy  to use than a security belt.  o IT security: due to the growth of data traffic and the interconnection of multiple devices the  people may loss the control. Some new services will require to be always connected with no  clear path to opt out and that the difference between local and cloud storage will fade out  making nearly impossible to track data.  o As of today, too many parameters are necessary to master the secure construction of such  applications and a new approach is needed to built in security and privacy mechanisms.  These mechanisms should take into account new threats models caused by the multiplicity  of use cases, and professionals should tackle them from a multi disciplinary angle. While  applications should be secure and respect the right of privacy by default, users should be  aware of the consequence of interacting and sharing information continuously. This will  require education to provide solid technical background. Finally, Thinking Global is necessar  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  17  and adherence to standards and interoperability are necessary but not enough to deliver  such solutions.  o Current legislation evolution: Thomas McDonogh and Padraig Kenny gave their perspective  about the current evolution of the directives and legislation around cybersecurity. If they  praised the ongoing effort they also pointed out that the fragmentation of EU is a problem in  the fight against cybercrimes and that the foreseen budget decrease may harm it. The fear is  that a cyberfighting divide may appear with only half of the EU states in the leading group.  They also defended the opinion that the cybercrime regulation should require a systematic  risk management for critical services and that a public repository about the legal entity  covered by cybersecurity obligations should be established. This transparency will help the  citizen and all stakeholders to better evaluate the effectiveness of the required protection  measures.  Q&A   The perceived shortage of cybersecurity experts raises the point of dedicated curriculum and  asks for better leveraging training initiatives. e.g. Several trainings are emerging in UK,  Nederlands, France, and Europol and Interpol started a collaboration to share training  material, agencies like ENISA are also key contributors to this area.   If risk management should be at the root of legislation, the question is to understand if  current tools are suitable and if they are able to include the dynamic of changes in  technology but also their usage? Similarly if a public repository of critical service exists, what  will be its added value for citizen? Which KPIs should be relevant and how should they be  disclosed publicly without avoiding risk like generalized mistrust or panic or without being  sure to not help cyber criminal looking for vulnerabilities ?  The fragmentation of Europe is perceived as problematic to fight the  international threats of cybercrimes, there is a need for collaboration.  A.1.3 Presentations of activities ECSM 2013   In the perspective of the upcoming 6th edition of the International Forum on Cyber  Security18, the FIC Observatory invited the participants to the event.   ECSM activities presented19 (e.g. Germany, Norway, Sweden and Belgium): All the activities  have in common the use of multiple communication channels (e.g. social network, seminar,  traditional press and videos) to address a majority of citizens. Story telling and effective  advertisements are used to raise awareness outside the cybersecurity gettho. To be more  effective, the german strategy was to split the month per week focusing on a particular topic  (e.g. password hygiene, social engineering) but also to involve Media to host Q&A sessions  with experts. Ederly and kids also deserved a specific treatment with respectively a contest  and a dedicated web site using cartoons code. The Norway initiative has choosen the  humour to carry the message and to raise awareness. Like the Belgian and German  initiatives the campaigns are global and span the whole society with numerous actions  including technical vulgarisation but also more advanced lectures. The Swedish ECSM  campaign is smaller and it should be understood as a way of gaining experiences for a larger  campaign next year. Still the campaign runs in cooperation with the The Swedish Post and  Telecom Authority (PTS) and target home users and employees and focus on Secure  passwords, Mobile devices, Back up your files, Malicious code and Wireless networks.  18  http://www.forum-fic.com/2014/en/  19  Details on the activities here www.cybersecuritymonth.eu  http://www.forum-fic.com/2014/en/ http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  18  Q&A   The scope of the intiatives is ambitious and it is both supported by different communication  channels and by creative and innovative material. Still the main question remaining is how to  measure the impact of the campaigns, how will they affect the daily behaviour of citizens?  How many people will change their cyber hygiene, how many will use different passwords?  On the other side of the spectrum, how many providers will promote stronger  authentication mean, how many of them will restrain to collect data that may be improperly  use to harm their customers without an evident immediate added value?  A.1.4 Practice panel, \"The Cyber Security Professional\"  o The evolution of the cybersecurity professionals’ skills and their career lifecycle: analysis  “European trends form the 2013 Global Information Security Workforce Study” of the  seniority of the cyber security showed a deficit in young talent, one possible explanation  coud be the lack of standardized education despite the emergence of dedicated curriculums  in Europe and world wide (e.g. Royal Holloway, Hague University of Applied Sciences, EPITA  and ParisTech) while one can also argue that (cyber)security professionals are coming from  broader initial skills and specialized later.  o In this context professional certifications may be a way to gradually recognize the  professional skills acquired by doing security tasks. In order to equip Europe with  professionals mastering the necessary broad scope  of techniques to face cyber security  challenges, intiative like CYSPA maybe a way to match the different stakeholders (e.g.  government, agencies, critical sectors and IT provider) expectations and to further define  the necessary skills matching specific duties.  Life long learning offer clear career level and paths may also boost the interest  of young practitioners.  A.1.5 Summary  Numerous topics were discussed during the day all having in common the growing importance of  sharing information, knowledge, expertise and responsibility across Europe to improve its resilience  to the numerous and worldwide Cyber Security threats.  “Shared responsibility” was a message carried by all presentations:   Reponsibility to make the citizen aware of potential risks with continuous and relevant  information where this first fully fledged ECSM is key;   Responsibility to provide the legal framework and research and development tools sustained  by the EU with directives, NIS and H2020 program;   Responsibilty to act today with resourceful national CERTs and to think about proactive  measures to lower the risks;   Responsibility for providers to propose solutions embedding security and privacy by design  during the project’s lifecycle;   Responsibility to be cybersecure and  fight cybercrime at the EU-wide level by sharing the  right information between all stakeholders;   Responsibility to train highly educated people with the appropriate skillsets.  “ENISA role to brokerage”  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  19  A.2 The agenda  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  20  ECSM final report  Roadmap for European Cyber Security Month  November 2013  Page  21  Annex B:  ECSM Analytics  B.1 Coordinators meetings   The ECSM Coordinators’ meeting I took place on the 27th of May in ENISA’s Athens office.

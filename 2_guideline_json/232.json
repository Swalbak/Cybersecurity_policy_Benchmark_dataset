A dedicated analytical framework is put  forward, consistent with the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) methodology, with the aim of  analysing both FIMI and cybersecurity aspects of disinformation.  The concept of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) has been proposed by  the EEAS, as a response to the call of the European Democracy Action Plan1 for a further  refinement of the definitions around disinformation. Although disinformation is a prominent part  of FIMI, FIMI puts emphasis on manipulative behaviour, as opposed to the truthfulness of the  content being delivered. Several strategic documents, such as the Strategic Compass for  Security and Defence and the July 2022 Council Conclusions on FIMI, refer to the importance of  countering FIMI as well as hybrid and cyber threats.  Accordingly, in light of broader hybrid threats that cross different domains, one of the main  motivations behind this report is to identify ways to bring the cybersecurity and counter-FIMI  communities closer together. The ambition is to provide an input to the on-going and ever- pressing discussion on the nature and dynamics of information manipulation and interference,  including disinformation, and on how to collectively respond to this phenomenon.  The report proposes and tests an analytical approach describing FIMI and manipulation of  information, as well as the underlying cybersecurity elements, by combing practices from both  domains:  • For cybersecurity: The open methodological framework2 used by ENISA’s annual  report on the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, the ENISA Threat  Landscape Reports3  • For FIMI: The open-source DISARM framework used to capture FIMI/disinformation  By testing the framework on a limited set of events, the report serves as a proof of concept for  the interoperability of the frameworks. In addition, it puts forward some preliminary conclusions  on the relationship between cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation:  • Role of cybersecurity in FIMI/disinformation. Cybersecurity analysis seems to be  particularly important in establishing attribution: among the events analysed, those that  had been attributed relied on a cybersecurity analysis. In addition, cyber-attacks seem  to be more prominent at the initial stages of FIMI/disinformation events. This means  firstly that specific cyber-attack techniques could act as an indicator of a  FIMI/disinformation event and, secondly, that awareness raising is important to limit the  development or acquisition of content and the compromise of infrastructure that  facilitate dissemination.  • Importance of structured and seamless incident reporting between the  cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation community.  Consistency of data and data  quality are the main limitation to cross-domain analyses. For example, open-source  data about FIMI/disinformation events often cover entire operations encompassing  several incidents, whereas a “pure” cybersecurity perspective would tend to focus on  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0790&from=EN  2 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  FIMI  Foreign Information  Manipulation and  Interference (FIMI)  describes a mostly non- illegal pattern of  behaviour that threatens  or has the potential to  negatively impact  values, procedures and  political processes. Such  activity is manipulative in  character, conducted in  an intentional and  coordinated manner.  Actors of such activity  can be state or non-state  actors, including their  proxies inside and  outside of their own  territory.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  5  single incidents.  Also, data about FIMI/disinformation events might not contain  sufficient information about its cybersecurity aspects. In both cases, improved incident  reporting practices could help.  • Mutual exchanges between the cybersecurity and the FIMI/disinformation  community could benefit the fight against FIMI/disinformation. Since incident  handling and response has been at the core of the cybersecurity community for many  years, established cybersecurity practices can help the counter FIMI/disinformation  community speeding up analytical maturity. For example, the FIMI community can  adopt and adapt standard information formats widely used in the cybersecurity realm,  to move beyond information sharing by written reports. Conversely, the  FIMI/disinformation community can, in return, inform cybersecurity practitioners on new  and emerging motivations, targets and threat vectors.  This report has been validated and supported by the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on  Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL)4.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-threats/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  6  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT  This chapter details the concepts used in the report to describe and define manipulation of information,  focusing on the activities the EU aims to address and explaining why the terminology commonly used  might not be sufficiently comprehensive and precise.  One of the most important parameters in defining the manipulation of information is the notion of  “intent”. “Misinformation”, i.e. the unintentional spread of false and/or misleading information, differs  from the intentional manipulation of the information environment. The importance of this basic  distinction is the repertoire of response options that can be used for unintentional misinformation versus  intentional information manipulation. Responses like exposing the actors responsible for such activity is  adequate if actors engage in intentional, coordinated and systematic manipulation, but not if they are  individual citizens who merely believed a false/misleading piece of information. Misinformation falls  outside the scope of this report.  Intentional attempts to manipulate the information environment and public discourse by foreign actors is  by no means a new phenomenon. However, activity which has previously been described as  “propaganda” and more recently as “disinformation” has received a considerable new impetus by  technological advancements and the propagation of the internet, in particular social media and private  messenger services. With this development, new ways of manipulation have become available to  malicious actors. In the last years, the term “disinformation”, intended as the intentional spread of false  and/or misleading information for a specific purpose, has become well-known and broadly used.  However, this definition of disinformation captures only part of the problem: the manipulation of the  content that is being pushed to distort facts and reality, to foster fear and hatred and to sow division in  societies. Other terms have also been developed, such as “computational propaganda”, “coordinated  inauthentic behaviour” or “information pollution”, to name just a few. These either incorporate new  aspects in addition to disinformation intended as above or they depict activities that go beyond its focus  on content.  The current over-abundance of terms and concepts could hamper effective responses and lead to  confusion over which phenomena or aspects thereof are actually being addressed. This is exacerbated  by the fact that the stakeholders countering such threats are diverse: from international organisations to  governments (national, regional and even local), private industry and civil society. Therefore, it is  necessary to go beyond the surface and be more specific in describing the manipulation of the information  environment the EU aims to address.  Accordingly, the European Democracy Action Plan5 called for the further refinement of the definitions, in  close cooperation with stakeholders. The European External Action Service (EEAS) has proposed the  definition of “Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference”:  “Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) describes a mostly non-illegal pattern of  behaviour that threatens or has the potential to negatively impact values, procedures and political  processes. Such activity is manipulative in character, conducted in an intentional and coordinated  manner. Actors of such activity can be state or non-state actors, including their proxies inside and outside  of their own territory.”  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0790&from=EN  Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  7  The concept of FIMI puts emphasis on manipulative behaviour as the main indicator of an attack instead  of content and its truthfulness. From this perspective, the manipulation of the information environment is  only one aspect of FIMI, although a prominent one.  The need to further step up the EU’s efforts in the area of FIMI has been highlighted in the recent  Council Conclusions on FIMI6 . Also, the Strategic Compass for Security and Defence7 stresses that  FIMI does not only constitute a threat to democracy, but also to our security. Russia’s use of information  manipulation and interference in the preparation and execution of its war of aggression against Ukraine  demonstrates this and shows how such activity constitutes an integral part of modern warfare.  Cybersecurity is an important aspect of this context. Firstly, hybrid threats make use of combinations of  cyberattacks and information manipulation to successfully materialise. Therefore, a comprehensive  analysis of related phenomena has to encompass the cybersecurity domain. Secondly, a thorough  understanding of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious actors is crucial for  effective response to threats – this corresponds to the part of the FIMI definition which speaks about a  “pattern of behaviour” and “activity [that is] manipulative in character”. In the cyber domain working with  TTPs has been an established practice for many years and can inform approaches to counter-FIMI.  1.2 SCOPE  The objective of the report is to propose and test an analytical approach describing FIMI and  manipulation of information (hereby referred to as “FIMI/disinformation”) as well as the underlying  cybersecurity elements. The peculiarity of such approach is in the combination of practices from both  the counter-FIMI and the cybersecurity communities in order to:  • Describe FIMI/disinformation, creation and dissemination behaviours as a way to  expose the activities the EU aims to prevent, deter and respond to  • Show the role of (or lack of thereof) in the production of FIMI/ disinformation, by  identifying the underlying cybersecurity elements  To do so, the proposed approach relies on two pillars:  • For cybersecurity: The open methodological framework8 used by ENISA’s annual report on  the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, the ENISA Threat Landscape Reports9  • For FIMI: The open-source DISARM framework used to capture FIMI/disinformation  In light of broader hybrid threats that cross different domains, one of the main motivations behind this  approach is to identify ways to bring the cybersecurity and FIMI communities closer together. In this  respect, the approach showcases how work on FIMI/disinformation can benefit from approaches from  the cyber domain where e.g. working with TTPs has been an established practice for many years.  A considerable part of the approach builds on the idea that a concurrent analysis of relevant events by  means of specialised frameworks that adequately describe the characteristics of the respective domains  (cybersecurity and FIMI) can yield significant intelligence and amplify joint situational awareness -  therefore allowing better identification and protect against FIMI/disinformation.  By testing the proposed approach on a real set of events, the report serves as a proof of concept for the  interoperability of the frameworks. In addition, it puts forward some preliminary conclusions on the  relationship between cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation.  IMPORTANT: Relevant statistics and findings are presented; however, it needs to be highlighted that  the findings are dependent on the limited set of specific incidents analysed and that this report is  6 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11429-2022-INIT/en/pdf  7 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/strategic-compass-security-and-defence-1_en  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  8  designed to give a first indication as food-for-thought. Future, much richer datasets and further research  will bring better insight.  As stated above, a shared understanding on how to describe the manipulation of the information  environment is key for the detection of malicious activities, information sharing and response. Against  this context, the proposed approach should not be intended as a final product, but rather as an initial,  operational contribution to this common effort. Ultimately, the ambition is to provide an input to the on- going and ever-pressing discussion on the nature and dynamics of information manipulation and  interference, including disinformation, and on how to collectively respond to this phenomenon.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience of the report consists of policy-makers, as well as of practitioners and academics from  both the counter-FIMI/Disinformation and cybersecurity communities, who could use and/or enhance  the proposed approach to describe FIMI/Disinformation incidents and define countermeasures.  1.4 STRUCTURE  The report is structured as follows:  • Section 2 presents the proposed approach, including a general overview and its categories  and definitions  • Section 3 shows how the proposed approach has been applied and tested on a limited set of  events.  • Section 4 outlines the conclusions and recommendations on different levels: technical,  strategic and political  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  9  2. PROPOSED APPROACH  As explained above, the two pillars of the proposed approach are, on one hand the framework used by  ENISA’s annual report on the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, the ENISA Threat Landscape  Reports10, and, on the other hand, the DISARM.  The former has been adapted and complemented with  practices from the counter-disinformation community, in particular with respect to the severity and the  disinformation tactics.  2.1 OVERVIEW  The table below shows an overview of the proposed approach, which is expanded in the subsequent  sections:  Table 1: Overview of the analytical framework11  Categories Description  Sectors (Primary and secondary) Open Cyber Threat Intelligence (Open  CTI) Platform  EU Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive)  Severity Reach of a FIMI/disinformation event  Duration Short/Medium/Long  Impact Domains affected  Threat actors Technical or political attribution to a state,  non-state actor or proxy  Motivation Reason underlying an information event  MITRE ATTA&CK MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise12  DISARM DISARM (DISinformation Analysis & Risk  Management) Red framework13  2.2 SECTORS AND VICTIMS AND IMPACT  The classification of the sectors and victims has been defined in order to reflect the fact that an event  directly affecting one sector/one victim or having a specific direct impact, might be designed to target  another sector/another victim and to have another impact. As an illustration, the primary target could be  the holder of a social media account that an actor breaches to gain control, but the secondary target  (the one that is the intended target of an actor) could be the followers of the account.  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  11 One of the feedbacks received from the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes suggested to consider  the platform element in the analytical framework. For example, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)  describes the medium through which the disinformation is conveyed, to include open web, social media, and messaging services.  https://github.com/DFRLab/Dichotomies-of-Disinformation#platforms.  12 https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/  13 https://disarmframework.herokuapp.com/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends https://github.com/DFRLab/Dichotomies-of-Disinformation#platforms  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  10  Although in FIMI/disinformation the secondary effect is often speculative, in an attempt to capture the  actual intent of an attacker, the events are described in terms of:  • Primary sector/victim/impact  • Secondary sector/victim/impact  Table 2: Example: fake accounts on social media posting critical allegations about a country’s government  Categories Primary Secondary  Sector  Medias and audio  visual  Citizens  Victim Public Government/Country  Impact Political Social  Concerning the sectors, the framework uses the sectors of Open Cyber Threat Intelligence (Open  CTI)14,  since they encompass a wider and hierarchical range of actors – from economic sectors to  political parties and citizens – and can more accurately reflect the wide FIMI/disinformation landscape.  In addition, it uses the list of essential sectors included in the EU Directive 2016/1148 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union  (NIS Directive)15, as well as the recently adopted revised NIS2 Directive16.  The breakdown of sectors is available on GitHub17.  The category of “Impact” is broken down as follows:  • Impact  • Financial  • Availability18  • Reputation  • Social  • Political  The break-down for the victims is outlined below.

However, it was noticed that:  • It was difficult to gauge with precision the duration of a FIMI/disinformation event – especially  in light of the fact that some events refer to incidents (one-off, unique activities) and others to  operations.  • The impact of FIMI/disinformation events would depend in particular on their outreach beyond  the initial “information bubble.”  As a consequence, it was decided to analyse duration independently and to distinguish the effects of a  FIMI/disinformation event into severity (that is, the reach of a FIMI/disinformation event) and impact  (that is, the domain affected). The tables below describe the categories of duration and severity,  whereas the impact is described in the previous section.

FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  12  2.4 THREAT ACTORS AND MOTIVATION  The classification of threat actors is based on the attribution – technical (TA) or political (PA) – and on  whether the entity identified as responsible for the event was a state actor, a non-state actor or a proxy.  Table 6: Threat actor  Threat Actor Definition  State actor PA State actor identified with political attribution i.e. through  official statements or reports  Non-State actor PA Non- State actor identified with political attribution i.e.  through official statements or reports  Proxy PA Proxy actor identified with political attribution i.e. through  official statements or reports  State actor TA State actor identified with technical attribution i.a.  through statements by victims e.g. platforms, or  independent research by civil society  Non-State actor TA Non- State actor identified with technical attribution, i.a.  through statements by victims, e.g. platforms, or  independent research by civil society  Proxy TA Proxy actor identified with technical attribution, i.a.  through statements by victims, e.g. platforms, or  independent research by civil society  Not officially attributed No information about attribution  Other Category not reflected above [free text]  The motivation has been categorised as in:  • Geopolitical  • Disruption  • Manipulation of information20  • Ideological  • Monetisation  • Other  2.5 DISARM FRAMEWORK AND MITRE ATT&CK  The DISARM (DISinformation Analysis & Risk Management) framework is designed for describing and  understanding the behavioural parts of FIMI/disinformation. The report uses the DISARM Red  framework21, which focuses on FIMI/disinformation creation and dissemination behaviours22. The  framework is inspired by the structure of the MITRE’s ATT&CK ® framework, which is a knowledge-  20 As explained in section 2.4, the category “Manipulation of information” has been used at the triage stage to identify the events in  scope of the report, which all share this motivation. Accordingly, the analysis of section 3 does not include “manipulation of  information” among the motivations.  21 https://disarmframework.herokuapp.com/  22 The other DISARM framework is called “DISARM Blue”, which focuses on disinformation countermeasures. DISARM Blue maps  response options to take in reaction to the TTPs outlined in DISARM Red.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  13  base of cyber adversary behaviour and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. The  DISARM Red Framework is a useful tool to describe FIMI TTPs. DISARM is born out of the  collaborative effort of individuals from the FIMI defender community, which introduced the concepts of  kill chain, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and behavioural fingerprints to the FIMI field. Due  to its threat-informed, open-source and community-driven nature, the DISARM framework allows to  consolidate all known FIMI TTPs. It also introduces a taxonomy for defenders to speak a common  language when describing their findings.  In the present report the DISARM framework is used jointly with MITRE ATTA&CK. MITRE ATT&CK  has two parts: ATT&CK for Enterprise, which covers behaviour against enterprise IT networks and  cloud, and ATT&CK for Mobile, which focuses on behaviour against mobile devices. The report uses  MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise23.  Both the DISARM and MITRE frameworks are structured across Tactics, Techniques and Procedures  (TTPs). During the initial phase of work on the report it was noticed that mapping events against tactics  and techniques using only one of the frameworks was not sufficient to understand both cyber and FIMI  dimensions. Hence the report suggests to use uses both frameworks to capture the entire complexity of  the events. This is a finding in itself, necessitating better and more in-depth incident reporting both in  the cyber and FIMI/disinformation domains and ensuring that the two communities exchange  information.  The joint use of the DISARM and MITRE frameworks helps identifying cybersecurity patterns used in  support of FIMI/disinformation behaviours and, at the same time, the mapping of FIMI/disinformation  patterns against cybersecurity TTPs. By analysing TTPs using only one of the two frameworks, one  might overlook TTPs from the other dimension, which could be important insights about the event as  well. FIMI/disinformation events often also incorporate a cyber element, whose analysis can assist for  the event’s attribution, as well as for the identification of indicators of compromise that enable rapid  mapping. Conversely, by analysis only cyber TTPs, important elements such as severity and impact  cannot be conceptualised and the coordinated nature of such complex events might be missed. The  complementarity of the analyses resulting from the combination of these two frameworks brings to more  comprehensive threat intelligence. This is especially important in light of hybrid campaigns and the EU’s  ambition to tackle such threats holistically. Facilitating the joint use of frameworks established for  specific domains can significantly boost comprehensive situational awareness and early warning.  Sharing insights in an interoperable way between the FIMI/disinformation and cybersecurity domains  can lead to quicker and more effective responses, mitigating the severity of harmful activities.  23 https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  14  3. TESTING THE FRAMEWORK: ANALYSIS  AND TRENDS  This section presents a proof of concept for the joint use of cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation cases  through the analysis of a set of indicative cases. The section showcases the feasibility and potential of  the proposed approach, identifies trends and patterns and yields novel insight on the complementary of  the FIMI/disinformation and cybersecurity domains, by identifying correlations among them.  IMPORTANT: As reported above, relevant statistics and findings are presented; however, it  needs to be highlighted that the findings are dependent on the limited set of specific incidents  analysed and that this report is designed to give a first indication as food-for-thought. Future,  much richer datasets and further research will bring better insight.  3.1 DATA COLLECTION AND CLEANING  The events analysed in this report are based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA  for situational awareness purposes24 and are all publicly disclosed. The scope of the collection is global  and multi-sectorial. However, events with a direct impact in the EU area are given a priority.  Specifically, the proposed approach is tested against 33 events that have been collected by ENISA in  the period from January 2020 until mid-June 2022 and that at a first triage state where identified as  motivated by the manipulation of information25. It is to be noted that singling out this motivation might  not be straightforward. For example: how should a phishing mail with false information luring the  receiver to click on a link be considered? In the context of the report, phishing would be analysed only if  it contributes to manipulating the information environment, for instance by supporting the compromise of  accounts that would facilitate the legitimisation and spread of disinformation.  Another important consideration is that it has not been possible to identify upfront which of the events  fell into the definition of FIMI, which outlines many specific features. This is normal since, as reminded  throughout the report, the proposed approach is meant to be used by the counter FIMI/disinformation  and the cybersecurity communities to improve the description of events, amplify joint situational  awareness and, as a result, it is expected to help identifying those that call for EU action with particular  attention to FIMI. After the analysis has been carried out it has been noted how not all the events  analysed could be considered FIMI, although all of them have been considered as motivated by the  manipulation of information (see above). For simplicity, the report refers to the analysed events as  FIMI/disinformation events.  Finally, one issue that emerged during the analysis is that some events referred to information/cyber  incidents that are part of the same information operation26 and others referred to information  operations composed by different information/cyber incidents. In addition, some information/cyber  incidents seem to be correlated, raising the question of how they should be counted. For simplicity and  being aware of the limitations, the report labels as “events” both information/cyber incidents and  information operations and does not group coordinated events into a single one.  24 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN)  25 As explained in section 2.4, the framework underlying the ENISA Threat Landscape includes among the possible motivations also  the category “Manipulation of information”. This category has been used to select the events to be analysed in the current report,  which are all motivated by the manipulation of information. Accordingly, this category is not reflected in the analysis of motivations in  section 3.2.3.  Still, it has been included in the description of “Motivations” as it could be used at the triage stage to identify relevant  events.  26 “Information operation’ means planned and coordinated actions and measures used to influence the target audience” - National  Cybersecurity Status Report 2020 – Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  15  3.2 APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH – DATA ANALISYS  3.2.1 Sectors, victims and impact  As stated in section 2.2, events have primary and secondary sectors, victims and impacts. The graphs  below show this duality.  Concerning the sectors, it has been analysed that more than half of the events (18) had a direct impact  on actors who are related to different aspects of a State (namely: government and administrations,  political parties; defence and legislative branch). In most of cases, citizens have not been impacted  directly, but rather as a consequence. They represent the secondary target in more than half (19) of the  events. The relevance of the media and audio-visual sector is especially noteworthy. Cybersecurity  analysis has a strong focus on critical sectors (e.g. energy or transport), whose disruption, by definition,  is particularly serious and addressed by specific legislation (e.g. NIS Directive). Clearly, in the context of  FIMI/disinformation, the sector of media and audio-visual is also to be considered as critical.  Figure 1: Primary and secondary sectors  The observations above mirror the ones on the victims, with governments being the primary victims in 17 events and  the public and individuals being secondary victims (in 22 cases).  Figure 2: Primary and secondary victims  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  16  When the impact is analysed, the results do not differ to a great extent from primary to secondary. In both cases there  is a strong focus on social and political impacts (the former more pronounced in the category of secondary impacts).  Figure 3: Primary and secondary impact  3.2.2 Severity and duration  The severity of the great majority of the events analysed is either low or medium, meaning that they  were systematically shared/noticed beyond the network that launched the incident (low severity) and left  the scope of the communication environment (medium severity), although without leading to prominent  actions in the real world.  Figure 4: Severity  Concerning the duration, it is considered based on the reported event (that is, not distinguishing among  incidents and operations). Therefore, observations related to duration are made with a low degree of  confidence. In particular, while the 10 events featuring a long duration (that is, they lasted more than  one month) correspond to operations featuring multiple incidents, it is unclear whether events with a  shorter duration are in fact incidents part of an operation extending over a longer period of time.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  17  Figure 5: Duration  3.2.3 Threat actors and motivation  The analysis of the threat actors focused on attribution. Not surprisingly, for the great majority of the  events (about 2/3), an attribution could not be found and for the remaining events technical attribution  seems to be more frequent.  Figure 6: Attribution (number of events)  The analysis showed multiple motivations underlying single events. For example, multiple social media  accounts run from a single location and perpetuating a critical narrative with respect to a government  might be motivated by ideology, but also by the willingness to disrupt. For this reason, multiple  motivations have been associated to single events.  About two-thirds of the motivations identified referred to geopolitics or disruption. The line between  disruption, ideology and geopolitics can be blurred at times since disruption can be carried out for  ideological and/or geopolitical motives. Therefore, the allocation of an event to a category could be  facilitated by a more elaborated definition of motivations. Monetisation has been identified as motivation  only in rare cases.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  18  Figure 7: Motivations associated to events  3.2.4 DISARM framework and MITRE ATT&CK  In this section the events have been mapped against both the DISARM and the MITRE ATT&CK tactics  with the ultimate goal to identify the FIMI/disinformation tactics (as defined in the DISARM framework)  that are impacted the most by cybersecurity tactics (as defined in MITRE ATT&CK). The idea is that, on  the ground, the detection of specific MITRE ATT&CK TTP(s) could act as an indicator of a  FIMI/disinformation event.  Accordingly, the analysis contained in this section starts with the identification of the most recurrent  tactics firstly as per the DISARM framework (sub-section 3.2.4.1) and, secondly, as per the MITRE  ATT&CK framework (sub-section 0). Lastly, the analysis unfolds with the joint use of the frameworks, by  showing the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques associated to the most recurrent DISARM tactics  (sub-section 0). Considerations on the affected assets are also included.  3.2.4.1 DISARM Framework perspective  The table below shows the distribution of the most recurrent tactics according to the DISARM framework. The analysis  has been carried out by associating to each FIMI/disinformation event several tactics.  Figure 8: Distribution of FIMI/disinformation tactics according to the DISARM framework  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  19  Based on the above, the most recurrent DISARM tactics are displayed in the table below. The most recurrent tactics  are those that have been identified at least 10 times27.  Table 7: Definitions of the most recurrent DISARM tactics  DISARM Tactic Definition  TA06 - Develop Content Create or acquire text, images, and other content  TA16 - Establish  Legitimacy Establish assets that create trust  TA 07- Select Channels  and Affordances  Selecting platforms and affordances assesses which online or offline platforms and  their associated affordances maximize an influence operation’s ability to reach its  target audience. To select the most appropriate platform(s), an operation may assess  the technological affordances including platform algorithms, terms of service, permitted  content types, or other attributes that determine platform usability and accessibility.  Selecting platforms includes both choosing platforms on which the operation will  publish its own content and platforms on which the operation will attempt to restrict  adversarial content.  TA15 - Establish Social  Assets  Establishing information assets generates messaging tools, including social media  accounts, operation personnel, and organizations, including directly and indirectly  managed assets. For assets under their direct control, the operation can add, change,  or remove these assets at will.  Establishing information assets allows an influence operation to promote messaging  directly to the target audience without navigating through external entities. Many online  influence operations create or compromise social media accounts as a primary vector  of information dissemination.  TA14 - Develop  Narratives  The promotion of beneficial master narratives is perhaps the most effective method for  achieving long-term strategic narrative dominance. From a \"\"whole of society\"\"  perspective the promotion of the society's core master narratives should occupy a  central strategic role. From a misinformation campaign / cognitive security perspective  the tactics around master narratives center more precisely on the day-to-day  promotion and reinforcement of this messaging. In other words, beneficial, high- coverage master narratives are a central strategic goal and their promotion constitutes  an ongoing tactical struggle carried out at a whole-of-society level. Tactically, their  promotion covers a broad spectrum of activities both on- and offline.  TA02 - Plan Objectives  Set clearly defined, measurable, and achievable objectives. Achieving objectives ties  execution of tactical tasks to reaching the desired end state. There are four primary  considerations:  - Each desired effect should link directly to one or more objectives  - The effect should be measurable  - The objective statement should not specify the way and means of accomplishment  - The effect should be distinguishable from the objective it supports as a condition for  success, not as another objective or task.  TA17- Maximize  Exposure  Maximize exposure of the target audience to incident/campaign content via flooding,  amplifying, and cross-posting.  27 It is to be noted that the tactics outlined in this graph represents more than 85% of the total.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  20  3.2.4.2 MITRE ATT&CK Framework perspective  The table below shows the distribution of the most recurrent tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK  framework. The analysis has been carried out by associating to each FIMI/disinformation event several  tactics.  Figure 9: Distribution of FIMI/disinformation tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  Based on the above, the most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics are displayed in the table below. The most recurrent  tactics are those that have been identified at least 10 times28 are: Resource development, Initial access, and Impact.  Table 8: Definitions of the most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics  MITRE ATT&CK  Tactic Definition  Resource Development  Resource Development consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating,  purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting.  Such resources include infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities. These resources can  be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such  as using purchased domains to support Command and Control, email accounts for  phishing as a part of Initial Access, or stealing code signing certificates to help with  Defense Evasion.  Initial Access  Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial  foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted  spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds  gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and  use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.  Impact  The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data.  Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or  compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques  used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases,  business processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the  adversaries’ goals. These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through  on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.  28 It is to be noted that the tactics outlined in this graph represents more than 70% of the total.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  21  3.2.4.3 DISARM and MITRE ATT&CK: Joint perspective and the role of cybersecurity  Unsurprisingly, when the DISARM and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks are applied jointly, it is noted that  the three most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned above (that is: Resource development,  Initial access and Impact) are also the most used within each DISARM tactic, as shown in the Annex.  The graphic below shows the definition of the three most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics and of the  techniques the framework associates to them.  Figure 10: Definition of the three most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques  It is important to note that these techniques are those associated to the identified tactics by the MITRE  ATT&ACK framework i.e. not all of them correspond to the analysed events. Future and more in-depth  applications of the approach proposed in this report might carry out a more detailed analysis and dig  also into the techniques. This is also due to the quality of the data, often not sufficiently precise to  determine the specific technique.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  22  An analysis of the assets impacted has been carried out, although it also suffers from the lack of  information as, in most of the cases (13 events out of 33), it has not been possible to understand which  asset had been affected by an event.  Table 9: Assets affected by FIMI/disinformation events29  3.2.4.4 The role of cybersecurity  Cybersecurity attacks play an important role in the manipulation of the information environment and, in  particular, they provide some of the tools that enable information incidents and operations, especially in  terms of content and infrastructure at the initial stages of a FIMI/disinformation event. They also play a  role in dissemination, although to a lesser extent.  The graph below conveys a qualitative analysis of the cyber-security activities that have been  associated to the most recurring DISARM tactics.  Figure 11: Role of cybersecurity (in orange boxes) across the most recurring DISARM tactics (in blue boxes)  29 Each event might be associated to more than one asset  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  23  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  4.1 TECHNICAL  4.1.1 On the analytical framework  As described in section 2, this report showcases how the interaction between frameworks developed for  different domains can lead to enhanced situational awareness. Through the application of both  frameworks to specific events, it is possible to:  • Describe FIMI/disinformation creation and dissemination behaviours  • Show the role of cybersecurity (or lack of thereof) in facilitating FIMI/disinformation by  identifying the underlying cybersecurity elements  • Expose the manipulative and harmful behaviours the EU wants to prevent, deter and respond  to by helping singling out incidents that can be considered as FIMI  Enhance the collective understanding of the kill-chain across the FIMI/disinformation and cybersecurity  domains, opening up to new and potential earlier response options While the combination of practices  from different domains can be considered overall effective, the implementation of the proposed  approach implementation reveals some peculiarities that merit attention and potentially further  refinement.  • Distinction between information/cyber incidents and operations. Somewhat differently  from the “purely” cybersecurity domain, open-source data about FIMI/disinformation events  often cover entire operations encompassing several incidents. Albeit to a lesser extent, some  reports refer to coordinated incidents distinctively. This is normal as FIMI/disinformation events  often appear as such only after “connecting the dots” of single incidents. However, it would be  important to find a common way to report on FIMI/disinformation events that manages to  consider both operations and incidents in a consistent way. The difficulty is to reconcile two  seemingly different angles. From the cybersecurity perspective, the focus on incidents is  especially important as the cybersecurity tactics are likely to change from incident to incident  within the same operation. However, from the FIMI/disinformation perspective, elements such  as motivation and impact might become evident only by considering operations in their  entirety. There is thus a growing need to consider incident reporting initiatives that are  prominent in cybersecurity, also in the field of FIMI and foster relevant information sharing  mechanisms either voluntarily (for example building on existing or new ISACs) or mandatory  (by means of legal instruments, such as NIS2 in the case of cybersecurity).  • Difficulties in establishing the duration of events. This aspect partly derives from the  previous one. A cybersecurity incident spanning over a few days might have an impact on the  information environment that goes way beyond that timeframe. In addition, it might not be  always clear what constitutes the “end” of an operation, as opposed to the “temporary pause of  an operation”. As explained,  the proposed approach has been applied in such a way that  duration is considered based on the reported event (that is, not distinguishing among incidents  and operations), which is sub-optimal. This aspect would probably not be as problematic once  a distinction between incidents and operations is made.  • DISARM vs MITRE: the importance of focusing on DISARM tactics to analyse the  cybersecurity component of information events. The DISARM framework is very good at  describing sets of (FIMI/disinformation) incidents that have a common (FIMI/disinformation)  goal and are part of the same operation, whereas MITRE is very good at describing single  (cybersecurity) incidents, regardless of whether they have the same goal or are part of the  same operation. Therefore, it has been found that the most effective way to jointly use of the  two frameworks is to analyse the MITRE tactics and techniques at the level of specific  DISARM tactics.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  24  • The primary target (in terms of victims, sectors and impact) is often not the real/main  one. The ENISA Threat Landscape identifies the sectors affected by a cyber-incident, without  the need to specify whether the sectors identified are primary or secondary targets. In the case  of FIMI/disinformation events, however, it is important to assess whether the directly affected  victim/sector/domain (primary) is the actual one or is used only as a means to reach a different  target (secondary).  • FIMI/disinformation events do not necessarily target critical sectors. The analysis of  cybersecurity incidents often focuses on critical sectors as per applicable EU legislation,  namely the NIS2 Directive. However, FIMI/disinformation events often target sectors that are  not necessarily considered critical (e.g. media) and can have disastrous consequences  regardless of the criticality of the sector impacted. The current framework includes both the  categories identified by the Open Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform and the NIS Directive.  The Open CTI Platform is deemed more appropriate for disinformation events.  4.1.2 On the role of cybersecurity  Based on the above, four areas emerge as important to tackle the manipulation of the information  environment from a cybersecurity perspective:  • The role of cybersecurity seems to be particularly important in establishing attribution.  While most of the events analysed were not attributed (see section 3.2.3), those that had  been attributed relied on a cybersecurity analysis. It would be beneficial to create a structured  link between technical attribution and FIMI/disinformation.  • The role of cyber-attacks at the initial stages of some FIMI/disinformation events,  strengthens the idea that, on the ground, the detection of specific MITRE ATT&CK  TTP(s) could act as an indicator of a FIMI/disinformation event. Seam-less cooperation  procedure between the cybersecurity and counter FIMI/disinformation communities could  yield significant benefits.  • One of the most relevant limitation in the analysis of the considered  FIMI/disinformation events has been the quality of the data. Open-source data about  FIMI/disinformation events might not contain sufficient information about its  cybersecurity aspects., FIMI/Disinformation reporting should consider this aspect  more systematically. For example, in many cases the description of the cyber-component  was not sufficiently detailed to identify the cybersecurity techniques utilised. As outlined in the  ENISA Threat Landscape 2021, more work is needed to better classify cyber incidents  related to disinformation and misinformation. On the one hand, a lot of them are classified in  other categories given that they are commonly used in complex, hybrid attacks. On the other  hand, data concerning FIMI/disinformation does not necessarily dig into cybersecurity  aspects. This shows that more cooperation between the cyber and the counter-FIMI  community is needed to bring these insights together in a more structured and systematic  manner30.  • Another limitation has been the comparability of different events, hence reporting  needs to be made as coherent as possible. Incident reporting and information exchange  are fundamental components of the lifecycle of response to both cybersecurity and  FIMI/disinformation incidents. It would be important to assess how to best integrate  cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation aspects in reporting and information exchange. The  use of DISARM in combination with MITRE ATTA&CK could constitute a starting point. Both  frameworks take into account the specificities of the respective domains to be able to analyse  and describe effectively any activity in either the cyber or FIMI domain. However, it has  30 Some examples of work in this direction: EUvsDisinfo is a project led by the EEAS that  identifies, compiles, and exposes  disinformation cases originating in pro-Kremlin media (https://euvsdisinfo.eu/); the open source threat intelligence platform MISP  which contains a “galaxy” (a method to express an object that can be attached to events or attributes) on threat actors  (https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html#_misinformation_pattern); the European Digital Media Observatory that brings together  fact-checkers, media literacy experts, and academic researchers to understand and analyse disinformation (https://edmo.eu/edmo-at- a-glance/)  Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Awareness raising  trainings on cybersecurity are becoming more and more common among organisations e.g.  on average, 61% of enterprises provide them (EU average)31. Attacks on the  governmental/public and media/audio-visual sectors (see section 3.2.1) have been identified  as instrumental in obtaining data for the development of content and dissemination and in  establishing legitimacy for the dissemination phase. Hence, it is key that awareness raising  campaigns are held for these sectors, also flagging the importance of cybersecurity as a  means to prevent, deter and respond to FIMI. Awareness raising should also include  guidance as to how identify first signals (precursors for a campaign, indicators of a campaign)  and then to inform other stakeholders. Moreover, since the more high-level the account  compromised is, the more legitimacy it has, it is important that high-profile members of  governmental/public and media/audio-visual sectors are aware of this. This aspect might be  especially relevant in the context of elections and should therefore be considered to help  boost the EU’s resilience in view of the 2024 European Parliament election.  4.2 STRATEGIC  FIMI, just like cybersecurity, is a complex, global and ever evolving threat. The vast amount of  information attacks prevents any individual defender alone to have a comprehensive and timely  overview of the threat landscape. The defender community likewise is highly complex – from  governments and international organisations to private industry and civil society as well as academia  and journalists, many different stakeholders are involved in tackling FIMI and provide essential  contributions to the overall work. Collaboration among defenders is therefore essential. Acknowledging  the parallels in the nature of the threat both communities face, we can apply concepts from the  cybersecurity community to advance our understanding of FIMI. This includes common definitions,  taxonomies and standards such as a data sharing standard, a focus on TTPs, a common methodology  and information exchange. Specifically, it is recommended to:  • Foster mutual exchanges between the cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation  community. As this report outlines, concepts of cybersecurity can be applied to the detection  and analysis of FIMI/disinformation incidents and operations. Existing frameworks,  taxonomies, tools, structures and interoperable standards from cybersecurity can be adapted  and adopted by the counter FIMI/disinformation community to speed up analytical maturity and  interoperability within and beyond the field. Indeed, incident handling and response has been  at the core of the cybersecurity community for many years, meaning that procedures and  reporting are codified32. The behaviour-focussed work on counter-FIMI/Disinformation, instead,  is relatively more recent, considering that for many years, the main focus has been laying on  “disinformation” and there with the content, not the manipulative tactics. Interoperable, reliable  and consistent analytical output by the FIMI/disinformation community can, in return, inform  cybersecurity practitioners on new and emerging motivations, targets and threat vectors. Such  exchanges can also help disrupt activities that span both domains at an earlier stage.  • Improve the availability and quality of FIMI/disinformation incident information.  Aggregable and representative information on FIMI/disinformation incidents is so far mostly  unavailable. While individual data and research exist and stakeholders do share highly  relevant insights, the sector is still underdeveloped compared to the diversity, specialisation  and quantity of information shared in the cybersecurity sector. FIMI defenders should consider  building on the behaviour (TTP) focus for FIMI detection and analysis. Organisations  maintaining FIMI SOCs can drive the development or adoption of commonly shared  31 Source: Eurostat (“Enterprises make persons employed aware of their obligations in ICT related issues” – 2019 data) -  https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do  32 For example, one important lesson from the “traditional” cybersecurity analysis is to avoid the abundance of threat actors/campaign  naming.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  26  frameworks and standards inter alia in voluntary vehicles like Information Sharing and Analysis  Centers (ISACs) for FIMI.  • Adopt and adapt standard information formats for sharing FIMI/disinformation  intelligence. The more structured information about incidents available, the higher each  investigator’s effectiveness. Building again on good case practices from cybersecurity, the  FIMI community can adopt and adapt standard information formats, such as STIX33, the  Standard Threat Information Expression language, to move beyond information sharing by  written reports. DISARM TTPs are already available as attack patterns in STIX format; other  STIX objects help to easily and comprehensively communicate important information of who  did what to whom, when, how and why. Existing STIX objects like threat actors, intrusion sets,  observables, vulnerabilities, identities etc. can already be used to communicate the majority of  relevant FIMI information. With standardised threat exchange formats automation can be  brought into the fight against FIMI and a shared threat intelligence knowledge base could be  established. With processes and approaches developed in cybersecurity, the gap between  well-resourced attackers and a decentralised but collaborative defender community could be  narrowed. By ridging cybersecurity with FIMI analyses, as defenders we have one additional  tool of threat intelligence at our disposal to better protect against relevant threats.  4.3 POLICY  Recent EU policy initiatives, such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)34, the Digital Operational  Resilience Act for the financial sector (DORA)35, Digital Services Act (DSA)36, Digital Markets Act  (DMA)37, Artificial Intelligence Act (AI)38, etc. rank cybersecurity high on the agenda across other  dimensions compared to strictly defined sectors. Likewise, the Code of Practice on Disinformation  (CoP)39, European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP)40, the DSA and the Strategic Compass for Security  and Defence41 as well as the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA)42 highlight the fundamental threat  that FIMI poses. FIMI, as outlined in this report, does not necessarily target ‘critical sectors’, but  corrodes the very basis of our democracy and security, by targeting i.a. society at large. Cybersecurity,  FIMI and hybrid threats permeate all aspects of our daily lives and thus future policy initiatives should  consider these aspects in relevant impact assessment. This leads to the following recommendations:  • The EU Institutions have expert teams dealing with FIMI and cybersecurity respectively, both  from a policy and an operational perspective. Facilitation of cooperation between those  groups should be a priority, especially in crises and surrounding important events such  as the upcoming 2024 European Elections.  • These expert teams jointly should build capacity and capability of Member States and  international partners, not only to raise awareness of the importance to bridge the silos,  but also to support them to increase their own capabilities. Based on the proposed  common definition for FIMI and the existing scope of the cybersecurity community, trainings on  applying to analytical frameworks in an interoperable way, building respective processes etc.  should be supported. Politically, the EU has committed in the Strategic Compass to build a  FIMI Data Space, to enhance the EU’s posture vis-à-vis FIMI threat actors. This could, based  on previous points, be in the shape of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC).  Exploratory work on this has already started in 2021 in the EEAS, in close exchanges with  relevant stakeholders from governments, civil society and private industry. Such a FIMI ISAC  should be set up in a timely manner and should be discussed with stakeholders from the  33 See https://stixproject.github.io/  34 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act  35 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0595  36 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package  37 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A842%3AFIN  38 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206  39 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/code-practice-disinformation  40 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/new-push-european-democracy/european-democracy-action-plan_en  41 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/strategic-compass-security-and-defence-1_en  42 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_5504  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  27  cybersecurity community, to ensure the FIMI ISAC is interoperable with existing structures in  the cybersecurity domain.

A dedicated analytical framework is put  forward, consistent with the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) methodology, with the aim of  analysing both FIMI and cybersecurity aspects of disinformation.  The concept of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) has been proposed by  the EEAS, as a response to the call of the European Democracy Action Plan1 for a further  refinement of the definitions around disinformation. Although disinformation is a prominent part  of FIMI, FIMI puts emphasis on manipulative behaviour, as opposed to the truthfulness of the  content being delivered. Several strategic documents, such as the Strategic Compass for  Security and Defence and the July 2022 Council Conclusions on FIMI, refer to the importance of  countering FIMI as well as hybrid and cyber threats.  Accordingly, in light of broader hybrid threats that cross different domains, one of the main  motivations behind this report is to identify ways to bring the cybersecurity and counter-FIMI  communities closer together. The ambition is to provide an input to the on-going and ever- pressing discussion on the nature and dynamics of information manipulation and interference,  including disinformation, and on how to collectively respond to this phenomenon.  The report proposes and tests an analytical approach describing FIMI and manipulation of  information, as well as the underlying cybersecurity elements, by combing practices from both  domains:  • For cybersecurity: The open methodological framework2 used by ENISA’s annual  report on the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, the ENISA Threat  Landscape Reports3  • For FIMI: The open-source DISARM framework used to capture FIMI/disinformation  By testing the framework on a limited set of events, the report serves as a proof of concept for  the interoperability of the frameworks. In addition, it puts forward some preliminary conclusions  on the relationship between cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation:  • Role of cybersecurity in FIMI/disinformation. Cybersecurity analysis seems to be  particularly important in establishing attribution: among the events analysed, those that  had been attributed relied on a cybersecurity analysis. In addition, cyber-attacks seem  to be more prominent at the initial stages of FIMI/disinformation events. This means  firstly that specific cyber-attack techniques could act as an indicator of a  FIMI/disinformation event and, secondly, that awareness raising is important to limit the  development or acquisition of content and the compromise of infrastructure that  facilitate dissemination.  • Importance of structured and seamless incident reporting between the  cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation community.  Consistency of data and data  quality are the main limitation to cross-domain analyses. For example, open-source  data about FIMI/disinformation events often cover entire operations encompassing  several incidents, whereas a “pure” cybersecurity perspective would tend to focus on  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0790&from=EN  2 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  FIMI  Foreign Information  Manipulation and  Interference (FIMI)  describes a mostly non- illegal pattern of  behaviour that threatens  or has the potential to  negatively impact  values, procedures and  political processes. Such  activity is manipulative in  character, conducted in  an intentional and  coordinated manner.  Actors of such activity  can be state or non-state  actors, including their  proxies inside and  outside of their own  territory.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  5  single incidents.  Also, data about FIMI/disinformation events might not contain  sufficient information about its cybersecurity aspects. In both cases, improved incident  reporting practices could help.  • Mutual exchanges between the cybersecurity and the FIMI/disinformation  community could benefit the fight against FIMI/disinformation. Since incident  handling and response has been at the core of the cybersecurity community for many  years, established cybersecurity practices can help the counter FIMI/disinformation  community speeding up analytical maturity. For example, the FIMI community can  adopt and adapt standard information formats widely used in the cybersecurity realm,  to move beyond information sharing by written reports. Conversely, the  FIMI/disinformation community can, in return, inform cybersecurity practitioners on new  and emerging motivations, targets and threat vectors.  This report has been validated and supported by the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on  Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes (CTL)4.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-threats/threats-and-trends/ad-hoc-working-group-cyber-threat-landscapes  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  6  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT  This chapter details the concepts used in the report to describe and define manipulation of information,  focusing on the activities the EU aims to address and explaining why the terminology commonly used  might not be sufficiently comprehensive and precise.  One of the most important parameters in defining the manipulation of information is the notion of  “intent”. “Misinformation”, i.e. the unintentional spread of false and/or misleading information, differs  from the intentional manipulation of the information environment. The importance of this basic  distinction is the repertoire of response options that can be used for unintentional misinformation versus  intentional information manipulation. Responses like exposing the actors responsible for such activity is  adequate if actors engage in intentional, coordinated and systematic manipulation, but not if they are  individual citizens who merely believed a false/misleading piece of information. Misinformation falls  outside the scope of this report.  Intentional attempts to manipulate the information environment and public discourse by foreign actors is  by no means a new phenomenon. However, activity which has previously been described as  “propaganda” and more recently as “disinformation” has received a considerable new impetus by  technological advancements and the propagation of the internet, in particular social media and private  messenger services. With this development, new ways of manipulation have become available to  malicious actors. In the last years, the term “disinformation”, intended as the intentional spread of false  and/or misleading information for a specific purpose, has become well-known and broadly used.  However, this definition of disinformation captures only part of the problem: the manipulation of the  content that is being pushed to distort facts and reality, to foster fear and hatred and to sow division in  societies. Other terms have also been developed, such as “computational propaganda”, “coordinated  inauthentic behaviour” or “information pollution”, to name just a few. These either incorporate new  aspects in addition to disinformation intended as above or they depict activities that go beyond its focus  on content.  The current over-abundance of terms and concepts could hamper effective responses and lead to  confusion over which phenomena or aspects thereof are actually being addressed. This is exacerbated  by the fact that the stakeholders countering such threats are diverse: from international organisations to  governments (national, regional and even local), private industry and civil society. Therefore, it is  necessary to go beyond the surface and be more specific in describing the manipulation of the information  environment the EU aims to address.  Accordingly, the European Democracy Action Plan5 called for the further refinement of the definitions, in  close cooperation with stakeholders. The European External Action Service (EEAS) has proposed the  definition of “Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference”:  “Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) describes a mostly non-illegal pattern of  behaviour that threatens or has the potential to negatively impact values, procedures and political  processes. Such activity is manipulative in character, conducted in an intentional and coordinated  manner. Actors of such activity can be state or non-state actors, including their proxies inside and outside  of their own territory.”  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0790&from=EN  Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Use only the function References/Insert Footnote  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  7  The concept of FIMI puts emphasis on manipulative behaviour as the main indicator of an attack instead  of content and its truthfulness. From this perspective, the manipulation of the information environment is  only one aspect of FIMI, although a prominent one.  The need to further step up the EU’s efforts in the area of FIMI has been highlighted in the recent  Council Conclusions on FIMI6 . Also, the Strategic Compass for Security and Defence7 stresses that  FIMI does not only constitute a threat to democracy, but also to our security. Russia’s use of information  manipulation and interference in the preparation and execution of its war of aggression against Ukraine  demonstrates this and shows how such activity constitutes an integral part of modern warfare.  Cybersecurity is an important aspect of this context. Firstly, hybrid threats make use of combinations of  cyberattacks and information manipulation to successfully materialise. Therefore, a comprehensive  analysis of related phenomena has to encompass the cybersecurity domain. Secondly, a thorough  understanding of the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious actors is crucial for  effective response to threats – this corresponds to the part of the FIMI definition which speaks about a  “pattern of behaviour” and “activity [that is] manipulative in character”. In the cyber domain working with  TTPs has been an established practice for many years and can inform approaches to counter-FIMI.  1.2 SCOPE  The objective of the report is to propose and test an analytical approach describing FIMI and  manipulation of information (hereby referred to as “FIMI/disinformation”) as well as the underlying  cybersecurity elements. The peculiarity of such approach is in the combination of practices from both  the counter-FIMI and the cybersecurity communities in order to:  • Describe FIMI/disinformation, creation and dissemination behaviours as a way to  expose the activities the EU aims to prevent, deter and respond to  • Show the role of (or lack of thereof) in the production of FIMI/ disinformation, by  identifying the underlying cybersecurity elements  To do so, the proposed approach relies on two pillars:  • For cybersecurity: The open methodological framework8 used by ENISA’s annual report on  the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, the ENISA Threat Landscape Reports9  • For FIMI: The open-source DISARM framework used to capture FIMI/disinformation  In light of broader hybrid threats that cross different domains, one of the main motivations behind this  approach is to identify ways to bring the cybersecurity and FIMI communities closer together. In this  respect, the approach showcases how work on FIMI/disinformation can benefit from approaches from  the cyber domain where e.g. working with TTPs has been an established practice for many years.  A considerable part of the approach builds on the idea that a concurrent analysis of relevant events by  means of specialised frameworks that adequately describe the characteristics of the respective domains  (cybersecurity and FIMI) can yield significant intelligence and amplify joint situational awareness -  therefore allowing better identification and protect against FIMI/disinformation.  By testing the proposed approach on a real set of events, the report serves as a proof of concept for the  interoperability of the frameworks. In addition, it puts forward some preliminary conclusions on the  relationship between cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation.  IMPORTANT: Relevant statistics and findings are presented; however, it needs to be highlighted that  the findings are dependent on the limited set of specific incidents analysed and that this report is  6 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11429-2022-INIT/en/pdf  7 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/strategic-compass-security-and-defence-1_en  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-methodology https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  8  designed to give a first indication as food-for-thought. Future, much richer datasets and further research  will bring better insight.  As stated above, a shared understanding on how to describe the manipulation of the information  environment is key for the detection of malicious activities, information sharing and response. Against  this context, the proposed approach should not be intended as a final product, but rather as an initial,  operational contribution to this common effort. Ultimately, the ambition is to provide an input to the on- going and ever-pressing discussion on the nature and dynamics of information manipulation and  interference, including disinformation, and on how to collectively respond to this phenomenon.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience of the report consists of policy-makers, as well as of practitioners and academics from  both the counter-FIMI/Disinformation and cybersecurity communities, who could use and/or enhance  the proposed approach to describe FIMI/Disinformation incidents and define countermeasures.  1.4 STRUCTURE  The report is structured as follows:  • Section 2 presents the proposed approach, including a general overview and its categories  and definitions  • Section 3 shows how the proposed approach has been applied and tested on a limited set of  events.  • Section 4 outlines the conclusions and recommendations on different levels: technical,  strategic and political  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  9  2. PROPOSED APPROACH  As explained above, the two pillars of the proposed approach are, on one hand the framework used by  ENISA’s annual report on the state of the cybersecurity threat landscape, the ENISA Threat Landscape  Reports10, and, on the other hand, the DISARM.  The former has been adapted and complemented with  practices from the counter-disinformation community, in particular with respect to the severity and the  disinformation tactics.  2.1 OVERVIEW  The table below shows an overview of the proposed approach, which is expanded in the subsequent  sections:  Table 1: Overview of the analytical framework11  Categories Description  Sectors (Primary and secondary) Open Cyber Threat Intelligence (Open  CTI) Platform  EU Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive)  Severity Reach of a FIMI/disinformation event  Duration Short/Medium/Long  Impact Domains affected  Threat actors Technical or political attribution to a state,  non-state actor or proxy  Motivation Reason underlying an information event  MITRE ATTA&CK MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise12  DISARM DISARM (DISinformation Analysis & Risk  Management) Red framework13  2.2 SECTORS AND VICTIMS AND IMPACT  The classification of the sectors and victims has been defined in order to reflect the fact that an event  directly affecting one sector/one victim or having a specific direct impact, might be designed to target  another sector/another victim and to have another impact. As an illustration, the primary target could be  the holder of a social media account that an actor breaches to gain control, but the secondary target  (the one that is the intended target of an actor) could be the followers of the account.  10 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends  11 One of the feedbacks received from the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Threat Landscapes suggested to consider  the platform element in the analytical framework. For example, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)  describes the medium through which the disinformation is conveyed, to include open web, social media, and messaging services.  https://github.com/DFRLab/Dichotomies-of-Disinformation#platforms.  12 https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/  13 https://disarmframework.herokuapp.com/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends https://github.com/DFRLab/Dichotomies-of-Disinformation#platforms  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  10  Although in FIMI/disinformation the secondary effect is often speculative, in an attempt to capture the  actual intent of an attacker, the events are described in terms of:  • Primary sector/victim/impact  • Secondary sector/victim/impact  Table 2: Example: fake accounts on social media posting critical allegations about a country’s government  Categories Primary Secondary  Sector  Medias and audio  visual  Citizens  Victim Public Government/Country  Impact Political Social  Concerning the sectors, the framework uses the sectors of Open Cyber Threat Intelligence (Open  CTI)14,  since they encompass a wider and hierarchical range of actors – from economic sectors to  political parties and citizens – and can more accurately reflect the wide FIMI/disinformation landscape.  In addition, it uses the list of essential sectors included in the EU Directive 2016/1148 concerning  measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union  (NIS Directive)15, as well as the recently adopted revised NIS2 Directive16.  The breakdown of sectors is available on GitHub17.  The category of “Impact” is broken down as follows:  • Impact  • Financial  • Availability18  • Reputation  • Social  • Political  The break-down for the victims is outlined below.

However, it was noticed that:  • It was difficult to gauge with precision the duration of a FIMI/disinformation event – especially  in light of the fact that some events refer to incidents (one-off, unique activities) and others to  operations.  • The impact of FIMI/disinformation events would depend in particular on their outreach beyond  the initial “information bubble.”  As a consequence, it was decided to analyse duration independently and to distinguish the effects of a  FIMI/disinformation event into severity (that is, the reach of a FIMI/disinformation event) and impact  (that is, the domain affected). The tables below describe the categories of duration and severity,  whereas the impact is described in the previous section.

FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  12  2.4 THREAT ACTORS AND MOTIVATION  The classification of threat actors is based on the attribution – technical (TA) or political (PA) – and on  whether the entity identified as responsible for the event was a state actor, a non-state actor or a proxy.  Table 6: Threat actor  Threat Actor Definition  State actor PA State actor identified with political attribution i.e. through  official statements or reports  Non-State actor PA Non- State actor identified with political attribution i.e.  through official statements or reports  Proxy PA Proxy actor identified with political attribution i.e. through  official statements or reports  State actor TA State actor identified with technical attribution i.a.  through statements by victims e.g. platforms, or  independent research by civil society  Non-State actor TA Non- State actor identified with technical attribution, i.a.  through statements by victims, e.g. platforms, or  independent research by civil society  Proxy TA Proxy actor identified with technical attribution, i.a.  through statements by victims, e.g. platforms, or  independent research by civil society  Not officially attributed No information about attribution  Other Category not reflected above [free text]  The motivation has been categorised as in:  • Geopolitical  • Disruption  • Manipulation of information20  • Ideological  • Monetisation  • Other  2.5 DISARM FRAMEWORK AND MITRE ATT&CK  The DISARM (DISinformation Analysis & Risk Management) framework is designed for describing and  understanding the behavioural parts of FIMI/disinformation. The report uses the DISARM Red  framework21, which focuses on FIMI/disinformation creation and dissemination behaviours22. The  framework is inspired by the structure of the MITRE’s ATT&CK ® framework, which is a knowledge-  20 As explained in section 2.4, the category “Manipulation of information” has been used at the triage stage to identify the events in  scope of the report, which all share this motivation. Accordingly, the analysis of section 3 does not include “manipulation of  information” among the motivations.  21 https://disarmframework.herokuapp.com/  22 The other DISARM framework is called “DISARM Blue”, which focuses on disinformation countermeasures. DISARM Blue maps  response options to take in reaction to the TTPs outlined in DISARM Red.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  13  base of cyber adversary behaviour and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. The  DISARM Red Framework is a useful tool to describe FIMI TTPs. DISARM is born out of the  collaborative effort of individuals from the FIMI defender community, which introduced the concepts of  kill chain, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and behavioural fingerprints to the FIMI field. Due  to its threat-informed, open-source and community-driven nature, the DISARM framework allows to  consolidate all known FIMI TTPs. It also introduces a taxonomy for defenders to speak a common  language when describing their findings.  In the present report the DISARM framework is used jointly with MITRE ATTA&CK. MITRE ATT&CK  has two parts: ATT&CK for Enterprise, which covers behaviour against enterprise IT networks and  cloud, and ATT&CK for Mobile, which focuses on behaviour against mobile devices. The report uses  MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise23.  Both the DISARM and MITRE frameworks are structured across Tactics, Techniques and Procedures  (TTPs). During the initial phase of work on the report it was noticed that mapping events against tactics  and techniques using only one of the frameworks was not sufficient to understand both cyber and FIMI  dimensions. Hence the report suggests to use uses both frameworks to capture the entire complexity of  the events. This is a finding in itself, necessitating better and more in-depth incident reporting both in  the cyber and FIMI/disinformation domains and ensuring that the two communities exchange  information.  The joint use of the DISARM and MITRE frameworks helps identifying cybersecurity patterns used in  support of FIMI/disinformation behaviours and, at the same time, the mapping of FIMI/disinformation  patterns against cybersecurity TTPs. By analysing TTPs using only one of the two frameworks, one  might overlook TTPs from the other dimension, which could be important insights about the event as  well. FIMI/disinformation events often also incorporate a cyber element, whose analysis can assist for  the event’s attribution, as well as for the identification of indicators of compromise that enable rapid  mapping. Conversely, by analysis only cyber TTPs, important elements such as severity and impact  cannot be conceptualised and the coordinated nature of such complex events might be missed. The  complementarity of the analyses resulting from the combination of these two frameworks brings to more  comprehensive threat intelligence. This is especially important in light of hybrid campaigns and the EU’s  ambition to tackle such threats holistically. Facilitating the joint use of frameworks established for  specific domains can significantly boost comprehensive situational awareness and early warning.  Sharing insights in an interoperable way between the FIMI/disinformation and cybersecurity domains  can lead to quicker and more effective responses, mitigating the severity of harmful activities.  23 https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  14  3. TESTING THE FRAMEWORK: ANALYSIS  AND TRENDS  This section presents a proof of concept for the joint use of cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation cases  through the analysis of a set of indicative cases. The section showcases the feasibility and potential of  the proposed approach, identifies trends and patterns and yields novel insight on the complementary of  the FIMI/disinformation and cybersecurity domains, by identifying correlations among them.  IMPORTANT: As reported above, relevant statistics and findings are presented; however, it  needs to be highlighted that the findings are dependent on the limited set of specific incidents  analysed and that this report is designed to give a first indication as food-for-thought. Future,  much richer datasets and further research will bring better insight.  3.1 DATA COLLECTION AND CLEANING  The events analysed in this report are based on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) collected by ENISA  for situational awareness purposes24 and are all publicly disclosed. The scope of the collection is global  and multi-sectorial. However, events with a direct impact in the EU area are given a priority.  Specifically, the proposed approach is tested against 33 events that have been collected by ENISA in  the period from January 2020 until mid-June 2022 and that at a first triage state where identified as  motivated by the manipulation of information25. It is to be noted that singling out this motivation might  not be straightforward. For example: how should a phishing mail with false information luring the  receiver to click on a link be considered? In the context of the report, phishing would be analysed only if  it contributes to manipulating the information environment, for instance by supporting the compromise of  accounts that would facilitate the legitimisation and spread of disinformation.  Another important consideration is that it has not been possible to identify upfront which of the events  fell into the definition of FIMI, which outlines many specific features. This is normal since, as reminded  throughout the report, the proposed approach is meant to be used by the counter FIMI/disinformation  and the cybersecurity communities to improve the description of events, amplify joint situational  awareness and, as a result, it is expected to help identifying those that call for EU action with particular  attention to FIMI. After the analysis has been carried out it has been noted how not all the events  analysed could be considered FIMI, although all of them have been considered as motivated by the  manipulation of information (see above). For simplicity, the report refers to the analysed events as  FIMI/disinformation events.  Finally, one issue that emerged during the analysis is that some events referred to information/cyber  incidents that are part of the same information operation26 and others referred to information  operations composed by different information/cyber incidents. In addition, some information/cyber  incidents seem to be correlated, raising the question of how they should be counted. For simplicity and  being aware of the limitations, the report labels as “events” both information/cyber incidents and  information operations and does not group coordinated events into a single one.  24 In accordance with the EU cybersecurity act Art.7 Par.6 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN)  25 As explained in section 2.4, the framework underlying the ENISA Threat Landscape includes among the possible motivations also  the category “Manipulation of information”. This category has been used to select the events to be analysed in the current report,  which are all motivated by the manipulation of information. Accordingly, this category is not reflected in the analysis of motivations in  section 3.2.3.  Still, it has been included in the description of “Motivations” as it could be used at the triage stage to identify relevant  events.  26 “Information operation’ means planned and coordinated actions and measures used to influence the target audience” - National  Cybersecurity Status Report 2020 – Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  15  3.2 APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH – DATA ANALISYS  3.2.1 Sectors, victims and impact  As stated in section 2.2, events have primary and secondary sectors, victims and impacts. The graphs  below show this duality.  Concerning the sectors, it has been analysed that more than half of the events (18) had a direct impact  on actors who are related to different aspects of a State (namely: government and administrations,  political parties; defence and legislative branch). In most of cases, citizens have not been impacted  directly, but rather as a consequence. They represent the secondary target in more than half (19) of the  events. The relevance of the media and audio-visual sector is especially noteworthy. Cybersecurity  analysis has a strong focus on critical sectors (e.g. energy or transport), whose disruption, by definition,  is particularly serious and addressed by specific legislation (e.g. NIS Directive). Clearly, in the context of  FIMI/disinformation, the sector of media and audio-visual is also to be considered as critical.  Figure 1: Primary and secondary sectors  The observations above mirror the ones on the victims, with governments being the primary victims in 17 events and  the public and individuals being secondary victims (in 22 cases).  Figure 2: Primary and secondary victims  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  16  When the impact is analysed, the results do not differ to a great extent from primary to secondary. In both cases there  is a strong focus on social and political impacts (the former more pronounced in the category of secondary impacts).  Figure 3: Primary and secondary impact  3.2.2 Severity and duration  The severity of the great majority of the events analysed is either low or medium, meaning that they  were systematically shared/noticed beyond the network that launched the incident (low severity) and left  the scope of the communication environment (medium severity), although without leading to prominent  actions in the real world.  Figure 4: Severity  Concerning the duration, it is considered based on the reported event (that is, not distinguishing among  incidents and operations). Therefore, observations related to duration are made with a low degree of  confidence. In particular, while the 10 events featuring a long duration (that is, they lasted more than  one month) correspond to operations featuring multiple incidents, it is unclear whether events with a  shorter duration are in fact incidents part of an operation extending over a longer period of time.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  17  Figure 5: Duration  3.2.3 Threat actors and motivation  The analysis of the threat actors focused on attribution. Not surprisingly, for the great majority of the  events (about 2/3), an attribution could not be found and for the remaining events technical attribution  seems to be more frequent.  Figure 6: Attribution (number of events)  The analysis showed multiple motivations underlying single events. For example, multiple social media  accounts run from a single location and perpetuating a critical narrative with respect to a government  might be motivated by ideology, but also by the willingness to disrupt. For this reason, multiple  motivations have been associated to single events.  About two-thirds of the motivations identified referred to geopolitics or disruption. The line between  disruption, ideology and geopolitics can be blurred at times since disruption can be carried out for  ideological and/or geopolitical motives. Therefore, the allocation of an event to a category could be  facilitated by a more elaborated definition of motivations. Monetisation has been identified as motivation  only in rare cases.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  18  Figure 7: Motivations associated to events  3.2.4 DISARM framework and MITRE ATT&CK  In this section the events have been mapped against both the DISARM and the MITRE ATT&CK tactics  with the ultimate goal to identify the FIMI/disinformation tactics (as defined in the DISARM framework)  that are impacted the most by cybersecurity tactics (as defined in MITRE ATT&CK). The idea is that, on  the ground, the detection of specific MITRE ATT&CK TTP(s) could act as an indicator of a  FIMI/disinformation event.  Accordingly, the analysis contained in this section starts with the identification of the most recurrent  tactics firstly as per the DISARM framework (sub-section 3.2.4.1) and, secondly, as per the MITRE  ATT&CK framework (sub-section 0). Lastly, the analysis unfolds with the joint use of the frameworks, by  showing the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques associated to the most recurrent DISARM tactics  (sub-section 0). Considerations on the affected assets are also included.  3.2.4.1 DISARM Framework perspective  The table below shows the distribution of the most recurrent tactics according to the DISARM framework. The analysis  has been carried out by associating to each FIMI/disinformation event several tactics.  Figure 8: Distribution of FIMI/disinformation tactics according to the DISARM framework  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  19  Based on the above, the most recurrent DISARM tactics are displayed in the table below. The most recurrent tactics  are those that have been identified at least 10 times27.  Table 7: Definitions of the most recurrent DISARM tactics  DISARM Tactic Definition  TA06 - Develop Content Create or acquire text, images, and other content  TA16 - Establish  Legitimacy Establish assets that create trust  TA 07- Select Channels  and Affordances  Selecting platforms and affordances assesses which online or offline platforms and  their associated affordances maximize an influence operation’s ability to reach its  target audience. To select the most appropriate platform(s), an operation may assess  the technological affordances including platform algorithms, terms of service, permitted  content types, or other attributes that determine platform usability and accessibility.  Selecting platforms includes both choosing platforms on which the operation will  publish its own content and platforms on which the operation will attempt to restrict  adversarial content.  TA15 - Establish Social  Assets  Establishing information assets generates messaging tools, including social media  accounts, operation personnel, and organizations, including directly and indirectly  managed assets. For assets under their direct control, the operation can add, change,  or remove these assets at will.  Establishing information assets allows an influence operation to promote messaging  directly to the target audience without navigating through external entities. Many online  influence operations create or compromise social media accounts as a primary vector  of information dissemination.  TA14 - Develop  Narratives  The promotion of beneficial master narratives is perhaps the most effective method for  achieving long-term strategic narrative dominance. From a \"\"whole of society\"\"  perspective the promotion of the society's core master narratives should occupy a  central strategic role. From a misinformation campaign / cognitive security perspective  the tactics around master narratives center more precisely on the day-to-day  promotion and reinforcement of this messaging. In other words, beneficial, high- coverage master narratives are a central strategic goal and their promotion constitutes  an ongoing tactical struggle carried out at a whole-of-society level. Tactically, their  promotion covers a broad spectrum of activities both on- and offline.  TA02 - Plan Objectives  Set clearly defined, measurable, and achievable objectives. Achieving objectives ties  execution of tactical tasks to reaching the desired end state. There are four primary  considerations:  - Each desired effect should link directly to one or more objectives  - The effect should be measurable  - The objective statement should not specify the way and means of accomplishment  - The effect should be distinguishable from the objective it supports as a condition for  success, not as another objective or task.  TA17- Maximize  Exposure  Maximize exposure of the target audience to incident/campaign content via flooding,  amplifying, and cross-posting.  27 It is to be noted that the tactics outlined in this graph represents more than 85% of the total.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  20  3.2.4.2 MITRE ATT&CK Framework perspective  The table below shows the distribution of the most recurrent tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK  framework. The analysis has been carried out by associating to each FIMI/disinformation event several  tactics.  Figure 9: Distribution of FIMI/disinformation tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  Based on the above, the most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics are displayed in the table below. The most recurrent  tactics are those that have been identified at least 10 times28 are: Resource development, Initial access, and Impact.  Table 8: Definitions of the most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics  MITRE ATT&CK  Tactic Definition  Resource Development  Resource Development consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating,  purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting.  Such resources include infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities. These resources can  be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such  as using purchased domains to support Command and Control, email accounts for  phishing as a part of Initial Access, or stealing code signing certificates to help with  Defense Evasion.  Initial Access  Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial  foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted  spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds  gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and  use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.  Impact  The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data.  Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or  compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques  used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases,  business processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the  adversaries’ goals. These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through  on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.  28 It is to be noted that the tactics outlined in this graph represents more than 70% of the total.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  21  3.2.4.3 DISARM and MITRE ATT&CK: Joint perspective and the role of cybersecurity  Unsurprisingly, when the DISARM and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks are applied jointly, it is noted that  the three most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics mentioned above (that is: Resource development,  Initial access and Impact) are also the most used within each DISARM tactic, as shown in the Annex.  The graphic below shows the definition of the three most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics and of the  techniques the framework associates to them.  Figure 10: Definition of the three most recurrent MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques  It is important to note that these techniques are those associated to the identified tactics by the MITRE  ATT&ACK framework i.e. not all of them correspond to the analysed events. Future and more in-depth  applications of the approach proposed in this report might carry out a more detailed analysis and dig  also into the techniques. This is also due to the quality of the data, often not sufficiently precise to  determine the specific technique.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  22  An analysis of the assets impacted has been carried out, although it also suffers from the lack of  information as, in most of the cases (13 events out of 33), it has not been possible to understand which  asset had been affected by an event.  Table 9: Assets affected by FIMI/disinformation events29  3.2.4.4 The role of cybersecurity  Cybersecurity attacks play an important role in the manipulation of the information environment and, in  particular, they provide some of the tools that enable information incidents and operations, especially in  terms of content and infrastructure at the initial stages of a FIMI/disinformation event. They also play a  role in dissemination, although to a lesser extent.  The graph below conveys a qualitative analysis of the cyber-security activities that have been  associated to the most recurring DISARM tactics.  Figure 11: Role of cybersecurity (in orange boxes) across the most recurring DISARM tactics (in blue boxes)  29 Each event might be associated to more than one asset  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  23  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  4.1 TECHNICAL  4.1.1 On the analytical framework  As described in section 2, this report showcases how the interaction between frameworks developed for  different domains can lead to enhanced situational awareness. Through the application of both  frameworks to specific events, it is possible to:  • Describe FIMI/disinformation creation and dissemination behaviours  • Show the role of cybersecurity (or lack of thereof) in facilitating FIMI/disinformation by  identifying the underlying cybersecurity elements  • Expose the manipulative and harmful behaviours the EU wants to prevent, deter and respond  to by helping singling out incidents that can be considered as FIMI  Enhance the collective understanding of the kill-chain across the FIMI/disinformation and cybersecurity  domains, opening up to new and potential earlier response options While the combination of practices  from different domains can be considered overall effective, the implementation of the proposed  approach implementation reveals some peculiarities that merit attention and potentially further  refinement.  • Distinction between information/cyber incidents and operations. Somewhat differently  from the “purely” cybersecurity domain, open-source data about FIMI/disinformation events  often cover entire operations encompassing several incidents. Albeit to a lesser extent, some  reports refer to coordinated incidents distinctively. This is normal as FIMI/disinformation events  often appear as such only after “connecting the dots” of single incidents. However, it would be  important to find a common way to report on FIMI/disinformation events that manages to  consider both operations and incidents in a consistent way. The difficulty is to reconcile two  seemingly different angles. From the cybersecurity perspective, the focus on incidents is  especially important as the cybersecurity tactics are likely to change from incident to incident  within the same operation. However, from the FIMI/disinformation perspective, elements such  as motivation and impact might become evident only by considering operations in their  entirety. There is thus a growing need to consider incident reporting initiatives that are  prominent in cybersecurity, also in the field of FIMI and foster relevant information sharing  mechanisms either voluntarily (for example building on existing or new ISACs) or mandatory  (by means of legal instruments, such as NIS2 in the case of cybersecurity).  • Difficulties in establishing the duration of events. This aspect partly derives from the  previous one. A cybersecurity incident spanning over a few days might have an impact on the  information environment that goes way beyond that timeframe. In addition, it might not be  always clear what constitutes the “end” of an operation, as opposed to the “temporary pause of  an operation”. As explained,  the proposed approach has been applied in such a way that  duration is considered based on the reported event (that is, not distinguishing among incidents  and operations), which is sub-optimal. This aspect would probably not be as problematic once  a distinction between incidents and operations is made.  • DISARM vs MITRE: the importance of focusing on DISARM tactics to analyse the  cybersecurity component of information events. The DISARM framework is very good at  describing sets of (FIMI/disinformation) incidents that have a common (FIMI/disinformation)  goal and are part of the same operation, whereas MITRE is very good at describing single  (cybersecurity) incidents, regardless of whether they have the same goal or are part of the  same operation. Therefore, it has been found that the most effective way to jointly use of the  two frameworks is to analyse the MITRE tactics and techniques at the level of specific  DISARM tactics.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  24  • The primary target (in terms of victims, sectors and impact) is often not the real/main  one. The ENISA Threat Landscape identifies the sectors affected by a cyber-incident, without  the need to specify whether the sectors identified are primary or secondary targets. In the case  of FIMI/disinformation events, however, it is important to assess whether the directly affected  victim/sector/domain (primary) is the actual one or is used only as a means to reach a different  target (secondary).  • FIMI/disinformation events do not necessarily target critical sectors. The analysis of  cybersecurity incidents often focuses on critical sectors as per applicable EU legislation,  namely the NIS2 Directive. However, FIMI/disinformation events often target sectors that are  not necessarily considered critical (e.g. media) and can have disastrous consequences  regardless of the criticality of the sector impacted. The current framework includes both the  categories identified by the Open Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform and the NIS Directive.  The Open CTI Platform is deemed more appropriate for disinformation events.  4.1.2 On the role of cybersecurity  Based on the above, four areas emerge as important to tackle the manipulation of the information  environment from a cybersecurity perspective:  • The role of cybersecurity seems to be particularly important in establishing attribution.  While most of the events analysed were not attributed (see section 3.2.3), those that had  been attributed relied on a cybersecurity analysis. It would be beneficial to create a structured  link between technical attribution and FIMI/disinformation.  • The role of cyber-attacks at the initial stages of some FIMI/disinformation events,  strengthens the idea that, on the ground, the detection of specific MITRE ATT&CK  TTP(s) could act as an indicator of a FIMI/disinformation event. Seam-less cooperation  procedure between the cybersecurity and counter FIMI/disinformation communities could  yield significant benefits.  • One of the most relevant limitation in the analysis of the considered  FIMI/disinformation events has been the quality of the data. Open-source data about  FIMI/disinformation events might not contain sufficient information about its  cybersecurity aspects., FIMI/Disinformation reporting should consider this aspect  more systematically. For example, in many cases the description of the cyber-component  was not sufficiently detailed to identify the cybersecurity techniques utilised. As outlined in the  ENISA Threat Landscape 2021, more work is needed to better classify cyber incidents  related to disinformation and misinformation. On the one hand, a lot of them are classified in  other categories given that they are commonly used in complex, hybrid attacks. On the other  hand, data concerning FIMI/disinformation does not necessarily dig into cybersecurity  aspects. This shows that more cooperation between the cyber and the counter-FIMI  community is needed to bring these insights together in a more structured and systematic  manner30.  • Another limitation has been the comparability of different events, hence reporting  needs to be made as coherent as possible. Incident reporting and information exchange  are fundamental components of the lifecycle of response to both cybersecurity and  FIMI/disinformation incidents. It would be important to assess how to best integrate  cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation aspects in reporting and information exchange. The  use of DISARM in combination with MITRE ATTA&CK could constitute a starting point. Both  frameworks take into account the specificities of the respective domains to be able to analyse  and describe effectively any activity in either the cyber or FIMI domain. However, it has  30 Some examples of work in this direction: EUvsDisinfo is a project led by the EEAS that  identifies, compiles, and exposes  disinformation cases originating in pro-Kremlin media (https://euvsdisinfo.eu/); the open source threat intelligence platform MISP  which contains a “galaxy” (a method to express an object that can be attached to events or attributes) on threat actors  (https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html#_misinformation_pattern); the European Digital Media Observatory that brings together  fact-checkers, media literacy experts, and academic researchers to understand and analyse disinformation (https://edmo.eu/edmo-at- a-glance/)  Please use footnotes for providing additional or explanatory information and/or relevant links.

Awareness raising  trainings on cybersecurity are becoming more and more common among organisations e.g.  on average, 61% of enterprises provide them (EU average)31. Attacks on the  governmental/public and media/audio-visual sectors (see section 3.2.1) have been identified  as instrumental in obtaining data for the development of content and dissemination and in  establishing legitimacy for the dissemination phase. Hence, it is key that awareness raising  campaigns are held for these sectors, also flagging the importance of cybersecurity as a  means to prevent, deter and respond to FIMI. Awareness raising should also include  guidance as to how identify first signals (precursors for a campaign, indicators of a campaign)  and then to inform other stakeholders. Moreover, since the more high-level the account  compromised is, the more legitimacy it has, it is important that high-profile members of  governmental/public and media/audio-visual sectors are aware of this. This aspect might be  especially relevant in the context of elections and should therefore be considered to help  boost the EU’s resilience in view of the 2024 European Parliament election.  4.2 STRATEGIC  FIMI, just like cybersecurity, is a complex, global and ever evolving threat. The vast amount of  information attacks prevents any individual defender alone to have a comprehensive and timely  overview of the threat landscape. The defender community likewise is highly complex – from  governments and international organisations to private industry and civil society as well as academia  and journalists, many different stakeholders are involved in tackling FIMI and provide essential  contributions to the overall work. Collaboration among defenders is therefore essential. Acknowledging  the parallels in the nature of the threat both communities face, we can apply concepts from the  cybersecurity community to advance our understanding of FIMI. This includes common definitions,  taxonomies and standards such as a data sharing standard, a focus on TTPs, a common methodology  and information exchange. Specifically, it is recommended to:  • Foster mutual exchanges between the cybersecurity and FIMI/disinformation  community. As this report outlines, concepts of cybersecurity can be applied to the detection  and analysis of FIMI/disinformation incidents and operations. Existing frameworks,  taxonomies, tools, structures and interoperable standards from cybersecurity can be adapted  and adopted by the counter FIMI/disinformation community to speed up analytical maturity and  interoperability within and beyond the field. Indeed, incident handling and response has been  at the core of the cybersecurity community for many years, meaning that procedures and  reporting are codified32. The behaviour-focussed work on counter-FIMI/Disinformation, instead,  is relatively more recent, considering that for many years, the main focus has been laying on  “disinformation” and there with the content, not the manipulative tactics. Interoperable, reliable  and consistent analytical output by the FIMI/disinformation community can, in return, inform  cybersecurity practitioners on new and emerging motivations, targets and threat vectors. Such  exchanges can also help disrupt activities that span both domains at an earlier stage.  • Improve the availability and quality of FIMI/disinformation incident information.  Aggregable and representative information on FIMI/disinformation incidents is so far mostly  unavailable. While individual data and research exist and stakeholders do share highly  relevant insights, the sector is still underdeveloped compared to the diversity, specialisation  and quantity of information shared in the cybersecurity sector. FIMI defenders should consider  building on the behaviour (TTP) focus for FIMI detection and analysis. Organisations  maintaining FIMI SOCs can drive the development or adoption of commonly shared  31 Source: Eurostat (“Enterprises make persons employed aware of their obligations in ICT related issues” – 2019 data) -  https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do  32 For example, one important lesson from the “traditional” cybersecurity analysis is to avoid the abundance of threat actors/campaign  naming.  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  26  frameworks and standards inter alia in voluntary vehicles like Information Sharing and Analysis  Centers (ISACs) for FIMI.  • Adopt and adapt standard information formats for sharing FIMI/disinformation  intelligence. The more structured information about incidents available, the higher each  investigator’s effectiveness. Building again on good case practices from cybersecurity, the  FIMI community can adopt and adapt standard information formats, such as STIX33, the  Standard Threat Information Expression language, to move beyond information sharing by  written reports. DISARM TTPs are already available as attack patterns in STIX format; other  STIX objects help to easily and comprehensively communicate important information of who  did what to whom, when, how and why. Existing STIX objects like threat actors, intrusion sets,  observables, vulnerabilities, identities etc. can already be used to communicate the majority of  relevant FIMI information. With standardised threat exchange formats automation can be  brought into the fight against FIMI and a shared threat intelligence knowledge base could be  established. With processes and approaches developed in cybersecurity, the gap between  well-resourced attackers and a decentralised but collaborative defender community could be  narrowed. By ridging cybersecurity with FIMI analyses, as defenders we have one additional  tool of threat intelligence at our disposal to better protect against relevant threats.  4.3 POLICY  Recent EU policy initiatives, such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)34, the Digital Operational  Resilience Act for the financial sector (DORA)35, Digital Services Act (DSA)36, Digital Markets Act  (DMA)37, Artificial Intelligence Act (AI)38, etc. rank cybersecurity high on the agenda across other  dimensions compared to strictly defined sectors. Likewise, the Code of Practice on Disinformation  (CoP)39, European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP)40, the DSA and the Strategic Compass for Security  and Defence41 as well as the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA)42 highlight the fundamental threat  that FIMI poses. FIMI, as outlined in this report, does not necessarily target ‘critical sectors’, but  corrodes the very basis of our democracy and security, by targeting i.a. society at large. Cybersecurity,  FIMI and hybrid threats permeate all aspects of our daily lives and thus future policy initiatives should  consider these aspects in relevant impact assessment. This leads to the following recommendations:  • The EU Institutions have expert teams dealing with FIMI and cybersecurity respectively, both  from a policy and an operational perspective. Facilitation of cooperation between those  groups should be a priority, especially in crises and surrounding important events such  as the upcoming 2024 European Elections.  • These expert teams jointly should build capacity and capability of Member States and  international partners, not only to raise awareness of the importance to bridge the silos,  but also to support them to increase their own capabilities. Based on the proposed  common definition for FIMI and the existing scope of the cybersecurity community, trainings on  applying to analytical frameworks in an interoperable way, building respective processes etc.  should be supported. Politically, the EU has committed in the Strategic Compass to build a  FIMI Data Space, to enhance the EU’s posture vis-à-vis FIMI threat actors. This could, based  on previous points, be in the shape of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC).  Exploratory work on this has already started in 2021 in the EEAS, in close exchanges with  relevant stakeholders from governments, civil society and private industry. Such a FIMI ISAC  should be set up in a timely manner and should be discussed with stakeholders from the  33 See https://stixproject.github.io/  34 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act  35 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0595  36 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package  37 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A842%3AFIN  38 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206  39 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/code-practice-disinformation  40 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/new-push-european-democracy/european-democracy-action-plan_en  41 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/strategic-compass-security-and-defence-1_en  42 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_5504  FOREIGN INFORMATION MANIPULATION AND INTERFERENCE (FIMI) AND  CYBERSECURITY – THREAT LANDSCAPE  27  cybersecurity community, to ensure the FIMI ISAC is interoperable with existing structures in  the cybersecurity domain.

    "abstract": "The EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the European External Action Service (EEAS) have joined forces to study and analyse the threat landscape concerning Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and disinformation. A dedicated analytical framework is put forward, consistent with the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) methodology, with the aim of analysing both FIMI and cybersecurity aspects of disinformation. The concept of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) has been proposed by the EEAS, as a response to the call of the European Democracy Action Plan for a further refinement of the definitions around disinformation. Although disinformation is a prominent part of FIMI, FIMI puts emphasis on manipulative behaviour, as opposed to the truthfulness of the content being delivered. Several strategic documents, such as the Strategic Compass for Security and Defence and the July 2022 Council Conclusions on FIMI, refer to the importance of countering FIMI as well as hybrid and cyber threats."

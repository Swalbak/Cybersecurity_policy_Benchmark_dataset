This document provides the results of an assessment of the maturity of the implementation of the  European Cyber Security Standardisation activities in the EU Member States with respect to the NIS  Directive concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems  across the Union. The main assertions this report makes include the following:   Standardisation for compliance with the NIS Directive is essential;   Recognition of standardisation in policy is low;   Utilisation of standards give value to Member States and their infrastructure;   Utilisation of standards raises Cyber Security levels;   Utilisation of standards provides sustainability and interoperability at European level.  The current market research has clearly shown that the information security/cyber security standard  development ecosystem is healthy and fast moving. Few gaps actually exist and to implement the NIS  Directive choosing the rights ones and implementing them is of paramount importance.  In the scope of this survey a questionnaire was sent to the Member States representatives and used as the  basis of data gathering either in the form of interviews, or by directly completing it and sending responses  to the authors. A summary of the responses given have been collated and summarised.  The content of these responses does not allow to identify whether Member States perceive the existence  of a gap in current available standardisation. However, the content, and general limitations in the cohesion  amongst Member States suggests that there is insufficient guidance from the specialists in the field (e.g.  national normalization institutes, European institutions etc.), on which of the many standards available are  to be used.  It is reasonably straightforward and it follows on the current rate on transposition, to suggest that all  Member States are aware of the NIS Directive and their responsibilities in implementing it. What is less  clear is the role that standards have in the NIS Directive implementation.  There is insufficient information with regard to the responses to conclude that a lack of knowledge of  standards exists. This suggests however that if an appropriate standard is available, it will be adopted. For  example, even though the ISO27000 series of standards are in the form of broad guidance, there is a well- established eco-system that addresses their implementation.  A major concern is that the NIS Directive domain, and compliance with the NIS Directive requirements, is  often perceived as a purely national prerogative. Where international, cross-border, information sharing is  required, this has been perceived as in the domain of existing CSIRT relationships used for reporting  security incidents and not directly as an element of NIS Directive compliance.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  05  At the operational level there is very little specified for standards-based NIS Directive compliance and this  is one area where ETSI, for example, has made some contributions. However, there are no mandates at  either national or European level to guide this activity at the implementation level.  In light of the above, the following solutions are recommended to mitigate the lack of overall awareness  and trainings on the role of standards in NIS Directive compliance and to encourage wide deployment of  common security platforms in the OES and PDS entities:  • Training initiatives by the European Commission and ENISA through workshops for Member  States’ relevant agencies  • Promotion of new work items in the European SDOs for some areas (e.g. criteria for defining OES /  DSP) or the adoption of appropriate standards in Europe where existing (for example information  exchange, where several mature efforts already are in place, like STIX )  • Repeat the information gathering as performed within the elaboration of this study after an  adequate interval of time  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  06  1. Introduction  This report is an extension of previous ENISA work on approaches to the Directive on security of network  and information systems (“NIS Directive”)1  by Member States, which:   have made recommendations on standardisation (i.e. \"Gaps in NIS standardisation -  Recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy”2)   have outlined the use and management of CSIRTs, which is directly referred to in Article 12 of the  NIS Directive that seeks to establish a CSIRTs network \"in order to contribute to developing  confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational  cooperation\".  ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively supports the cooperation among the  CSIRTs. An up to date inventory of CSIRTs is also maintained by ENISA3.  There are several assertions to take into account when discussing standardisation and EU policies:   Standardisation for compliance with the intentions of the NIS Directive is essential;   Recognition of standardisation in policy is generally low;   Utilisation of standards give value to Member States and their infrastructure;   Utilisation of standards raises Cyber Security levels;   Utilisation of standards provides sustainability and interoperability at European level.  The role of standards in general is described in section 4 of this report, where also the structure of the  European Standards process and a review of the core bodies involved is given.  The prevailing practice in European Standardisation is that standards are voluntary and are not cited by  policy. With a few exceptions for standards that have a direct impact on regulated resources (e.g. radio  bandwidth) or on safety there are very few domains where standards are harmonised across the EU and  again in most cases voluntary adherence to common standards is the common practice. Only when it is  shown that no effective standards exist is it expected that the EU will become directly involved by  provision of a standard and its enforcement.  Specific recommendations made in the report \"Gaps in NIS Standardisation\" include the need to reach  consensus among Member States and major partners on:  • Architectures, interfaces, and information exchange expressions  • Standards and specifications  It is also strongly recommended that given the strong similarities of the NIS Directive and USA  Cybersecurity Act, that these two implementations be implemented after taking consideration of each  other’s features to the extent possible, including common architectures, interfaces, structured information  expressions and privacy filters including taking the following actions:  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/gaps-eu-standardisation  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/gaps-eu-standardisation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  07  • Develop a means for Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) and Information  Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) to fit into the NIS Directive model and  architecture  • Develop a means for Public Electronic Communication Networks or Publicly Available  Electronic Communication Service Providers under EU Directive 2002/21/EC and Trust  Providers to fit into the NIS Directive model and architecture  • Develop additional border gateway defence and threat exchange standards for one  Essential Service (Digital Infrastructure Internet Exchange Points)  • Develop a means for NFV, SDN, MEC and other virtualised infrastructures and services to  fit into the NIS Directive model and architecture  when considering the role of CSIRTs, ISAOs and ISACs in the context of NISD it has been previously  reported that there are no globally cited standards for interoperability of CSIRTS in support of the NIS  Directive. The concern implicit in the NIS Directive is that there are insufficient measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union. The recommendations in  this document taken along with those in the report are intended to provide a means to close the gap and  to highlight those areas of standardisation that the authors of this report believe should be promoted by  Member States.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  08  2. Scope  This report provides the results of an assessment of the maturity of the implementation of the European  Cyber Security Standardisation activities in the EU Member States with respect to the NIS Directive  concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the  Union.  This report is the outcome of work undertaken under ENISA Work Programme 2017, Strategic Objective 1,  part of Work Package 1.3. - Research & Development, Innovation. The objective of this report is therefore  to provide a concise assessment of the maturity of the implementation of the European Security  Standardisation activities in the EU Member States. The document includes the results of a fact gathering  by series of interviews with selected Member States to ascertain the level of knowledge in the Member  States of the deployment of NIS related standards that have been cited as being publicly available, or in  the course of open development, to meet specific needs for IT products, systems and services.  In undertaking the analysis an assessment of the factors that are limiting or reducing the adoption of  standards in NIS is given. This complements the previously published work from ENISA in identifying any  potential gaps in NIS standardisation in terms of content or process and in this report provides  recommendations for the future development of standards in the area of the NIS directive.  This report provides for identification of standards related to the NIS Directive and their uptake at the  Member States level. A dedicated section contains the questions used as the basis of data gathering; a  summary of the responses given have been collated and are summarised in the next section of this report.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  09  3. Definitions  Formally speaking, the output of a Standards Development Organisation (SDO) may be considered as a  standard. However, within that broad definition there is a large number of types of standards that are  available. The following table has been taken from the working practices of each of CEN and ETSI (two of  the three SDOs officially recognized as competent in the area of voluntary technical standardization in  Europe4 – ESOs, and those with a specific duty to address ICT standardisation).

It has to be noted that at the international level there are three globally recognised  Standardisation bodies  (also by the EU Regulation 1025/2012) – ISO, IEC, and ITU. These organisations also develop relevant  standards to NIS. Thus an ISO standard can be cited and may be cross-published under the provisions of  the Vienna and Frankfurt agreements. In some domains, particularly in the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27, \"IT  security\", is a joint committee developing standards in management systems, evaluation certification,  application security and privacy.  In the technical domain standards can be broadly seen to support aspects of the CIA paradigm as it is  understood in information security, i.e. to address requirements for Confidentiality, Integrity and  Availability of a system.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  12  4. Standards related to the Network and Information Security Directive  This section identifies standards having relation to the NIS Directive.  International Standards  4.1.1 ISO  In ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27 a large number of standards may be applicable when putting NIS Directive into force.  The key documents are listed below.  Information systems management systems to provide guidance and best practices for IT management:   ISO/IEC 27000 Information security management systems - Overview and Vocabulary.   ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systems – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27002 Code of practice for information security controls.   ISO/IEC 27005 Information security risk management   ISO/IEC 27007 Information security management systems - auditor guidelines   ISO/IEC 27008 Guidelines for auditors on ISMS controls   ISO/IEC 27009 Sector-specific application of ISO/IEC 27001 – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27019 Information security management guidelines based on ISO/IEC 27002 for process  control systems specific to the energy utility industry  Evaluation techniques and methods to provide assurance:   ISO/IEC 15408 Common criteria   ISO/IEC 15446 Guide for the production of Protection Profiles and Security Targets   ISO/IEC 17825 Side channels attacks characterization   ISO/IEC 18045 Common criteria evaluation method   ISO/IEC 18367 Cryptographic algorithms and security mechanisms conformance testing   ISO/IEC 19608 Guidance for developing security and privacy functional requirements based on  ISO/IEC 15408   ISO/IEC 19790 Security requirements for cryptographic modules   ISO/IEC 19896 Competence requirements for information security testers and evaluators  o Part 1 Introduction, concepts and general requirements  o Part 2 Knowledge, skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 19790 testers  o Part 3 Knowledge skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 15408 evaluators   ISO/IEC 19989 Security evaluation of presentation attack detection for biometrics  o Part 1 Framework  o Part 2 Biometric recognition performance  o Part 3 Presentation attack detection  Application security management:   ISO/IEC 27032 Guidelines for cyber security   ISO/IEC 27034 Application security  o Part 1 Concepts and overview  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  13  o Part 2 Organisation normative framework  o Part 3 Application security management process  o Part 4 Application security validation  o Part 5 Protocols and application security controls data structure  o Part 6 Security guidance for specific applications  o Part 7 Application security assurance prediction model »   ISO/IEC 27035 Information security incident management  o Part 1 Principles on incident management  o Part 2 Guidelines to plan and prepare for incident response  o Part 3 Guidelines for incident response operations   ISO/IEC 27036 Information Security for Supplier Relationships  o Part 1 Overview and Concepts.  o Part 2 Requirements.  o Part 3 Guidelines for ICT supply chain security.  o Part 4 Guidelines for security of cloud services  European Standards  4.2.1 CEN and CENELEC  In 2017 CEN and CENELEC established a new joint Technical committee, TC 13 on “Cybersecurity and data  protection”, which intends to develop standards and guidelines in support of EU policies. As of writing of  this report, no deliverables have been published by TC13, nor has any publicly information been made  available.  4.2.2 ETSI  There is a broad set of technologies being addressed across ETSI’s Technical Bodies including CYBER5, NFV6  that prepare standardisation related documents that may be used in support of NISD compliance. The  following is a selection of the publications from ETSI TC CYBER that apply:   TR 103 303, Protection measures for ICT in the context of CI   TR 103 309, Secure by Default adoption – Platform Security Technology   TS 103 487, Security baseline requirements for sensitive functions for NFV and related platforms   TR 103 305, Security Assurance by Default; Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence   TR 103 331, CYBER Structured threat information sharing   TR 103 456, NIS Directive Implementation  NOTE: The above provides guidance on the available technical specifications and those in development by major  cyber security communities  The work performed by the Industry Specification Group (ISG)7 Information Security Indicators (ISI)8 is also  of interest for application in the NISD domain. The following ETSI publication is of specific interest in the  NISD domain for reporting and classifying security events:  5 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/cyber-security  6 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv  7 http://www.etsi.org/about/how-we-work/how-we-organize-our-work/industry-specification-groups-isgs  8 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/information-security-indicators  http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/cyber-security http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv http://www.etsi.org/about/how-we-work/how-we-organize-our-work/industry-specification-groups-isgs http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/information-security-indicators  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  14   ETSI GS ISI Information Security Indicators (ISI); Key Performance Security Indicators (KPSIs) to evaluate  the maturity of security event detection  4.2.3 Other bodies  At the European level the work already carried out by the European Network for Critical Infrastructure  Protection (ERNCIP)9 should be taken into consideration, even if not strictly part of standardization  activities.  Conclusions  The current market research has clearly shown that the information security/cyber security standard  development ecosystem is healthy and fast moving. Few gaps actually exist and to implement the NIS  Directive choosing the rights ones and implementing them is of paramount importance. For that to  happen, however, the organizations tasked with the actual, technical compliance with NIS Directive need  to be aware of the multiplicity of standards and guidelines available and also that - if possible - all EU  Member States adopt the same ones. In the next chapter the questionnaire that the expert group  developed to assess recognition of standards across the EU will be presented.  9 https://erncip-project.jrc.ec.europa.eu/  https://erncip-project.jrc.ec.europa.eu/  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  15  5. Questionnaire  This section of the report contains the questions used as the basis of data gathering either in the form of  interviews with representatives of the Member States, or by the Member State directly completing the  questionnaire and sending their responses to the authors. A summary of the responses given have been  collated and are summarised in the next section of this report.  A significant observation of the data gathering exercise has been to recognise that many Member States  have reserved the right to not directly participate in this work and optional interviews necessary to  complete the questionnaires. One reason is that in undertaking activity to allow national NIS Directive  compliance a number of concurrent work items has been in progress. Such work in progress related to the  national implementation and understanding of the NIS Directive, and of the impact of the NIS Directive on  existing intra- and inter-Member State activities in the cyber-security domain, has been stated as  significantly limiting the time to address the questionnaire. However, in most cases the Member States  have made public some or all of their cyber-security plans, including those relating to the NIS Directive,  and the content of the present report has been compiled from examination of such sources.  However, with respect to the role of standards, it has been noted that most of the responders to the  questionnaire (either by analysis of MS publications or by direct response) are not familiar with either  existing standards or with current work in progress.  It may be reasonably noted that at the policy level a  statement of intent to interwork with other Member States, and to ensure that NIS Directive obligations to  interwork may be seen to imply a requirement for standardisation without having to directly being able to  cite the standards to be used at that policy level.  In response it is considered that further communication effort has to be launched by ENISA and partner  agencies in Member States in order to further promote and get support on standardisation work. For  example, whilst the ISO 270xx family is often cited, the other work done or in progress is clearly not well  known.  Overview  The questions are grouped as follows:   Standardisation awareness  o The aim here is to directly address article 14(2) and article 16(2) and to drive the answers towards  the intent of article 19 to support standardisation and the deployment/acceptance of open  international standards at the core of the NIS Directive implementation   Organisation and authority  o These questions are intended to ensure that Member States have the relevant structures in place  in order to manage the NIS requirements and to distinguish the implementation phase from the  operational phase   Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)  o These questions address how CSIRTs interoperate (ideally focussing the answers on common  standards)  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  16  Standardisation awareness questions  NUMBER QUESTION  PRO-FORMA ANSWER FOR  GUIDANCE  1  How does the MS ensure that operators of essential  services have taken measures to prevent and minimise  the impact of incidents affecting the security of their  network and information systems?  1a  Using International standards and guidelines published  by a recognised European Standards Body (i.e.  CEN/CENELEC/ETSI)  Please identify the list of  standards  1b  Using recognised standards from other standards  development organisations and publishers (e.g. ITU-T,  IETF, ISO, IEC  Please identify the list of  standards, e.g. ISO 27001,  ISO 27018  1c  Using industry standards agreed by specific industrial  sectors  Please identify the list of  standards  1d Independent OES assessment by market regulator  Provide details of MS  assessment scheme  1e  Guidance and recommendations provided by the  Member State  Provide copies of MS  guidance  1f Other Freeform text expected  2  How does the MS ensure that providers of digital  services (as defined in Annex III of NISD) have taken  measures to prevent and minimise the impact of  incidents affecting the security of their network and  information systems?  2a  Using International standards and guidelines published  by a recognised European Standards Body (i.e.  CEN/CENELEC/ETSI)  Please identify the list of  standards  2b  Using recognised standards from other standards  development organisations and publishers (e.g. ITU-T,  IETF, ISO, IEC  Please identify the list of  standards, e.g. ISO 27001,  ISO 27018  2c  Using industry standards agreed by specific industrial  sectors  Please identify the list of  standards  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  17  2d Independent OES assessment by market regulator  Provide details of MS  assessment scheme  2e  Guidance and recommendations provided by the  Member State  Provide copies of MS  guidance  2f Other Freeform text expected  Organisation and Authority questions  NUMBER QUESTION  PRO-FORMA ANSWER FOR GUIDANCE  3  Do you have a nominated single point of contact  for the implementation of the NISD?

Analysis of results  As noted in section 5 a series of questions have been raised the aim of which has been to directly address  article 14(2) and article 16(2) and to drive the answers towards the intent of article 19 to support  standardisation and the deployment/acceptance of open international standards at the core of the NISD  implementation. The results, however, of the questionnaire are not conclusive.  General observations  The content of the responses to the questionnaire does not allow to identify if the Member States perceive  the existence of a gap in available standardisation. However, the content, and general lack of cohesion  amongst Member States suggests that there is insufficient guidance from the specialists in the field (e.g.  national normalization institutes, European institutions etc.), on which of the many standards available are  to be used.  NOTE: For the purposes of this report the SDOs are not considered as experts in the field as their primary  purpose is to prepare standards. As a direct consequence of their business model standards will overlap  and compete. For example, in the world of security there are a large number of 128-bit block cipher  algorithms, all of which perform essentially the same function of maintaining confidentiality of data, but  cannot interoperate. Which is the correct one to choose? If the policy level standard is to use 128-bit  encryption additional guidance is required to select algorithm and mode of operation. This is a secondary  level of standardisation and may in turn require a tertiary level to be invoked and specified.  An impression of the standards gap identified in the responses is typified in the cartoon:  Drawing courtesy of XKCD10  In layman’s terms it is clear that there are lots of standards but it is not clear which to use. Adding a new  standard for a perceived gap results in another standard, whereas an impression of the lack of simple  10 https://xkcd.com/  http://www.xkcd.com/ https://xkcd.com/  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  22  answers to this part of the questionnaire may rather be that an authority should state which standard to  use for which part of NIS Directive compliance. It is noted that this is the direction taken by ETSI in TR 103  46511.  Observations related to ESOs  6.2.1 ETSI  The following set of observations have been noted and published by ETSI in TR 103 456:   There is basically no cyber security standards gap  o There are several standards available, perhaps one could note, even too many, and many  are not actionable or particularly useful  o The real need is to converge toward useful, practical, actionable, interoperable sets of  standards  o Standards that are not freely available on‐line, constantly evolving, and well‐versioned  have diminished value and represent cyber security impediments  o TC CYBER sought to discover the ecosystem and focus on identifying the most effective  platforms and specifications and that have the broadest industry support   There are no simple or easy cyber security solutions  o Cybersecurity as such is not achievable given the enormity of constantly evolving  vulnerabilities  o What you can do is implement sets of defence measures (Critical Security Controls), and  threat exchange measures (STIX ensemble or equivalent) that can reduce the risks  o Whilst encryption has positive benefits, there are adverse effects of end‐to‐end encryption  which need urgent attention  o Rapidly evolving new industry platforms such as NFV‐SDN/5G and quantum computing  need urgent attention to control the cyber security risks  The suite of recommendations made in TR 103 456 are the following:   Operators of essential services  o The operators of Essential Services should be encouraged to adopt common interoperable  platforms such as STIX or equivalent for cyber threat intelligence sharing and the Critical  Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence, as well as critical capabilities such as the  Middlebox Security Protocol to deal with the mounting challenges of encrypted traffic   Digital service providers  o Digital Service Provider should be encouraged to adopt common interoperable platforms  such as STIX or equivalent for cyber threat intelligence sharing and the Critical Security  Controls for Effective Cyber Defence, as well as critical capabilities such as the Middlebox  Security Protocol to deal with the mounting challenges of encrypted traffic   Facilitative mechanisms for network and information security  o In general, the use of the facilitative mechanisms described in Part 4 of TR 103 305,  “CYBER; Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence,” including privacy impact  assessments, mappings to national cyber security frameworks, cyber hygiene programmes,  and governance strategies, can significantly enhance network and information security.  11 ETSI Technical Report: Implementation of the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103400_103499/103456/01.01.01_60/tr_103456v010101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103400_103499/103456/01.01.01_60/tr_103456v010101p.pdf  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  23  6.2.2 CEN and ISO   Operators of essential services  o ISO/IEC 2700x family offers security requirements in order to achieve good practice level  and provide information system management evaluation   Digital service providers  o ISO/IEC 2700x can be recommended in order to achieve good practice level and provide  information system management evaluation   Facilitative mechanisms for network and information security  o ISO/IEC 27044 offers standards on security event format standard consistent with the one  developed by ISI group in ETSI  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  24  7. Conclusions  General summary and review  It is reasonably straightforward to see that all Member States have a high degree of understanding of the  NIS Directive and their responsibilities in implementing it; this can be evidenced through the degree of  transposition of the directive across the Member States and the ensuing preparations at Member State  level. What is less clear is what role standards can further have in the NIS Directive implementation  process.  Most Member States have a clear understanding of their role at national and regional level. Those Member  States with a well-established security agency that functions within their public administration, appear to  have integrated the responsibilities emanating from the NIS Directive (and similar EU initiatives) with their  existing agencies competences and have done so with only minor updates in the legal framework and  operating procedures. As there are already well established paths for cross border co-operation in security,  the obligations of the NIS Directive typically take advantage of them.  What may be the most apparent is the absence of a specific standard to define each Operator of Essential  Services (OES) and Digital Service Provider (DSP) but even without such a standard, or at least a standard  for the metrics to allow their identification, each Member State has developed a method to identify them.  However at a later stage and as the internal market integration progresses, further consolidation in this  area is foreseeable.  How to enhance the uptake of standards at MS?  There is insufficient information in the responses to conclude that there is a lack of knowledge of  standards. This suggests however that if an appropriate standard is available, it will be adopted. For  example, even though the ISO27000 series of standards are in the form of broad guidance, there is a well- established eco-system that addresses their implementation. The preconditions for uptake of a standard  are well known:   Existence of the standard that is seen as essential by their stakeholders   A support infrastructure to oversee the implementation and maintenance of the standard on  behalf of the stakeholders  In the context of the NIS Directive there has been no clear requirement expressed by the stakeholders to  define additional standards. It may be that in time to come such requirements may be expressed and the  support infrastructure be built. A shortcut that may be envisaged is to provide a specific support  infrastructure. Such an infrastructure should be able to specify exactly which standards Member States  need to implement in support of the NIS Directive and for them to task the ESOs to develop specific  standards.  What are the limiting factors and how to mitigate them?  A major concern is that the NIS Directive domain, and compliance to the NIS Directive requirements, is  often perceived as a purely national prerogative. Where international, cross-border, information sharing is  required, this has been perceived as in the domain of existing CSIRT relationships used for reporting  security incidents and not directly as an element of NIS Directive compliance.  With regards to understanding of the role of standards, as they apply to NIS Directive compliance, there is  somewhat limited awareness. In part this is implied from the responses indicating that from a Member  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  25  State point of view NIS Directive is mostly a policy issue dealing with requirements that are placed on  Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Providers of Digital Services (PDS). Once the policy is established,  and under active management, the Member States may make a reasonable claim that they have complied  to NIS Directive. However, at this point the OES and PDS entities may be trans-national and their best  interests in complying to the delegated elements of NIS Directive may be met by very specific standards. In  the first part of this process, where policy and process management functions apply, it is the set of security  management standards that are both most deployed and for which there is most awareness, i.e. the ISO  27000 series of standards and guidelines.  At the operational level there is very little specified for standards-based NIS Directive compliance and this  is one area where ETSI, for example, has made some contributions. However, there are no mandates at  either national or European level to guide this activity at the implementation level. Given the importance  standards however it is important to aim at specific technical levels of knowledge and understanding that  can be attained through proper training.  In light of the above, the following solutions are recommended to mitigate the lack of overall awareness  and trainings on the role of standards in NIS Directive compliance and to encourage wide deployment of  common security platforms in the OES and PDS entities:   Training initiatives by the European Commission and ENISA through workshops for Member States’  relevant agencies   Promotion of new work items in the European SDOs for some areas (e.g. criteria for defining OES /  DSP) or the adoption of appropriate standards in Europe where existing (for example information  exchange, where several mature efforts already are in place, like STIX12)   Repeat the information gathering as performed within the elaboration of this study after an  adequate interval of time  Additional considerations  A set of standardization requests identifying those standards which may be used to state NIS Directive  compliance (when conformed with) should be drafted. To this aim, the expertise pool of the European  Standardization Organizations could be used, when needed.  12 https://stixproject.github.io/  https://stixproject.github.io/  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  TP-02-18-011-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-249-3,  DOI 10.2824/176720",

This document provides the results of an assessment of the maturity of the implementation of the  European Cyber Security Standardisation activities in the EU Member States with respect to the NIS  Directive concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems  across the Union. The main assertions this report makes include the following:   Standardisation for compliance with the NIS Directive is essential;   Recognition of standardisation in policy is low;   Utilisation of standards give value to Member States and their infrastructure;   Utilisation of standards raises Cyber Security levels;   Utilisation of standards provides sustainability and interoperability at European level.  The current market research has clearly shown that the information security/cyber security standard  development ecosystem is healthy and fast moving. Few gaps actually exist and to implement the NIS  Directive choosing the rights ones and implementing them is of paramount importance.  In the scope of this survey a questionnaire was sent to the Member States representatives and used as the  basis of data gathering either in the form of interviews, or by directly completing it and sending responses  to the authors. A summary of the responses given have been collated and summarised.  The content of these responses does not allow to identify whether Member States perceive the existence  of a gap in current available standardisation. However, the content, and general limitations in the cohesion  amongst Member States suggests that there is insufficient guidance from the specialists in the field (e.g.  national normalization institutes, European institutions etc.), on which of the many standards available are  to be used.  It is reasonably straightforward and it follows on the current rate on transposition, to suggest that all  Member States are aware of the NIS Directive and their responsibilities in implementing it. What is less  clear is the role that standards have in the NIS Directive implementation.  There is insufficient information with regard to the responses to conclude that a lack of knowledge of  standards exists. This suggests however that if an appropriate standard is available, it will be adopted. For  example, even though the ISO27000 series of standards are in the form of broad guidance, there is a well- established eco-system that addresses their implementation.

Introduction  This report is an extension of previous ENISA work on approaches to the Directive on security of network  and information systems (“NIS Directive”)1  by Member States, which:   have made recommendations on standardisation (i.e. \"Gaps in NIS standardisation -  Recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy”2)   have outlined the use and management of CSIRTs, which is directly referred to in Article 12 of the  NIS Directive that seeks to establish a CSIRTs network \"in order to contribute to developing  confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational  cooperation\".  ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively supports the cooperation among the  CSIRTs. An up to date inventory of CSIRTs is also maintained by ENISA3.  There are several assertions to take into account when discussing standardisation and EU policies:   Standardisation for compliance with the intentions of the NIS Directive is essential;   Recognition of standardisation in policy is generally low;   Utilisation of standards give value to Member States and their infrastructure;   Utilisation of standards raises Cyber Security levels;   Utilisation of standards provides sustainability and interoperability at European level.  The role of standards in general is described in section 4 of this report, where also the structure of the  European Standards process and a review of the core bodies involved is given.  The prevailing practice in European Standardisation is that standards are voluntary and are not cited by  policy. With a few exceptions for standards that have a direct impact on regulated resources (e.g. radio  bandwidth) or on safety there are very few domains where standards are harmonised across the EU and  again in most cases voluntary adherence to common standards is the common practice. Only when it is  shown that no effective standards exist is it expected that the EU will become directly involved by  provision of a standard and its enforcement.  Specific recommendations made in the report \"Gaps in NIS Standardisation\" include the need to reach  consensus among Member States and major partners on:  • Architectures, interfaces, and information exchange expressions  • Standards and specifications  It is also strongly recommended that given the strong similarities of the NIS Directive and USA  Cybersecurity Act, that these two implementations be implemented after taking consideration of each  other’s features to the extent possible, including common architectures, interfaces, structured information  expressions and privacy filters including taking the following actions:  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/gaps-eu-standardisation  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/gaps-eu-standardisation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  07  • Develop a means for Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) and Information  Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) to fit into the NIS Directive model and  architecture  • Develop a means for Public Electronic Communication Networks or Publicly Available  Electronic Communication Service Providers under EU Directive 2002/21/EC and Trust  Providers to fit into the NIS Directive model and architecture  • Develop additional border gateway defence and threat exchange standards for one  Essential Service (Digital Infrastructure Internet Exchange Points)  • Develop a means for NFV, SDN, MEC and other virtualised infrastructures and services to  fit into the NIS Directive model and architecture  when considering the role of CSIRTs, ISAOs and ISACs in the context of NISD it has been previously  reported that there are no globally cited standards for interoperability of CSIRTS in support of the NIS  Directive. The concern implicit in the NIS Directive is that there are insufficient measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union. The recommendations in  this document taken along with those in the report are intended to provide a means to close the gap and  to highlight those areas of standardisation that the authors of this report believe should be promoted by  Member States.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  08  2. Scope  This report provides the results of an assessment of the maturity of the implementation of the European  Cyber Security Standardisation activities in the EU Member States with respect to the NIS Directive  concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the  Union.  This report is the outcome of work undertaken under ENISA Work Programme 2017, Strategic Objective 1,  part of Work Package 1.3. - Research & Development, Innovation. The objective of this report is therefore  to provide a concise assessment of the maturity of the implementation of the European Security  Standardisation activities in the EU Member States. The document includes the results of a fact gathering  by series of interviews with selected Member States to ascertain the level of knowledge in the Member  States of the deployment of NIS related standards that have been cited as being publicly available, or in  the course of open development, to meet specific needs for IT products, systems and services.  In undertaking the analysis an assessment of the factors that are limiting or reducing the adoption of  standards in NIS is given. This complements the previously published work from ENISA in identifying any  potential gaps in NIS standardisation in terms of content or process and in this report provides  recommendations for the future development of standards in the area of the NIS directive.  This report provides for identification of standards related to the NIS Directive and their uptake at the  Member States level. A dedicated section contains the questions used as the basis of data gathering; a  summary of the responses given have been collated and are summarised in the next section of this report.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  09  3. Definitions  Formally speaking, the output of a Standards Development Organisation (SDO) may be considered as a  standard. However, within that broad definition there is a large number of types of standards that are  available. The following table has been taken from the working practices of each of CEN and ETSI (two of  the three SDOs officially recognized as competent in the area of voluntary technical standardization in  Europe4 – ESOs, and those with a specific duty to address ICT standardisation).

It has to be noted that at the international level there are three globally recognised  Standardisation bodies  (also by the EU Regulation 1025/2012) – ISO, IEC, and ITU. These organisations also develop relevant  standards to NIS. Thus an ISO standard can be cited and may be cross-published under the provisions of  the Vienna and Frankfurt agreements. In some domains, particularly in the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27, \"IT  security\", is a joint committee developing standards in management systems, evaluation certification,  application security and privacy.  In the technical domain standards can be broadly seen to support aspects of the CIA paradigm as it is  understood in information security, i.e. to address requirements for Confidentiality, Integrity and  Availability of a system.  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  12  4. Standards related to the Network and Information Security Directive  This section identifies standards having relation to the NIS Directive.  International Standards  4.1.1 ISO  In ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 27 a large number of standards may be applicable when putting NIS Directive into force.  The key documents are listed below.  Information systems management systems to provide guidance and best practices for IT management:   ISO/IEC 27000 Information security management systems - Overview and Vocabulary.   ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systems – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27002 Code of practice for information security controls.   ISO/IEC 27005 Information security risk management   ISO/IEC 27007 Information security management systems - auditor guidelines   ISO/IEC 27008 Guidelines for auditors on ISMS controls   ISO/IEC 27009 Sector-specific application of ISO/IEC 27001 – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27019 Information security management guidelines based on ISO/IEC 27002 for process  control systems specific to the energy utility industry  Evaluation techniques and methods to provide assurance:   ISO/IEC 15408 Common criteria   ISO/IEC 15446 Guide for the production of Protection Profiles and Security Targets   ISO/IEC 17825 Side channels attacks characterization   ISO/IEC 18045 Common criteria evaluation method   ISO/IEC 18367 Cryptographic algorithms and security mechanisms conformance testing   ISO/IEC 19608 Guidance for developing security and privacy functional requirements based on  ISO/IEC 15408   ISO/IEC 19790 Security requirements for cryptographic modules   ISO/IEC 19896 Competence requirements for information security testers and evaluators  o Part 1 Introduction, concepts and general requirements  o Part 2 Knowledge, skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 19790 testers  o Part 3 Knowledge skills and effectiveness requirements for ISO/IEC 15408 evaluators   ISO/IEC 19989 Security evaluation of presentation attack detection for biometrics  o Part 1 Framework  o Part 2 Biometric recognition performance  o Part 3 Presentation attack detection  Application security management:   ISO/IEC 27032 Guidelines for cyber security   ISO/IEC 27034 Application security  o Part 1 Concepts and overview  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  13  o Part 2 Organisation normative framework  o Part 3 Application security management process  o Part 4 Application security validation  o Part 5 Protocols and application security controls data structure  o Part 6 Security guidance for specific applications  o Part 7 Application security assurance prediction model »   ISO/IEC 27035 Information security incident management  o Part 1 Principles on incident management  o Part 2 Guidelines to plan and prepare for incident response  o Part 3 Guidelines for incident response operations   ISO/IEC 27036 Information Security for Supplier Relationships  o Part 1 Overview and Concepts.  o Part 2 Requirements.  o Part 3 Guidelines for ICT supply chain security.  o Part 4 Guidelines for security of cloud services  European Standards  4.2.1 CEN and CENELEC  In 2017 CEN and CENELEC established a new joint Technical committee, TC 13 on “Cybersecurity and data  protection”, which intends to develop standards and guidelines in support of EU policies. As of writing of  this report, no deliverables have been published by TC13, nor has any publicly information been made  available.  4.2.2 ETSI  There is a broad set of technologies being addressed across ETSI’s Technical Bodies including CYBER5, NFV6  that prepare standardisation related documents that may be used in support of NISD compliance. The  following is a selection of the publications from ETSI TC CYBER that apply:   TR 103 303, Protection measures for ICT in the context of CI   TR 103 309, Secure by Default adoption – Platform Security Technology   TS 103 487, Security baseline requirements for sensitive functions for NFV and related platforms   TR 103 305, Security Assurance by Default; Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence   TR 103 331, CYBER Structured threat information sharing   TR 103 456, NIS Directive Implementation  NOTE: The above provides guidance on the available technical specifications and those in development by major  cyber security communities  The work performed by the Industry Specification Group (ISG)7 Information Security Indicators (ISI)8 is also  of interest for application in the NISD domain. The following ETSI publication is of specific interest in the  NISD domain for reporting and classifying security events:  5 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/cyber-security  6 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv  7 http://www.etsi.org/about/how-we-work/how-we-organize-our-work/industry-specification-groups-isgs  8 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/information-security-indicators  http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/cyber-security http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv http://www.etsi.org/about/how-we-work/how-we-organize-our-work/industry-specification-groups-isgs http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/information-security-indicators  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  14   ETSI GS ISI Information Security Indicators (ISI); Key Performance Security Indicators (KPSIs) to evaluate  the maturity of security event detection  4.2.3 Other bodies  At the European level the work already carried out by the European Network for Critical Infrastructure  Protection (ERNCIP)9 should be taken into consideration, even if not strictly part of standardization  activities.  Conclusions  The current market research has clearly shown that the information security/cyber security standard  development ecosystem is healthy and fast moving. Few gaps actually exist and to implement the NIS  Directive choosing the rights ones and implementing them is of paramount importance. For that to  happen, however, the organizations tasked with the actual, technical compliance with NIS Directive need  to be aware of the multiplicity of standards and guidelines available and also that - if possible - all EU  Member States adopt the same ones. In the next chapter the questionnaire that the expert group  developed to assess recognition of standards across the EU will be presented.  9 https://erncip-project.jrc.ec.europa.eu/  https://erncip-project.jrc.ec.europa.eu/  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  15  5. Questionnaire  This section of the report contains the questions used as the basis of data gathering either in the form of  interviews with representatives of the Member States, or by the Member State directly completing the  questionnaire and sending their responses to the authors. A summary of the responses given have been  collated and are summarised in the next section of this report.  A significant observation of the data gathering exercise has been to recognise that many Member States  have reserved the right to not directly participate in this work and optional interviews necessary to  complete the questionnaires. One reason is that in undertaking activity to allow national NIS Directive  compliance a number of concurrent work items has been in progress. Such work in progress related to the  national implementation and understanding of the NIS Directive, and of the impact of the NIS Directive on  existing intra- and inter-Member State activities in the cyber-security domain, has been stated as  significantly limiting the time to address the questionnaire. However, in most cases the Member States  have made public some or all of their cyber-security plans, including those relating to the NIS Directive,  and the content of the present report has been compiled from examination of such sources.  However, with respect to the role of standards, it has been noted that most of the responders to the  questionnaire (either by analysis of MS publications or by direct response) are not familiar with either  existing standards or with current work in progress.  It may be reasonably noted that at the policy level a  statement of intent to interwork with other Member States, and to ensure that NIS Directive obligations to  interwork may be seen to imply a requirement for standardisation without having to directly being able to  cite the standards to be used at that policy level.  In response it is considered that further communication effort has to be launched by ENISA and partner  agencies in Member States in order to further promote and get support on standardisation work. For  example, whilst the ISO 270xx family is often cited, the other work done or in progress is clearly not well  known.  Overview  The questions are grouped as follows:   Standardisation awareness  o The aim here is to directly address article 14(2) and article 16(2) and to drive the answers towards  the intent of article 19 to support standardisation and the deployment/acceptance of open  international standards at the core of the NIS Directive implementation   Organisation and authority  o These questions are intended to ensure that Member States have the relevant structures in place  in order to manage the NIS requirements and to distinguish the implementation phase from the  operational phase   Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)  o These questions address how CSIRTs interoperate (ideally focussing the answers on common  standards)  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  16  Standardisation awareness questions  NUMBER QUESTION  PRO-FORMA ANSWER FOR  GUIDANCE  1  How does the MS ensure that operators of essential  services have taken measures to prevent and minimise  the impact of incidents affecting the security of their  network and information systems?  1a  Using International standards and guidelines published  by a recognised European Standards Body (i.e.  CEN/CENELEC/ETSI)  Please identify the list of  standards  1b  Using recognised standards from other standards  development organisations and publishers (e.g. ITU-T,  IETF, ISO, IEC  Please identify the list of  standards, e.g. ISO 27001,  ISO 27018  1c  Using industry standards agreed by specific industrial  sectors  Please identify the list of  standards  1d Independent OES assessment by market regulator  Provide details of MS  assessment scheme  1e  Guidance and recommendations provided by the  Member State  Provide copies of MS  guidance  1f Other Freeform text expected  2  How does the MS ensure that providers of digital  services (as defined in Annex III of NISD) have taken  measures to prevent and minimise the impact of  incidents affecting the security of their network and  information systems?  2a  Using International standards and guidelines published  by a recognised European Standards Body (i.e.  CEN/CENELEC/ETSI)  Please identify the list of  standards  2b  Using recognised standards from other standards  development organisations and publishers (e.g. ITU-T,  IETF, ISO, IEC  Please identify the list of  standards, e.g. ISO 27001,  ISO 27018  2c  Using industry standards agreed by specific industrial  sectors  Please identify the list of  standards  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  17  2d Independent OES assessment by market regulator  Provide details of MS  assessment scheme  2e  Guidance and recommendations provided by the  Member State  Provide copies of MS  guidance  2f Other Freeform text expected  Organisation and Authority questions  NUMBER QUESTION  PRO-FORMA ANSWER FOR GUIDANCE  3  Do you have a nominated single point of contact  for the implementation of the NISD?

Analysis of results  As noted in section 5 a series of questions have been raised the aim of which has been to directly address  article 14(2) and article 16(2) and to drive the answers towards the intent of article 19 to support  standardisation and the deployment/acceptance of open international standards at the core of the NISD  implementation. The results, however, of the questionnaire are not conclusive.  General observations  The content of the responses to the questionnaire does not allow to identify if the Member States perceive  the existence of a gap in available standardisation. However, the content, and general lack of cohesion  amongst Member States suggests that there is insufficient guidance from the specialists in the field (e.g.  national normalization institutes, European institutions etc.), on which of the many standards available are  to be used.  NOTE: For the purposes of this report the SDOs are not considered as experts in the field as their primary  purpose is to prepare standards. As a direct consequence of their business model standards will overlap  and compete. For example, in the world of security there are a large number of 128-bit block cipher  algorithms, all of which perform essentially the same function of maintaining confidentiality of data, but  cannot interoperate. Which is the correct one to choose? If the policy level standard is to use 128-bit  encryption additional guidance is required to select algorithm and mode of operation. This is a secondary  level of standardisation and may in turn require a tertiary level to be invoked and specified.  An impression of the standards gap identified in the responses is typified in the cartoon:  Drawing courtesy of XKCD10  In layman’s terms it is clear that there are lots of standards but it is not clear which to use. Adding a new  standard for a perceived gap results in another standard, whereas an impression of the lack of simple  10 https://xkcd.com/  http://www.xkcd.com/ https://xkcd.com/  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  22  answers to this part of the questionnaire may rather be that an authority should state which standard to  use for which part of NIS Directive compliance. It is noted that this is the direction taken by ETSI in TR 103  46511.  Observations related to ESOs  6.2.1 ETSI  The following set of observations have been noted and published by ETSI in TR 103 456:   There is basically no cyber security standards gap  o There are several standards available, perhaps one could note, even too many, and many  are not actionable or particularly useful  o The real need is to converge toward useful, practical, actionable, interoperable sets of  standards  o Standards that are not freely available on‐line, constantly evolving, and well‐versioned  have diminished value and represent cyber security impediments  o TC CYBER sought to discover the ecosystem and focus on identifying the most effective  platforms and specifications and that have the broadest industry support   There are no simple or easy cyber security solutions  o Cybersecurity as such is not achievable given the enormity of constantly evolving  vulnerabilities  o What you can do is implement sets of defence measures (Critical Security Controls), and  threat exchange measures (STIX ensemble or equivalent) that can reduce the risks  o Whilst encryption has positive benefits, there are adverse effects of end‐to‐end encryption  which need urgent attention  o Rapidly evolving new industry platforms such as NFV‐SDN/5G and quantum computing  need urgent attention to control the cyber security risks  The suite of recommendations made in TR 103 456 are the following:   Operators of essential services  o The operators of Essential Services should be encouraged to adopt common interoperable  platforms such as STIX or equivalent for cyber threat intelligence sharing and the Critical  Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence, as well as critical capabilities such as the  Middlebox Security Protocol to deal with the mounting challenges of encrypted traffic   Digital service providers  o Digital Service Provider should be encouraged to adopt common interoperable platforms  such as STIX or equivalent for cyber threat intelligence sharing and the Critical Security  Controls for Effective Cyber Defence, as well as critical capabilities such as the Middlebox  Security Protocol to deal with the mounting challenges of encrypted traffic   Facilitative mechanisms for network and information security  o In general, the use of the facilitative mechanisms described in Part 4 of TR 103 305,  “CYBER; Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defence,” including privacy impact  assessments, mappings to national cyber security frameworks, cyber hygiene programmes,  and governance strategies, can significantly enhance network and information security.  11 ETSI Technical Report: Implementation of the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103400_103499/103456/01.01.01_60/tr_103456v010101p.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103400_103499/103456/01.01.01_60/tr_103456v010101p.pdf  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  23  6.2.2 CEN and ISO   Operators of essential services  o ISO/IEC 2700x family offers security requirements in order to achieve good practice level  and provide information system management evaluation   Digital service providers  o ISO/IEC 2700x can be recommended in order to achieve good practice level and provide  information system management evaluation   Facilitative mechanisms for network and information security  o ISO/IEC 27044 offers standards on security event format standard consistent with the one  developed by ISI group in ETSI  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  24  7. Conclusions  General summary and review  It is reasonably straightforward to see that all Member States have a high degree of understanding of the  NIS Directive and their responsibilities in implementing it; this can be evidenced through the degree of  transposition of the directive across the Member States and the ensuing preparations at Member State  level. What is less clear is what role standards can further have in the NIS Directive implementation  process.  Most Member States have a clear understanding of their role at national and regional level. Those Member  States with a well-established security agency that functions within their public administration, appear to  have integrated the responsibilities emanating from the NIS Directive (and similar EU initiatives) with their  existing agencies competences and have done so with only minor updates in the legal framework and  operating procedures. As there are already well established paths for cross border co-operation in security,  the obligations of the NIS Directive typically take advantage of them.  What may be the most apparent is the absence of a specific standard to define each Operator of Essential  Services (OES) and Digital Service Provider (DSP) but even without such a standard, or at least a standard  for the metrics to allow their identification, each Member State has developed a method to identify them.  However at a later stage and as the internal market integration progresses, further consolidation in this  area is foreseeable.  How to enhance the uptake of standards at MS?  There is insufficient information in the responses to conclude that there is a lack of knowledge of  standards. This suggests however that if an appropriate standard is available, it will be adopted. For  example, even though the ISO27000 series of standards are in the form of broad guidance, there is a well- established eco-system that addresses their implementation. The preconditions for uptake of a standard  are well known:   Existence of the standard that is seen as essential by their stakeholders   A support infrastructure to oversee the implementation and maintenance of the standard on  behalf of the stakeholders  In the context of the NIS Directive there has been no clear requirement expressed by the stakeholders to  define additional standards. It may be that in time to come such requirements may be expressed and the  support infrastructure be built. A shortcut that may be envisaged is to provide a specific support  infrastructure. Such an infrastructure should be able to specify exactly which standards Member States  need to implement in support of the NIS Directive and for them to task the ESOs to develop specific  standards.  What are the limiting factors and how to mitigate them?  A major concern is that the NIS Directive domain, and compliance to the NIS Directive requirements, is  often perceived as a purely national prerogative. Where international, cross-border, information sharing is  required, this has been perceived as in the domain of existing CSIRT relationships used for reporting  security incidents and not directly as an element of NIS Directive compliance.  With regards to understanding of the role of standards, as they apply to NIS Directive compliance, there is  somewhat limited awareness. In part this is implied from the responses indicating that from a Member  Improving recognition of ICT security standards  Version: 1.0  |  December 2017  25  State point of view NIS Directive is mostly a policy issue dealing with requirements that are placed on  Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Providers of Digital Services (PDS). Once the policy is established,  and under active management, the Member States may make a reasonable claim that they have complied  to NIS Directive. However, at this point the OES and PDS entities may be trans-national and their best  interests in complying to the delegated elements of NIS Directive may be met by very specific standards. In  the first part of this process, where policy and process management functions apply, it is the set of security  management standards that are both most deployed and for which there is most awareness, i.e. the ISO  27000 series of standards and guidelines.  At the operational level there is very little specified for standards-based NIS Directive compliance and this  is one area where ETSI, for example, has made some contributions. However, there are no mandates at  either national or European level to guide this activity at the implementation level. Given the importance  standards however it is important to aim at specific technical levels of knowledge and understanding that  can be attained through proper training.  In light of the above, the following solutions are recommended to mitigate the lack of overall awareness  and trainings on the role of standards in NIS Directive compliance and to encourage wide deployment of  common security platforms in the OES and PDS entities:   Training initiatives by the European Commission and ENISA through workshops for Member States’  relevant agencies   Promotion of new work items in the European SDOs for some areas (e.g. criteria for defining OES /  DSP) or the adoption of appropriate standards in Europe where existing (for example information  exchange, where several mature efforts already are in place, like STIX12)   Repeat the information gathering as performed within the elaboration of this study after an  adequate interval of time  Additional considerations  A set of standardization requests identifying those standards which may be used to state NIS Directive  compliance (when conformed with) should be drafted. To this aim, the expertise pool of the European  Standardization Organizations could be used, when needed.  12 https://stixproject.github.io/  https://stixproject.github.io/  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  TP-02-18-011-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-249-3,  DOI 10.2824/176720",

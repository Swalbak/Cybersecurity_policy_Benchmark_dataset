Over the last decade, there has been a significant development of privacy standards, which aim at  contributing to the integration of privacy requirements into information processes, systems and services.  Such integration is fundamental for the protection of individuals’ personal identifiable information (PII),  particularly in digital environments, while it may also support the implementation of relevant privacy and  data protection legislation.  Against this background, ENISA elaborated further on the area of privacy standards considering the  developments at legislative, policy, and standardisation level. The current study explores how the  standards-developing world is responding to the fast-changing, demanding realm of privacy by mapping  existing available standards and initiatives in the area and provides insights on the “state-of-the-art” of  privacy standards in the information security context through a relevant gap analysis. To this end, the main  findings of the study are presented below.  International vs. European standards  Since the references to standards in the Union legislation are becoming more regular, and there are  considerable differences of Union privacy and security regulations with other jurisdictions, the need for  analysis of mapping of international standards and European regulatory requirements is intensified.  Standardisation and conformity assessment mechanisms in information security  Proving compliance with privacy standards in information security is not as straightforward as one would  expect. While there are some approaches for conformity assessment available in specific sectors, others  are still lacking appropriate mechanisms.  Selection, agreement, and prioritisation of standardization activities  A consistent analysis of sector-specific needs for privacy standardisation is essential, especially in the  context of information security, before moving ahead with the adoption or development of new standards.  Through such an analysis, common issues that may be addressed with baseline cross-sector standards, and  additional issues to be dealt with in sector-specific standards can be identified and thus avoid duplication  of efforts.  The role of technology and privacy by design  Standardisation activity is mainly focused on covering technological approaches/solutions. Among those  solutions, many address the introduction of privacy-preserving technologies throughout the whole lifecycle  of a product or a system. Despite a general common agreement on the value of privacy by design, the  concept and its implementation are still not clearly elucidated in standardization activities.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  06  1. Introduction  Importance of privacy standards in the information security context  Standards are essential components of almost all aspects of the organisation and functioning of modern  societies. Critical infrastructures, quality management, and a broad range of other topics are covered by  the standardisation activity of Standards Development Organisations (SDOs). Standards are also of great  importance for information security. Through the development and adoption of standards, best practices  are shared among organisations, integration and interoperability of systems is promoted, complex  environments are simplified, and information systems are shielded against cyber threats.1  However, there are also challenges in the deployment and use of standards. Based on previous work of  ENISA in this area2,3&4, it is apparent that information security standards do not evolve in a pace  commensurate with the perceived threat level, and that there is lack of awareness and information among  stakeholders (e.g. public authorities or Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs)) that could adopt and benefit  from them. Additionally, there is limited coordination among SDOs, which results in the proliferation of  multiple standards on one topic and scarcity of standards on another.  Privacy standards can be seen as an application area of the broader area of information security standards.  Over the last decade, there has been a significant development of privacy standards, as illustrated by the  activities of ISO/EC, CEN and CENELEC discussed in Sections 3 and 4 respectively, which aim at contributing  to the integration of privacy requirements into information processes, systems and services. Such  integration is fundamental for the protection of individuals’ personal identifiable information (PII),  particularly in digital environments, while it may also support the implementation of relevant privacy and  data protection legislation (e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR in EU5). This having said,  the inherent limitations of standardisation activities are also present in this area, especially with regard to  co-ordination and coverage of the whole spectrum of requirements that is relevant to privacy.  In 2017, the first edition of the CEN-CENELEC - ENISA workshop6 on standards took place in Brussels under  the theme “Cybersecurity and Data Protection Standards”. In the course of this workshop, the need to  identify and possibly adopt standards by relevant stakeholders already available or under development in  the area of Network and Information Security (NIS) was highlighted, towards supporting the EU Digital  Single Market and the underlying EU policy and regulatory framework. In that workshop, privacy standards  were particularly outlined as an important area (under the broader area of NIS) where further work is  needed, in terms of both gap analysis, as well as technical implementation.  Against this background, ENISA, in its 2018 programming document7 elaborated further on the area of  privacy standards. As the Agency has by virtue of its Regulation a role on standards, it is logical that  addressing standards associated with privacy is a reasonable extension of its work. The expected outcome  of this undertaking is that greater understanding by means of analysis can be reached and that gaps can be  1 Steve Purser, Standards for Cyber Security, in Hathaway, Melissa (ed.)

As a result,  stakeholders interested in network and information security measures concerning PII, can get better  control and enhance their ability to successfully mitigate risks identified.  Aim and structure of the report  Building on the previous studies of ENISA and considering the developments at legislative, policy, and  standardisation level, this study aims to:   explore how the standards-developing world is responding to the fast-changing, demanding realm of  privacy by mapping existing available standards and initiatives in the area and   provide insights on the “state-of-the-art” of privacy standards in the information security context  through a relevant gap analysis.  It is important to stress that, although information security standards have a broader scope than privacy  standards, the latter is an essential part of the former. In the context of this report, the focus is mainly on  the information security dimension of these standards, while also providing a general description of their  overall application area.  To this end, the study provides an overview of existing standardisation initiatives at European Union and  international level. At the European level, the study examines the European Standards Organisations  (ESOs): CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI 8. At international level, the focus is on the following organisations: the  International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Committee  (IEC).  Next, standards are presented per organisation and categories of standard, namely fundamental  standards, specifications, guidelines and codes of practice.9 Moreover, the study presents the results of a  gap analysis, which may indicate possible next areas to be considered towards the development or  repositioning of standards/ongoing initiatives. The report concludes with a number of additional  considerations drawn by the research conducted for the study and the contributors’ and reviewers’  expertise and engagement in the area of standardisation.  The intended audience of the study is NIS practitioners and relevant MS authorities, while on the other  hand it is also meant to serve as a non-binding guidance document for ESO’s.  Methodological approach  Following the discussion on the existing SDO’s and working groups, the gap analysis is based on the Privacy  Principles provided in the broadly referenced fundamental standard ISO/IEC 2910010. This international  standard entails a privacy framework comprising of common privacy terminology, actors and roles, privacy  safeguarding considerations and privacy principles for information technology. The Privacy Principles have  been developed taking into account the privacy principles adopted in different countries and regions, such  8 See Art.2 (8) and (9) Regulation (EU) 1025/2012 .  9 https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/Information-about-standards/different-types-of-standards/  10 ISO/IEC 29100:2011 Information technology - Security techniques - Privacy framework  https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/Information-about-standards/different-types-of-standards/  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  08  as the Fair Information Principles in the US11 and the Data Quality principles of the EU data protection  legislation,12 as well as the OECD guidelines on privacy.13  Key concepts discussed within the study  Information Security:  Preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. In addition, other  properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation, and reliability can also be involved. 14  Standard: Technical specification, adopted by a recognised standardisation body, for repeated or continuous  application, with which compliance is not compulsory. 15  Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information that (a) can be used to identify the PII principal to  whom such information relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a PII principal.  Privacy Standard: Standard that includes privacy controls, requirements and/or guidance related to the  processing of personally identifiable information. The focus of the study is mainly on the information  security dimension of privacy standards.  Privacy Controls: Measures that treat privacy risks by reducing their likelihood or their consequences. According  to ISO/IEC 29100: 2011 Privacy controls include organizational, physical and technical measures, e.g.,  policies, procedures, guidelines, legal contracts, management practices or organizational structures.  11 The Fair Information Principles were introduced in the US Privacy Act of 1974 (updated in 2015).  12 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data  OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31–50  13 OECD, Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (1980, updated in 2013),  http://oe.cd/privacy [accessed 10 September 2018]  14 ISO/IEC 27000:2018 Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Overview and  vocabulary  15 Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation,  amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC,  2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council  Decision 87/95/EEC, OJ L 316, 14.11.2012  http://oe.cd/privacy  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  09  2. EU context overview  EU standardisation legal framework  Since 2012, the EU Regulation 1025/2012 provides the legal framework on standardisation in the EU and  replaced former Directives addressing aspects of standardisation in the Union16.  The Regulation, among  other issues, established obligations for transparency and stakeholder participation and reformed the  framework on standards in support of Union legislation and policies.  With regard to this study, a relevant provision of the Regulation is the one on standardisation requests to  the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs). According to Article 10, the Commission may request  (formerly called ‘mandate’) the ESOs to draft a standardisation deliverable (standard or other deliverable),  stating the policy objectives aimed to be achieved with the requested standard. After the ESO accept the  request and develop the standard, the Commission together with the ESO, assesses the compliance with the  initial request.  The Commission has issued two standardisation requests in relation to privacy: i) The mandate M/289 in  support of the European Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal  data, published in 199917 and ii) The mandate M/530 on privacy management standards for security  technologies18.  EU legal framework & privacy standards in information security  Standards are often developed in support of Union policy and legislation. In the field of privacy and  information security, reference to standards or acknowledgement of their significance has also been  introduced in the EU legislative instruments19. The overview of the Union legislation (and proposals for  legislation), in Table 1 below, outlines the main areas where standards may play a role. However, unless the  primary or secondary legislation specifically refers to standards or technical regulations, the application of  those is on a voluntary basis20.

International privacy standards for information security: ISO/IEC  Introduction  General privacy standardisation in the field of Information Technology is within the Scope of ISO/IEC JTC  1/SC 27 IT Security Techniques (SC 27). SC 27 is a subcommittee of the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1)  of ISO and IEC, scoped to address Information Technology. Within the SC 27, a number of standards of  relevance to the field of privacy have been developed within ISO/IEC JTC 1SC 27/WG 5 - the Working  Group on Identity Management, Privacy and Biometrics. While this Working Group (WG) takes on a  specific privacy perspective, its neighbouring Working Groups (WGs 1-4, see Figure 1 below), may also  include privacy topics, although typically with a more security oriented viewpoint.  Figure 1: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 IT Security Techniques working groups overview  It should be noted, that the general understanding is that these fields are interconnected by way of  overlapping areas; i.e. there are areas of security standards with relevance to privacy and vice versa. The  following overview of activities is mainly derived from the aforementioned Working Groups, which mostly  take a generic approach towards the topic of privacy. It should be noted however, that there are numerous  sectorial efforts, which have been looking at several related topics and need to be taken into account,  when working in the respective areas. For reasons of brevity, only a limited number of those standards are  mentioned in this study.  It is helpful to understand the process, i.e. the different steps often followed in developing an international  standard. New projects are often prepared with a six to twenty-four months Study Period (SP) which may  deliver a formal New Work Item Proposal (NWIP). This form also entails a table of contents, some example  clauses, and often a preliminary working draft for the project. After approval of such a proposal, the  project evolves via several Working Drafts (WDs), where expert opinions on the text are exchanged and  incorporated. If the project is considered sufficiently stable, it will then be progressed to become a  Committee Draft (CD). At this stage further technical comments submitted as agreed upon by the  corresponding mirror committees of National Bodies will be taken into consideration. If the Committee  Draft meets sufficient consensus a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) is produced to resolve any  remaining editorial issues, before an International Standard is published.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  12  The ISO may opt to produce Technical Specifications in cases where a field has not sufficiently matured for  a standard, as well as Technical Reports providing any other information of relevance, that are not  standards and specifications. While the aforementioned process is used, applicable directives allow for  deviations, such as omitting certain stages, including – in some cases - to directly table a FDIS under the  “fast track” procedure.  Figure 2: Standards development process in ISO and ISO/IEC JTC 1  Privacy-focused standards  The privacy-focused standards of WG 5 are generally making use of the privacy principles presented earlier  in section 1.3. As such, many of the projects can be allocated to different categories of documents, such as:  i) general frameworks, ii) management  standards and iii) standards more focussed on the implementation  aspects, or supporting documents as illustrated in Figure 3 below.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  13  Figure 3: Overview of some Standards with Privacy Relevance in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27/WG 5 and their relationships  3.2.1 Framework documents  The most relevant framework document in WG 5 in the context of this report is ISO/IEC 29100 – Privacy  Principles, as described and outlined above (1.3).25 The document is freely available26 under the ISO  25 It may be important to note, that the main achievement of 29100 lies not so much within the development of  privacy principles, which are also enshrined in many other documents, such as the OECD-Guidelines on Privacy, but in  laying a sound policy foundation for the later work in international standardisation.  26 http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html (2018-10-20)  http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  14  Customer License Agreement27. Equally, WG 5 maintains – upon updates by its members – a list of privacy  references as their Standing Document 228.  3.2.2 Privacy management  A number of standards address privacy management from different perspectives. For example, the ISO/IEC  29190:2015 provides a “Privacy capability assessment model”, which was the first ISO standard to transfer  the underlying concept of continuous quality control in the context into privacy management.  Later standards, such as the ISO/IEC 29151:2017 – “Code of practice for personally identifiable information  protection”, establish a closer link with Information Security Management Systems, by describing “control  objectives, controls and guidelines for implementing controls, to meet the requirements identified by a risk  and impact assessment related to the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).”29 The latter  standard is based on ISO/IEC 27002, “taking into consideration the requirements for processing PII which  may be applicable within the context of an organization's information security risk environment(s).”30  Recently ISO/IEC 27552 – “Privacy-specific application of ISO/IEC 27001 Requirements (PIMS)”, which is  still under development, “provides guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually  improving a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)”31, which is also supposed to extend ISO/IEC  27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy management within the context of the organization. It is targeted  towards PII controllers and PII processors, and intends to provide mechanisms for conformity assessment.  ISO/IEC 29134:2017 – Privacy Impact Assessment – Methodology allows for an assessment taking into  account either of the above standards and it “gives guidelines for a process on privacy impact assessments  (PIA), and a structure and content of a PIA report”.32  Finally, some Identity Management related standards may also provide guidance in this context, such as:   ISO/IEC 24760 A framework for identity management   ISO/IEC 29115 Entity Authentication Assurance Framework   ISO/IEC 29146 A framework for access management  3.2.3 Technical implementation of privacy  One of the first published standard highlighting some technical aspects is the ISO/IEC 29101:2013 – Privacy  architecture framework, which “specifies concerns for ICT systems that process PII; lists components for  the implementation of such systems; and provides architectural views contextualizing these  components”33. Currently, it is being supplemented by the Technical Recommendation ISO/IEC 27550 –  Privacy engineering for system life cycle processes, which is supposed to be published within 2019. ISO/IEC  27550 will describe “the relationship between privacy engineering and other engineering viewpoints  (system engineering, security engineering, risk management); and privacy engineering activities in key  engineering processes such as knowledge management, risk management, requirement analysis, and  27 https://www.iso.org/terms-conditions-licence-agreement.html#Customer-Licence (2018-10-20)  28 WG 5 Standing Document 2 (SD2) -- Privacy references list online  https://www.din.de/en/meta/jtc1sc27/downloads (2018-10-20)  29 ISO/IEC 29151: 2017, Scope section.  30 As above.  31 ISO/IEC 27552, Scope section of the 2nd CD.  32 ISO/IEC 29134:2017, Scope section.  33 ISO/IEC 29101 Privacy architecture framework, Scope section.  https://www.iso.org/terms-conditions-licence-agreement.html#Customer-Licence https://www.din.de/en/meta/jtc1sc27/downloads  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  15  architecture design”34. The fact that it was developed as a technical recommendation also supports the  assumption that privacy engineering is still a field in its early days, where only few common best practises  have evolved. However, compliance requirements are now an accelerating development of the field.  However, there are some specific technology oriented standards available, e.g. ISO/IEC 29191  Requirements for partially anonymous , partially unlikable authentication, and ISO/IEC 27551 requirements  for attribute based unlikable entity authentication – currently at WD stage, and finally ISO/IEC 20889  Privacy enhancing data de-identification techniques which “specifies terminology, a classification of de- identification techniques according to their characteristics, and their applicability for reducing the risk of re- identification”35.  Lastly, there is also work under preparation, transferring a national standard on conceptualizing deletion of  PII, including but not limited to an approach for “defining deletion/de-identification rules in an efficient  way, a description of required documentation, and a definition of roles, responsibilities and processes”36.  3.2.4 Examples of sector-specific privacy standards  There are also a number of projects within WG5 and beyond that address sector specific requirements for  privacy, such as:   ISO/IEC 27018:2014 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Code of practice for protection of  personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors   ISO/IEC 27570 Privacy guidelines for smart cities.   ISO/IEC 17030  Guidelines for security and privacy in Internet of Things (IoT)   ISO/IEC 29184  Guidelines for online privacy notices and consent  The last three are still under development, but nearing publication.  Information security management systems standards with privacy relevance  Beyond the privacy-focused standards outlined in the previous section, ISO and IEC have been developing  information security standards that, while not focused on privacy as such, are relevant for privacy in a  broader context.  3.3.1 Generic information security management standards  A list of information security management standards with a broad application area is presented below.   ISO/IEC 27000 Information security management systems - Overview and Vocabulary   ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systems – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27005 Information security risk management   ISO/IEC 27006 Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security  management systems   ISO/IEC 27007 Information security management systems - auditor guidelines  34 ISO/IEC 27550 – Privacy engineering for system life cycle processes, Scope section.  35 ISO/IEC 20889 Privacy enhancing data de-identification techniques, Scope section.  36 NWIP on Developing a PII deletion concept in organizations, Scope.

A  list of security evaluation standards with privacy relevance is presented below:   ISO/IEC 15408 Evaluation criteria for IT security   ISO/IEC 18045 Methodology for IT security evaluation   ISO/IEC 19608 Guidance for developing security and privacy functional requirements based on  ISO/IEC 15408  Standards on the implementation of security techniques with privacy relevance  To comply with the eleven privacy principles technical mechanisms and functions are necessary. For  example, anonymization is mandatory and attribute based credentials are key technologies to support  privacy management. The promise of homomorphic encryption may allow for suitable privacy geared  calculations without compromising confidentiality. Crypto mechanisms are supporting privacy  implementation, while key management procedures may be included in the scope of a Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA)/ Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).  Many of these techniques are based on cryptographic techniques and a few examples are listed  hereinafter37:   ISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms   ISO/IEC 18370 Blind digital signatures   ISO/IEC 20008 Anonymous digital signatures   ISO/IEC 20009 Anonymous entity authentication   ISO/IEC 29191 Partially anonymous partially unlinkable authentication   ISO/IEC 20889 Privacy enhancing data de-identification techniques   ISO/IEC 27551 Attribute based unlinkable entity authentication (This document provides a  framework and establishes requirements for attribute-based unlinkable entity authentication.)  37 For more information see ISO/IEC JTC1/WG2 work plan and standards  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  17  Privacy by default and consumers interests  The Copolco committee38 (ISO’s Committee on consumer policy) has initiated a new project committee (PC  317) on “Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services“. However, at the time  of preparing this study, this Committee has only been approved by the Technical Management Board of  ISO, and is only on its way to establishing its scope and timeline, which limits actual results. However, in  view of its apparent close relationship to the topics of this study, the work of this Committee should be  taken into account in the future. In order to avoid duplication of efforts a liaison has been requested  between JWG8 and with ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27.  38 https://www.iso.org/copolco.html  https://www.iso.org/copolco.html  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  18  4. European privacy standards  Introduction  In the EU there are three standardisation bodies, which work independently of each other; CEN and  CENELEC on the one hand and ETSI on the other hand.  In 2011, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI set up the Cyber security coordination group (CSCG) to identify overlaps,  gaps and limitations in coordination in European Cybersecurity standardisation. ETSI left the group in 2015  and in 2016, this group was renamed to the CEN CENELEC Focus group. This focus group, which was  established for a limited period, was disbanded in 2018 and further integrated in WG1 of the newly  created CEN CENELEC JTC13.  Standardisation request M/530  In 2014, the European Commission issued mandate M/530 on standardisation, a request addressed to the  European standardisation organisations in support of the implementation of privacy and personal data  protection management in the design and development and in the production and service provision  processes of security technologies.  This mandate was prepared by DG HOME, after consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the  European Data Protection Supervisor, and information security industry representatives.  4.2.1 CEN and CENELEC  To respond to the mandate, CEN and CENELEC created in 2015 a Joint working group between CEN and  CENELEC named JWG839. JWG8 proposed to the Technical Board to prepare three deliverables:   WI 001- Data protection by design and by default (type of deliverable: EN)   WI 002- Video surveillance (CEN/ TR )40   WI 003- Biometric for access control including face recognition (CEN/TR)  Within its scope, JWG8 has proposed to recognize ISO/IEC 29134 (privacy impact assessment  Methodology) as a European standard (EN).  4.2.2 ETSI  ETSI on its side also prepared the following deliverables as a contribution to the mandate:   DTR/CYBER-0010, TR 103 370, Practical introductory guide to privacy   DTS/CYBER-0013, TS 103 485, Mechanisms for privacy assurance and verification   DTS/CYBER-0014, TS 103 486, Identity management and naming schema protection mechanisms   DTS/CYBER-0020, TS 103 458, Application of Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) for data protection  on smart devices, cloud and mobile services  39 Initially, ETSI also participated in the JWG8  40 CEN TR stands for CEN Technical Report, which are informative documents providing information on the technical content of  standards. https://www.cen.eu/work/products/TR/Pages/default.aspx [accessed 10 September 2018]  https://www.cen.eu/work/products/TR/Pages/default.aspx  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  19  ETSI TC Cyber  The ETSI Technical Committee Cyber (TC Cyber), created in 2014, was designated by ETSI Board as the  coordinator of the work to be handled to fulfil the EC mandate. TC Cyber has identified several privacy topics  as a priority domain to be tackled by ETSI.  CEN CENELEC new TCs on privacy and cybersecurity  In addition to the above activity, CEN and CENELEC decided in 2017 to set up a new Technical Committee  to handle in a more generic basis data protection and privacy by design and by default (CEN/CENELEC  JTC13). This newly created Committee has several objectives:   Import relevant ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 standards and create European standards following the Vienna  agreement. The following standards were identified as potential candidates : ISO/IEC 27006,  ISO/IEC 27007, ISO/IEC 27008, ISO/IEC 27010,ISO/IEC 27011, ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27018,  ISO/IEC 27019, ISO/IEC 15408, ISO/IEC 18045, ISO/IEC 19790, ISO/IEC 30111,ISO/IEC 29147,  ISO/IEC 19608   Act as a European mirroring committee to SC27 with according structure:  o WG1  Advisory group  o WG2 Management systems  o WG2  evaluation and certification systems  o WG4  Applications  o WG5 Privacy  o WG6 Products security   Integrate JTC8 To JTC13 WG5   Develop necessary Complementary standards to fulfil European regulations and mandates.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  20  5. Privacy information security standards: Gap analysis  This section provides a gap analysis and mapping of standards mentioned earlier to the ISO/IEC 29100  Privacy Principles. Following this analysis, the main points raised are discussed in Section 6.  Principle #1: Consent and choice  With regard to online services, the consent and choice principle is covered by ISO/IEC 29184 (draft)  outlining possibilities to present PII principal’s choice, obtain their consent, providing them prior  information, etc. Both, consent and choice are decisions taken by the data subject consciously also  assessing the security profile of the data processor, therefore the due application of the standard is  important.  Principle #2: Purpose legitimacy & specification  Concerning online services, the purpose legitimacy and specification principle is addressed by ISO/IEC  29184 (draft), outlining possibilities to communicate the purposes to the PII principal before PII collection  and the linguistic style used. Clearly the security of PII needs to be properly spelled out.  Principle #3: Collection limitation  At European level, EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530), being developed by  CEN-CENELEC/JTC 8 (and to be maintained by JTC 13/WG 5), covers the collection limitation principle, as it  has a direct impact on design and development of data processing activities. Moreover, draft ISO/IEC  27550 includes engineering practices that reduce the collection of PII. Both of these standards are  supported by a terminology on de-identification techniques defined in ISO/IEC 20889, thereby indirectly  covering the collection limitation principle.  ISO/IEC 29191, 27551 (draft), ETSI/TS 103 458 (draft) cover partial anonymisation and unlinkability,  attribute based unlinkability and encryption, respectively, generating information sources that can render  PII collection unnecessary. Indirectly, collection limitation is covered by ISO/IEC 24760, 29115, ETSI/TS 103  486 (draft) providing the framework for the management and assurance of identity and authentication  standards such as those dealing with anonymisation, unlinkability and attribute based encryption. With  regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the collection limitation principle is included in draft ISO/IEC  27030 and 27570.  Principle #4: Data minimisation  The European Standard “Data protection and privacy by design and by default” (M/530) covers the data  minimisation principle, as it has a direct impact on design and development of data processing activities  (e.g. the limitation of linkability of PII collected). Moreover, draft ISO/IEC 27550 includes engineering  practices that minimise the processing of PII. Both of these standards are supported by a terminology on  de-identification techniques defined in ISO/IEC 20889, thereby indirectly covering the data minimisation  principle.  ISO/IEC 29191, 27551 (draft), ETSI/TS 103 458 (draft) cover partial anonymisation and unlinkability,  attribute based unlinkability and encryption, respectively, generating options for interactions and  transactions not requiring identification of PII principals, reduce the observability of their behaviour, etc.  Indirectly, data minimisation is covered by ISO/IEC 24760, 29115, ETSI/TS 103 486 (draft) providing the  framework for the management and assurance of identity and authentication standards such as those  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  21  dealing with anonymisation, unlinkability and attribute based encryption. With regard to IoT and smart  cities, respectively, the data minimisation principle is included in draft ISO/IEC 27030 and 27570.  Principle #5: Use, retention, and disclosure limitation  EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530) covers the use, retention and disclosure  limitation principle, as it has a direct impact on design and development of data processing activities.  Moreover, draft ISO/IEC 27550 includes engineering practices that reduce the use, retention period and  disclosure of PII. Both of these standards are supported by a terminology on de-identification techniques  defined in ISO/IEC 20889, thereby indirectly covering the use, retention and disclosure limitation principle.  ISO/IEC 29191, 27551 (draft), ETSI/TS 103 458 (draft) cover partial anonymization and unlinkability,  attribute based unlinkability and encryption, respectively, preventing the use of PII from being linked  across different purposes and providing options for anonymising PII after the stated purposes for their  retention have been fulfilled. Indirectly, the use, retention and disclosure limitations are covered by  ISO/IEC 24760, 29115, ETSI/TS 103 486 (draft) providing the framework for the management and  assurance of identity and authentication standards such as those dealing with anonymisation, unlinkability  and attribute based encryption. With regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the use, retention and  disclosure principle is included in draft ISO/IEC 27030 and 27570.  Principle #6: Accuracy & quality  ISO/IEC 27000 and 27001 and 27005, 27006, 27007, partly cover vocabulary, requirements and risks and  auditing/certification requirements, auditing guidelines, respectively, for the management of accuracy and  quality of information including PII. Moreover, ISO/IEC 27002, 27008, 27014, 27017, 15408, 18045 in part  include controls and assessment of controls and governance and cloud-specific controls and evaluation  criteria and evaluation methodology, respectively, for accuracy and quality.  Indirectly, accuracy and quality is covered by ISO/IEC 27009, 27013, specifying sectorial use of  International Standard 27001 (which according to ISO/IEC language includes the privacy sector). With  regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the accuracy and quality principle is included in draft ISO/IEC  27030 and 27570.  Principle #7: Openness, transparency & notice  With regard to online services, the openness, transparency, and notice principles are covered by ISO/IEC  29184 (draft), outlining possibilities to provide PII principals information about the controller's policies,  procedures and practices, the purposes, types of recipient privacy stakeholders, the controller's identity,  the PII principal's means of participation and access and other notices.  Principle #8: Individual participation & access  In relation to online services, the individual’s participation and access principle is covered by ISO/IEC 29184  (draft), outlining options to enable PII principals to access, correct and remove PII, to communicate such  actions to third parties, and to securely establish procedures for exercising the rights of PII principals.  Principle #9: Accountability  Concerning privacy management systems, ISO/IEC 27552 provides a framework extending the existing  ISMS standards. Furthermore, ISO/IEC 19608 (draft), 27018, 29134, ETSI/TS 103 485 (draft) cover the  management of privacy-related practices within an organisation and PII in cloud computing and privacy  impact assessments and assurance mechanisms, respectively. Indirectly, accountability, which is a trust  invoking measure, is covered by ISO/IEC 29101, 29151, 29190 specifying the privacy principles defined in  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  22  International Standard 29100, whereas ETSI/TR 103 370 (draft) lists and classifies the most relevant  ISO/IEC privacy standards.  Principle #10: Information security  ISO/IEC 27000 and 27001 and 27002 and 27005, 27006, 27007, cover information security management  vocabulary and requirements and controls and risks and auditing/certification requirements, auditing  guidelines, respectively. Moreover, ISO/IEC 27002, 27008, 27014, 27017, 15408, 18045 include controls  and assessment of controls and governance and cloud-specific controls and evaluation criteria and  evaluation methodology, respectively, for information security.  At European level, EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530) covers the  information security principle, as it has a direct impact on design and development of data processing  activities (e.g. implementing controls in proportion to likelihood and severity of potential consequences,  sensitivity of PII, and number of possible PII principals). Moreover, draft ISO/IEC 27550 includes  engineering practices that support information security from the point of view of the PII principal. Both of  these standards are supported by a terminology on de-identification techniques defined in ISO/IEC 20889,  thereby indirectly covering the information security principle.  Indirectly, information security is covered by ISO/IEC 27009, 27013 specifying sectorial use (which  according to ISO/IEC language includes the privacy sector) and implementation of, respectively,  International Standard 27001. With regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the information security  principle is included in draft ISO/IEC 27030 and 27570.  Principle #11: Privacy compliance  The dedicated privacy management system currently being developed in ISO/IEC 27552 includes aspects of  privacy compliance verification. Besides, ISO/IEC 19608 (draft), 27018, 29134, ETSI/TS 103 485 (draft)  cover the verification of privacy-related practices within an organisation and PII in cloud computing and  privacy impact assessments and verification mechanisms, respectively. Indirectly, privacy compliance is  covered by ISO/IEC 29101, 29151, 29190 operationalising and in an information security context,  specifying the privacy principles that have been defined in International Standard 29100; ETSI/TR 103 370  (draft) categorises the most relevant ISO/IEC privacy standards.  At European level, EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530) covers the privacy  compliance principle, as it needs to be verified, supervised and demonstrated that the design and  development of data processing activities meets the legal data protection and privacy requirements based  on the associated risks for PII protection (particularly Article 25 GDPR “Data protection by design and by  default”).

Further considerations and recommendations  Following the overview of existing standardization initiatives at EU and International level, the gap analysis  and mapping of them against the privacy principles, this section presents some findings of this exercise,  derives some key conclusions and makes relevant proposals and recommendations. The non-exhaustive list  of considerations and recommendations aims to prioritise potential areas of action for the near future.  International vs. European standards  The activity of the international standard-setting organisations is rapidly growing in a way that seeks to keep  up with their prominence and importance in a changing privacy and cybersecurity policy landscape.  European Standards Organisations often adopt international standards as European ones, based on the  premise that ESOs do not need to re-invent the wheel. The adoption of international standards however  often takes place in the absence of thorough examination on whether the needs of the Europe-based  industry, market, and the EU legislation require standards tailored to the European reality. Since the  references to standards in the Union legislation are becoming more regular, and there are considerable  differences of Union privacy and security regulations with other jurisdictions, the need for analysis of  mapping of international standards and European regulatory requirements is intensified.  As a significant set of requirements in the area intersecting privacy and cybersecurity currently originates  from the EU it is logical that the standardisation efforts in this area need to be led and guidance needs to be  made available by ESOs active in the field. In this case, it is reasonable to expect that ESOs will drive standards  development for the internal EU market.  EU policy makers and European Standards Organisations should promote the development of  European input to privacy and cybersecurity standards. While leadership is needed, to drive  standardization efforts in this area, the stakeholders’ need to be provided with guidance might be met  with private initiatives from beyond the EU. In addition, the aforementioned stakeholders should also  establish a mechanism to assess the viability of adopting  international standards with European  (legal) requirements and filter international efforts to match EU levels.  ESOs should develop dependable privacy and security-centric mechanisms and associated pools of experts  to support them, for the purpose of assessing the adoption of international standards and their alignment  with European legal requirements and market needs. The existence of stable mechanisms and experts  pools would guarantee consistency in the long-term and ensure avoidance of overlap of standards.  Furthermore, such practice would identify potential overlap even among European standards developed  by CEN and CENELEC on the one hand, and ETSI on the other.  In the absence of EU initiatives and leadership in this area there is a growing risk of de facto  standardisation of practices via market consolidation as innovative EU-based service providers may  gradually be consolidated in non-EU-led groups of companies.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  24  Standardisation and conformity assessment mechanisms in information security  Proving compliance with privacy standards in information security is not as straightforward as one would  expect . While there are some approaches for conformity assessment available in specific sectors, others  are still lacking appropriate mechanisms. An example is the way in which the proposed EU cybersecurity  certification framework proposal under the Cybersecurity Act is likely to work out in practice; how  different approaches are likely to be combined and put to use. In addition, as shown in the gap analysis,  privacy and information security standards adopt different approaches with regard to the privacy  principles of the ISO/IEC 29100 and their implementation. High-level principles often leave room for  interpretation in individual cases.  There is therefore a need for coordinated guidance in that respect.  EU policy makers and European Cybersecurity Certification Group members should promote the  endorsement and adoption of privacy and information security standards, including conformity  assessment standards specific to privacy matters.  One recommendation to the above issue would be to incorporate privacy and information security  standards into the upcoming Cybersecurity Certification Framework. This approach can offer better  positioning that improves on the current sectorial-based approach.  EU policy makers and European Standards Organisations should further promote coordination and  collaboration with a range of stakeholders throughout the process of standards developments and  standardisation activity.  Coordination and collaboration with a range of stakeholders throughout the standardisation activity as  well as the development of conformity assessment schemes are necessary to meet various types of  expectations. In addition, easier direct participation of stakeholders to complement participation via  national only committees could also be considered.  Selection, agreement, and prioritisation of standardization activities  The example of the Joint Working Group 8, and the subsequent split of the mandated work in to two  different groups at CEN/CENELEC on the one hand and ETSI on the other hand, clearly shows that issues  pertaining to selection, agreement, and prioritisation of standardisation activities may arise. A consistent  analysis of sector-specific needs for privacy standardisation is essential, especially in the context of  information security, before moving ahead with the adoption or development of new standards. Such an  analysis might lead to the identification of common issues that may be addressed with baseline cross-sector  standards, and additional issues to be dealt in sector-specific standards.  EU bodies and competent authorities in the Member States should promote the adoption of a  structured approach on the analysis of sector-specific needs with regard to privacy standardisation,  especially in information security context and then proceed with the adoption or development of new  standards.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  25  Relevant regulatory authorities, e.g. in the areas of privacy, cybersecurity, telecommunications etc, need  to be involved further in standardisation activities, e.g. in defining, endorsing, or affirming potential  standardisation goals in the areas of privacy and information security. This could be done in several  manners by means of standardisation requests pursuant Art. 10 Regulation 1025/2012, EU policy  documents with clear objectives explicitly referring to standardisation, but also via research, namely by  aligning relevant aspects of the new Framework Programme. A joint agenda meeting the needs of  regulatory authorities across the board in the policy areas of privacy, cybersecurity and  telecommunications needs to be set up and coordination across all of them needs to take place at MS and  EU levels.  EU policy makers and relevant EU bodies need to be further involved in the standardisation process,  so as to define, endorse or affirm potential standardisation goals in the areas of privacy and  information security.  The role of technology and privacy by design  As discussed in chapters 3 and 4, much of the standardisation activity is focused on standardisation of  technological solutions. Among those solutions, many address the introduction of privacy-preserving  technologies throughout the whole lifecycle of a product or a system. Many stakeholders, ranging from  regulators, consumers, to the industry have acknowledged the value of privacy by design. In a recent  opinion, the European Data Protection Supervisor made a pledge for Privacy by design to be treated as a  landmark for values driven technology development41.  Despite a general common agreement on the value  of privacy by design, the concept and its implementation are still not clearly elucidated in standardization  activities.  Competent bodies at EU and Member State level  should further promote their research and  standardisation activities to support the realization of Privacy by Design principle.  Continuous research on Privacy by Design is valuable, as well as platforms where experts can exchange  knowledge on the latest technological developments  such as the EDPS Internet Privacy Engineering Network  (IPEN).42 Standardisation of aspects of Privacy by Design would also prove to be helpful, in terms of making  technology accessible to a broader audience. A good example of such initiative is the recently developed ISO  Committee on Consumer protection and privacy by design for consumer goods and services.43  41 EDPS Opinion on Privacy by Design 2018, p.19.  42 Read more: https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/ipen-internet-privacy-engineering-network_en [accessed 10 September  2018].  43 ISO/PC 317 https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html [accessed 10 September 2018]  https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/ipen-internet-privacy-engineering-network_en https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  26  7.

International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)  The ISO is a non-governmental organisation, operating under the Swiss law. ISO develops international  standards through its Technical Committees. Today, approximately 160 national standardisation bodies are  members of ISO and collaborate in over 750 Technical Committees. The ISO standards are voluntary, even  though it is also possible they sometimes carry more weight than a mere voluntary agreement; international  standards may be required to be followed as in the case of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)45  Barriers  to Trade Agreement or referenced in regional or national legislation.46  ISO, together with IEC, has a  longstanding tradition in developing information security standards, the framework of the Joint Technical  Committee 1 (JTC 1) on information technology standards.  International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC)  While the ISO work spans over a range of fields, the IEC is focused on international standards for electrical,  electronic, and related fields. IEC is a non-for-profit, quasi-governmental organisation, with National  Committees (one per country) as members.47 Unlike ISO, the IEC also offers conformity assessment via the  Conformity Assessment Board.48  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  The International Telecommunication Union is a United Nations’ specialized agency, working on the  development of voluntary recommendations (standards) for the telecommunication sector. ITU has  numerous publications on cybersecurity and Internet of Things that often address privacy aspects.  European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)  CEN is one of the three European Standardisation Organisations (ESO). CEN is set up as an association under  the Belgian law. Participation in CEN is based on national representation, via the national standardization  bodies of the European Union Member States, and other countries participating in the European Single  Market, such as Switzerland and Turkey. CEN develops consensus-based voluntary European standards (EN),  but also other deliverables of softer nature in the form of CEN Workshop Agreements.49 Approximately 1/3  of the CEN’s European Standards are developed in response to standardization requests coming from the  European Commission.50 CEN has been working on privacy standards since 1997, when the CEN Information  Society Standardization System (CEN/ISSS) was established. The CEN/ISSS was focused on Information and  45 WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade: https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/17-tbt_e.htm [accessed 2  September 2018]  46 See for example Art. 43 Regulation (EU) 679/2016  47 See  http://www.iec.ch/about/?ref=menu [accessed 2 September 2018]  48 See https://www.iso.org/conformity-assessment.html [accessed 2 September 2018] Read more about the conformity  assessment activities of IEC: http://www.iec.ch/about/activities/conformity.htm [accessed 2 September 2018]  49 Read more about CEN Workshop Agreements: https://www.cen.eu/work/products/CWA/Pages/default.aspx [accessed 2  September 2018]  50 https://www.cen.eu/you/EuropeanStandardization/Pages/default.aspx [accessed 2 September 2018]  https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/17-tbt_e.htm http://www.iec.ch/about/?ref=menu https://www.iso.org/conformity-assessment.html http://www.iec.ch/about/activities/conformity.htm https://www.cen.eu/work/products/CWA/Pages/default.aspx https://www.cen.eu/you/EuropeanStandardization/Pages/default.aspx  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  31  Communication Technologies (ICT), with a working group on privacy and data protection.51  Recently, CEN  created a new Technical Committee on Data Protection, as elaborated later in this Report.  European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC)  CENELEC is a non-for profit organisation operating under the Belgian law. It develops voluntary standards in  the field of electrotechnical engineering and collaborates closely with the IEC. Like CEN, the participation in  CENELEC is through national representation. The IEC is mainly involved in privacy and data protection related  standards in the information security context through its collaboration with CEN. An example is the  Standardisation request by the European Commission M/530 to develop privacy management standards for  security technologies.52  European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)  ETSI is a non-for-profit organisation established in France. Stakeholders-members of ETSI may join ETSI’s  standardisation work via direct participation. In addition, the standards developed by ETSI are made publicly  available free of charge. ETSI develops standards on different technology clusters: security, interoperability,  connecting things, wireless systems and networks, and others.53 ETSI’s Technical Committee on Cyber  security (TC Cyber) is mostly active in privacy standardisation for information security.  Cooperation Agreements  The recognised standard-setting organisations have concluded collaboration agreements, that address  issues of participation to each other’s work, but also – very importantly- the avoidance of duplication of  work. The Vienna Agreement concluded between ISO and CEN for example, underlines that international  standardisation takes precedence over national standardisation, but also recognises that the Single  European Market has particular needs for European standards.54 A similar agreement is signed between IEC  and CENELEC (Dresden and Frankfurt agreements).55  Other Fora  Beyond the aforementioned renowned Standardisation Organisations there are numerous other fora and  consortia developing specifications and standards. Most notably the ISOC/IETF and the W3C, whose  relevance to the Internet and the World Wide Web can hardly be underestimated. Equally, there are  numerous sector-specific, but also cross-cutting organisations, that may provide relevant advice in the field.  Finally, with regards to privacy, there is also a number of regulators providing relevant information, with the  European Data Protection Board (and before that the Article 29 Working Party) issuing relevant guidance.  51 CEN/ISSS Initiative on Privacy Standardization in Europe, Final Report, 2002.

Through the development and adoption of standards, best  practices are shared among organisations, integration and interoperability of systems is promoted,  complex environments are simplified, and information systems are shielded against cyber threats. Privacy  standards can be seen as an application area of the broader area of information security standards.  Over the last decade, there has been a significant development of privacy standards, which aim at  contributing to the integration of privacy requirements into information processes, systems and services.  Such integration is fundamental for the protection of individuals’ personal identifiable information (PII),  particularly in digital environments, while it may also support the implementation of relevant privacy and  data protection legislation.  Against this background, ENISA elaborated further on the area of privacy standards considering the  developments at legislative, policy, and standardisation level. The current study explores how the  standards-developing world is responding to the fast-changing, demanding realm of privacy by mapping  existing available standards and initiatives in the area and provides insights on the “state-of-the-art” of  privacy standards in the information security context through a relevant gap analysis. To this end, the main  findings of the study are presented below.  International vs. European standards  Since the references to standards in the Union legislation are becoming more regular, and there are  considerable differences of Union privacy and security regulations with other jurisdictions, the need for  analysis of mapping of international standards and European regulatory requirements is intensified.  Standardisation and conformity assessment mechanisms in information security  Proving compliance with privacy standards in information security is not as straightforward as one would  expect. While there are some approaches for conformity assessment available in specific sectors, others  are still lacking appropriate mechanisms.  Selection, agreement, and prioritisation of standardization activities  A consistent analysis of sector-specific needs for privacy standardisation is essential, especially in the  context of information security, before moving ahead with the adoption or development of new standards.  Through such an analysis, common issues that may be addressed with baseline cross-sector standards, and  additional issues to be dealt with in sector-specific standards can be identified and thus avoid duplication  of efforts.  The role of technology and privacy by design  Standardisation activity is mainly focused on covering technological approaches/solutions. Among those  solutions, many address the introduction of privacy-preserving technologies throughout the whole lifecycle  of a product or a system. Despite a general common agreement on the value of privacy by design, the  concept and its implementation are still not clearly elucidated in standardization activities.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  06  1. Introduction  Importance of privacy standards in the information security context  Standards are essential components of almost all aspects of the organisation and functioning of modern  societies. Critical infrastructures, quality management, and a broad range of other topics are covered by  the standardisation activity of Standards Development Organisations (SDOs). Standards are also of great  importance for information security. Through the development and adoption of standards, best practices  are shared among organisations, integration and interoperability of systems is promoted, complex  environments are simplified, and information systems are shielded against cyber threats.1  However, there are also challenges in the deployment and use of standards. Based on previous work of  ENISA in this area2,3&4, it is apparent that information security standards do not evolve in a pace  commensurate with the perceived threat level, and that there is lack of awareness and information among  stakeholders (e.g. public authorities or Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs)) that could adopt and benefit  from them. Additionally, there is limited coordination among SDOs, which results in the proliferation of  multiple standards on one topic and scarcity of standards on another.  Privacy standards can be seen as an application area of the broader area of information security standards.  Over the last decade, there has been a significant development of privacy standards, as illustrated by the  activities of ISO/EC, CEN and CENELEC discussed in Sections 3 and 4 respectively, which aim at contributing  to the integration of privacy requirements into information processes, systems and services. Such  integration is fundamental for the protection of individuals’ personal identifiable information (PII),  particularly in digital environments, while it may also support the implementation of relevant privacy and  data protection legislation (e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR in EU5). This having said,  the inherent limitations of standardisation activities are also present in this area, especially with regard to  co-ordination and coverage of the whole spectrum of requirements that is relevant to privacy.  In 2017, the first edition of the CEN-CENELEC - ENISA workshop6 on standards took place in Brussels under  the theme “Cybersecurity and Data Protection Standards”. In the course of this workshop, the need to  identify and possibly adopt standards by relevant stakeholders already available or under development in  the area of Network and Information Security (NIS) was highlighted, towards supporting the EU Digital  Single Market and the underlying EU policy and regulatory framework. In that workshop, privacy standards  were particularly outlined as an important area (under the broader area of NIS) where further work is  needed, in terms of both gap analysis, as well as technical implementation.  Against this background, ENISA, in its 2018 programming document7 elaborated further on the area of  privacy standards. As the Agency has by virtue of its Regulation a role on standards, it is logical that  addressing standards associated with privacy is a reasonable extension of its work. The expected outcome  of this undertaking is that greater understanding by means of analysis can be reached and that gaps can be  1 Steve Purser, Standards for Cyber Security, in Hathaway, Melissa (ed.)

As a result,  stakeholders interested in network and information security measures concerning PII, can get better  control and enhance their ability to successfully mitigate risks identified.  Aim and structure of the report  Building on the previous studies of ENISA and considering the developments at legislative, policy, and  standardisation level, this study aims to:   explore how the standards-developing world is responding to the fast-changing, demanding realm of  privacy by mapping existing available standards and initiatives in the area and   provide insights on the “state-of-the-art” of privacy standards in the information security context  through a relevant gap analysis.  It is important to stress that, although information security standards have a broader scope than privacy  standards, the latter is an essential part of the former. In the context of this report, the focus is mainly on  the information security dimension of these standards, while also providing a general description of their  overall application area.  To this end, the study provides an overview of existing standardisation initiatives at European Union and  international level. At the European level, the study examines the European Standards Organisations  (ESOs): CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI 8. At international level, the focus is on the following organisations: the  International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Committee  (IEC).  Next, standards are presented per organisation and categories of standard, namely fundamental  standards, specifications, guidelines and codes of practice.9 Moreover, the study presents the results of a  gap analysis, which may indicate possible next areas to be considered towards the development or  repositioning of standards/ongoing initiatives. The report concludes with a number of additional  considerations drawn by the research conducted for the study and the contributors’ and reviewers’  expertise and engagement in the area of standardisation.  The intended audience of the study is NIS practitioners and relevant MS authorities, while on the other  hand it is also meant to serve as a non-binding guidance document for ESO’s.  Methodological approach  Following the discussion on the existing SDO’s and working groups, the gap analysis is based on the Privacy  Principles provided in the broadly referenced fundamental standard ISO/IEC 2910010. This international  standard entails a privacy framework comprising of common privacy terminology, actors and roles, privacy  safeguarding considerations and privacy principles for information technology. The Privacy Principles have  been developed taking into account the privacy principles adopted in different countries and regions, such  8 See Art.2 (8) and (9) Regulation (EU) 1025/2012 .  9 https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/Information-about-standards/different-types-of-standards/  10 ISO/IEC 29100:2011 Information technology - Security techniques - Privacy framework  https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/Information-about-standards/different-types-of-standards/  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  08  as the Fair Information Principles in the US11 and the Data Quality principles of the EU data protection  legislation,12 as well as the OECD guidelines on privacy.13  Key concepts discussed within the study  Information Security:  Preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. In addition, other  properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation, and reliability can also be involved. 14  Standard: Technical specification, adopted by a recognised standardisation body, for repeated or continuous  application, with which compliance is not compulsory. 15  Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Any information that (a) can be used to identify the PII principal to  whom such information relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a PII principal.  Privacy Standard: Standard that includes privacy controls, requirements and/or guidance related to the  processing of personally identifiable information. The focus of the study is mainly on the information  security dimension of privacy standards.  Privacy Controls: Measures that treat privacy risks by reducing their likelihood or their consequences. According  to ISO/IEC 29100: 2011 Privacy controls include organizational, physical and technical measures, e.g.,  policies, procedures, guidelines, legal contracts, management practices or organizational structures.  11 The Fair Information Principles were introduced in the US Privacy Act of 1974 (updated in 2015).  12 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data  OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31–50  13 OECD, Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (1980, updated in 2013),  http://oe.cd/privacy [accessed 10 September 2018]  14 ISO/IEC 27000:2018 Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Overview and  vocabulary  15 Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation,  amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC,  2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council  Decision 87/95/EEC, OJ L 316, 14.11.2012  http://oe.cd/privacy  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  09  2. EU context overview  EU standardisation legal framework  Since 2012, the EU Regulation 1025/2012 provides the legal framework on standardisation in the EU and  replaced former Directives addressing aspects of standardisation in the Union16.  The Regulation, among  other issues, established obligations for transparency and stakeholder participation and reformed the  framework on standards in support of Union legislation and policies.  With regard to this study, a relevant provision of the Regulation is the one on standardisation requests to  the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs). According to Article 10, the Commission may request  (formerly called ‘mandate’) the ESOs to draft a standardisation deliverable (standard or other deliverable),  stating the policy objectives aimed to be achieved with the requested standard. After the ESO accept the  request and develop the standard, the Commission together with the ESO, assesses the compliance with the  initial request.  The Commission has issued two standardisation requests in relation to privacy: i) The mandate M/289 in  support of the European Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal  data, published in 199917 and ii) The mandate M/530 on privacy management standards for security  technologies18.  EU legal framework & privacy standards in information security  Standards are often developed in support of Union policy and legislation. In the field of privacy and  information security, reference to standards or acknowledgement of their significance has also been  introduced in the EU legislative instruments19. The overview of the Union legislation (and proposals for  legislation), in Table 1 below, outlines the main areas where standards may play a role. However, unless the  primary or secondary legislation specifically refers to standards or technical regulations, the application of  those is on a voluntary basis20.

International privacy standards for information security: ISO/IEC  Introduction  General privacy standardisation in the field of Information Technology is within the Scope of ISO/IEC JTC  1/SC 27 IT Security Techniques (SC 27). SC 27 is a subcommittee of the Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1)  of ISO and IEC, scoped to address Information Technology. Within the SC 27, a number of standards of  relevance to the field of privacy have been developed within ISO/IEC JTC 1SC 27/WG 5 - the Working  Group on Identity Management, Privacy and Biometrics. While this Working Group (WG) takes on a  specific privacy perspective, its neighbouring Working Groups (WGs 1-4, see Figure 1 below), may also  include privacy topics, although typically with a more security oriented viewpoint.  Figure 1: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 IT Security Techniques working groups overview  It should be noted, that the general understanding is that these fields are interconnected by way of  overlapping areas; i.e. there are areas of security standards with relevance to privacy and vice versa. The  following overview of activities is mainly derived from the aforementioned Working Groups, which mostly  take a generic approach towards the topic of privacy. It should be noted however, that there are numerous  sectorial efforts, which have been looking at several related topics and need to be taken into account,  when working in the respective areas. For reasons of brevity, only a limited number of those standards are  mentioned in this study.  It is helpful to understand the process, i.e. the different steps often followed in developing an international  standard. New projects are often prepared with a six to twenty-four months Study Period (SP) which may  deliver a formal New Work Item Proposal (NWIP). This form also entails a table of contents, some example  clauses, and often a preliminary working draft for the project. After approval of such a proposal, the  project evolves via several Working Drafts (WDs), where expert opinions on the text are exchanged and  incorporated. If the project is considered sufficiently stable, it will then be progressed to become a  Committee Draft (CD). At this stage further technical comments submitted as agreed upon by the  corresponding mirror committees of National Bodies will be taken into consideration. If the Committee  Draft meets sufficient consensus a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) is produced to resolve any  remaining editorial issues, before an International Standard is published.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  12  The ISO may opt to produce Technical Specifications in cases where a field has not sufficiently matured for  a standard, as well as Technical Reports providing any other information of relevance, that are not  standards and specifications. While the aforementioned process is used, applicable directives allow for  deviations, such as omitting certain stages, including – in some cases - to directly table a FDIS under the  “fast track” procedure.  Figure 2: Standards development process in ISO and ISO/IEC JTC 1  Privacy-focused standards  The privacy-focused standards of WG 5 are generally making use of the privacy principles presented earlier  in section 1.3. As such, many of the projects can be allocated to different categories of documents, such as:  i) general frameworks, ii) management  standards and iii) standards more focussed on the implementation  aspects, or supporting documents as illustrated in Figure 3 below.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  13  Figure 3: Overview of some Standards with Privacy Relevance in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27/WG 5 and their relationships  3.2.1 Framework documents  The most relevant framework document in WG 5 in the context of this report is ISO/IEC 29100 – Privacy  Principles, as described and outlined above (1.3).25 The document is freely available26 under the ISO  25 It may be important to note, that the main achievement of 29100 lies not so much within the development of  privacy principles, which are also enshrined in many other documents, such as the OECD-Guidelines on Privacy, but in  laying a sound policy foundation for the later work in international standardisation.  26 http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html (2018-10-20)  http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  14  Customer License Agreement27. Equally, WG 5 maintains – upon updates by its members – a list of privacy  references as their Standing Document 228.  3.2.2 Privacy management  A number of standards address privacy management from different perspectives. For example, the ISO/IEC  29190:2015 provides a “Privacy capability assessment model”, which was the first ISO standard to transfer  the underlying concept of continuous quality control in the context into privacy management.  Later standards, such as the ISO/IEC 29151:2017 – “Code of practice for personally identifiable information  protection”, establish a closer link with Information Security Management Systems, by describing “control  objectives, controls and guidelines for implementing controls, to meet the requirements identified by a risk  and impact assessment related to the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).”29 The latter  standard is based on ISO/IEC 27002, “taking into consideration the requirements for processing PII which  may be applicable within the context of an organization's information security risk environment(s).”30  Recently ISO/IEC 27552 – “Privacy-specific application of ISO/IEC 27001 Requirements (PIMS)”, which is  still under development, “provides guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually  improving a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)”31, which is also supposed to extend ISO/IEC  27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy management within the context of the organization. It is targeted  towards PII controllers and PII processors, and intends to provide mechanisms for conformity assessment.  ISO/IEC 29134:2017 – Privacy Impact Assessment – Methodology allows for an assessment taking into  account either of the above standards and it “gives guidelines for a process on privacy impact assessments  (PIA), and a structure and content of a PIA report”.32  Finally, some Identity Management related standards may also provide guidance in this context, such as:   ISO/IEC 24760 A framework for identity management   ISO/IEC 29115 Entity Authentication Assurance Framework   ISO/IEC 29146 A framework for access management  3.2.3 Technical implementation of privacy  One of the first published standard highlighting some technical aspects is the ISO/IEC 29101:2013 – Privacy  architecture framework, which “specifies concerns for ICT systems that process PII; lists components for  the implementation of such systems; and provides architectural views contextualizing these  components”33. Currently, it is being supplemented by the Technical Recommendation ISO/IEC 27550 –  Privacy engineering for system life cycle processes, which is supposed to be published within 2019. ISO/IEC  27550 will describe “the relationship between privacy engineering and other engineering viewpoints  (system engineering, security engineering, risk management); and privacy engineering activities in key  engineering processes such as knowledge management, risk management, requirement analysis, and  27 https://www.iso.org/terms-conditions-licence-agreement.html#Customer-Licence (2018-10-20)  28 WG 5 Standing Document 2 (SD2) -- Privacy references list online  https://www.din.de/en/meta/jtc1sc27/downloads (2018-10-20)  29 ISO/IEC 29151: 2017, Scope section.  30 As above.  31 ISO/IEC 27552, Scope section of the 2nd CD.  32 ISO/IEC 29134:2017, Scope section.  33 ISO/IEC 29101 Privacy architecture framework, Scope section.  https://www.iso.org/terms-conditions-licence-agreement.html#Customer-Licence https://www.din.de/en/meta/jtc1sc27/downloads  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  15  architecture design”34. The fact that it was developed as a technical recommendation also supports the  assumption that privacy engineering is still a field in its early days, where only few common best practises  have evolved. However, compliance requirements are now an accelerating development of the field.  However, there are some specific technology oriented standards available, e.g. ISO/IEC 29191  Requirements for partially anonymous , partially unlikable authentication, and ISO/IEC 27551 requirements  for attribute based unlikable entity authentication – currently at WD stage, and finally ISO/IEC 20889  Privacy enhancing data de-identification techniques which “specifies terminology, a classification of de- identification techniques according to their characteristics, and their applicability for reducing the risk of re- identification”35.  Lastly, there is also work under preparation, transferring a national standard on conceptualizing deletion of  PII, including but not limited to an approach for “defining deletion/de-identification rules in an efficient  way, a description of required documentation, and a definition of roles, responsibilities and processes”36.  3.2.4 Examples of sector-specific privacy standards  There are also a number of projects within WG5 and beyond that address sector specific requirements for  privacy, such as:   ISO/IEC 27018:2014 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Code of practice for protection of  personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors   ISO/IEC 27570 Privacy guidelines for smart cities.   ISO/IEC 17030  Guidelines for security and privacy in Internet of Things (IoT)   ISO/IEC 29184  Guidelines for online privacy notices and consent  The last three are still under development, but nearing publication.  Information security management systems standards with privacy relevance  Beyond the privacy-focused standards outlined in the previous section, ISO and IEC have been developing  information security standards that, while not focused on privacy as such, are relevant for privacy in a  broader context.  3.3.1 Generic information security management standards  A list of information security management standards with a broad application area is presented below.   ISO/IEC 27000 Information security management systems - Overview and Vocabulary   ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systems – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27005 Information security risk management   ISO/IEC 27006 Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security  management systems   ISO/IEC 27007 Information security management systems - auditor guidelines  34 ISO/IEC 27550 – Privacy engineering for system life cycle processes, Scope section.  35 ISO/IEC 20889 Privacy enhancing data de-identification techniques, Scope section.  36 NWIP on Developing a PII deletion concept in organizations, Scope.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  16   ISO/IEC 27008 Guidelines for the assessment of information security controls   ISO/IEC 27009 Sector-specific application of ISO/IEC 27001 – Requirements   ISO/IEC 27013 Guidelines on the integrated implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1   ISO/IEC 27014 Governance of information security  3.3.2 Examples of sector-specific information security management standards  A list of information security management standards with a more sector specific application area is  presented below.   ISO/IEC 27002 Code of practice for information security controls   ISO/IEC 17030  Guidelines for security and privacy in Internet of Things (IoT)   ISO/IEC 27017  Code of practice for information security controls based on ISO/IEC 27002 for  cloud services  Security evaluation standards with privacy relevance  Similarly to the information security management system standards, we can find security evaluation  standards with privacy references or relevance at large, especially in relation to data security measures. A  list of security evaluation standards with privacy relevance is presented below:   ISO/IEC 15408 Evaluation criteria for IT security   ISO/IEC 18045 Methodology for IT security evaluation   ISO/IEC 19608 Guidance for developing security and privacy functional requirements based on  ISO/IEC 15408  Standards on the implementation of security techniques with privacy relevance  To comply with the eleven privacy principles technical mechanisms and functions are necessary. For  example, anonymization is mandatory and attribute based credentials are key technologies to support  privacy management. The promise of homomorphic encryption may allow for suitable privacy geared  calculations without compromising confidentiality. Crypto mechanisms are supporting privacy  implementation, while key management procedures may be included in the scope of a Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA)/ Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).  Many of these techniques are based on cryptographic techniques and a few examples are listed  hereinafter37:   ISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms   ISO/IEC 18370 Blind digital signatures   ISO/IEC 20008 Anonymous digital signatures   ISO/IEC 20009 Anonymous entity authentication   ISO/IEC 29191 Partially anonymous partially unlinkable authentication   ISO/IEC 20889 Privacy enhancing data de-identification techniques   ISO/IEC 27551 Attribute based unlinkable entity authentication (This document provides a  framework and establishes requirements for attribute-based unlinkable entity authentication.)  37 For more information see ISO/IEC JTC1/WG2 work plan and standards  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  17  Privacy by default and consumers interests  The Copolco committee38 (ISO’s Committee on consumer policy) has initiated a new project committee (PC  317) on “Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services“. However, at the time  of preparing this study, this Committee has only been approved by the Technical Management Board of  ISO, and is only on its way to establishing its scope and timeline, which limits actual results. However, in  view of its apparent close relationship to the topics of this study, the work of this Committee should be  taken into account in the future. In order to avoid duplication of efforts a liaison has been requested  between JWG8 and with ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27.  38 https://www.iso.org/copolco.html  https://www.iso.org/copolco.html  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  18  4. European privacy standards  Introduction  In the EU there are three standardisation bodies, which work independently of each other; CEN and  CENELEC on the one hand and ETSI on the other hand.  In 2011, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI set up the Cyber security coordination group (CSCG) to identify overlaps,  gaps and limitations in coordination in European Cybersecurity standardisation. ETSI left the group in 2015  and in 2016, this group was renamed to the CEN CENELEC Focus group. This focus group, which was  established for a limited period, was disbanded in 2018 and further integrated in WG1 of the newly  created CEN CENELEC JTC13.  Standardisation request M/530  In 2014, the European Commission issued mandate M/530 on standardisation, a request addressed to the  European standardisation organisations in support of the implementation of privacy and personal data  protection management in the design and development and in the production and service provision  processes of security technologies.  This mandate was prepared by DG HOME, after consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the  European Data Protection Supervisor, and information security industry representatives.  4.2.1 CEN and CENELEC  To respond to the mandate, CEN and CENELEC created in 2015 a Joint working group between CEN and  CENELEC named JWG839. JWG8 proposed to the Technical Board to prepare three deliverables:   WI 001- Data protection by design and by default (type of deliverable: EN)   WI 002- Video surveillance (CEN/ TR )40   WI 003- Biometric for access control including face recognition (CEN/TR)  Within its scope, JWG8 has proposed to recognize ISO/IEC 29134 (privacy impact assessment  Methodology) as a European standard (EN).  4.2.2 ETSI  ETSI on its side also prepared the following deliverables as a contribution to the mandate:   DTR/CYBER-0010, TR 103 370, Practical introductory guide to privacy   DTS/CYBER-0013, TS 103 485, Mechanisms for privacy assurance and verification   DTS/CYBER-0014, TS 103 486, Identity management and naming schema protection mechanisms   DTS/CYBER-0020, TS 103 458, Application of Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) for data protection  on smart devices, cloud and mobile services  39 Initially, ETSI also participated in the JWG8  40 CEN TR stands for CEN Technical Report, which are informative documents providing information on the technical content of  standards. https://www.cen.eu/work/products/TR/Pages/default.aspx [accessed 10 September 2018]  https://www.cen.eu/work/products/TR/Pages/default.aspx  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  19  ETSI TC Cyber  The ETSI Technical Committee Cyber (TC Cyber), created in 2014, was designated by ETSI Board as the  coordinator of the work to be handled to fulfil the EC mandate. TC Cyber has identified several privacy topics  as a priority domain to be tackled by ETSI.  CEN CENELEC new TCs on privacy and cybersecurity  In addition to the above activity, CEN and CENELEC decided in 2017 to set up a new Technical Committee  to handle in a more generic basis data protection and privacy by design and by default (CEN/CENELEC  JTC13). This newly created Committee has several objectives:   Import relevant ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 standards and create European standards following the Vienna  agreement. The following standards were identified as potential candidates : ISO/IEC 27006,  ISO/IEC 27007, ISO/IEC 27008, ISO/IEC 27010,ISO/IEC 27011, ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27018,  ISO/IEC 27019, ISO/IEC 15408, ISO/IEC 18045, ISO/IEC 19790, ISO/IEC 30111,ISO/IEC 29147,  ISO/IEC 19608   Act as a European mirroring committee to SC27 with according structure:  o WG1  Advisory group  o WG2 Management systems  o WG2  evaluation and certification systems  o WG4  Applications  o WG5 Privacy  o WG6 Products security   Integrate JTC8 To JTC13 WG5   Develop necessary Complementary standards to fulfil European regulations and mandates.

Privacy information security standards: Gap analysis  This section provides a gap analysis and mapping of standards mentioned earlier to the ISO/IEC 29100  Privacy Principles. Following this analysis, the main points raised are discussed in Section 6.  Principle #1: Consent and choice  With regard to online services, the consent and choice principle is covered by ISO/IEC 29184 (draft)  outlining possibilities to present PII principal’s choice, obtain their consent, providing them prior  information, etc. Both, consent and choice are decisions taken by the data subject consciously also  assessing the security profile of the data processor, therefore the due application of the standard is  important.  Principle #2: Purpose legitimacy & specification  Concerning online services, the purpose legitimacy and specification principle is addressed by ISO/IEC  29184 (draft), outlining possibilities to communicate the purposes to the PII principal before PII collection  and the linguistic style used. Clearly the security of PII needs to be properly spelled out.  Principle #3: Collection limitation  At European level, EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530), being developed by  CEN-CENELEC/JTC 8 (and to be maintained by JTC 13/WG 5), covers the collection limitation principle, as it  has a direct impact on design and development of data processing activities. Moreover, draft ISO/IEC  27550 includes engineering practices that reduce the collection of PII. Both of these standards are  supported by a terminology on de-identification techniques defined in ISO/IEC 20889, thereby indirectly  covering the collection limitation principle.  ISO/IEC 29191, 27551 (draft), ETSI/TS 103 458 (draft) cover partial anonymisation and unlinkability,  attribute based unlinkability and encryption, respectively, generating information sources that can render  PII collection unnecessary. Indirectly, collection limitation is covered by ISO/IEC 24760, 29115, ETSI/TS 103  486 (draft) providing the framework for the management and assurance of identity and authentication  standards such as those dealing with anonymisation, unlinkability and attribute based encryption. With  regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the collection limitation principle is included in draft ISO/IEC  27030 and 27570.  Principle #4: Data minimisation  The European Standard “Data protection and privacy by design and by default” (M/530) covers the data  minimisation principle, as it has a direct impact on design and development of data processing activities  (e.g. the limitation of linkability of PII collected). Moreover, draft ISO/IEC 27550 includes engineering  practices that minimise the processing of PII. Both of these standards are supported by a terminology on  de-identification techniques defined in ISO/IEC 20889, thereby indirectly covering the data minimisation  principle.  ISO/IEC 29191, 27551 (draft), ETSI/TS 103 458 (draft) cover partial anonymisation and unlinkability,  attribute based unlinkability and encryption, respectively, generating options for interactions and  transactions not requiring identification of PII principals, reduce the observability of their behaviour, etc.  Indirectly, data minimisation is covered by ISO/IEC 24760, 29115, ETSI/TS 103 486 (draft) providing the  framework for the management and assurance of identity and authentication standards such as those  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  21  dealing with anonymisation, unlinkability and attribute based encryption. With regard to IoT and smart  cities, respectively, the data minimisation principle is included in draft ISO/IEC 27030 and 27570.  Principle #5: Use, retention, and disclosure limitation  EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530) covers the use, retention and disclosure  limitation principle, as it has a direct impact on design and development of data processing activities.  Moreover, draft ISO/IEC 27550 includes engineering practices that reduce the use, retention period and  disclosure of PII. Both of these standards are supported by a terminology on de-identification techniques  defined in ISO/IEC 20889, thereby indirectly covering the use, retention and disclosure limitation principle.  ISO/IEC 29191, 27551 (draft), ETSI/TS 103 458 (draft) cover partial anonymization and unlinkability,  attribute based unlinkability and encryption, respectively, preventing the use of PII from being linked  across different purposes and providing options for anonymising PII after the stated purposes for their  retention have been fulfilled. Indirectly, the use, retention and disclosure limitations are covered by  ISO/IEC 24760, 29115, ETSI/TS 103 486 (draft) providing the framework for the management and  assurance of identity and authentication standards such as those dealing with anonymisation, unlinkability  and attribute based encryption. With regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the use, retention and  disclosure principle is included in draft ISO/IEC 27030 and 27570.  Principle #6: Accuracy & quality  ISO/IEC 27000 and 27001 and 27005, 27006, 27007, partly cover vocabulary, requirements and risks and  auditing/certification requirements, auditing guidelines, respectively, for the management of accuracy and  quality of information including PII. Moreover, ISO/IEC 27002, 27008, 27014, 27017, 15408, 18045 in part  include controls and assessment of controls and governance and cloud-specific controls and evaluation  criteria and evaluation methodology, respectively, for accuracy and quality.  Indirectly, accuracy and quality is covered by ISO/IEC 27009, 27013, specifying sectorial use of  International Standard 27001 (which according to ISO/IEC language includes the privacy sector). With  regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the accuracy and quality principle is included in draft ISO/IEC  27030 and 27570.  Principle #7: Openness, transparency & notice  With regard to online services, the openness, transparency, and notice principles are covered by ISO/IEC  29184 (draft), outlining possibilities to provide PII principals information about the controller's policies,  procedures and practices, the purposes, types of recipient privacy stakeholders, the controller's identity,  the PII principal's means of participation and access and other notices.  Principle #8: Individual participation & access  In relation to online services, the individual’s participation and access principle is covered by ISO/IEC 29184  (draft), outlining options to enable PII principals to access, correct and remove PII, to communicate such  actions to third parties, and to securely establish procedures for exercising the rights of PII principals.  Principle #9: Accountability  Concerning privacy management systems, ISO/IEC 27552 provides a framework extending the existing  ISMS standards. Furthermore, ISO/IEC 19608 (draft), 27018, 29134, ETSI/TS 103 485 (draft) cover the  management of privacy-related practices within an organisation and PII in cloud computing and privacy  impact assessments and assurance mechanisms, respectively. Indirectly, accountability, which is a trust  invoking measure, is covered by ISO/IEC 29101, 29151, 29190 specifying the privacy principles defined in  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  22  International Standard 29100, whereas ETSI/TR 103 370 (draft) lists and classifies the most relevant  ISO/IEC privacy standards.  Principle #10: Information security  ISO/IEC 27000 and 27001 and 27002 and 27005, 27006, 27007, cover information security management  vocabulary and requirements and controls and risks and auditing/certification requirements, auditing  guidelines, respectively. Moreover, ISO/IEC 27002, 27008, 27014, 27017, 15408, 18045 include controls  and assessment of controls and governance and cloud-specific controls and evaluation criteria and  evaluation methodology, respectively, for information security.  At European level, EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530) covers the  information security principle, as it has a direct impact on design and development of data processing  activities (e.g. implementing controls in proportion to likelihood and severity of potential consequences,  sensitivity of PII, and number of possible PII principals). Moreover, draft ISO/IEC 27550 includes  engineering practices that support information security from the point of view of the PII principal. Both of  these standards are supported by a terminology on de-identification techniques defined in ISO/IEC 20889,  thereby indirectly covering the information security principle.  Indirectly, information security is covered by ISO/IEC 27009, 27013 specifying sectorial use (which  according to ISO/IEC language includes the privacy sector) and implementation of, respectively,  International Standard 27001. With regard to IoT and smart cities, respectively, the information security  principle is included in draft ISO/IEC 27030 and 27570.  Principle #11: Privacy compliance  The dedicated privacy management system currently being developed in ISO/IEC 27552 includes aspects of  privacy compliance verification. Besides, ISO/IEC 19608 (draft), 27018, 29134, ETSI/TS 103 485 (draft)  cover the verification of privacy-related practices within an organisation and PII in cloud computing and  privacy impact assessments and verification mechanisms, respectively. Indirectly, privacy compliance is  covered by ISO/IEC 29101, 29151, 29190 operationalising and in an information security context,  specifying the privacy principles that have been defined in International Standard 29100; ETSI/TR 103 370  (draft) categorises the most relevant ISO/IEC privacy standards.  At European level, EN 'Data protection and privacy by design and by default' (M/530) covers the privacy  compliance principle, as it needs to be verified, supervised and demonstrated that the design and  development of data processing activities meets the legal data protection and privacy requirements based  on the associated risks for PII protection (particularly Article 25 GDPR “Data protection by design and by  default”).  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  23  6. Further considerations and recommendations  Following the overview of existing standardization initiatives at EU and International level, the gap analysis  and mapping of them against the privacy principles, this section presents some findings of this exercise,  derives some key conclusions and makes relevant proposals and recommendations. The non-exhaustive list  of considerations and recommendations aims to prioritise potential areas of action for the near future.  International vs. European standards  The activity of the international standard-setting organisations is rapidly growing in a way that seeks to keep  up with their prominence and importance in a changing privacy and cybersecurity policy landscape.  European Standards Organisations often adopt international standards as European ones, based on the  premise that ESOs do not need to re-invent the wheel. The adoption of international standards however  often takes place in the absence of thorough examination on whether the needs of the Europe-based  industry, market, and the EU legislation require standards tailored to the European reality. Since the  references to standards in the Union legislation are becoming more regular, and there are considerable  differences of Union privacy and security regulations with other jurisdictions, the need for analysis of  mapping of international standards and European regulatory requirements is intensified.  As a significant set of requirements in the area intersecting privacy and cybersecurity currently originates  from the EU it is logical that the standardisation efforts in this area need to be led and guidance needs to be  made available by ESOs active in the field. In this case, it is reasonable to expect that ESOs will drive standards  development for the internal EU market.  EU policy makers and European Standards Organisations should promote the development of  European input to privacy and cybersecurity standards. While leadership is needed, to drive  standardization efforts in this area, the stakeholders’ need to be provided with guidance might be met  with private initiatives from beyond the EU. In addition, the aforementioned stakeholders should also  establish a mechanism to assess the viability of adopting  international standards with European  (legal) requirements and filter international efforts to match EU levels.  ESOs should develop dependable privacy and security-centric mechanisms and associated pools of experts  to support them, for the purpose of assessing the adoption of international standards and their alignment  with European legal requirements and market needs. The existence of stable mechanisms and experts  pools would guarantee consistency in the long-term and ensure avoidance of overlap of standards.  Furthermore, such practice would identify potential overlap even among European standards developed  by CEN and CENELEC on the one hand, and ETSI on the other.  In the absence of EU initiatives and leadership in this area there is a growing risk of de facto  standardisation of practices via market consolidation as innovative EU-based service providers may  gradually be consolidated in non-EU-led groups of companies.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  24  Standardisation and conformity assessment mechanisms in information security  Proving compliance with privacy standards in information security is not as straightforward as one would  expect . While there are some approaches for conformity assessment available in specific sectors, others  are still lacking appropriate mechanisms. An example is the way in which the proposed EU cybersecurity  certification framework proposal under the Cybersecurity Act is likely to work out in practice; how  different approaches are likely to be combined and put to use. In addition, as shown in the gap analysis,  privacy and information security standards adopt different approaches with regard to the privacy  principles of the ISO/IEC 29100 and their implementation. High-level principles often leave room for  interpretation in individual cases.  There is therefore a need for coordinated guidance in that respect.  EU policy makers and European Cybersecurity Certification Group members should promote the  endorsement and adoption of privacy and information security standards, including conformity  assessment standards specific to privacy matters.  One recommendation to the above issue would be to incorporate privacy and information security  standards into the upcoming Cybersecurity Certification Framework. This approach can offer better  positioning that improves on the current sectorial-based approach.  EU policy makers and European Standards Organisations should further promote coordination and  collaboration with a range of stakeholders throughout the process of standards developments and  standardisation activity.  Coordination and collaboration with a range of stakeholders throughout the standardisation activity as  well as the development of conformity assessment schemes are necessary to meet various types of  expectations. In addition, easier direct participation of stakeholders to complement participation via  national only committees could also be considered.  Selection, agreement, and prioritisation of standardization activities  The example of the Joint Working Group 8, and the subsequent split of the mandated work in to two  different groups at CEN/CENELEC on the one hand and ETSI on the other hand, clearly shows that issues  pertaining to selection, agreement, and prioritisation of standardisation activities may arise. A consistent  analysis of sector-specific needs for privacy standardisation is essential, especially in the context of  information security, before moving ahead with the adoption or development of new standards. Such an  analysis might lead to the identification of common issues that may be addressed with baseline cross-sector  standards, and additional issues to be dealt in sector-specific standards.  EU bodies and competent authorities in the Member States should promote the adoption of a  structured approach on the analysis of sector-specific needs with regard to privacy standardisation,  especially in information security context and then proceed with the adoption or development of new  standards.  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  25  Relevant regulatory authorities, e.g. in the areas of privacy, cybersecurity, telecommunications etc, need  to be involved further in standardisation activities, e.g. in defining, endorsing, or affirming potential  standardisation goals in the areas of privacy and information security. This could be done in several  manners by means of standardisation requests pursuant Art. 10 Regulation 1025/2012, EU policy  documents with clear objectives explicitly referring to standardisation, but also via research, namely by  aligning relevant aspects of the new Framework Programme. A joint agenda meeting the needs of  regulatory authorities across the board in the policy areas of privacy, cybersecurity and  telecommunications needs to be set up and coordination across all of them needs to take place at MS and  EU levels.  EU policy makers and relevant EU bodies need to be further involved in the standardisation process,  so as to define, endorse or affirm potential standardisation goals in the areas of privacy and  information security.  The role of technology and privacy by design  As discussed in chapters 3 and 4, much of the standardisation activity is focused on standardisation of  technological solutions. Among those solutions, many address the introduction of privacy-preserving  technologies throughout the whole lifecycle of a product or a system. Many stakeholders, ranging from  regulators, consumers, to the industry have acknowledged the value of privacy by design. In a recent  opinion, the European Data Protection Supervisor made a pledge for Privacy by design to be treated as a  landmark for values driven technology development41.  Despite a general common agreement on the value  of privacy by design, the concept and its implementation are still not clearly elucidated in standardization  activities.  Competent bodies at EU and Member State level  should further promote their research and  standardisation activities to support the realization of Privacy by Design principle.  Continuous research on Privacy by Design is valuable, as well as platforms where experts can exchange  knowledge on the latest technological developments  such as the EDPS Internet Privacy Engineering Network  (IPEN).42 Standardisation of aspects of Privacy by Design would also prove to be helpful, in terms of making  technology accessible to a broader audience. A good example of such initiative is the recently developed ISO  Committee on Consumer protection and privacy by design for consumer goods and services.43  41 EDPS Opinion on Privacy by Design 2018, p.19.  42 Read more: https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/ipen-internet-privacy-engineering-network_en [accessed 10 September  2018].  43 ISO/PC 317 https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html [accessed 10 September 2018]  https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/ipen-internet-privacy-engineering-network_en https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  26  7.

International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)  The ISO is a non-governmental organisation, operating under the Swiss law. ISO develops international  standards through its Technical Committees. Today, approximately 160 national standardisation bodies are  members of ISO and collaborate in over 750 Technical Committees. The ISO standards are voluntary, even  though it is also possible they sometimes carry more weight than a mere voluntary agreement; international  standards may be required to be followed as in the case of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)45  Barriers  to Trade Agreement or referenced in regional or national legislation.46  ISO, together with IEC, has a  longstanding tradition in developing information security standards, the framework of the Joint Technical  Committee 1 (JTC 1) on information technology standards.  International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC)  While the ISO work spans over a range of fields, the IEC is focused on international standards for electrical,  electronic, and related fields. IEC is a non-for-profit, quasi-governmental organisation, with National  Committees (one per country) as members.47 Unlike ISO, the IEC also offers conformity assessment via the  Conformity Assessment Board.48  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  The International Telecommunication Union is a United Nations’ specialized agency, working on the  development of voluntary recommendations (standards) for the telecommunication sector. ITU has  numerous publications on cybersecurity and Internet of Things that often address privacy aspects.  European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)  CEN is one of the three European Standardisation Organisations (ESO). CEN is set up as an association under  the Belgian law. Participation in CEN is based on national representation, via the national standardization  bodies of the European Union Member States, and other countries participating in the European Single  Market, such as Switzerland and Turkey. CEN develops consensus-based voluntary European standards (EN),  but also other deliverables of softer nature in the form of CEN Workshop Agreements.49 Approximately 1/3  of the CEN’s European Standards are developed in response to standardization requests coming from the  European Commission.50 CEN has been working on privacy standards since 1997, when the CEN Information  Society Standardization System (CEN/ISSS) was established. The CEN/ISSS was focused on Information and  45 WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade: https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/17-tbt_e.htm [accessed 2  September 2018]  46 See for example Art. 43 Regulation (EU) 679/2016  47 See  http://www.iec.ch/about/?ref=menu [accessed 2 September 2018]  48 See https://www.iso.org/conformity-assessment.html [accessed 2 September 2018] Read more about the conformity  assessment activities of IEC: http://www.iec.ch/about/activities/conformity.htm [accessed 2 September 2018]  49 Read more about CEN Workshop Agreements: https://www.cen.eu/work/products/CWA/Pages/default.aspx [accessed 2  September 2018]  50 https://www.cen.eu/you/EuropeanStandardization/Pages/default.aspx [accessed 2 September 2018]  https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/17-tbt_e.htm http://www.iec.ch/about/?ref=menu https://www.iso.org/conformity-assessment.html http://www.iec.ch/about/activities/conformity.htm https://www.cen.eu/work/products/CWA/Pages/default.aspx https://www.cen.eu/you/EuropeanStandardization/Pages/default.aspx  Guidance and gaps analysis for European standardisation  Final Draft | Privacy standards in the information security context | November 2018  31  Communication Technologies (ICT), with a working group on privacy and data protection.51  Recently, CEN  created a new Technical Committee on Data Protection, as elaborated later in this Report.  European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC)  CENELEC is a non-for profit organisation operating under the Belgian law. It develops voluntary standards in  the field of electrotechnical engineering and collaborates closely with the IEC. Like CEN, the participation in  CENELEC is through national representation. The IEC is mainly involved in privacy and data protection related  standards in the information security context through its collaboration with CEN. An example is the  Standardisation request by the European Commission M/530 to develop privacy management standards for  security technologies.52  European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)  ETSI is a non-for-profit organisation established in France. Stakeholders-members of ETSI may join ETSI’s  standardisation work via direct participation. In addition, the standards developed by ETSI are made publicly  available free of charge. ETSI develops standards on different technology clusters: security, interoperability,  connecting things, wireless systems and networks, and others.53 ETSI’s Technical Committee on Cyber  security (TC Cyber) is mostly active in privacy standardisation for information security.  Cooperation Agreements  The recognised standard-setting organisations have concluded collaboration agreements, that address  issues of participation to each other’s work, but also – very importantly- the avoidance of duplication of  work. The Vienna Agreement concluded between ISO and CEN for example, underlines that international  standardisation takes precedence over national standardisation, but also recognises that the Single  European Market has particular needs for European standards.54 A similar agreement is signed between IEC  and CENELEC (Dresden and Frankfurt agreements).55  Other Fora  Beyond the aforementioned renowned Standardisation Organisations there are numerous other fora and  consortia developing specifications and standards. Most notably the ISOC/IETF and the W3C, whose  relevance to the Internet and the World Wide Web can hardly be underestimated. Equally, there are  numerous sector-specific, but also cross-cutting organisations, that may provide relevant advice in the field.

Re-building trust in the online environment has been perceived as key to economic and social  development by the European legislator. Regulation (EU) No 910/20142 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation)  adopted last year and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC on 1 July 2016 clearly aims to enhance trust in  electronic transactions in the internal market by providing a common foundation for secure electronic  interaction between citizens, businesses and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of  public and private online services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.  In order to ensure uniform conditions for its implementation, the Regulation confers implementing powers  to the Commission, to promulgate implementation specifications or to reference standards the use of  which would raise a presumption of compliance with select requirements laid down in the eIDAS  Regulation. When adopting delegated or implementing acts, the Commission needs to take due account of  the standards and technical specifications drawn up by European and international standardisation  organisations and bodies, in particular ETSI, CEN, ISO and ITU.  Already in 2009, the European Commission issued Standardisation Mandate 460 to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI  to update the existing eSignature standardisation deliverables in view of establishing a fully rationalised  framework, which would solve the issues raised in actual use of eSignatures in the EU. These issues were  about, notably, the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, the multiplicity of  standardization documents and the lack of usage guidelines, and different technical implementations.  This report on one hand analyses the eIDAS requirements with regard to the standards, on the other  analyses currently available standards and compares the results of both analyses. Such a mapping is  oriented at the requirements specified in the various eIDAS articles. Pursuant to this mapping it can be  concluded that usually the analysed standards usually cover some requirements in part or whole.  Existing standards can be endorsed for being used within the frames of eIDAS Regulation, to the extent as  presented in the previous sections. The analysis presented in this report led, however, to a shortlist of  gaps, where specific eIDAS requirements have yet to be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC)  nor international ones.  1 Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community  framework for electronic signatures.

Introduction3  Pursuant to 15 years of implementation of Directive 1999/93/EC4 on a Community framework for  electronic signatures, the lack of trust and in particular the perceived lack of legal certainty have made  consumers, businesses and public authorities hesitate to carry out transactions electronically and to adopt  new digital services.  Re-building trust in the online environment is still seen as key to economic and social development by the  European legislator. Regulation (EU) No 910/20145 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation) adopted last year and  repealing Directive 1999/93/EC on 1 July 2016 clearly aims to enhance trust in electronic transactions in  the internal market by providing a common foundation for secure electronic interaction between citizens,  businesses and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of public and private online  services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.  In addition to a set of provisions addressing the mutual recognition and equivalence over the EU of  national electronic identification schemes notified against a common assurance level scheme, the eIDAS  Regulation is setting legal provisions for cross-border recognition and EU harmonised legal effects for a  much broader range of trust services than Directive 1999/93/EC that was a mere framework-setting  instrument. Furthermore, the notions of qualified trust services and qualified trust service provider have  been introduced with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of  qualified trust services and products are used or provided. While Directive 1999/93/EC was purposefully  aimed at (a) provisions on non repudiation addressed by means of issuing qualified certificates and (b) the  automatic cross-border recognition of “qualified electronic signatures” as equivalent to hand written  signature, the eIDAS Regulation also addresses other types of qualified trust services. Such services aim at  the protection and adoption of electronic services (e.g. eGovernment and eCommerce transactions etc.)  in  the digital market, including qualified electronic time stamps, qualified electronic seals, qualified validation  and preservation of qualified electronic signatures/seals, qualified electronic registered delivery services  and qualified website authentication.  These qualified trust services are clearly “marketed” by the Regulation to enhance in particular the trust of  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in the internal market and to promote the use  of trust services and products.  As illustrated in Figure 1 below, through its set of (qualified) trust services related provisions and articles, it  is actually a complete pyramid of trust that the eIDAS Regulation is setting up. The most visible part is the  3 Sources:  - Study to support the implementation of a pan-European framework on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market.

Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  08  “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, which each qualified trust service provider may use to brand  and promote the quality and trustworthiness of the qualified trust services it provides.  Figure 1: eIDAS Regulation building trust in the online environment – Supervision  (Source: IAS² study)  This trust mark introduced by the eIDAS Regulation and further defined by Commission Implementing  Regulation (EU) 2015/8066  is expected to be the convenient distinctive mark for online services users to  identify qualified trust services provided by qualified trust service provider and gain confidence in such  services to secure online service they are using or about to use. By clearly differentiating high quality and  trustworthy qualified trust services from other services, using a trust mark, it is expected that transparency  in the market will improve. The users will be helped to fully benefit and consciously rely on electronic  services supported by qualified trust services and hence to contribute to the development of the digital  market.  The adoption of a trust mark, its credibility, and trustworthiness require a legal basis (as per Art.23 of the  Regulation) and a suitable set of procedural, quality and security requirements to comply with.  6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services. OJ L 128, 23.05.2015, p13-15.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  09  Additionally a mechanism is needed to  notify the market that qualified trust service providers meet such  requirements and obligations so that users of such services can make informed decisions.  As illustrated in the above Figure 1, the eIDAS Regulation explicitly sets up a consistent set of quality  andsecurity requirements and obligations for qualified trust services (QTSs) and qualified trust service  providers (QTSPs). These requirements aim to enhance the trust of consumers and enterprises, in  particular SMEs, in the internal (electronic) market and to promote the use of such qualified trust services  and products.  Through ex-ante and ex-post supervisory activities the eIDAS Regulation sets up a supervisory regime upon  these quality and security requirements and obligations for QTSs and QTSPs. The eIDAS Regulation aims to  ensure that, from before providing qualified services up to terminating such services, the QTSPs indeed  meet these requirements. This supervisory regime for QTS’ and QTSPs is enforced in each EU Member  State (MS), through a national supervisory body to ensure a comparable security level of QTSs over the EU.  The supervisory regime covers the entire life-cycle of the QTSP and their QTSs and in specific:   It relies on a pre-authorisation mechanisms obliging trust service providers intending to provide QTS to  notify the competent supervisory body of their intention together with a conformity assessment  report (CAR) issued by an accredited conformity assessment body (CAB) attesting that the QTSP and  the QTSs it intends to provide meet the requirements laid down in the Regulation.   Once qualified status is granted, it obliges, QTSPs to re-affirm attestations, as above, each two years.   It allows competent supervisory bodies, at their own discretion and at any time, to audit themselves or  to request an accredited CAB to perform a conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS and to produce a  CAR confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides meet the requirements laid down in the  Regulation.   It foresees rules to be followed by QTSP and supervisory activities to be performed in cases where the  QTSP changes or terminates the provisioning of a QTS, or risk ceasing operating.  The decisions to grant or withdraw qualified status to trust services and trust service providers, resulting  from the above described supervisory activities, are taken by the national supervisory bodies .  All associated decisions are published in electronically signed or sealed national trusted lists. Such national  trusted lists are established, maintained and published to disseminate in a trustworthy manner  information related to the qualified trust service providers for which a Member State is responsible,  together with information related to the qualified trust services provided by them, including the whole  history of the qualified status they have been granted.  The mandatory EU MS national trusted lists are published at least in a form suitable for automated  processing. In practice these are XML files. The voluntary “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, aims  to make any such qualification visible to the consumer. The eIDAS Regulation obliges QTSPs using such a  trust mark to provide, close to it, a link to the corresponding trusted list allowing for verification.  The pyramid of trust further relies on and is strengthened by the use of best practices and standards. In  order to ensure uniformity the Regulation confers implementing powers on the Commission, with regard  to specifications and standards referencing (Recital (71)).  When adopting delegated or implementing acts, the Commission typically takes account of standards and  technical specifications drawn up by European and international standardisation organisations and bodies,  in particular the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Telecommunications  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  10  Standards Institute (ETSI), the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU), with a view to ensuring a high level of security and interoperability of  electronic identification and trust services (Recital (72)).  Seven implementing acts are foreseen by the Regulation to support implementation of eIDAS, as  illustrated in Figure 2. Two mandatory implementing acts have to be laid down respectively on trust marks7  and trusted lists8, three optional implementing acts supporting the supervisory regime, respectively on  conformity assessment bodies, QTSP initiation and supervisory body yearly activities reports, and two  optional implementing acts on common provisions respectively on TSPs and on QTSPs.  Additional implementing acts are foreseen on specific provisions per type of (qualified) trust service and  trust service provider.

Amongst the above list of secondary legislative acts, only four implementing acts are mandatory, timed  and adopted (trust mark, trusted lists and electronic signatures/seals format in public services and  standards for the security assessment of information technology products under article 30.3) For the rest  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  13  of implementing acts, it is clearly expected that industry will self-regulate as much as possible within the  legal and supervisory framework provided by the Regulation.  When the European Commission is empowered to draft secondary legislation it:   Produces drafts of sets of rules published as a delegated or an implementing act; in this case there  would be no (EU) standard, but a piece of secondary legislation to be approved according to article  48.2 of the Regulation.   Issues a Mandate to European Standardisation Organisations to produce a standard that will be  referenced by a delegated or implementing act. Such standards should clearly separate the purely  technical (industry) part and the eventual regulatory part that implements or specifies a specific  aspect of the Regulation.  Currently,  an informal expert group has been set up by the Commission, composed of MS experts to draw  up a compilation of mandatory Implementing Acts in 2015 and will do the same for non mandatory ones as  well.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  14  2. Requirements of eIDAS  Supervision and conformity assessment requirements  2.1.1 Conformity assessment bodies accreditation & conformity assessment rules  The ex ante and ex post supervisory regime covering the entire life-cycle of the QTSP and the QTSs they  provide relies on conformity assessment reports issued by a conformity assessment body (initiation of a  QTS, two-yearly assessment, ad hoc assessment at discretion of supervisory body).  As per Art.3.(18) a ‘conformity assessment body’ refers to ‘a body defined in point 13 of Article 2 of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [7], which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as competent to  carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust services it  provides’.  The European co-operation for Accreditation (EA - www.european-accreditation.org) is the body  established under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 to define the accreditation schemes used by national  accreditation bodies (NAB) to accredit CABs in a specific context like the one defined by the eIDAS  Regulation.  EA and CEN/ETSI have already set up discussions to establish, under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, the  scheme under which national accreditation bodies (NABs) shall accredit, in accordance with Regulation  (EU) No 910/2014, conformity assessment bodies (CABs), as competent to carry out conformity  assessments referred to in its Art.20.1 and whose purpose is ‘to confirm that the qualified trust service  providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in this  Regulation’.  That accreditation scheme is organised as follows:   The retained scheme relies on ISO/IEC 17065  (Internal & External Services), as the general  framework for accrediting the competency of CABs to assess products, processes and services,  and within this framework requires to demonstrate their:  o competency to carry out specific ISO/IEC 17021 -based assessments,  o competency to carry out specific ISO/IEC 27006 -based assessments (Information Security  Management Systems - ISMS).  Note: Beyond ISO/IEC 17065, no additional accreditation is further required according to ISO/IEC 17021  and ISO/IEC 27006   The scheme also defines a “sectoral” specific framework, to further accredit the competency  of CABs to carry out assessments of qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) and qualified trust  services (QTSs) they provide. This specific framework builds on EN 319 403 to specify the  general requirements for CABs and the general auditing rules under which CABs will carry out  their conformity assessments of QTSPs and their QTSs.   In order to be complete, the accreditation scheme requires the identification of a specific set  of “TSP audit criteria”, as defined in EN 319 403, against which the competences of CABs to  assess the QTSPs/QTSs will be accredited and against which the conformity assessment of  QTSPs/QTSs will be conducted by the accredited CAB's. EN 319 403 allow these “TSP audit  criteria” to:  http://www.european-accreditation.org/  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  15  o take into account specificities of the type of trusted service to be assessed;  o ensure that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully covered; and  o be based on standards, publicly available specifications and/or regulatory requirements.  Leveraging on such an accreditation scheme, the competence of accredited CABs would be recognised to  cover not only the conduction of Art.20.1 two-yearly conformity assessments but also the initial  conformity assessments referred to in Art.21, as well as ad-hoc assessments referred to in Art.20.2. These  assessments can perfectly result in conformity assessment reports based on the same set of QTSP/QTS  audit criteria as used for two-yearly conformity assessments (Art.20.1).  2.1.2 CAB as certification bodies  It should be noted as well that this accreditation scheme requires CABs to be certification bodies, and not  simply inspection bodies or laboratories, as CABs are required to certify the conformity of TSPs against the  identified TSP audit criteria against which the assessment is conducted.  ‘EA members unanimously selected ISO 1706510 as the best option as basis for the accreditation of CABs in  the context of conformity assessments of TSPs and trust services they provide, and in particular assessment  of QTSPs/QTSs. EA experience is that ISO 1702011 is not considered appropriate to assessment of  conformance of requirements for the management system of the TSP, and it is considered that review of  the security management system of TSP provides an important part of a TSP audit.  Also, 17020 does not impose a continued assessment by following deviations of the use of certification  brands. Inspection processes tend to review the status of the items being inspected at a point in time  whereas the requirements for a TSP need a more long term, continuous assessment as provided by a  certification scheme. The issue of certification includes requirements for regular surveillance activities as  well as specific requirements for ongoing quality and service improvement.  On their own ISO 2700612 and 1702113 are not considered sufficient to cover assessment of specific service  requirements. However, ISO 17065 was specifically designed to be extended to incorporate requirements  from 17021, but the opposite is not true as ISO 17065 requirements do not fit well into ISO 17021.  The industry requirement for public trust services, such as reflected in the CA Browser Forum guidelines and  for other national schemes for non-qualified trust services, is for a clear indication of the technical  compliance to industry good practice. The aim of the EN 319 403 conformity assessment is also to allow  assessment of conformance to industry good practices as well as that the technical requirements of the  Regulation are met. ETSI/CEN consider that any scheme which falls short of assessment against industry  good practice will bring the acceptability of qualified trust services into question.  Furthermore, there seem to be a market requirement for a clear statement in the international context  where an independent non-governmental statement of conformance.’14  10 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=46568  11 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=52994  12 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=62313  13 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=61651  14 EA/ETSI disposition on comments made during the approval process of EN 319 403  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=46568 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=52994 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=62313 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=61651  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  16  The certification decision of the CAB as to whether QTSP/QTS assessed (technically, operationally and  procedurally) meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation addressed in Art.20.1 with regards to two- yearly assessments. Same decisions are required in the context of initial assessments (Art.21) and of ad  hoc assessments (Art.20.2) conducted by accredited CABs.  Certification decisions of the CABs do not automatically entail an obligation for the Supervisory Body to  align its decision as to whether to grant a qualified status to the trust service provider and the trust service  it provides. With regards to supervision of QTSPs/QTSs, Regulation 910/2014/EU gives an exclusive legal  competence for the national Supervisory Body (SB) in granting the qualified status to trust service  providers and the trust services they provide (see Art.17.4.g, Art.20.3 and Art.21.2).  2.1.3 “TSP audit criteria” in the context of eIDAS Regulation  In any other context than Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, having a specific technical standard such as “TSP  audit criteria” allows TSPs to demonstrate conformity against such a standard to interested parties  benefiting from the certification issued by the accredited CAB as a result of a successful conformity  assessment. For example, TSPs being certified by an accredited CAB against EN 319 411-1 (“Policy and  security requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing certificates; Part 1: General requirements”) would  likely be entitled to be accepted by CA/Browser Forum members for inclusion of their CA root certificates  in the corresponding CA root certificates trust stores of these members.  However in the context of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, limiting the “TSP audit criteria” to one or more  specific technical standards raise some issues:   Expected purpose: As per Art.20.1 of the Regulation, the expected purpose of conformity  assessment reports from accredited CAB on QTSPs/QTSs is “to confirm that the qualified trust  service providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid  down in this Regulation”. These eIDAS conformity assessment reports (initial, two-yearly and  ad hoc15) must confirm that the QTSP/QTS meet all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. Their purpose is not to confirm the conformity of the QTSP/QTS to a specific  technical standard addressed to TSPs.  None of the CEN/ETSI standards cover all requirements of the Regulation applicable to the addressed  (Q)TSP/(Q)TS. They only cover the technical counterparts of an important but limited set of legal provisions  laid down in the Regulation.  The “TSP audit criteria against which the competences of CABs to assess the QTSPs/QTSs will be accredited  and against which the conformity assessment of QTSPs/QTSs will be conducted by the accredited CAB's”  (hereafter called “QTSP/QTS audit criteria”) should allow accredited CABs to assess whether QTSPs/QTSs  meet the requirements of the Regulation not how they meet them.   De facto mandatory TSP standards: Assuming that one or more CEN/ETSI standards would  address and cover all requirements applicable to a specific type of QTSP/QTS, having such  standards as the “QTSP/QTS audit criteria” would make them de facto obligatory for QTSPs  and the QTSs they provide. Indeed as QTSPs must be assessed by accredited CABs, when CABs  15 Standards mentioned require annual surveillance of TSPs, but from the eIDAS Regulation, there is no such  recurrence needed, as there is a continuous supervision from the Supervisory Body that is entitled to conduct an ad- hoc audit or request an ad-hoc assessment from an accredited CAB.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  17  are accredited only against such standards, there is no other choice for QTSPs to comply with  such standards; otherwise they could not be assessed by an accredited CAB.  The eIDAS Regulation is intimately associated to an implementing technical layer that will mainly rely on  standards adopted by standardisation bodies (as per articles 2(1) , (8), (9) and (10) as well as Annex I of  Regulation 1025/2012/EC) and technical specifications. Such a technical layer could be used by  stakeholders on a voluntary basis as one manner to implement the requirements of the Regulation. It  would not be acceptable that a standard became de facto mandatory.  The implementation of the eIDAS accreditation scheme should target the same approach with regards to  the QTSPs/QTSs, allowing them to implement any method, standardised or not, to meet the applicable  requirements of the Regulation.  Furthermore, Art.20.4 implementing acts are addressing CABs and not QTSPs with regards to the  referencing of standards, in particular on their accreditation, conformity assessment reports, and auditing  rules under which they will carry out their conformity assessment of the qualified trust service providers.   Incomplete standard referencing scheme in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to QTSP/QTS  obligations: The eIDAS Regulation allows, through the adoption of secondary legislation, to  establish reference numbers of standards, which when they are met will provide legal  presumption of conformity to the corresponding legal provisions. However it should be clearly  noted that not all the requirements applicable to a specific type of QTSP/QTS are covered by  such a referencing mechanism. E.g. from Art.24 on requirements for QTSPs, only Art.24.(2).e  and Art.24.(2).f requirements benefit from such a referencing.  It is not possible to establish a list of standards applicable to QTSPs/QTSs that will provide presumption of  conformity with the Regulation.   IA foreseen in Art.20.4 are optional: It should be noted that the implementing acts foreseen in  Art.20.4 are not mandatory but optional. There is no obligation for the European Commission  to establish such acts. The provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are supposed self-sufficient in  order to ensure the applicability of the legal framework. As for all optional implementing acts,  these Art.20.4 acts are deemed related to non-essential elements of the Regulation that are  not substantial for the Regulation to work. The need to adopt them must be assessed on a  case-by-case basis in the light of several principles including  o The eIDAS framework consistency: in the present case adopting Art.20.4  implementing acts would require to ensure its consistency with other implementing  acts granting QTSPs/QTSs with presumption of compliance with some legal provisions.  o Taking into account stakeholders/market needs: evaluating stakeholders / market's  demands and needs, potential barriers hamper eIDAS adoption and take-up  o Favouring non-regulatory approach, co-regulatory approach and development under  other regulatory frameworks: In this case, as the implementation of an eIDAS  accreditation scheme may be ensured under the framework of Regulation  765/2008/EC, as being set up by EA, the implementing act foreseen in art.20.4 may  not be needed. Furthermore adopting a secondary act means codifying a given  technological approach that may quickly become obsolete, requiring a revision of the  adopted act.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  18   Availability and adequacy of standards: Following the availability of a standard, the  Commission may assess whether to list it in an implementing act.   Availability of QTSPs/QTSs standards is important but not required: Considering the current  status of the European (ETSI, CEN/CENELEC) standardisation framework, it is unlikely that all  types of QTSPs/QTS will be addressed by technical specifications and standards   Outcome based “QTSP/QTS audit criteria” in the context of eIDAS Regulation: For all the  above-stated reasons, in the eIDAS accreditation scheme being set up by EA under Regulation  765/2008/EC, the “QTSPs/QTSs audit criteria”16 should be designed in such a way that:  o The resulting conformity assessment reports issued by accredited CABs aim to confirm  that the qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services provided by  them meet the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  o It consists of one or more separate standards, outcome based, mapping audit criteria  built as control objectives and controls, against the requirements of the Regulation per  type of qualified trust service. These criteria shall be used by accredited CABs as a  basis for establishing the conformity assessment report to be issued by them  confirming QTSP/QTS they assess meet all applicable requirements from the  Regulation.  These criteria defined in an “outcome based” approach could leverage on the check  lists specified by or in the context of relevant available standards (e.g. the check list  from ETSI draft EN 319 411-2 with regards to QTSPs issuing qualified certificates); it  should however be clear that these criteria are for use by CABs as a method to  produce a conformity assessment report on the conformity of the audited QTSPs/QTSs  and shall not presuppose or require QTSPs/QTSs to comply with the standards from  which they are derived. QTSPs/QTSs are free to implement such standards, any other  standard or no standard at all. Current CEN/ETSI standards addressing QTSP and QTS  related specifications, including the ETSI EN 319 4x1 series and any other relevant  standards, can be used by TSPs on a voluntary basis but cannot be made (de facto)  mandatory.  o Whenever compliance with part of the applicable eIDAS requirements would be  deemed satisfied by compliance with a referenced standard, this would be  acknowledged provided the conformity with such a referenced standard has been  assessed and confirmed by an eIDAS accredited CABs.  Currently no such QTSPs/QTSs audit criteria standard exists and the European Commission should ask  CEN/ETSI to prepare it as matter of priority.  This does not prevent the accreditation scheme being set up by EA and CEN/ETSI to allow accreditation of  CABs against specific set of TSP oriented standards so that TSPs/TSs and/or QTSPs/QTSs can benefit from  certification of conformity against any of such specific standards. This can be used to certify compliance  with standards for use outside the context of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. CA/Browser Forum and the  associated industry) but also for attesting compliance with standards possibly referenced in eIDAS  secondary legislation.  16 i.e. TSP audit criteria against which the competences of CABs to assess the QTSPs/QTSs will be accredited and  against which the conformity assessment of QTSPs/QTSs will be conducted by the accredited CAB's.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  19  Requirements that TSPs should put in place in order to provide certain services  2.2.1 Requirements common to all TSPs   Data processing and protection (Art.5)  o Art.5.1. Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  o Art.5.2. Without prejudice to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use  of pseudonyms in electronic transactions shall not be prohibited.   Liability and burden of the proof (Art.13)  o (Art.13.1) TSP liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or legal  person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation   Burden of proving intention/negligence of non-qualified TSP is on claiming party   Intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTSP  o (Art.13.2) When TSP informed customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services,  & when such limitations are recognisable to third parties, TSP not liable when limitations have  been exceeded.  o (Art.13.3) In accordance with national rules on liability.   Accessibility for person with disabilities (Art.15) – where feasible   Due diligence (Art.19.1)  o shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide.  o Having regard to the latest technological developments, these measures shall ensure that the  level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk  o measures shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform  stakeholders of the adverse effects of any such incidents   Security & personal data breach notification (Art.19.2)  o shall, without undue delay but in any event within 24 hours after having become aware of it,  notify the supervisory body and, where applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the  competent national body for information security or the data protection authority, of any  breach of security or loss of integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided  or on the personal data maintained therein  o shall also notify the [likely adversely affected] natural or legal [customer] of the breach of  security or loss of integrity without undue delay  o May be required by the supervisory body to inform the public, when it is in the public interest  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  20  The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, further specifies measures & procedures for these  due diligence and security/personal data breach notification provisions. In this context however, the  initiative of ENISA on security breach notifications (SBN) may make the adoption of the related  implementing act under art.19.4 of eIDAS Regulation unnecessary.  Building upon the experience on SBN  gained while working on the implementation of article 13a of the e-communication Framework Directive,  ENISA is currently developing technical guidelines to facilitate the implementation of article 19 of the  eIDAS Regulation. Such guidelines will be developed in close cooperation with all stakeholders (in  particular national supervisory bodies and TSPs) and focus on appropriate technical and operational  solutions to comply with article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation. Once completed, these guidelines would be  available to stakeholders for voluntary adoption, and be subject to regular revision (as it has been the case  of these related to article 13a of the e-communication Framework Directive).  Furthermore it is recommended to the TSPs to prepare procedures to be used in case of and to support  supervision of their SB according to article 17.3. This may be done in co-operation with the responsible SB.  2.2.2 Requirements common to all QTSPs  Requirements common to all QTSPs are these requirements applicable to all TSPs (see section 2.2.1)  together with the following requirements laid down in Art.24.2 of the eIDAS Regulation:  (a) Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease (new provision  compared to that of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (b) Requirements on staff (similar to Annex II.e of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (c) Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law (similar  to Annex II.h of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (d) Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. limitations on use (similar to Annex.II.k);  (e) use trustworthy systems and products (similar to Annex.II.f + reliability of supported  processes);  (f) use trustworthy systems to store (personal) data (new provision compared to that of Directive  1999/93/EC);  (g) take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data (generalisation of Annex.II.g);  (h) Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received (generalisation of  Annex.II.i), even after cessation (new);  (i) Up-to-date termination plan (agreed with SB) to ensure continuity of service (new provision  compared to that of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (j) ensure lawful processing of personal data in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC (similar to  Art.8 of Directive 1999/93/EC).  (Art.24.5) The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of standards  for trustworthy systems and products, which comply with the requirements   under Art.24.2.(e) - trustworthy systems and products   under Art.24.2.(f) - trustworthy systems for data storage  Compliance with the requirements laid down in these articles Art.24.2.(e) and (f) shall be presumed where  trustworthy systems and products meet these standards.  2.2.3 Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified certificates  Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified certificates are these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these  requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following requirements laid down in:  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  21   Art.24.1:   Art.24.2.(k) on establishing and keeping updated a certificate database;   Art.24.3: If a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified certificates decides to revoke a  certificate, it shall register such revocation in its certificate database and publish the revocation  status of the certificate in a timely manner, and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt of  the request. The revocation shall become effective immediately upon its publication.   Art24.4: With regard to paragraph 3, qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates  shall provide to any relying party information on the validity or revocation status of qualified  certificates issued by them. This information shall be made available at least on a per certificate  basis at any time and beyond the validity period of the certificate in an automated manner that is  reliable, free of charge and efficient.  OCSP does not necessarily provide more up to date information than a CRL. In practice, the two last  requirements do not require the implementation of OCSP based certificate validity status information  services. It would be advised to provide both types of such services for efficiency reasons, provided  adequate profiling of the corresponding standards are specified. Anticipating the termination, expected or  unexpected, may also have a considerable influence in selecting implementation of both types of services.   Content of qualified certificates:  o As per Annex I for qualified certificate for electronic signatures (Art.28.1)  o As per Annex III for qualified certificate for electronic seals (Art.38.1)  o As per Annex IV for qualified certificate for website authentication (Art.45.1)   May include non-mandatory attributes, not affecting interoperability or recognition (Art.28.3, Art.  38.3, also applying to QC for WSA when special case of QC for electronic seals – Recital (65))   Revocation of qualified certificates is definitive (Art.28.4, Art. 38.4, also applying to QC for WSA  when special case of QC for electronic seals – Recital (65))  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  22   Temporary suspension of QC for electronic seals and for electronic signatures may be specified on  a national basis (Art.28.5, Art.38.5)  o With obliteration?  o Without obliteration?  In case the QTSP issues qualified electronic signature creation devices (QSCD), the following requirements  apply:   Characteristics of QSCD:  o As per Annex II for qualified electronic signature creation devices (Art.29.1)   Certification of the QSCD by appropriate bodies (Art.30.1) whereas the certification is based upon  an security evaluation process according to Art. 30.3, and where the European Commission shall,  by means of implementing acts, establish list of standards for the security assessment of  information technology products.  Instead of issuing a new QSCD, the QTSP might want to certify public keys originating from QSCD already in  the hand of a user. In such a case the QTSP has to ensure by appropriate means that the key is truly  originating from a QSCD, before issuing the certificate (Art.3(12)).  With regard to the requirements of art. 24.1.(b), on issuing remotely a qualified certificate, the identity  verification process is in fact more strict than identity proofing process at the issuance of electronic means  of identification of the level of assurance ‘high’17. Therefore to be compliant with art. 24.1.(b) it is  (explicitly) mandatory to use electronic identification means for which physical presence was performed at  issuance, regardless it represents level ‘substantial’ or ‘high’.  2.2.4 Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified validation services for QESig / QESeal  Requirements for QTSPs providing validation services for QESig / QESeal18 (referring to Art.33 / Art.40) are  these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.33.1(a) with regard to the validation process to be provided in compliance with Art.32.1. (alinea (a)  to (h)).   Art.33.1(b) for the provision of the validation result in an automated manner that needs:  o to provide to the relying party the correct result of the validation process and shall allow the  relying party to detect any security relevant issues (in conjunction of Art.32.2);  o to be reliable and efficient; and  o to bear the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the QTSP providing  the qualified validation service.  17 According to CIR (EU) 2015/1502 on setting out the minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance  levels for electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European  Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market. OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p7-20.  18 Art.40 for validation of QESeals refers back to Art. 32 and 33  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  23  As foreseen in Art.32.3, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers  of standards for the validation of qualified electronic signatures and as foreseen in Art.33.2 the  Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of standards for qualified  validation service as required by Art.33.1.  As the relative vagueness of provisions stipulated in Art.32 on the requirements for the validation of  qualified electronic signatures may lead to varying implementation measures , adopting such  implementing acts would be recommended.  2.2.5 Requirements for QTSPs providing preservation service for QESig/ QESeal  Requirements for QTSPs providing preservation services for QESig / QESeal19 (referring to (Art.34 / Art.40)  are these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.34.1 for making use of procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of  the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological validity period.  Where, according to Art.34.2 the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference  numbers of standards for the qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures and seals.  2.2.6 Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified electronic time stamps  Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified electronic time stamps (referring to Art.42) are these  requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.42.1 for qualified electronic time stamps:  o to bind the date and time to data in such a manner as to reasonably preclude the possibility of  the data being changed undetectably;  o to be based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated Universal Time; and  o to be signed using an advanced electronic signature or sealed with an advanced electronic seal  of the qualified trust service provider, or by some equivalent method  As of Art.42.2 the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of  standards for the binding of date and time to data and for accurate time sources.  2.2.7 Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified electronic registered delivery service  Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified electronic registered delivery service (referring to Art.44) are  these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.44.1 on the definition of the qualified electronic registered delivery service which may be  offered by one or more QTSP.  19 Art.40 for preservation of QSeals refers back to Art. 34  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  24  As of Art.44.2 the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of  standards for processes for sending and receiving data.  Technical requirements for signatures, seals, certificates and their validation  In this context, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506 of 8 September 2015 laying down  specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced electronic seals to be  recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of  the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic  transactions in the internal market has been published in the Official Journal of the EU20.  The eIDAS Regulation specifies other electronic signatures, electronic seals and related certificates  requirements set directly in the annexes to the regulation; other requirements are stipulated as follows, by  establishing reference numbers of standards for:21   Art.24(5) - trustworthy systems and products, which comply with the requirements under points (e)  and (f) of paragraph 2 of Art.24.   Art.27(4) - advanced electronic signatures in public services.   Art.28(6) - qualified certificates for electronic signatures.   Art.29(2) - qualified electronic signature creation devices.   Art.32(3) - the validation of qualified electronic signatures.   Art.34(2) - qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures   Art.37(4) - advanced electronic seals in public services.   Art.38(6) - qualified certificates for electronic seals.   Art.39(1) - qualified electronic seal creation devices.   Art.40 - the validation of qualified electronic seals.   Art.42(2) - the binding of date and time to data and for accurate time sources in the context of  qualified electronic time stamps (Art.42(1)).   Art.45(2) - qualified certificates for website authentication.  The following direct requirements are specified with ANNEX I to IV to the eIDAS-Regulation:   ANNEX I – Requirements for qualified certificates for electronic signatures:  Specifies the minimum data contents of the certificate and requires, that the certificate supporting  advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider  must be available free of charge, ANNEX I (h),   ANNEX II – Requirements for qualified electronic signature creation devices:  Specifies minimum requirements to be met by a QSCD and requires that electronic signature creation  data may only be managed on behalf of the signatory by a qualified trust service provider. In addition,  requirements for the duplication of a signatory’s electronic signature creation data are specified  ANNEX II, 4.   ANNEX III – Requirements for qualified certificates for electronic seals:  Specifies the minimum data contents of the certificate and requires, that the certificate supporting  advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider  must be available free of charge, ANNEX III (h),  20 OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p37-41.  21 The approach of the Commission in this regard is expressed in section 2.1.3.

Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  26  3. Inventory of standards  Overview  In late 2009, the European Commission issued Standardisation Mandate 46022 to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to update  the existing eSignature standardisation deliverables in view of establishing a fully rationalised framework, which  would solve the issues raised in actual use of eSignatures in the EU. These issues were about, notably, the mutual  recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, the multiplicity of standardization documents and the  lack of usage guidelines, the difficulty of access, the lack of business orientation, the numerous options and  latitude for divergent interpretations and different technical implementations.  Other standardisation bodies such as ISO, IETF, OASIS, UPU, ITU and national accreditation or supervisory bodies  are also defining “standards” or “local rules” that apply to Trust Services and Trust Service Provider.  The main objective of this section is to have an overview of involved parties and existing standards at the time of  writing. Annex A of this document provides a table of all identified standards.  ETSI/CEN framework for standardization of signatures  One of the first tasks in the context of Mandate 460 was to establish a rationalized framework for signature  standardization to overcome the reported issues within the context of the eSignature Directive, taking into  account possible revisions to this Directive. In August 2014, the European Commission published Regulation  910/2014/EU aiming to repeal that Directive as from 1/7/2016. That Regulation extends the scope of the Directive  with additional services for identification and authentication alongside an extended range of signature related  trust services and defines additional forms of qualified certificates.  A work programme has been established and will be maintained to address any elements identified as missing in  the framework for standardization of signatures. All documents of the framework intend to cover digital signatures  supported by PKI and public key certificates, and aim to meet the general requirements of the international  community to provide trust and confidence in electronic transactions, including, amongst other, applicable  requirements from the EU legislation. Digital signatures as data appended to, or being a cryptographic  transformation of a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and integrity of the data  unit and protect against forgery, can support, when appropriately supported themselves by relevant trust services,  implementation of electronic signatures and electronic seals as they are defined in the applicable European  legislation.  ETSI technical report TR 119 000 describes the general structure for ETSI/CEN digital signature standardization  outlining existing and potential standards for such signatures, hereafter referred to as the ETSI/CEN framework for  standardization of signatures. This framework identifies six areas of standardization with a list of existing and  potential future standards in each area:  1. Signature creation and validation: focusing on standards related to the creation and validation of digital  signatures, covering:  i) the policy and security requirements for signature creation applications and signature  validation applications;  ii) the expression of rules and procedures to be followed at creation, verification and for  preservation of digital signatures for long term;  22 http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  27  iii) signature format, packaging of signatures and signed documents; and  iv) protection profiles, according to Common Criteria for signature creation/verification  applications.  2. Signature creation and other related devices: focusing on standards related to secure signature creation  devices as defined in Directive 1999/93/EC, on signature creation devices used by trust service providers as  well as other types of devices supporting digital signatures and related services such as authentication.  3. Cryptographic suites: covering standardisation aspects related to the use of signature cryptographic  suites, i.e. the suite of digital signature related algorithms including key generation algorithms, signing  algorithms with parameters and padding method, verification algorithms, and hash functions.  4. Trust service providers supporting digital signatures and related services: covering TSPs issuing qualified  certificates, TSPs issuing public key certificates other than qualified certificates, including web server  certificates, time-stamping services providers, TSPs offering signature validation services, TSPs offering  remote signature creation services (also called signing servers).  5. Trust application service providers: covering trust service providers offering value added services applying  digital signatures and that relies on the generation/validation of electronic signatures in normal operation.  This includes namely registered mail and other e-delivery services, as well as data preservation (long term  archiving) services.  6. Trust service status (list) provider: covering standards related to the provision of trusted lists as defined  by CD 2009/767/EC as amended and by CD 2015/1505/EU.  Up to five types of documents may be associated with each area:   Guidance documents   Policy and Security Requirements   Technical Specifications   Conformance Assessment Guidance   Compliance and Interoperability Testing  The next subsections describe shortly these different areas and their constitutive documents. The descriptive text  regarding each listed document is minimised as an extended version can be found in TR 119 000. An overview of  the effective availability of the documents is also provided.  The total number of expected documents for the whole framework is 59 multipart documents and more than a  hundred (107) when counting each part separately. This also explains the need for guidance documents from  different sources of interest in eSignatures (business, security, etc.). The bulk of these are technical specification  documents. Thanks to ETSI Plug-Test programs, the “Compliance and Interoperability Testing” documents for  electronic signatures/seals are also available.  3.2.1 Introductory documents  An additional area (Area 0) is grouping TR 119 000, the document presenting the general structure of the  CEN/ETSI framework for standardization of signatures, as well as studies and other introductory deliverables  related to the structure of the framework.  This general purpose Area 0 includes the documents listed in Table 1 below. This table and the other tables listing  the existing document of the ETSI/CEN framework indicate the new numbering of each standard as it appears in  the framework, its title, the type of document, the number(s) of the document(s) it replaces, and the effective or  expected publication date (for information and subject to changes).  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  28  Table 1: Introductory documents of the framework for signature standardization (source ETSI TR 119 000)  No draft is available yet for TR 419 010 that aims to propose an extension of the signature standardisation  framework to cover electronic identification, electronic authentication and signatures. Its delivery has been  delayed in order to be aligned with Regulation 2014/910/EU and in particular with its secondary legislation on  electronic identification means, i.e. CID 2015/1502/EU23.  The special report SR 019 020 is planned for publication in November 2015. This document recommends:   The provision of specifications on the framework for standards (including potential architectures and  relevant scenarios) required for the creation of advanced AdES in distributed environments (e.g. via new  TS 119 152). This is expected to leverage on OASIS DSS and on MCOMM specifications.   The provision of specifications on the policy requirements for TSPs providing signature generation services  (e.g. via new EN 319 431). The operation of the TSP providing such signature generation services needs to  be trusted to ensure that the keys held on the server are not open to hostile attack. Support for split keys  (e.g. models in use in Poland) is for further study. This document will reference EN 319 401 for general  policy requirements on TSPs.   The provision of specifications to address protocol requirements for use of TSPs to support both local and  remote signing (e.g. via new EN 319 432). For local signing both ETSI M-COMM and OASIS DSS are  applicable. M-COMM already has a significant installed base and can take advantage of particular features  of mobile environment. OASIS DSS has the advantage of being generally applicable to both mobile and of  computing environments. For remote signing, OASIS DSS is directly applicable.   The provision of specifications on the policy requirements for TSPs providing signature validation services  (e.g. via new EN 319 441). The operation of the TSP providing such signature validation services needs to  be trusted to ensure that the service is not open to hostile attack. This document will reference EN 319  401 for general policy requirements on TSPs.   The provision of specifications (e.g. via new EN 319 442) to address protocol, formats and procedures  requirements for use of signature validation trust service (providers). OASIS DSS is directly applicable  although other services may be used to support signature validation (e.g. W3C XML Key Management  Specifications, DVCS protocols, SCVP protocols).  23 CIR (EU) 2015/1502 on setting out the minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance levels for  electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament  and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.

These documents aim to provide best practices in the usage of e-signatures within  the context of SMEs and consumers. They should answer questions in relation to the use and benefits (ROI) of  eSignatures to SMEs / consumers ecosystems. These guides are not meant to be as technically oriented as ETSI  documents.  TR 119 001 provides all definitions & abbreviations used in documents of the framework and serve as reference.  SR 019 050 provided a proposal for a rationalized framework of standards for electronic registered delivery  services, as defined by the eIDAS Regulation 20914/910/EU; the current structure of the framework documents  covering these services is the one published in TR 119 000 (see section 3.2.§ below).  3.2.2 Signature Creation and Validation  The standardisation documents for signature creation and validation are summarised in table 2 with further details  provided in TR 119 000.  With regards to the validation of digital signatures, it should be noted that procedures for signature validation  were previously specified in TS 102 853 - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Signature validation  procedures and policies updated in November 2014 to reflect corrections in processing identification of the  signer’s certificate in XAdES, CAdES and PAdES. EN 319 102 “Procedures for Signature Creation and Validation; Part  1: Signature validation procedures”, under EN approval, will further update TS 102 853, in particular to meet the  requirements of Regulation 2014/910/EU. It should be noted however that the standardisation work on  specifications for a signature validation report (EN 319 102 Part2) has been delayed to the next specialist task force  activities waiting for funding from the European Commission.  Significant efforts have been made to standardise requirements for signature creation and/or validation  applications. This encompasses specifications for policy and security requirements (TS 119 101), protection profiles  (EN 419 111 series) and relevant conformity assessment guidance (TS 119 103). This is believed to be an important  contribution to the enhancement of the quality and security of such applications. Appropriate coordination  between CEN and ETSI shall be required to properly finalise such efforts. TS 119 101 and TS 119 103 are not yet  published while all five parts of the Protection Profiles (PPs) for signature creation and verification application  (prCEN/EN 419 111) have been published as CEN enquiry status in 2013-03 hence in the context of Directive  1999/93/EC. These latter PPs may need to be updated for alignment with eIDAS Regulation, upcoming ETSI  documents (e.g. TS 119 101) and furthermore Part 2 and Part 4 still need to be evaluated and certified. Evaluation  and certification were delayed due to the need to find a new editor.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  30  Table 2: Standards for signature creation and validation (source ETSI TR 119 000)  Increased rationalisation and simplification with regards to the specifications of XAdES, CAdES and PAdES signature  formats have been implemented, further simplifying and promoting the baseline profiles as the primary  specifications while marginalising any additional optional extensions. The same improvements have been done for  associated signature containers (ASiC) specifications. All corresponding documents are under EN approval process  and are expected to be adopted and published early 2016. It is expected that these specifications could be  candidate for being referenced by implementing acts foreseen in Art.27.5 and Art 37.5 of the eIDAS Regulation,  when amending CID 2015/1506/EU.

The remote Plugtests™ interoperability  events aim to conduct conformance and interoperability testing on X/C/PAdES digital signatures and ASiC  containers and provide full test coverage of the specifications including testing signatures evolution, simulating  real life situations. The tests include creation, augmentation and verification of signature and are executed  according to current version and new draft of applicable standards. They are organised three or four times a year.  Outside these events, ETSI is also designing and developing a set of conformance testing tools. ETSI TS 119 1x4  documents aim to help implementers and accelerate the development of C/X/PAdES-ASiC signature creation and  validation applications by defining test suites complete sets of test assertions for testing technical conformance of  signatures against the relevant technical specifications. The test results can also be used in conformity assessment  for signature creation and validation applications (ETSI EN 319 103) with policies requiring conformity to specific  ETSI signature formats and procedures.  With regards to signature policies, published part 1 of TS 119 172 lays down the concepts and the specifications for  the table of contents of a human readable signature policy while parts 2 & 3 specifying the derived machine  processable formats (XML and ASN.1) have been postponed to a future phase of the standardisation work  programme. TS 119 172 Part 4 will be dedicated to specify a signature validation policy as aligned to Art.32 of  Regulation (EU) 910/2014, i.e. rules for validating digital signatures using EU MS trusted lists in order to indicate  whether they are advanced electronic signatures/seals, advanced electronic signatures/seals supported by a  qualified certificate or qualified electronic signature/seal in accordance with the applicable EU legislation.  3.2.3 Signature creation and other related devices  The standardisation documents for signature creation and other related devices are summarised in table 3 with  further details available in TR 119 000.

This part provides a tutorial and \"how-to\" use guide for the following parts of the  standard.   Part 2 (Basic services for electronic signatures) specifies mandatory mechanisms for smart cards  and other secure elements to be used as secure signature creation devices covering among other  signature creation, user verification, device authentication, and establishment of a secure channel.  The specified mechanisms are suitable for other purposes like services in the context of IAS. The  group is currently working on the integration of eSeal. It is not clear what are the constraints  regarding seal versus signature (where depending on the environment, a device authentication  and a secure channel must be established).   Part 3 (Device authentication) specifies device authentication to be used for SSCDs in various  contexts and includes device authentication protocols, data structures, CV-certificates and key  management. The device authentication protocols shall apply to sole-control signature as  mandated by Directive 1999/93/EC and as mandated by Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.   Part 4 (Privacy) specifies access to e-services with privacy-oriented protocols. The group is working  on the integration of eIDAS token specification.   Part 5 (Additional services in the context of electronic services) contains Identification,  Authentication and Digital Signature (IAS) services in addition to the SSCD mechanisms already  described in Part 1 to enable interoperability and usage for IAS services on a national or European  level. It also specifies additional mechanisms like key decipherment, Client/Server authentication  and identity management.  3.2.4 Cryptographic suites  The standardisation documents for cryptographic suites are summarised in table 4 with further details in TR 119  000.  Table 4: Standards for cryptographic suites (source TR 119 000)  An updated version of TS 102 176-1 (known as the “Algo paper”) has been published as TS 119 312 v1.1.1 in  November 2014.  ETSI TR 119 300 and ETSI TS 119 312 are providing guidance on selection of cryptographic suites with particular  emphasis on security. ETSI TS 119 312 identifies a range of different cryptographic suites that can be used  corresponding to the appropriate level of security, which meets the security needs identified during the system  design; there is no normative requirement on selection among the alternatives but for all alternatives, normative  requirements apply to ensure security and interoperability. It is based on various security recommendations given  Cryptographic suites Replaces Expected publication  Sub-areas  Guidance  TR 1 19 3 0 0 Business guidance on cryptographic suites (new) published  Technical Specifications  TS 1 19 3 1 2 Cryptographic suites TS 102 176-1 published  Testing Conformance  & Interoperability  - - - - - no requirement identified  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  35  by other standardization bodies, national security agencies (including but not limited to France24 and Germany25)  and supervisory authorities of the Member States. ETSI 119 300 explains the concept of security parameters that  helps to choose a proper cryptographic suite for digital signature creation. It also gives an overview how to analyse  the business needs on the use of standards for cryptographic suites (in particular for digital signature creation  algorithms) and how to select a system that satisfies these needs.  3.2.5 TSPs supporting digital signatures and related services  The standardisation documents for TSP supporting digital signatures and related services are summarised in table  5 with further details provided in TR 119 000.

Besides the business driven guidance document (TR 119 400), the document entry points for each of the above  types of trust service and trust service provider are respectively:  1. EN 319 411 document, respectively Part 1 for general requirements for TSPs issuing certificates  and Part 2 for requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates;  2. EN 319 421 for the issuance of time-stamps,  3. EN 319 431 for the provisioning of signature generation services, and  4. EN 319 441 for the provisioning of signature validation services.  These documents are highlighted in dark pink in Figure 3 below, together with their interrelations with the other  relevant documents of the standardisation area, i.e. indicating which document they require or conditionally  require.  Figure 3: Overview the Area 4 documents and their interrelations  It should be noted that production of the documents directly related to the provisioning of signature generation  and validation services have been postponed for future standardisation work and they will likely not be available,  at least under the form of a European standard (EN) by 1/07/2016.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  37  3.2.6 Trust application service providers  The documents for trust application service providers are summarised in table 6 with further details provided in TR  119 000.  Table 6: Standards for trust application service providers  On the subject of trust application service providers (TASP) area, there are no well-established documents besides  the existing TS 102 573 (“Policy requirements for trust service providers signing and/or storing data objects”) and  the multipart TS 102 640 series (“Registered Electronic Mail (REM)”).  In September 2015, work has been started to address trust service consisting in preservation of (qualified)  electronic signatures under the form of a study undertaken to evaluate the needs and scope for such  standardisation work. The standardisation work on electronic registered delivery services will leverage on the  existing multipart TS 102 640 series addressing standardisation of registered electronic mail (REM) and align these  specifications to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic registered delivery services.  Effective production of such REM specifications and more general specifications addressing all other types of  electronic registered delivery services has not been planned yet and is likely not to finalised in 2016.

Table 7: Standards for trust service status lists providers  The current technical specifications of the EU Member State national trusted lists are defined by CD 2009/767/EC  as amended and currently rely on ETSI TS 119 612 v1.1.1.  The technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 are laid down in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 (OJ L 235,  9.9.2015, p26-36). CID 2015/1505/EU relies on TS 119 612 v2.1.1 for establishing such specifications.  Work on testing conformance and interoperability of trusted lists is expected to be part of standardisation work  programme.  Other standards  The present section identifies standards and publicly available specifications coming from other sources than the  CEN/ETSI while addressing the same topics and matters applicable to trust services and trust service providers.  These additional sources include other standardisation bodies such as ISO, IETF, ITU, NIST, OASIS, UPU and national  accreditation or supervisory bodies.  From all identified documents listed in Annex A, each of the next sub-sections will present these additional  standards and publicly available specifications that have been retained as relevant with regards to the addressed  topic. Relevance is discussed against the main objective of identifying standards as potential candidates for being  referenced by eIDAS Regulation, against the existing ETSI/CEN standards being also candidates. Categories of  interesting standards have been added for their connection with trust services and trust service providers even  when not addressed directly by the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. cryptographic suites, formats of the document or data  that may be required to be signed or sealed).  3.3.1 Cryptographic suites  Standards and publicly available specifications related to cryptographic suites can be split into two main  categories: the specifications defining specific cryptographic algorithms and their parameters on the one side, and  on the other side guidance oriented documents on how to select and implement in practice these algorithms and  parameters in a specific context for a specific purpose. These latter guidance can either be defined at a national  Trust  service status lists providers Replaces Expected publication  Sub-areas  Guidance  TR 1 19 6 0 0 Business guidance for trust service status lists providers new published  Policy & Security Requirements  TS 1 19 6 1 1 Policy & security requirements for trusted lists providers Undefined  Technical Specifications  TS 1 19 6 1 2 Trusted lists TS 102 231 published  Conformity Assessment  - - - - - no requirement identified for such a document - relying on TS 119 403 / EN 319 403  Testing Conformance & Interoperability  TS 1 19 6 1 4 Testing conformance & interoperability of trusted lists:  - Part 1: Test suites for testing interoperability of XML representation of trusted lists.  - Part 2: Specifications for testing conformance of XML representation of trusted lists  (new) Undefined  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  39  level (e.g. BSI in Germany, ANSSI in France, IEEE, NIST or NSA in the US), in a specific domain of application (e.g.  biopharma industry, banking industry) or at a more general level (e.g. European standardisation organisation,  regional or continental organisation).  Relevant alternatives identified in Annex A are mostly related to the US NIST documents defining and providing  guidance on the use of cryptographic suites.  As cryptographic suites and their proper use is a key building blocks for all trust services, it is of utmost importance  that appropriate guidance on selection of cryptographic suites that would be applicable for implementation of  trust services and in particular qualified trust services under the eIDAS Regulation will be maintained over time to  ensure effective and appropriate security of these services.  Different countries set the minimum requirements on the cryptographic suites they recommend to be used. Some  examples of what countries like Japan and the U.S. are recommending.  CRYPTREC is the Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees set up by the Japanese Government to  evaluate and recommend cryptographic techniques for government and industrial use and the NSA Suite B  Cryptography is a set of cryptographic algorithms promulgated by the National Security Agency as part of its  Cryptographic Modernization Program  Some of the recommended standards are:   NIST series 800 on computer security such as  o NIST SP 800- 38, 56, 67, 133, etc.  o NIST FIPS series such as 140, 180, 197 and 198ISO/IEC 9798RFC 5759, Suite B Certificate and  Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile   RFCs:  o RFC 6239, Suite B Cryptographic Suites for Secure Shell (SSH)  o RFC 6379, Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec  o RFC 6460, Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)   IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standardization and the P1363 project is for  public-key cryptography). They´ve developed some standards such as:  o 1363-- IEEE Standard Specifications for Public-Key Cryptography. 2000.  As an example, the key length is an important security parameter. There´re recommendations and mathematical  formulas to approximate the minimum key size requirement for security. Bluekrypt26 compares the different  approaches and techniques and select the appropriate key length for the desired level of protection.  A list of these documents can be found in annex A.  3.3.2 Due diligence – risk analysis – information security management  The increasing corporate governance requirements have caused companies to examine and ensure that controls  are in place and operating effectively. Organizations are increasingly competing in the global marketplace, which is  governed by multiple laws and supported by various best practices and standards (i.e, ITIL, ISO 27000 family,  COSO, COBIT).  26 Bluekrypt (www.keylength.com)  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5759 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6239 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6379 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6460  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  40  Determination of which standards meet the organization´s needs must be driven by the security policies agreed  upon by management. The standards provide the specification of the technology to effectively enable the  organization to become successful in meeting the requirements of the policy.  Standards may also refer to guidelines established by standards organizations and accepted by management,  including organizations such as NIST, ISO, IEEE, ANSI, NSA and others.  A list of these documents can be found in annex A.  3.3.3 Security breach notification  It is crucial to improve the trustworthiness of this ecosystem to provide information to other interested parties on  security breaches to avoid or with the goal to learn from incidents and propose alternatives or fixes. This  information sharing among interested parties relating to possible enhanced risk from identified individuals,  entities, identities, locations, domains, IP addresses, and other data to be determined in order to allow or to  determine, whether to undertake additional steps to mitigate or solve.  This notification will consider issues such as legal limitations, privacy concerns, methods for updating or correcting  information, and other factors that may arise from such notification of a security breach.  ENISA has developed multiple recommendations in the area of breach notifications (for notifications under  Framework Directive Art. 13a, ePrivacy Directive Art.4, eIDAS Art.19).  In areas like cybersecurity, different non-EU governments like the U.S. publish acts on “antitrust policy on sharing  cybersecurity information”, which are U.S. related executive orders27.  27 Such us https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/12/fact-sheet-executive-order-promoting-private- sector-cybersecurity-inform , http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/executive-order-promoting- private-sector-cybersecurity-information-shari  https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/04/ftc-doj-issue-antitrust-policy-statement-sharing-cybersecurity https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/04/ftc-doj-issue-antitrust-policy-statement-sharing-cybersecurity https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/12/fact-sheet-executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-inform https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/12/fact-sheet-executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-inform http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-information-shari http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-information-shari  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  41  The MITRE Corporation has released the TAXII project. TAXII is not an information sharing initiative or application  and does not attempt to define trust agreements, governance, or non-technical aspects of cyber threat  information sharing. Instead, TAXII empowers organizations to achieve improved situational awareness about  emerging threats, and enables organizations to easily share the information they choose with the partners they  choose. Additionally, the MITRE Corporation has also developed an XML schema called STIX.  There´s also, related to cyber threats, an alliance called the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA),  http://cyberthreatalliance.org/ which was founded in 2014, together with Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and  McAfee and a group of cybersecurity providers, to share threat information to improve defenses against advanced  cyber adversaries. The CTA adheres to strict guidelines that protect privacy and anonymize data, while at the same  time pooling a broad array of resources to fight cybercriminals.  Also, private companies are working on this notification and have developed some documents, for example,  Microsoft, which has announced its strategy publicly282930.  Some of these initiatives have been adopted by OASIS creating a technical committee on Cyber Threat Intelligence  (CTI) taking into account the STIX, TAXII, and CybOX cyber security specifications and will be advanced as  international standards by members of the OASIS consortium in a transition headed by the US Department of  Homeland Security  3.3.4 Issuing digital certificates  In cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic  document used to prove ownership of a public key. The certificate includes information about the key, information  about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are  correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they  can use that key to communicate with its owner.  Standards like IETF RFC 5280 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List  (CRL) Profile and ITU-t X.509 define a digital certificate  Another approach is the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 WG4 initiative on TSP practices and its positioning against CEN/ETSI  framework documents:   14516-1, Guidelines for the use and management of Trust Service Providers – Part 1: Overview and  concepts;   14516-2, Guidelines for the use and management of Trust Service Providers – Part 2: Guidelines on  information security of PKI Trust Service Providers;   14516-3, Guidelines for the use and management of Trust Service Providers – Part 3: Guidelines on  provision of services by PKI Trust Service Providers  The expected goal of the work made at ISO/SC27is to identify key TSP component services that can be operated by  independent service providers for a TSP such as PKI service provider, dissemination service provider, registration  service provider, etc.  28 https://threatpost.com/microsoft-to-preview-interflow-information-sharing-platform/106798  29 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn750892.aspx  30 http://blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2014/06/23/microsoft-interflow-a-security-and-threat-information-exchange- platform-announced/  http://cyberthreatalliance.org/ https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  42  Best efforts will be made by editors of these documents to make these standards compatible with the ones from  ETSI (for instance including parts equivalent to EN 319 403 using ISO 17065 as the accreditation standard).  The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an  X.509 digital certificate. Initially it was defined in RFC 2560, X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure Online  Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP31  but has been updated to RFC 6960, X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure  Online Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP32. It was created as an alternative to certificate revocation lists (CRL),  specifically addressing certain problems associated with using CRLs in a public key infrastructure (PKI). Current  OCSP/CRL specifications are not sufficient and must be profiled to cover requirements from Art.24.3 and Art.24.4  of eIDAS Regulation.  Another specification of interest in this area is RFC 4806, Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Extensions to  IKEv233  3.3.5 Formats of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  The following ISO standard aims at helping business and governments to guarantee the long-term authenticity of  electronic signatures, increasingly used in e-commerce and e-government. It will also ensure the interoperability of  electronic signatures when the documents they authenticate are transferred and processed through different  information technology systems. The ISO standard is in two parts:   ISO 14533-1:2012, Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and  dministration – Long term signature profiles – Part 1: Long term signature profiles for CMS  Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)   ISO 14533-2:2012, Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and  administration – Long term signature profiles – Part 2: Long term signature profiles for XML  Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)  Klaus-Dieter Naujok, Chair of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 154 who developed the standard, commented: \"ISO  14533-1:2012 and ISO 14533-2:2012 provide a framework complying with the European Commission Mandate  M/460, as well as helping the work by UN/CEFACT on its current revision on Recommendation 14 (Authentication  of Trade Documents by Means Other than Signature), for guaranteeing interoperability and consumption of  messages regardless of the target platform. The new standards provide for long term protection of these  document formats that is not currently available.\"  ISO 14533-1:2012 and ISO 14533-2:2012 were developed by ISO/TC 154, Processes, data elements and documents  in commerce, industry and administration.  3.3.6 Generation of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  The OASIS Digital Signature Services (DSS) develops techniques to support the processing of digital signatures, such  as an interface for requesting that a web service produce and/or verify a digital signature.  The Digital Signature Services (DSS) specifications describe two XML-based request/response protocols: a signing  protocol and a verifying protocol. The DSS Core specifications provide the basic protocols and elements, upon  which other services can be built. For instance, the DSS-X Technical Committee has specified several profiles for  specific usages.  31 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560  32 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960  33 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4806  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4806 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4806  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  43  The OASIS committee on extended services for digital signatures (DSS-X34) develops new profiles for digital  signature services  3.3.7 Validation of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  The IETF defines other options for a validation services, called Data Validation and Certification Server (DVCS)  which is a public key infrastructure or PKI service providing data validation services, asserting correctness of  digitally signed documents, validity of public key certificates and possession or existence of data.  A Data Validation and Certification Server (DVCS) is a Trusted Third Party (TTP)35 providing data validation services,  asserting correctness of digitally signed documents, validity of public key certificates, and possession or existence  of data.  Services provided by a DVCS do not replace the usage of CRLs and OCSP36, as mentioned in clause 3.3.4, for public  key certificate revocation checking in large open environments, due to concerns about the scalability of the  protocol.  RFC 3029 \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Data Validation and Certification Server Protocols37  3.3.8 Preservation of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  In library and archival science, digital preservation is a formal endeavor to ensure that digital information of  continuing value remains accessible and usable. The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of  authenticated content over time  To standardize digital preservation practice and provide a set of recommendations for preservation program  implementation, the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) was developed. OAIS is  concerned with all technical aspects of a digital object’s life cycle: ingest, archival storage, data management,  administration, access and preservation planning   Not only OASIS is developing standards on how to preserve this digital information, there are also  other entities promoting other documents such as   Design Criteria Standard For Electronic Records Management Software Applications   Electronic archiving - Part 1: Specifications concerning the design and the operation of an  information system for electronic information preservation   Space data and information transfer systems - Open archival information system (OAIS) - Reference  model   Information and documentation – Records management   PDF/A Specification   Data Preservation Systems Security; Part 1: Requirements for Implementation and Management   Policy requirements for trust service providers signing and/or storing data objects   Spécifications fonctionnelles d'un composant Coffre-Fort Numérique destiné à la conservation  d'informations numériques dans des conditions de nature à en garantir leur intégrité dans le temps   Evidence Record Syntax  34 https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dss-x  35 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_third_party  36 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol  37 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3029  https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dss-x https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAIS  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  44  It´s also necessary to assess these services, for what ISO defined an standard on audit and Certification of  Trustworthy Digital Repositories (ISO 16363:2012), developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data  Systems (CCSDS), which was approved as a full international standard in March 2012  3.3.9 Time stamps and their issuance  A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many  cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered  into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.  This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and  tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual  data is called timestamping. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping  ISO 8601 standardizes the representation of dates and times. These standard representations are often used to  construct timestamp values.  There are many timestamping schemes with different security goals:   PKI-based – timestamp token is protected using PKI digital signature.   Linking-based schemes – timestamp is generated such a way that it is related to other timestamps.   Distributed schemes – timestamp is generated in cooperation of multiple parties.   Transient key scheme – variant of PKI with short-living signing keys.   MAC – simple secret key based scheme, found in ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard.   Database – document hashes are stored in trusted archive; there is online lookup service for  verification.   Hybrid schemes – the linked and signed method is prevailing, see X9.95  Only the PKI covers the 3 of them, the RFC 3161, X9.95 and ISO/IEC 18014  According to the RFC 316138 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP), a trusted  timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a Time Stamping Authority (TSA). It is used  to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records, …)  without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. Multiple TSAs can be used to increase  reliability and reduce vulnerability.  The newer ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard39 for Trusted Time Stamps augments the RFC 3161 standard with data-level  security requirements to ensure data integrity against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party.  This standard has been applied to authenticating digitally signed data for regulatory compliance, financial  transactions, and legal evidence.  RFC 362840 Policy Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities (TSAs)  3.3.10 Electronic delivery services  The delivery of services, whether electronic or not, is one of the key goals of the UPU, the Universal Postal Union  (UPU), which is the second oldest international organization worldwide.  38 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3161  39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_ASC_X9.95_Standard  40 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3628  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  45  The UPU has developed some standards regarding interoperability aspects, the registered electronic mail, in  collaboration with CEN, etc.  S33 Interoperability framework for postal public key infrastructures:  The objective of this standard is to create a common Postal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to provide global  certification and security services aimed at globally binding the identity of individuals and organisations with their  public key. The framework itself and its first four elements (PKI structure, cryptographic algorithms, data formats  and data dissemination protocols) are included.  S52 Functional specification for postal registered electronic mail:  This standard defines the functional specification of a secure electronic postal service, referred to as the postal  registered electronic mail or PReM service. PReM provides a trusted and certified electronic mail exchange  between mailer, designated operators and addressee/mailee. In addition, evidence of corresponding events and  operations within the scope of PReM will be generated and archived for future attestation.  3.3.11 Supervision of services and certification of products  Supervision of services:  Considering the work done by the European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), there is a need to adopt the  implementing acts Art.20.4 to support the EA proposed model for CAB accreditation and QTSs/QTSPs evaluation of  conformity as well as to cover the missing part to that model i.e. the applicable “QTS/QTSP audit criteria” as  discussed in section 2.2.  Certification of products:  Security assessment of an IT product is done through the security evaluation of the product. That evaluation  should be made by a certification body, itself accredited by some authority. The Common Criteria evaluation  scheme (http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/), for instance, is organized in this way.  ISO 15408 defines a framework for the IT evaluation of IT security products.  Besides the Common Criteria evaluation model, the use of Regulation 765/2008 model should be assessed as well.  It is also applicable to the certification of products and a comparable model to the one developed to accredit CABs  to certify and confirm compliance of QTS/QTSPs to the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation could be  developed similarly for certification of products against appropriate criteria (be it evaluated and certified PPs).  Criteria for products – Protection profiles:  TSP and end-users will rely on IT products, either software or hardware (cryptographic modules, USB tokens…) to  store, create, validate or preserve (signed or sealed) data. Directive 1999/93/EC mentioned such requirement for  “secure signature creation devices”, but the eIDAS Regulation has broadened the concept “qualified signature/seal  creation devices”. The eIDAS Regulation allows server (remote) qualified signature, that is in fact a kind of  electronic service on-line requiring authentication (use of electronic mean of authentication), as well as remote  identity verification using an eID (art. 24.1.(b)). Therefore security assessment of such elements may fall in the  scope of interest of QTSP.  It is believed (expected) that CEN PPs developed under the CEN/ETSI framework for standardization of signatures  will be natural candidates as criteria for being referenced as criteria against which “qualified signature/seal  creation devices” must be certified as compliant with the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  46  3.3.12 Formats of documents for which a digital/electronic signature or seal may be required  Protocols and format commonly used for documents include the following:   S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)   XML (Extensible Markup Language), and its variant that include:  o ebXML (electronic business XML)  o “AS4 Profile of ebMS 3.0\" from OASIS submitted to ISO  o ISO 20022: standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions (i.e. electronic  funds transfers). It describes a metadata repository containing descriptions of messages and  business processes, and a maintenance process for the repository content. The repository contains  a huge amount of financial services metadata that has been shared and standardized across the  industry. The metadata is stored in UML models with a special ISO 20022 UML Profile. Underlying  all of this is the ISO 20022 metamodel - a model of the models. The UML (Unified Modeling  Language) profile is the metamodel transformed into UML. The metadata is transformed into the  syntax of messages used in financial networks. The first syntax supported for messages was XML  Schema. ISO 20022 is widely used in financial services and adopted as SEPA format for storing &  processing transactions.   PDF  o ISO 32000 – Document management – Portable document format  o SR 003 032 on the Printable Representations of Electronic Signatures  3.3.13 Other initiatives  Beyond international standardization committees, there are numerous attempts to implement technical or  organisational answers to the need for trust services such as digital identity, signature or transactions. Where no  binding legal framework exists, particular requirements and specifications are usually issued by an authoritative  body (professional order/association, steering committee, workgroups, etc.) to ensure interoperability of solutions  and responsibilities of involved actors.  However, such ad hoc solutions tend to be limited to a specific domain and their reusability outside it can be  difficult, if not impossible, to assess. The following initiatives were thus selected as they address a sufficiently large  scope.  3.3.13.1 xDTM & SafeBiopharma (U.S.)  In the U.S., the xDTM Standard Association41 (an independent non-profit organization) is on its way to define and  advance requirements (the xDTM Standard), and create the framework for an associated certification program to  ensure open, secure digital transactions. In the same spirit as the e-IDAS Regulation, the xDTM self-defined  objective is to define an interoperable and widely accepted standard. The term Digital Transaction Management  (DTM) denotes a category of cloud services that would enable companies to manage their document-based  transactions digitally with the same legal value and acknowledgement as they have with paper-based transactions.  First experiments with digital signatures in the U.S. originated in the pharmaceutical industry (http://www.safe- biopharma.org/overview.htm) and has achieved some success in that domain. The xDTM initiative seems to  broaden the scope of the project in the same way that the e-IDAS Regulation expanded the 1999/93/EC Directive:  digital signatures and identities become means to new digital services (digital transactions).  41 www.xdtm.org  http://www.safe-biopharma.org/overview.htm http://www.safe-biopharma.org/overview.htm http://www.xdtm.org/  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  47  The xDTM Association has not yet released any standard.  3.3.13.2 e-SENS (Electronic Simple European Networked Services)  e-SENS is a large-scale project to provide an easy access to public European administration and services online, and  ensure interoperability across different national systems. Several European projects are part of this initiative:   SPOCS (Simple Procedures Online for Cross-Border Services, http://www.eu-spocs.eu) uses the solution for the  cross border use of natural persons eID developed by STORK. Furthermore it also builds on document  transport concepts developed by STORK. It has used the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) concept of PEPPOL for  document containers and has generalized it into a container format for eDocuments (OCD) to package  company information for transmission to Points of Single Contact in other countries.   e-CODEX (e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange, http://www.e-codex.eu) will build on and make  necessary changes to deliverables from SPOCS and the other pilots in order to meet its objectives of improving  the cross-border access of citizens and businesses to legal means in Europe as well as to improve the  interoperability between legal authorities within the EU.   PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online, http://www.peppol.eu) has developed and implemented  technology standards for European governmental public electronic procurement.   STORK (Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed, http://www.eid-stork.eu) aims at establishing a European eID  Interoperability Platform that will allow citizens to establish new e-relations across borders, just by presenting  their national eID. This platform allows European citizens to log in to public services of other Member States  using the eID technology of their home country.  Currently, STORK 2.0 extends its scope to mandates and representation (e.g. of legal entities) and advances from  eGovernment to private sector applications (http://www.eid-stork2.eu).  http://www.eu-spocs.eu/ http://www.e-codex.eu/ http://www.peppol.eu/ http://www.eid-stork.eu/ http://www.eid-stork2.eu/  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  48  4. Mapping and analysis  Description of methodology  The following section contain mappings between the eIDAS requirements as identified in chapter 2 and the  currently available standards as listed in the inventory in chapter 3 of this document.  The mapping is oriented at  the requirements specified in the different eIDAS articles.  In order to understand the meaning of the mapping and in order to apply the mapped standards in a proper way,  the following should to be considered:   The mapping indicates which standard  allows to meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The  mentioned standards usually only cover a part of the eIDAS requirements (the explanation will be  given further in the text).   In some cases the eIDAS Regulation articles laying down requirements for TSPs, TS’s, QTSP’s or QTS’s  allows for referencing standards (among other documents), either through direct reference or  potentially via specifications established  by the European legislator. Compliance with these  referenced standards will provide a legal presumption of compliance with the associated legal  provisions.   It should be noted that this legal presumption compliance referencing mechanism is not complete in  the Regulation in the sense that it does not cover all the provisions applicable to TSP/TS or QTSP/QTS  but to a part of them.   Furthermore, in practice, it might be rather unlikely at this moment in time, that a standard or a set of  standards are available which have been developed especially in order to serve all the different eIDAS  articles requirements applicable to all types of TSP/TS or QTSP/QTS. Again, the adequacy of the  standards to the articles' requirements can at best be partial.   Some of the standards content was compiled before the eIDAS Regulation had been released. The  content therefore could not cover all of its requirements. In such case, the adequacy of the standards  to the articles' requirements can at best be partial.   In any case, the eIDAS Regulation \"should be technology-neutral\" (recital 27). Thus, even if the  hereafter identified standards were to be mentioned in future delegated/implementing acts,  compliance with the Regulation could alternatively also be achieved through other implementations,  based upon other standards or based upon best practices. In case of a Qualified Service according to  the eIDAS requirements, the suitability and coverage of such an alternative solution to meetl the eIDAS  requirements will have to be judged by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) issuing a corresponding  Conformity Assessment Report (CAR).  The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference number of standards (Art.20.4 (a))  for  the accreditation of the conformity assessment bodies and for the conformity assessment report referred to in  Art.20.1 and for (Art.20.4.(b)) for auditing rules under which conformity assessment bodies will carry out their  conformity assessment of the qualified trust service providers as referred to in Art.20.1. The standards based  accreditation system the European cooperation for accreditation (EA) is currently establishing is however not  addressing the standardization of the “QTSP/QTS audit criteria” against which the QTSP/QTS compliance with all  the applicable provisions of the eIDAS Regulation will be assessed is missing. This is specifically addressed in  section 4.3.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  49  ETSI/CEN Framework - Trust service related standards mapping and analysis  4.2.1 Standards covering general TSP operations related requirements  4.2.1.1 Requirements common to all TSPs  Implementing acts foreseen in Art.19(4) do not limit the legislative power of the European Commission to simply  refer to standards that would have been assessed as allowing compliant implementations to meet the specific  covered requirements and hence granting such compliant implementations a legal presumption of compliance  with these requirements.  The Commission may through such acts:   (Art.19(4)a) specify the due diligence technical and organisational measures TSPs must implement to  manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide (Art.19(1)).   (Art.19(4)b) define the formats and procedures, including deadlines, applicable for the purpose of security  and personal data breach notifications by TSPs and QTSPs (Art.19(2)).  As already stated in section 2.3.1, the initiative of ENISA on security breach notifications (SBN) may make the  adoption of the related implementing act under art.19.4 of eIDAS Regulation unnecessary. ENISA is currently  developing technical guidelines to facilitate the implementation of article 19 of eIDAS Regulation. Once completed,  these guidelines would be available to stakeholders for voluntary adoption, and be subject to regular revision (as it  has been the case of these related to article 13a of the e-communication Framework Directive).  The following table however is analysing the relevance of the ETSI EN 319 4x1 standard in addressing the  requirements common to all TSPs as these requirements are identified through the reference to the corresponding  article of the eIDAS Regulation (first column). The second column provides, when applicable, a reference to  foreseen implementing acts. The third column identifies the standard(s) being candidate for allowing implementer  meeting the requirements (or standards referenced by primarily considered standard) for which the publication  status is given in the fourth column. The last column provides the results of the assessment/analysis on whether  the identified standard actually correctly address the requirement identified in the first column. The content of this  last column can be limited to the identification of the standard clause addressing the requirement; when no  addition comment is made it is assessed to allow addressing correctly the requirement.

There is no specific ETSI standard dedicated to address requirements on due diligence technical and organisational  measures that TSPs must implement to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide or  requirements on the formats and procedures, including deadlines, applicable for the purpose of security and  personal data breach notifications by TSPs.  Both these types of requirements are however addressed in documents addressing specific types of trust service  provider and trust services, requiring any potential referencing process to point to a long list of specific clauses  from a combination of specific documents. Furthermore only TSP issuing (qualified) certificates and TSP issuing  (qualified) time-stamps related standards are currently available.  4.2.1.2 Requirements common to all QTSPs  Requirements common to all QTSPs are these requirements applicable to all TSPs (see table in section 4.2.1.1)  together with the requirements listed in the following table.

The ETSI/CEN TS 102 023 standard, which is currently used for the certification of  timestamping authorities, was updated under the M460 mandate, and split in two standards.   ETSI EN 319 421 is a natural candidate for enforcing good security practices and correct time-management  of a timestamping authority ; ANSSI RGS A5 strengthens it but contains some French-specific requirements  that may not be compatible with the actual practices in other countries.   Conforming to the ETSI EN 319 422 ensures the binding of the date and time to data in the produced  timestamps.  ANSSI DCSSI-PP 2008/07 is currently the only evaluated Common Criteria protection profile for a timestamping  system. The prCEN/TS 419231 protection profile is currently under evaluation.

Moreover, REM systems may forward messages to  \"regular e-mail\" services, hence \"unqualified\" services providers.  UPU : That point is not addressed in the standards. In particular, issues regarding \"cross-border scenarios\" are  explicitely not covered.  (b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : In the standards, \"choice of the authentication mechanism is left to the [trust service  provider]\". Specific requirements must hence be added to correctly reflect these of the eIDAS Regulation.  UPU : Same situation (\"The act of physically authenticating individual calls to a SePS is outside the scope of this  specification\").  (c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : That point is covered in the functional working of the protocol.  UPU : idem.  (d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic signature or an advanced electronic seal  of a qualified trust service provider in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the data being changed  undetectably;  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  60  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : the standards only \"assume the usage of at least an Advanced Electronic Signature […]  issued with a Secure Signature Creation Device\", in the sense of the EU Directive 1999/93/EC. Hence, this standard  does not require such a signature, strictly speaking.  UPU : The standards contain no requirement on the level of the signatures.  (e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data is clearly indicated to the sender  and addressee of the data;  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : That point is not addressed in the standards.  UPU : idem.  However, that point could be deemed unapplicable to these standards, which do not consider that one could alter  the sent data in any way.  (f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by a qualified electronic time  stamp.  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : That point is not addressed in the standards.  UPU : The electronic PostMark is a \"superset of a standard timestamp\", and several European post services are  already providing ETSI 102 023-certified services.  Overall, the existing standards are technical and were written before any existing regulation. It is not surprising,  then, that they do not try to strongly enforce specific properties. In particular, they contain very few strict  requirements on the services.  Future ETSI standardisation work on electronic registered delivery services will leverage on the existing multipart  TS 102 640 series addressing standardisation of registered electronic mail (REM) and align these specifications to  the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic registered delivery services. Effective production  of such REM specifications and more general specifications addressing all other types of electronic registered  delivery services has not been planned yet and is likely not to finalised in 2016.  The standards could be used as a basis for a technical definition of the qualified electronic registered delivery  services, under additional requirements (service profiles) covering the above elements. For instance, the  requirement that sent data must be signed/sealed according to (d).  4.2.1.8 Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified certificates for website authentication  Article Standard Status Comment  45(2) Baseline requirements for the issuance and  management of publicly-trusted certificates (CAB  Forum CAB BR)  Published Partial (see below)  45(2) EV SSL certificate guidelines (CAB Forum CAB EVSSL) Published Partial (see below)  45(2) Guidance for Auditors and CSPs on ETSI TS 102 042  for Issuing Publicly-Trusted TLS/SSL Certificates (ETSI  TR 103 123)  Published Guidance document for  auditors (but much lower  Assurance scope than  expected in eIDAS  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  61  Article Standard Status Comment  45(2) Technical report TR 101 564 on guidance on ETSI TS  102 042 for issuing EV certificates for auditors and  CSPs  Published Intended to be used by  auditors as a guidance to  assess the compliance of a  CA according to TS 102 042  and for the CA to clarify  the requirements  Partial coverage: The CAB Forum documents are an industrial standard on the Internet, used by all the mainstream  web browsers, but their requirements, which aim at strongly ensuring a site’s identity and that of its owner, do not  fully match these of a « qualified certificate for website authentication », as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.

Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  63  The main issue with (a) is that \"trustworthiness\" is an abstract notion, which corresponds, in practice, to different  properties for different trust services. There are thus two possible solutions that are not necessarily exclusive.  First, implementing acts could refer to generic security practices, applicable to all TSPs, such as ETSI EN 319 401 or  ISO/IEC 27001:2013. Second, implementing acts could refer to specific standards, depending on each trust service,  such as protection profiles for signature services.  Candidate standards for referencing by Art.24(a) are:  - prCEN/EN 419 221 - PP for TSP cryptographic modules, in particular its Part 5 PP for cryptographic modules  for TSPs, aimed at being aligned with eIDAS Regulation.  - prCEN/EN 419 231 PP for trustworthy systems supporting time stamping.  - prCEN/EN 419 241 security requirements and PP’s for trustworthy systems supporting server signing.  - prCEN/TS 419 261 (was prTS 419 221-1, was prTS 14167-1) - Security requirements for Trustworthy  Systems (incl. Managing Certificates for Electronic Signatures).  While no standard has been identified as candidate for being referenced under Art.24(b), it could be expected that  prCEN/TS 419 261 could include provisions for trustworthy systems to meet Art.24(2)f requirements.  4.2.2.2 QSCD  Article Standard Status Comment  29(2)  39(2)  Application interfaces for secure signature creation  devices - Parts 1-5 (CEN EN 419 212)  Published Partial (see below)  29(2)  39(2)  Protection profiles for secure signature creation  devices – Parts 1-6 (CEN EN 419 211)  Published Partial (see below)  29(2)  39(2)  Protection profiles for TSP Cryptographic modules –  Part 1-5 (CEN EN 419 221)  Draft  (part 5 is a CEN  prEN 419 221-5)  Partial (see below)  29(2)  39(2)  Trustworthy systems supporting server signing  (signature generation services) - Parts 1-3 (CEN EN  419 241)  Draft  (TS 419241 is  published)  Partial (see below)  Annex II on qualified electronic signature/seal creation device require \"by appropriate technical and procedural  means\", that:  1.[…] such device ensures:  (a) the confidentiality of the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation is reasonably  assured;  (b) the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation can practically occur only once;  (c) the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation cannot, with reasonable assurance,  be derived and the electronic signature is reliably protected against forgery using currently available technology;  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  64  These properties are fully addressed in the protection profiles for cryptographic module and signature devices  (CEN EN 419 211, CEN EN 419 221). Common Criteria and FIPS PUB security evaluation have been successfully used  for SSCD for several years now, and the eIDAS Regulation is no reason for change on this matter.  (d) the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation can be reliably protected by the  legitimate signatory against use by others.  2. Qualified electronic signature creation devices shall not alter the data to be signed or prevent such data from  being presented to the signatory prior to signing.  These requirements are addressed in the standards on signature creation applications (CEN EN 419 212 and CEN  EN 419 241).  3. Generating or managing electronic signature creation data on behalf of the signatory may only be done by a  qualified trust service provider.  That requirement is purely procedural and cannot be addressed in a standard.  4. Without prejudice to point (d) of point 1, qualified trust service providers managing electronic signature creation  data on behalf of the signatory may duplicate the electronic signature creation data only for back-up purposes  provided the following requirements are met:  (a) the security of the duplicated datasets must be at the same level as for the original datasets;  This point is addressed as 1.(a)-(c) in the protection profiles for cryptographic modules and other ETSI standards.  (b) the number of duplicated datasets shall not exceed the minimum needed to ensure continuity of the service.  That requirement is purely procedural and cannot be addressed in a standard.  Notification of QSCD  Articles 31(3) and 39(3) consider the publication of a list of certified qualified electronic signature/seal creation  devices.

These requirements are thus not  addressed. However, the qualified status of the signature’s certificates is considered among the available  constraints.  ETSI TS 119 102-1: not addressed in the standard.  (c) the signature validation data corresponds to the data provided to the relying party;  (d) the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is correctly provided to the relying party;  (e) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated to the relying party if a pseudonym was used at the time of  signing;  (g) the integrity of the signed data has not been compromised;  (h) the requirements provided for in Article 26 were met at the time of signing [the signature is an advanced  signature].  ETSI/CEN TS 102 853, ETSI TS 119 102-1: these checks are covered in the standard.  2. The system used for validating the qualified electronic signature shall provide to the relying party the correct  result of the validation process and shall allow the relying party to detect any security relevant issues.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  66  A qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a qualified trust service  provider who […] allows relying parties to receive the result of the validation process in an automated manner,  which is reliable, efficient and bears the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the provider  of the qualified validation service.

In these standards, the signature are \"advanced\" in  the sense that they are technically more complex than the \"basic\" signatures formats they extend, and that they  ensure more evolved security properties (long-term duration of electronic signatures, timestamping, etc.).  Requirements on advanced electronic signature are defined in article 26:  (a) [must be] uniquely linked to the signatory;  (b) [must be] capable of identifying the signatory;  (d) [must be] linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is  detectable.  Practically, these requirements are enforced by the \"advanced\" signature formats: the link with the signer and  his/her identity come from the digital certificate, and the integrity-protected link between signature and signed  data, from cryptographic methods.  42 The term \"advanced electronic signature\" in these standards has absolutely no relationship with the notion used y  the eIDAS Regulation  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  68  (c) [must be] created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of  confidence, use under his sole control;  That requirement is not directly addressed by signature profiles. Indirectly, through the use of qualified certificate  attributes specified in the \"advanced\" standards, however, it is possible to determine that an electronic signature  has been made using a SSCD, which is a sufficient condition for (c) to be met (see below); but this only applies to a  specific kind of electronic signatures.  As with \"trustworthy systems\", condition (c) seems difficult to technically characterize using standards; audits and  case-by-case assessment are more relevant with such requirement.  4.2.3 Standards covering other requirements  4.2.3.1 Trusted Lists  The current technical specifications of the EU Member State national trusted lists are defined by CD 2009/767/EC  as amended and currently rely on ETSI TS 119 612 v1.1.1.  The technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 are laid down in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 (OJ L 235,  9.9.2015, p26-36). CID 2015/1505/EU relies on TS 119 612 v2.1.1 for establishing such specifications.  Additional standards (see section 3.2.7 – Table 7) could support the correct management of trusted lists (ensuring  interoperability and correct practices for TL managers), but this is actually mostly outside the scope of the  implementing acts.  4.2.3.2 QTSPs/QTSs conformity assessment bodies accreditation, assessment report and auditing  rules  Considering the work done at the level and by European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), there is a need for  adopting Art.20.4 implementing acts to legitimate the EA proposed model for CAB accreditation and QTSs/QTSPs  evaluation of conformity as well as to cover the missing part to that model i.e. the applicable “QTS/QTSP audit  criteria” as discussed in section 2.2.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  69  5. Conclusions – identified gaps  Based on the mapping between the requirements of eIDAS and the analysis of existing standards, it can be  concluded that the European Norms will be good candidates for meeting several requirements covered by  foreseen implementing acts, at least those regarding compliance with Annex I, III and IV. Some of the standards  only cover a part of a requirement – and these parts might also only be covered partly (like requirements for  QTSPs providing validation or preservation services). Some others cover a variety of different matters addressed by  various eIDAS articles (e.g. new norms EN 319 431 and EN 319 432).  Some of the standards are not yet available and it is still too early to assess them.  Existing standards can be endorsed for being used within the frames of eIDAS Regulation, to the extent presented  in the previous sections.  Considering the work done at the level and by European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), It might be considered  to adopt in the future the implementing acts set in article 20(4) to legitimate the EA proposed model for CAB  accreditation as well as to cover the applicable “QTS/QTSP audit criteria” to be developed in an “outcome based”  model as discussed in section 2.2.  The analysis also led, however, to a shortlist of gaps, where specific eIDAS requirement are not yet covered by EU  standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC).  Area of open issue  Open standard (draft or even not yet drafted) or description of  open issue  QTSPs providing validation services General requirements on testing compliance and interoperability  of signature creation and validation (ETSI TS 119 104)  ISO and ETSI/CEN standards exist for data preservation services.

Re-building trust in the online environment has been perceived as key to economic and social  development by the European legislator. Regulation (EU) No 910/20142 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation)  adopted last year and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC on 1 July 2016 clearly aims to enhance trust in  electronic transactions in the internal market by providing a common foundation for secure electronic  interaction between citizens, businesses and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of  public and private online services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.  In order to ensure uniform conditions for its implementation, the Regulation confers implementing powers  to the Commission, to promulgate implementation specifications or to reference standards the use of  which would raise a presumption of compliance with select requirements laid down in the eIDAS  Regulation. When adopting delegated or implementing acts, the Commission needs to take due account of  the standards and technical specifications drawn up by European and international standardisation  organisations and bodies, in particular ETSI, CEN, ISO and ITU.  Already in 2009, the European Commission issued Standardisation Mandate 460 to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI  to update the existing eSignature standardisation deliverables in view of establishing a fully rationalised  framework, which would solve the issues raised in actual use of eSignatures in the EU. These issues were  about, notably, the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, the multiplicity of  standardization documents and the lack of usage guidelines, and different technical implementations.  This report on one hand analyses the eIDAS requirements with regard to the standards, on the other  analyses currently available standards and compares the results of both analyses. Such a mapping is  oriented at the requirements specified in the various eIDAS articles. Pursuant to this mapping it can be  concluded that usually the analysed standards usually cover some requirements in part or whole.  Existing standards can be endorsed for being used within the frames of eIDAS Regulation, to the extent as  presented in the previous sections. The analysis presented in this report led, however, to a shortlist of  gaps, where specific eIDAS requirements have yet to be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC)  nor international ones.  1 Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community  framework for electronic signatures.

Introduction3  Pursuant to 15 years of implementation of Directive 1999/93/EC4 on a Community framework for  electronic signatures, the lack of trust and in particular the perceived lack of legal certainty have made  consumers, businesses and public authorities hesitate to carry out transactions electronically and to adopt  new digital services.  Re-building trust in the online environment is still seen as key to economic and social development by the  European legislator. Regulation (EU) No 910/20145 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation) adopted last year and  repealing Directive 1999/93/EC on 1 July 2016 clearly aims to enhance trust in electronic transactions in  the internal market by providing a common foundation for secure electronic interaction between citizens,  businesses and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of public and private online  services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.  In addition to a set of provisions addressing the mutual recognition and equivalence over the EU of  national electronic identification schemes notified against a common assurance level scheme, the eIDAS  Regulation is setting legal provisions for cross-border recognition and EU harmonised legal effects for a  much broader range of trust services than Directive 1999/93/EC that was a mere framework-setting  instrument. Furthermore, the notions of qualified trust services and qualified trust service provider have  been introduced with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security of  qualified trust services and products are used or provided. While Directive 1999/93/EC was purposefully  aimed at (a) provisions on non repudiation addressed by means of issuing qualified certificates and (b) the  automatic cross-border recognition of “qualified electronic signatures” as equivalent to hand written  signature, the eIDAS Regulation also addresses other types of qualified trust services. Such services aim at  the protection and adoption of electronic services (e.g. eGovernment and eCommerce transactions etc.)  in  the digital market, including qualified electronic time stamps, qualified electronic seals, qualified validation  and preservation of qualified electronic signatures/seals, qualified electronic registered delivery services  and qualified website authentication.  These qualified trust services are clearly “marketed” by the Regulation to enhance in particular the trust of  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in the internal market and to promote the use  of trust services and products.  As illustrated in Figure 1 below, through its set of (qualified) trust services related provisions and articles, it  is actually a complete pyramid of trust that the eIDAS Regulation is setting up. The most visible part is the  3 Sources:  - Study to support the implementation of a pan-European framework on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market.

Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  08  “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, which each qualified trust service provider may use to brand  and promote the quality and trustworthiness of the qualified trust services it provides.  Figure 1: eIDAS Regulation building trust in the online environment – Supervision  (Source: IAS² study)  This trust mark introduced by the eIDAS Regulation and further defined by Commission Implementing  Regulation (EU) 2015/8066  is expected to be the convenient distinctive mark for online services users to  identify qualified trust services provided by qualified trust service provider and gain confidence in such  services to secure online service they are using or about to use. By clearly differentiating high quality and  trustworthy qualified trust services from other services, using a trust mark, it is expected that transparency  in the market will improve. The users will be helped to fully benefit and consciously rely on electronic  services supported by qualified trust services and hence to contribute to the development of the digital  market.  The adoption of a trust mark, its credibility, and trustworthiness require a legal basis (as per Art.23 of the  Regulation) and a suitable set of procedural, quality and security requirements to comply with.  6 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/806 of 22 May 2015 laying down specifications relating to the form  of the EU trust mark for qualified trust services. OJ L 128, 23.05.2015, p13-15.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  09  Additionally a mechanism is needed to  notify the market that qualified trust service providers meet such  requirements and obligations so that users of such services can make informed decisions.  As illustrated in the above Figure 1, the eIDAS Regulation explicitly sets up a consistent set of quality  andsecurity requirements and obligations for qualified trust services (QTSs) and qualified trust service  providers (QTSPs). These requirements aim to enhance the trust of consumers and enterprises, in  particular SMEs, in the internal (electronic) market and to promote the use of such qualified trust services  and products.  Through ex-ante and ex-post supervisory activities the eIDAS Regulation sets up a supervisory regime upon  these quality and security requirements and obligations for QTSs and QTSPs. The eIDAS Regulation aims to  ensure that, from before providing qualified services up to terminating such services, the QTSPs indeed  meet these requirements. This supervisory regime for QTS’ and QTSPs is enforced in each EU Member  State (MS), through a national supervisory body to ensure a comparable security level of QTSs over the EU.  The supervisory regime covers the entire life-cycle of the QTSP and their QTSs and in specific:   It relies on a pre-authorisation mechanisms obliging trust service providers intending to provide QTS to  notify the competent supervisory body of their intention together with a conformity assessment  report (CAR) issued by an accredited conformity assessment body (CAB) attesting that the QTSP and  the QTSs it intends to provide meet the requirements laid down in the Regulation.   Once qualified status is granted, it obliges, QTSPs to re-affirm attestations, as above, each two years.   It allows competent supervisory bodies, at their own discretion and at any time, to audit themselves or  to request an accredited CAB to perform a conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS and to produce a  CAR confirming that the QTSP and the QTSs it provides meet the requirements laid down in the  Regulation.   It foresees rules to be followed by QTSP and supervisory activities to be performed in cases where the  QTSP changes or terminates the provisioning of a QTS, or risk ceasing operating.  The decisions to grant or withdraw qualified status to trust services and trust service providers, resulting  from the above described supervisory activities, are taken by the national supervisory bodies .  All associated decisions are published in electronically signed or sealed national trusted lists. Such national  trusted lists are established, maintained and published to disseminate in a trustworthy manner  information related to the qualified trust service providers for which a Member State is responsible,  together with information related to the qualified trust services provided by them, including the whole  history of the qualified status they have been granted.  The mandatory EU MS national trusted lists are published at least in a form suitable for automated  processing. In practice these are XML files. The voluntary “EU trust mark for qualified trust services”, aims  to make any such qualification visible to the consumer. The eIDAS Regulation obliges QTSPs using such a  trust mark to provide, close to it, a link to the corresponding trusted list allowing for verification.  The pyramid of trust further relies on and is strengthened by the use of best practices and standards. In  order to ensure uniformity the Regulation confers implementing powers on the Commission, with regard  to specifications and standards referencing (Recital (71)).  When adopting delegated or implementing acts, the Commission typically takes account of standards and  technical specifications drawn up by European and international standardisation organisations and bodies,  in particular the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Telecommunications  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  10  Standards Institute (ETSI), the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU), with a view to ensuring a high level of security and interoperability of  electronic identification and trust services (Recital (72)).  Seven implementing acts are foreseen by the Regulation to support implementation of eIDAS, as  illustrated in Figure 2. Two mandatory implementing acts have to be laid down respectively on trust marks7  and trusted lists8, three optional implementing acts supporting the supervisory regime, respectively on  conformity assessment bodies, QTSP initiation and supervisory body yearly activities reports, and two  optional implementing acts on common provisions respectively on TSPs and on QTSPs.  Additional implementing acts are foreseen on specific provisions per type of (qualified) trust service and  trust service provider.

When the European Commission is empowered to draft secondary legislation it:   Produces drafts of sets of rules published as a delegated or an implementing act; in this case there  would be no (EU) standard, but a piece of secondary legislation to be approved according to article  48.2 of the Regulation.   Issues a Mandate to European Standardisation Organisations to produce a standard that will be  referenced by a delegated or implementing act. Such standards should clearly separate the purely  technical (industry) part and the eventual regulatory part that implements or specifies a specific  aspect of the Regulation.  Currently,  an informal expert group has been set up by the Commission, composed of MS experts to draw  up a compilation of mandatory Implementing Acts in 2015 and will do the same for non mandatory ones as  well.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  14  2. Requirements of eIDAS  Supervision and conformity assessment requirements  2.1.1 Conformity assessment bodies accreditation & conformity assessment rules  The ex ante and ex post supervisory regime covering the entire life-cycle of the QTSP and the QTSs they  provide relies on conformity assessment reports issued by a conformity assessment body (initiation of a  QTS, two-yearly assessment, ad hoc assessment at discretion of supervisory body).  As per Art.3.(18) a ‘conformity assessment body’ refers to ‘a body defined in point 13 of Article 2 of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [7], which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as competent to  carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the qualified trust services it  provides’.  The European co-operation for Accreditation (EA - www.european-accreditation.org) is the body  established under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 to define the accreditation schemes used by national  accreditation bodies (NAB) to accredit CABs in a specific context like the one defined by the eIDAS  Regulation.  EA and CEN/ETSI have already set up discussions to establish, under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, the  scheme under which national accreditation bodies (NABs) shall accredit, in accordance with Regulation  (EU) No 910/2014, conformity assessment bodies (CABs), as competent to carry out conformity  assessments referred to in its Art.20.1 and whose purpose is ‘to confirm that the qualified trust service  providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in this  Regulation’.  That accreditation scheme is organised as follows:   The retained scheme relies on ISO/IEC 17065  (Internal & External Services), as the general  framework for accrediting the competency of CABs to assess products, processes and services,  and within this framework requires to demonstrate their:  o competency to carry out specific ISO/IEC 17021 -based assessments,  o competency to carry out specific ISO/IEC 27006 -based assessments (Information Security  Management Systems - ISMS).  Note: Beyond ISO/IEC 17065, no additional accreditation is further required according to ISO/IEC 17021  and ISO/IEC 27006   The scheme also defines a “sectoral” specific framework, to further accredit the competency  of CABs to carry out assessments of qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) and qualified trust  services (QTSs) they provide. This specific framework builds on EN 319 403 to specify the  general requirements for CABs and the general auditing rules under which CABs will carry out  their conformity assessments of QTSPs and their QTSs.   In order to be complete, the accreditation scheme requires the identification of a specific set  of “TSP audit criteria”, as defined in EN 319 403, against which the competences of CABs to  assess the QTSPs/QTSs will be accredited and against which the conformity assessment of  QTSPs/QTSs will be conducted by the accredited CAB's. EN 319 403 allow these “TSP audit  criteria” to:  http://www.european-accreditation.org/  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  15  o take into account specificities of the type of trusted service to be assessed;  o ensure that all aspects of the TSP activity are fully covered; and  o be based on standards, publicly available specifications and/or regulatory requirements.  Leveraging on such an accreditation scheme, the competence of accredited CABs would be recognised to  cover not only the conduction of Art.20.1 two-yearly conformity assessments but also the initial  conformity assessments referred to in Art.21, as well as ad-hoc assessments referred to in Art.20.2. These  assessments can perfectly result in conformity assessment reports based on the same set of QTSP/QTS  audit criteria as used for two-yearly conformity assessments (Art.20.1).  2.1.2 CAB as certification bodies  It should be noted as well that this accreditation scheme requires CABs to be certification bodies, and not  simply inspection bodies or laboratories, as CABs are required to certify the conformity of TSPs against the  identified TSP audit criteria against which the assessment is conducted.  ‘EA members unanimously selected ISO 1706510 as the best option as basis for the accreditation of CABs in  the context of conformity assessments of TSPs and trust services they provide, and in particular assessment  of QTSPs/QTSs. EA experience is that ISO 1702011 is not considered appropriate to assessment of  conformance of requirements for the management system of the TSP, and it is considered that review of  the security management system of TSP provides an important part of a TSP audit.  Also, 17020 does not impose a continued assessment by following deviations of the use of certification  brands. Inspection processes tend to review the status of the items being inspected at a point in time  whereas the requirements for a TSP need a more long term, continuous assessment as provided by a  certification scheme. The issue of certification includes requirements for regular surveillance activities as  well as specific requirements for ongoing quality and service improvement.  On their own ISO 2700612 and 1702113 are not considered sufficient to cover assessment of specific service  requirements. However, ISO 17065 was specifically designed to be extended to incorporate requirements  from 17021, but the opposite is not true as ISO 17065 requirements do not fit well into ISO 17021.  The industry requirement for public trust services, such as reflected in the CA Browser Forum guidelines and  for other national schemes for non-qualified trust services, is for a clear indication of the technical  compliance to industry good practice. The aim of the EN 319 403 conformity assessment is also to allow  assessment of conformance to industry good practices as well as that the technical requirements of the  Regulation are met. ETSI/CEN consider that any scheme which falls short of assessment against industry  good practice will bring the acceptability of qualified trust services into question.  Furthermore, there seem to be a market requirement for a clear statement in the international context  where an independent non-governmental statement of conformance.’14  10 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=46568  11 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=52994  12 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=62313  13 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=61651  14 EA/ETSI disposition on comments made during the approval process of EN 319 403  http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=46568 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=52994 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=62313 http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=61651  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  16  The certification decision of the CAB as to whether QTSP/QTS assessed (technically, operationally and  procedurally) meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation addressed in Art.20.1 with regards to two- yearly assessments. Same decisions are required in the context of initial assessments (Art.21) and of ad  hoc assessments (Art.20.2) conducted by accredited CABs.  Certification decisions of the CABs do not automatically entail an obligation for the Supervisory Body to  align its decision as to whether to grant a qualified status to the trust service provider and the trust service  it provides. With regards to supervision of QTSPs/QTSs, Regulation 910/2014/EU gives an exclusive legal  competence for the national Supervisory Body (SB) in granting the qualified status to trust service  providers and the trust services they provide (see Art.17.4.g, Art.20.3 and Art.21.2).  2.1.3 “TSP audit criteria” in the context of eIDAS Regulation  In any other context than Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, having a specific technical standard such as “TSP  audit criteria” allows TSPs to demonstrate conformity against such a standard to interested parties  benefiting from the certification issued by the accredited CAB as a result of a successful conformity  assessment. For example, TSPs being certified by an accredited CAB against EN 319 411-1 (“Policy and  security requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing certificates; Part 1: General requirements”) would  likely be entitled to be accepted by CA/Browser Forum members for inclusion of their CA root certificates  in the corresponding CA root certificates trust stores of these members.  However in the context of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, limiting the “TSP audit criteria” to one or more  specific technical standards raise some issues:   Expected purpose: As per Art.20.1 of the Regulation, the expected purpose of conformity  assessment reports from accredited CAB on QTSPs/QTSs is “to confirm that the qualified trust  service providers and the qualified trust services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid  down in this Regulation”. These eIDAS conformity assessment reports (initial, two-yearly and  ad hoc15) must confirm that the QTSP/QTS meet all the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. Their purpose is not to confirm the conformity of the QTSP/QTS to a specific  technical standard addressed to TSPs.  None of the CEN/ETSI standards cover all requirements of the Regulation applicable to the addressed  (Q)TSP/(Q)TS. They only cover the technical counterparts of an important but limited set of legal provisions  laid down in the Regulation.  The “TSP audit criteria against which the competences of CABs to assess the QTSPs/QTSs will be accredited  and against which the conformity assessment of QTSPs/QTSs will be conducted by the accredited CAB's”  (hereafter called “QTSP/QTS audit criteria”) should allow accredited CABs to assess whether QTSPs/QTSs  meet the requirements of the Regulation not how they meet them.   De facto mandatory TSP standards: Assuming that one or more CEN/ETSI standards would  address and cover all requirements applicable to a specific type of QTSP/QTS, having such  standards as the “QTSP/QTS audit criteria” would make them de facto obligatory for QTSPs  and the QTSs they provide. Indeed as QTSPs must be assessed by accredited CABs, when CABs  15 Standards mentioned require annual surveillance of TSPs, but from the eIDAS Regulation, there is no such  recurrence needed, as there is a continuous supervision from the Supervisory Body that is entitled to conduct an ad- hoc audit or request an ad-hoc assessment from an accredited CAB.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  17  are accredited only against such standards, there is no other choice for QTSPs to comply with  such standards; otherwise they could not be assessed by an accredited CAB.  The eIDAS Regulation is intimately associated to an implementing technical layer that will mainly rely on  standards adopted by standardisation bodies (as per articles 2(1) , (8), (9) and (10) as well as Annex I of  Regulation 1025/2012/EC) and technical specifications. Such a technical layer could be used by  stakeholders on a voluntary basis as one manner to implement the requirements of the Regulation. It  would not be acceptable that a standard became de facto mandatory.  The implementation of the eIDAS accreditation scheme should target the same approach with regards to  the QTSPs/QTSs, allowing them to implement any method, standardised or not, to meet the applicable  requirements of the Regulation.  Furthermore, Art.20.4 implementing acts are addressing CABs and not QTSPs with regards to the  referencing of standards, in particular on their accreditation, conformity assessment reports, and auditing  rules under which they will carry out their conformity assessment of the qualified trust service providers.   Incomplete standard referencing scheme in the eIDAS Regulation with regards to QTSP/QTS  obligations: The eIDAS Regulation allows, through the adoption of secondary legislation, to  establish reference numbers of standards, which when they are met will provide legal  presumption of conformity to the corresponding legal provisions. However it should be clearly  noted that not all the requirements applicable to a specific type of QTSP/QTS are covered by  such a referencing mechanism. E.g. from Art.24 on requirements for QTSPs, only Art.24.(2).e  and Art.24.(2).f requirements benefit from such a referencing.  It is not possible to establish a list of standards applicable to QTSPs/QTSs that will provide presumption of  conformity with the Regulation.   IA foreseen in Art.20.4 are optional: It should be noted that the implementing acts foreseen in  Art.20.4 are not mandatory but optional. There is no obligation for the European Commission  to establish such acts. The provisions of the eIDAS Regulation are supposed self-sufficient in  order to ensure the applicability of the legal framework. As for all optional implementing acts,  these Art.20.4 acts are deemed related to non-essential elements of the Regulation that are  not substantial for the Regulation to work. The need to adopt them must be assessed on a  case-by-case basis in the light of several principles including  o The eIDAS framework consistency: in the present case adopting Art.20.4  implementing acts would require to ensure its consistency with other implementing  acts granting QTSPs/QTSs with presumption of compliance with some legal provisions.  o Taking into account stakeholders/market needs: evaluating stakeholders / market's  demands and needs, potential barriers hamper eIDAS adoption and take-up  o Favouring non-regulatory approach, co-regulatory approach and development under  other regulatory frameworks: In this case, as the implementation of an eIDAS  accreditation scheme may be ensured under the framework of Regulation  765/2008/EC, as being set up by EA, the implementing act foreseen in art.20.4 may  not be needed. Furthermore adopting a secondary act means codifying a given  technological approach that may quickly become obsolete, requiring a revision of the  adopted act.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  18   Availability and adequacy of standards: Following the availability of a standard, the  Commission may assess whether to list it in an implementing act.   Availability of QTSPs/QTSs standards is important but not required: Considering the current  status of the European (ETSI, CEN/CENELEC) standardisation framework, it is unlikely that all  types of QTSPs/QTS will be addressed by technical specifications and standards   Outcome based “QTSP/QTS audit criteria” in the context of eIDAS Regulation: For all the  above-stated reasons, in the eIDAS accreditation scheme being set up by EA under Regulation  765/2008/EC, the “QTSPs/QTSs audit criteria”16 should be designed in such a way that:  o The resulting conformity assessment reports issued by accredited CABs aim to confirm  that the qualified trust service providers and the qualified trust services provided by  them meet the requirements laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  o It consists of one or more separate standards, outcome based, mapping audit criteria  built as control objectives and controls, against the requirements of the Regulation per  type of qualified trust service. These criteria shall be used by accredited CABs as a  basis for establishing the conformity assessment report to be issued by them  confirming QTSP/QTS they assess meet all applicable requirements from the  Regulation.  These criteria defined in an “outcome based” approach could leverage on the check  lists specified by or in the context of relevant available standards (e.g. the check list  from ETSI draft EN 319 411-2 with regards to QTSPs issuing qualified certificates); it  should however be clear that these criteria are for use by CABs as a method to  produce a conformity assessment report on the conformity of the audited QTSPs/QTSs  and shall not presuppose or require QTSPs/QTSs to comply with the standards from  which they are derived. QTSPs/QTSs are free to implement such standards, any other  standard or no standard at all. Current CEN/ETSI standards addressing QTSP and QTS  related specifications, including the ETSI EN 319 4x1 series and any other relevant  standards, can be used by TSPs on a voluntary basis but cannot be made (de facto)  mandatory.  o Whenever compliance with part of the applicable eIDAS requirements would be  deemed satisfied by compliance with a referenced standard, this would be  acknowledged provided the conformity with such a referenced standard has been  assessed and confirmed by an eIDAS accredited CABs.  Currently no such QTSPs/QTSs audit criteria standard exists and the European Commission should ask  CEN/ETSI to prepare it as matter of priority.  This does not prevent the accreditation scheme being set up by EA and CEN/ETSI to allow accreditation of  CABs against specific set of TSP oriented standards so that TSPs/TSs and/or QTSPs/QTSs can benefit from  certification of conformity against any of such specific standards. This can be used to certify compliance  with standards for use outside the context of the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. CA/Browser Forum and the  associated industry) but also for attesting compliance with standards possibly referenced in eIDAS  secondary legislation.  16 i.e. TSP audit criteria against which the competences of CABs to assess the QTSPs/QTSs will be accredited and  against which the conformity assessment of QTSPs/QTSs will be conducted by the accredited CAB's.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  19  Requirements that TSPs should put in place in order to provide certain services  2.2.1 Requirements common to all TSPs   Data processing and protection (Art.5)  o Art.5.1. Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC.  o Art.5.2. Without prejudice to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use  of pseudonyms in electronic transactions shall not be prohibited.   Liability and burden of the proof (Art.13)  o (Art.13.1) TSP liable for damage caused intentionally or negligently to any natural or legal  person due to a failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation   Burden of proving intention/negligence of non-qualified TSP is on claiming party   Intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed, unless proven otherwise by QTSP  o (Art.13.2) When TSP informed customer in advance on limitations on the use of their services,  & when such limitations are recognisable to third parties, TSP not liable when limitations have  been exceeded.  o (Art.13.3) In accordance with national rules on liability.   Accessibility for person with disabilities (Art.15) – where feasible   Due diligence (Art.19.1)  o shall take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services they provide.  o Having regard to the latest technological developments, these measures shall ensure that the  level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk  o measures shall be taken to prevent and minimize the impact of security incidents and inform  stakeholders of the adverse effects of any such incidents   Security & personal data breach notification (Art.19.2)  o shall, without undue delay but in any event within 24 hours after having become aware of it,  notify the supervisory body and, where applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the  competent national body for information security or the data protection authority, of any  breach of security or loss of integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided  or on the personal data maintained therein  o shall also notify the [likely adversely affected] natural or legal [customer] of the breach of  security or loss of integrity without undue delay  o May be required by the supervisory body to inform the public, when it is in the public interest  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  20  The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, further specifies measures & procedures for these  due diligence and security/personal data breach notification provisions. In this context however, the  initiative of ENISA on security breach notifications (SBN) may make the adoption of the related  implementing act under art.19.4 of eIDAS Regulation unnecessary.  Building upon the experience on SBN  gained while working on the implementation of article 13a of the e-communication Framework Directive,  ENISA is currently developing technical guidelines to facilitate the implementation of article 19 of the  eIDAS Regulation. Such guidelines will be developed in close cooperation with all stakeholders (in  particular national supervisory bodies and TSPs) and focus on appropriate technical and operational  solutions to comply with article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation. Once completed, these guidelines would be  available to stakeholders for voluntary adoption, and be subject to regular revision (as it has been the case  of these related to article 13a of the e-communication Framework Directive).  Furthermore it is recommended to the TSPs to prepare procedures to be used in case of and to support  supervision of their SB according to article 17.3. This may be done in co-operation with the responsible SB.  2.2.2 Requirements common to all QTSPs  Requirements common to all QTSPs are these requirements applicable to all TSPs (see section 2.2.1)  together with the following requirements laid down in Art.24.2 of the eIDAS Regulation:  (a) Inform SB of any change in QTS provisioning and of intention to cease (new provision  compared to that of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (b) Requirements on staff (similar to Annex II.e of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (c) Sufficient financial resources and/or liability insurance, in accordance with national law (similar  to Annex II.h of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (d) Consumer information on terms and conditions, incl. limitations on use (similar to Annex.II.k);  (e) use trustworthy systems and products (similar to Annex.II.f + reliability of supported  processes);  (f) use trustworthy systems to store (personal) data (new provision compared to that of Directive  1999/93/EC);  (g) take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data (generalisation of Annex.II.g);  (h) Record and keep accessible activities related data, issued and received (generalisation of  Annex.II.i), even after cessation (new);  (i) Up-to-date termination plan (agreed with SB) to ensure continuity of service (new provision  compared to that of Directive 1999/93/EC);  (j) ensure lawful processing of personal data in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC (similar to  Art.8 of Directive 1999/93/EC).  (Art.24.5) The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of standards  for trustworthy systems and products, which comply with the requirements   under Art.24.2.(e) - trustworthy systems and products   under Art.24.2.(f) - trustworthy systems for data storage  Compliance with the requirements laid down in these articles Art.24.2.(e) and (f) shall be presumed where  trustworthy systems and products meet these standards.  2.2.3 Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified certificates  Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified certificates are these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these  requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following requirements laid down in:  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  21   Art.24.1:   Art.24.2.(k) on establishing and keeping updated a certificate database;   Art.24.3: If a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified certificates decides to revoke a  certificate, it shall register such revocation in its certificate database and publish the revocation  status of the certificate in a timely manner, and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt of  the request. The revocation shall become effective immediately upon its publication.   Art24.4: With regard to paragraph 3, qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates  shall provide to any relying party information on the validity or revocation status of qualified  certificates issued by them. This information shall be made available at least on a per certificate  basis at any time and beyond the validity period of the certificate in an automated manner that is  reliable, free of charge and efficient.  OCSP does not necessarily provide more up to date information than a CRL. In practice, the two last  requirements do not require the implementation of OCSP based certificate validity status information  services. It would be advised to provide both types of such services for efficiency reasons, provided  adequate profiling of the corresponding standards are specified. Anticipating the termination, expected or  unexpected, may also have a considerable influence in selecting implementation of both types of services.   Content of qualified certificates:  o As per Annex I for qualified certificate for electronic signatures (Art.28.1)  o As per Annex III for qualified certificate for electronic seals (Art.38.1)  o As per Annex IV for qualified certificate for website authentication (Art.45.1)   May include non-mandatory attributes, not affecting interoperability or recognition (Art.28.3, Art.  38.3, also applying to QC for WSA when special case of QC for electronic seals – Recital (65))   Revocation of qualified certificates is definitive (Art.28.4, Art. 38.4, also applying to QC for WSA  when special case of QC for electronic seals – Recital (65))  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  22   Temporary suspension of QC for electronic seals and for electronic signatures may be specified on  a national basis (Art.28.5, Art.38.5)  o With obliteration?  o Without obliteration?  In case the QTSP issues qualified electronic signature creation devices (QSCD), the following requirements  apply:   Characteristics of QSCD:  o As per Annex II for qualified electronic signature creation devices (Art.29.1)   Certification of the QSCD by appropriate bodies (Art.30.1) whereas the certification is based upon  an security evaluation process according to Art. 30.3, and where the European Commission shall,  by means of implementing acts, establish list of standards for the security assessment of  information technology products.  Instead of issuing a new QSCD, the QTSP might want to certify public keys originating from QSCD already in  the hand of a user. In such a case the QTSP has to ensure by appropriate means that the key is truly  originating from a QSCD, before issuing the certificate (Art.3(12)).  With regard to the requirements of art. 24.1.(b), on issuing remotely a qualified certificate, the identity  verification process is in fact more strict than identity proofing process at the issuance of electronic means  of identification of the level of assurance ‘high’17. Therefore to be compliant with art. 24.1.(b) it is  (explicitly) mandatory to use electronic identification means for which physical presence was performed at  issuance, regardless it represents level ‘substantial’ or ‘high’.  2.2.4 Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified validation services for QESig / QESeal  Requirements for QTSPs providing validation services for QESig / QESeal18 (referring to Art.33 / Art.40) are  these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.33.1(a) with regard to the validation process to be provided in compliance with Art.32.1. (alinea (a)  to (h)).   Art.33.1(b) for the provision of the validation result in an automated manner that needs:  o to provide to the relying party the correct result of the validation process and shall allow the  relying party to detect any security relevant issues (in conjunction of Art.32.2);  o to be reliable and efficient; and  o to bear the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the QTSP providing  the qualified validation service.  17 According to CIR (EU) 2015/1502 on setting out the minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance  levels for electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European  Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market. OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p7-20.  18 Art.40 for validation of QESeals refers back to Art. 32 and 33  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  23  As foreseen in Art.32.3, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers  of standards for the validation of qualified electronic signatures and as foreseen in Art.33.2 the  Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of standards for qualified  validation service as required by Art.33.1.  As the relative vagueness of provisions stipulated in Art.32 on the requirements for the validation of  qualified electronic signatures may lead to varying implementation measures , adopting such  implementing acts would be recommended.  2.2.5 Requirements for QTSPs providing preservation service for QESig/ QESeal  Requirements for QTSPs providing preservation services for QESig / QESeal19 (referring to (Art.34 / Art.40)  are these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.34.1 for making use of procedures and technologies capable of extending the trustworthiness of  the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological validity period.  Where, according to Art.34.2 the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference  numbers of standards for the qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures and seals.  2.2.6 Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified electronic time stamps  Requirements for QTSPs issuing qualified electronic time stamps (referring to Art.42) are these  requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.42.1 for qualified electronic time stamps:  o to bind the date and time to data in such a manner as to reasonably preclude the possibility of  the data being changed undetectably;  o to be based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated Universal Time; and  o to be signed using an advanced electronic signature or sealed with an advanced electronic seal  of the qualified trust service provider, or by some equivalent method  As of Art.42.2 the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of  standards for the binding of date and time to data and for accurate time sources.  2.2.7 Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified electronic registered delivery service  Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified electronic registered delivery service (referring to Art.44) are  these requirements applicable to all TSPs, these requirements common to all QTSPs, and the following  requirements laid down in:   Art.44.1 on the definition of the qualified electronic registered delivery service which may be  offered by one or more QTSP.  19 Art.40 for preservation of QSeals refers back to Art. 34  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  24  As of Art.44.2 the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference numbers of  standards for processes for sending and receiving data.  Technical requirements for signatures, seals, certificates and their validation  In this context, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1506 of 8 September 2015 laying down  specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced electronic seals to be  recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27(5) and 37(5) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of  the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic  transactions in the internal market has been published in the Official Journal of the EU20.  The eIDAS Regulation specifies other electronic signatures, electronic seals and related certificates  requirements set directly in the annexes to the regulation; other requirements are stipulated as follows, by  establishing reference numbers of standards for:21   Art.24(5) - trustworthy systems and products, which comply with the requirements under points (e)  and (f) of paragraph 2 of Art.24.   Art.27(4) - advanced electronic signatures in public services.   Art.28(6) - qualified certificates for electronic signatures.   Art.29(2) - qualified electronic signature creation devices.   Art.32(3) - the validation of qualified electronic signatures.   Art.34(2) - qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures   Art.37(4) - advanced electronic seals in public services.   Art.38(6) - qualified certificates for electronic seals.   Art.39(1) - qualified electronic seal creation devices.   Art.40 - the validation of qualified electronic seals.   Art.42(2) - the binding of date and time to data and for accurate time sources in the context of  qualified electronic time stamps (Art.42(1)).   Art.45(2) - qualified certificates for website authentication.  The following direct requirements are specified with ANNEX I to IV to the eIDAS-Regulation:   ANNEX I – Requirements for qualified certificates for electronic signatures:  Specifies the minimum data contents of the certificate and requires, that the certificate supporting  advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider  must be available free of charge, ANNEX I (h),   ANNEX II – Requirements for qualified electronic signature creation devices:  Specifies minimum requirements to be met by a QSCD and requires that electronic signature creation  data may only be managed on behalf of the signatory by a qualified trust service provider. In addition,  requirements for the duplication of a signatory’s electronic signature creation data are specified  ANNEX II, 4.   ANNEX III – Requirements for qualified certificates for electronic seals:  Specifies the minimum data contents of the certificate and requires, that the certificate supporting  advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider  must be available free of charge, ANNEX III (h),  20 OJ L 235, 9.9.2015, p37-41.  21 The approach of the Commission in this regard is expressed in section 2.1.3.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  25   ANNEX IV – Requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication:  Specifies the minimum data contents of the certificate and requires, that the certificate supporting  advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the issuing qualified trust service provider  must be available free of charge, ANNEX IV (i).  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  26  3. Inventory of standards  Overview  In late 2009, the European Commission issued Standardisation Mandate 46022 to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to update  the existing eSignature standardisation deliverables in view of establishing a fully rationalised framework, which  would solve the issues raised in actual use of eSignatures in the EU. These issues were about, notably, the mutual  recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures, the multiplicity of standardization documents and the  lack of usage guidelines, the difficulty of access, the lack of business orientation, the numerous options and  latitude for divergent interpretations and different technical implementations.  Other standardisation bodies such as ISO, IETF, OASIS, UPU, ITU and national accreditation or supervisory bodies  are also defining “standards” or “local rules” that apply to Trust Services and Trust Service Provider.  The main objective of this section is to have an overview of involved parties and existing standards at the time of  writing. Annex A of this document provides a table of all identified standards.  ETSI/CEN framework for standardization of signatures  One of the first tasks in the context of Mandate 460 was to establish a rationalized framework for signature  standardization to overcome the reported issues within the context of the eSignature Directive, taking into  account possible revisions to this Directive. In August 2014, the European Commission published Regulation  910/2014/EU aiming to repeal that Directive as from 1/7/2016. That Regulation extends the scope of the Directive  with additional services for identification and authentication alongside an extended range of signature related  trust services and defines additional forms of qualified certificates.  A work programme has been established and will be maintained to address any elements identified as missing in  the framework for standardization of signatures. All documents of the framework intend to cover digital signatures  supported by PKI and public key certificates, and aim to meet the general requirements of the international  community to provide trust and confidence in electronic transactions, including, amongst other, applicable  requirements from the EU legislation. Digital signatures as data appended to, or being a cryptographic  transformation of a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and integrity of the data  unit and protect against forgery, can support, when appropriately supported themselves by relevant trust services,  implementation of electronic signatures and electronic seals as they are defined in the applicable European  legislation.  ETSI technical report TR 119 000 describes the general structure for ETSI/CEN digital signature standardization  outlining existing and potential standards for such signatures, hereafter referred to as the ETSI/CEN framework for  standardization of signatures. This framework identifies six areas of standardization with a list of existing and  potential future standards in each area:  1. Signature creation and validation: focusing on standards related to the creation and validation of digital  signatures, covering:  i) the policy and security requirements for signature creation applications and signature  validation applications;  ii) the expression of rules and procedures to be followed at creation, verification and for  preservation of digital signatures for long term;  22 http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf  http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  27  iii) signature format, packaging of signatures and signed documents; and  iv) protection profiles, according to Common Criteria for signature creation/verification  applications.  2. Signature creation and other related devices: focusing on standards related to secure signature creation  devices as defined in Directive 1999/93/EC, on signature creation devices used by trust service providers as  well as other types of devices supporting digital signatures and related services such as authentication.  3. Cryptographic suites: covering standardisation aspects related to the use of signature cryptographic  suites, i.e. the suite of digital signature related algorithms including key generation algorithms, signing  algorithms with parameters and padding method, verification algorithms, and hash functions.  4. Trust service providers supporting digital signatures and related services: covering TSPs issuing qualified  certificates, TSPs issuing public key certificates other than qualified certificates, including web server  certificates, time-stamping services providers, TSPs offering signature validation services, TSPs offering  remote signature creation services (also called signing servers).  5. Trust application service providers: covering trust service providers offering value added services applying  digital signatures and that relies on the generation/validation of electronic signatures in normal operation.  This includes namely registered mail and other e-delivery services, as well as data preservation (long term  archiving) services.  6. Trust service status (list) provider: covering standards related to the provision of trusted lists as defined  by CD 2009/767/EC as amended and by CD 2015/1505/EU.  Up to five types of documents may be associated with each area:   Guidance documents   Policy and Security Requirements   Technical Specifications   Conformance Assessment Guidance   Compliance and Interoperability Testing  The next subsections describe shortly these different areas and their constitutive documents. The descriptive text  regarding each listed document is minimised as an extended version can be found in TR 119 000. An overview of  the effective availability of the documents is also provided.  The total number of expected documents for the whole framework is 59 multipart documents and more than a  hundred (107) when counting each part separately. This also explains the need for guidance documents from  different sources of interest in eSignatures (business, security, etc.). The bulk of these are technical specification  documents. Thanks to ETSI Plug-Test programs, the “Compliance and Interoperability Testing” documents for  electronic signatures/seals are also available.  3.2.1 Introductory documents  An additional area (Area 0) is grouping TR 119 000, the document presenting the general structure of the  CEN/ETSI framework for standardization of signatures, as well as studies and other introductory deliverables  related to the structure of the framework.  This general purpose Area 0 includes the documents listed in Table 1 below. This table and the other tables listing  the existing document of the ETSI/CEN framework indicate the new numbering of each standard as it appears in  the framework, its title, the type of document, the number(s) of the document(s) it replaces, and the effective or  expected publication date (for information and subject to changes).  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  28  Table 1: Introductory documents of the framework for signature standardization (source ETSI TR 119 000)  No draft is available yet for TR 419 010 that aims to propose an extension of the signature standardisation  framework to cover electronic identification, electronic authentication and signatures. Its delivery has been  delayed in order to be aligned with Regulation 2014/910/EU and in particular with its secondary legislation on  electronic identification means, i.e. CID 2015/1502/EU23.  The special report SR 019 020 is planned for publication in November 2015. This document recommends:   The provision of specifications on the framework for standards (including potential architectures and  relevant scenarios) required for the creation of advanced AdES in distributed environments (e.g. via new  TS 119 152). This is expected to leverage on OASIS DSS and on MCOMM specifications.   The provision of specifications on the policy requirements for TSPs providing signature generation services  (e.g. via new EN 319 431). The operation of the TSP providing such signature generation services needs to  be trusted to ensure that the keys held on the server are not open to hostile attack. Support for split keys  (e.g. models in use in Poland) is for further study. This document will reference EN 319 401 for general  policy requirements on TSPs.   The provision of specifications to address protocol requirements for use of TSPs to support both local and  remote signing (e.g. via new EN 319 432). For local signing both ETSI M-COMM and OASIS DSS are  applicable. M-COMM already has a significant installed base and can take advantage of particular features  of mobile environment. OASIS DSS has the advantage of being generally applicable to both mobile and of  computing environments. For remote signing, OASIS DSS is directly applicable.   The provision of specifications on the policy requirements for TSPs providing signature validation services  (e.g. via new EN 319 441). The operation of the TSP providing such signature validation services needs to  be trusted to ensure that the service is not open to hostile attack. This document will reference EN 319  401 for general policy requirements on TSPs.   The provision of specifications (e.g. via new EN 319 442) to address protocol, formats and procedures  requirements for use of signature validation trust service (providers). OASIS DSS is directly applicable  although other services may be used to support signature validation (e.g. W3C XML Key Management  Specifications, DVCS protocols, SCVP protocols).  23 CIR (EU) 2015/1502 on setting out the minimum technical specifications and procedures for assurance levels for  electronic identification means pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament  and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.

These documents aim to provide best practices in the usage of e-signatures within  the context of SMEs and consumers. They should answer questions in relation to the use and benefits (ROI) of  eSignatures to SMEs / consumers ecosystems. These guides are not meant to be as technically oriented as ETSI  documents.  TR 119 001 provides all definitions & abbreviations used in documents of the framework and serve as reference.  SR 019 050 provided a proposal for a rationalized framework of standards for electronic registered delivery  services, as defined by the eIDAS Regulation 20914/910/EU; the current structure of the framework documents  covering these services is the one published in TR 119 000 (see section 3.2.§ below).  3.2.2 Signature Creation and Validation  The standardisation documents for signature creation and validation are summarised in table 2 with further details  provided in TR 119 000.  With regards to the validation of digital signatures, it should be noted that procedures for signature validation  were previously specified in TS 102 853 - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Signature validation  procedures and policies updated in November 2014 to reflect corrections in processing identification of the  signer’s certificate in XAdES, CAdES and PAdES. EN 319 102 “Procedures for Signature Creation and Validation; Part  1: Signature validation procedures”, under EN approval, will further update TS 102 853, in particular to meet the  requirements of Regulation 2014/910/EU. It should be noted however that the standardisation work on  specifications for a signature validation report (EN 319 102 Part2) has been delayed to the next specialist task force  activities waiting for funding from the European Commission.  Significant efforts have been made to standardise requirements for signature creation and/or validation  applications. This encompasses specifications for policy and security requirements (TS 119 101), protection profiles  (EN 419 111 series) and relevant conformity assessment guidance (TS 119 103). This is believed to be an important  contribution to the enhancement of the quality and security of such applications. Appropriate coordination  between CEN and ETSI shall be required to properly finalise such efforts. TS 119 101 and TS 119 103 are not yet  published while all five parts of the Protection Profiles (PPs) for signature creation and verification application  (prCEN/EN 419 111) have been published as CEN enquiry status in 2013-03 hence in the context of Directive  1999/93/EC. These latter PPs may need to be updated for alignment with eIDAS Regulation, upcoming ETSI  documents (e.g. TS 119 101) and furthermore Part 2 and Part 4 still need to be evaluated and certified. Evaluation  and certification were delayed due to the need to find a new editor.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  30  Table 2: Standards for signature creation and validation (source ETSI TR 119 000)  Increased rationalisation and simplification with regards to the specifications of XAdES, CAdES and PAdES signature  formats have been implemented, further simplifying and promoting the baseline profiles as the primary  specifications while marginalising any additional optional extensions. The same improvements have been done for  associated signature containers (ASiC) specifications. All corresponding documents are under EN approval process  and are expected to be adopted and published early 2016. It is expected that these specifications could be  candidate for being referenced by implementing acts foreseen in Art.27.5 and Art 37.5 of the eIDAS Regulation,  when amending CID 2015/1506/EU.

The remote Plugtests™ interoperability  events aim to conduct conformance and interoperability testing on X/C/PAdES digital signatures and ASiC  containers and provide full test coverage of the specifications including testing signatures evolution, simulating  real life situations. The tests include creation, augmentation and verification of signature and are executed  according to current version and new draft of applicable standards. They are organised three or four times a year.  Outside these events, ETSI is also designing and developing a set of conformance testing tools. ETSI TS 119 1x4  documents aim to help implementers and accelerate the development of C/X/PAdES-ASiC signature creation and  validation applications by defining test suites complete sets of test assertions for testing technical conformance of  signatures against the relevant technical specifications. The test results can also be used in conformity assessment  for signature creation and validation applications (ETSI EN 319 103) with policies requiring conformity to specific  ETSI signature formats and procedures.  With regards to signature policies, published part 1 of TS 119 172 lays down the concepts and the specifications for  the table of contents of a human readable signature policy while parts 2 & 3 specifying the derived machine  processable formats (XML and ASN.1) have been postponed to a future phase of the standardisation work  programme. TS 119 172 Part 4 will be dedicated to specify a signature validation policy as aligned to Art.32 of  Regulation (EU) 910/2014, i.e. rules for validating digital signatures using EU MS trusted lists in order to indicate  whether they are advanced electronic signatures/seals, advanced electronic signatures/seals supported by a  qualified certificate or qualified electronic signature/seal in accordance with the applicable EU legislation.  3.2.3 Signature creation and other related devices  The standardisation documents for signature creation and other related devices are summarised in table 3 with  further details available in TR 119 000.

This part provides a tutorial and \"how-to\" use guide for the following parts of the  standard.   Part 2 (Basic services for electronic signatures) specifies mandatory mechanisms for smart cards  and other secure elements to be used as secure signature creation devices covering among other  signature creation, user verification, device authentication, and establishment of a secure channel.  The specified mechanisms are suitable for other purposes like services in the context of IAS. The  group is currently working on the integration of eSeal. It is not clear what are the constraints  regarding seal versus signature (where depending on the environment, a device authentication  and a secure channel must be established).   Part 3 (Device authentication) specifies device authentication to be used for SSCDs in various  contexts and includes device authentication protocols, data structures, CV-certificates and key  management. The device authentication protocols shall apply to sole-control signature as  mandated by Directive 1999/93/EC and as mandated by Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.   Part 4 (Privacy) specifies access to e-services with privacy-oriented protocols. The group is working  on the integration of eIDAS token specification.   Part 5 (Additional services in the context of electronic services) contains Identification,  Authentication and Digital Signature (IAS) services in addition to the SSCD mechanisms already  described in Part 1 to enable interoperability and usage for IAS services on a national or European  level. It also specifies additional mechanisms like key decipherment, Client/Server authentication  and identity management.  3.2.4 Cryptographic suites  The standardisation documents for cryptographic suites are summarised in table 4 with further details in TR 119  000.  Table 4: Standards for cryptographic suites (source TR 119 000)  An updated version of TS 102 176-1 (known as the “Algo paper”) has been published as TS 119 312 v1.1.1 in  November 2014.  ETSI TR 119 300 and ETSI TS 119 312 are providing guidance on selection of cryptographic suites with particular  emphasis on security. ETSI TS 119 312 identifies a range of different cryptographic suites that can be used  corresponding to the appropriate level of security, which meets the security needs identified during the system  design; there is no normative requirement on selection among the alternatives but for all alternatives, normative  requirements apply to ensure security and interoperability. It is based on various security recommendations given  Cryptographic suites Replaces Expected publication  Sub-areas  Guidance  TR 1 19 3 0 0 Business guidance on cryptographic suites (new) published  Technical Specifications  TS 1 19 3 1 2 Cryptographic suites TS 102 176-1 published  Testing Conformance  & Interoperability  - - - - - no requirement identified  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  35  by other standardization bodies, national security agencies (including but not limited to France24 and Germany25)  and supervisory authorities of the Member States. ETSI 119 300 explains the concept of security parameters that  helps to choose a proper cryptographic suite for digital signature creation. It also gives an overview how to analyse  the business needs on the use of standards for cryptographic suites (in particular for digital signature creation  algorithms) and how to select a system that satisfies these needs.  3.2.5 TSPs supporting digital signatures and related services  The standardisation documents for TSP supporting digital signatures and related services are summarised in table  5 with further details provided in TR 119 000.

These documents are highlighted in dark pink in Figure 3 below, together with their interrelations with the other  relevant documents of the standardisation area, i.e. indicating which document they require or conditionally  require.  Figure 3: Overview the Area 4 documents and their interrelations  It should be noted that production of the documents directly related to the provisioning of signature generation  and validation services have been postponed for future standardisation work and they will likely not be available,  at least under the form of a European standard (EN) by 1/07/2016.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  37  3.2.6 Trust application service providers  The documents for trust application service providers are summarised in table 6 with further details provided in TR  119 000.  Table 6: Standards for trust application service providers  On the subject of trust application service providers (TASP) area, there are no well-established documents besides  the existing TS 102 573 (“Policy requirements for trust service providers signing and/or storing data objects”) and  the multipart TS 102 640 series (“Registered Electronic Mail (REM)”).  In September 2015, work has been started to address trust service consisting in preservation of (qualified)  electronic signatures under the form of a study undertaken to evaluate the needs and scope for such  standardisation work. The standardisation work on electronic registered delivery services will leverage on the  existing multipart TS 102 640 series addressing standardisation of registered electronic mail (REM) and align these  specifications to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic registered delivery services.  Effective production of such REM specifications and more general specifications addressing all other types of  electronic registered delivery services has not been planned yet and is likely not to finalised in 2016.

Table 7: Standards for trust service status lists providers  The current technical specifications of the EU Member State national trusted lists are defined by CD 2009/767/EC  as amended and currently rely on ETSI TS 119 612 v1.1.1.  The technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 are laid down in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 (OJ L 235,  9.9.2015, p26-36). CID 2015/1505/EU relies on TS 119 612 v2.1.1 for establishing such specifications.  Work on testing conformance and interoperability of trusted lists is expected to be part of standardisation work  programme.  Other standards  The present section identifies standards and publicly available specifications coming from other sources than the  CEN/ETSI while addressing the same topics and matters applicable to trust services and trust service providers.  These additional sources include other standardisation bodies such as ISO, IETF, ITU, NIST, OASIS, UPU and national  accreditation or supervisory bodies.  From all identified documents listed in Annex A, each of the next sub-sections will present these additional  standards and publicly available specifications that have been retained as relevant with regards to the addressed  topic. Relevance is discussed against the main objective of identifying standards as potential candidates for being  referenced by eIDAS Regulation, against the existing ETSI/CEN standards being also candidates. Categories of  interesting standards have been added for their connection with trust services and trust service providers even  when not addressed directly by the eIDAS Regulation (e.g. cryptographic suites, formats of the document or data  that may be required to be signed or sealed).  3.3.1 Cryptographic suites  Standards and publicly available specifications related to cryptographic suites can be split into two main  categories: the specifications defining specific cryptographic algorithms and their parameters on the one side, and  on the other side guidance oriented documents on how to select and implement in practice these algorithms and  parameters in a specific context for a specific purpose. These latter guidance can either be defined at a national  Trust  service status lists providers Replaces Expected publication  Sub-areas  Guidance  TR 1 19 6 0 0 Business guidance for trust service status lists providers new published  Policy & Security Requirements  TS 1 19 6 1 1 Policy & security requirements for trusted lists providers Undefined  Technical Specifications  TS 1 19 6 1 2 Trusted lists TS 102 231 published  Conformity Assessment  - - - - - no requirement identified for such a document - relying on TS 119 403 / EN 319 403  Testing Conformance & Interoperability  TS 1 19 6 1 4 Testing conformance & interoperability of trusted lists:  - Part 1: Test suites for testing interoperability of XML representation of trusted lists.  - Part 2: Specifications for testing conformance of XML representation of trusted lists  (new) Undefined  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  39  level (e.g. BSI in Germany, ANSSI in France, IEEE, NIST or NSA in the US), in a specific domain of application (e.g.  biopharma industry, banking industry) or at a more general level (e.g. European standardisation organisation,  regional or continental organisation).  Relevant alternatives identified in Annex A are mostly related to the US NIST documents defining and providing  guidance on the use of cryptographic suites.  As cryptographic suites and their proper use is a key building blocks for all trust services, it is of utmost importance  that appropriate guidance on selection of cryptographic suites that would be applicable for implementation of  trust services and in particular qualified trust services under the eIDAS Regulation will be maintained over time to  ensure effective and appropriate security of these services.  Different countries set the minimum requirements on the cryptographic suites they recommend to be used. Some  examples of what countries like Japan and the U.S. are recommending.  CRYPTREC is the Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees set up by the Japanese Government to  evaluate and recommend cryptographic techniques for government and industrial use and the NSA Suite B  Cryptography is a set of cryptographic algorithms promulgated by the National Security Agency as part of its  Cryptographic Modernization Program  Some of the recommended standards are:   NIST series 800 on computer security such as  o NIST SP 800- 38, 56, 67, 133, etc.  o NIST FIPS series such as 140, 180, 197 and 198ISO/IEC 9798RFC 5759, Suite B Certificate and  Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile   RFCs:  o RFC 6239, Suite B Cryptographic Suites for Secure Shell (SSH)  o RFC 6379, Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec  o RFC 6460, Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)   IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standardization and the P1363 project is for  public-key cryptography). They´ve developed some standards such as:  o 1363-- IEEE Standard Specifications for Public-Key Cryptography. 2000.  As an example, the key length is an important security parameter. There´re recommendations and mathematical  formulas to approximate the minimum key size requirement for security. Bluekrypt26 compares the different  approaches and techniques and select the appropriate key length for the desired level of protection.  A list of these documents can be found in annex A.  3.3.2 Due diligence – risk analysis – information security management  The increasing corporate governance requirements have caused companies to examine and ensure that controls  are in place and operating effectively. Organizations are increasingly competing in the global marketplace, which is  governed by multiple laws and supported by various best practices and standards (i.e, ITIL, ISO 27000 family,  COSO, COBIT).  26 Bluekrypt (www.keylength.com)  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5759 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6239 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6379 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6460  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  40  Determination of which standards meet the organization´s needs must be driven by the security policies agreed  upon by management. The standards provide the specification of the technology to effectively enable the  organization to become successful in meeting the requirements of the policy.  Standards may also refer to guidelines established by standards organizations and accepted by management,  including organizations such as NIST, ISO, IEEE, ANSI, NSA and others.  A list of these documents can be found in annex A.  3.3.3 Security breach notification  It is crucial to improve the trustworthiness of this ecosystem to provide information to other interested parties on  security breaches to avoid or with the goal to learn from incidents and propose alternatives or fixes. This  information sharing among interested parties relating to possible enhanced risk from identified individuals,  entities, identities, locations, domains, IP addresses, and other data to be determined in order to allow or to  determine, whether to undertake additional steps to mitigate or solve.  This notification will consider issues such as legal limitations, privacy concerns, methods for updating or correcting  information, and other factors that may arise from such notification of a security breach.  ENISA has developed multiple recommendations in the area of breach notifications (for notifications under  Framework Directive Art. 13a, ePrivacy Directive Art.4, eIDAS Art.19).  In areas like cybersecurity, different non-EU governments like the U.S. publish acts on “antitrust policy on sharing  cybersecurity information”, which are U.S. related executive orders27.  27 Such us https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/12/fact-sheet-executive-order-promoting-private- sector-cybersecurity-inform , http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/executive-order-promoting- private-sector-cybersecurity-information-shari  https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/04/ftc-doj-issue-antitrust-policy-statement-sharing-cybersecurity https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/04/ftc-doj-issue-antitrust-policy-statement-sharing-cybersecurity https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/12/fact-sheet-executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-inform https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/12/fact-sheet-executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-inform http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-information-shari http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/13/executive-order-promoting-private-sector-cybersecurity-information-shari  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  41  The MITRE Corporation has released the TAXII project. TAXII is not an information sharing initiative or application  and does not attempt to define trust agreements, governance, or non-technical aspects of cyber threat  information sharing. Instead, TAXII empowers organizations to achieve improved situational awareness about  emerging threats, and enables organizations to easily share the information they choose with the partners they  choose. Additionally, the MITRE Corporation has also developed an XML schema called STIX.  There´s also, related to cyber threats, an alliance called the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA),  http://cyberthreatalliance.org/ which was founded in 2014, together with Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and  McAfee and a group of cybersecurity providers, to share threat information to improve defenses against advanced  cyber adversaries. The CTA adheres to strict guidelines that protect privacy and anonymize data, while at the same  time pooling a broad array of resources to fight cybercriminals.  Also, private companies are working on this notification and have developed some documents, for example,  Microsoft, which has announced its strategy publicly282930.  Some of these initiatives have been adopted by OASIS creating a technical committee on Cyber Threat Intelligence  (CTI) taking into account the STIX, TAXII, and CybOX cyber security specifications and will be advanced as  international standards by members of the OASIS consortium in a transition headed by the US Department of  Homeland Security  3.3.4 Issuing digital certificates  In cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic  document used to prove ownership of a public key. The certificate includes information about the key, information  about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are  correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they  can use that key to communicate with its owner.  Standards like IETF RFC 5280 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List  (CRL) Profile and ITU-t X.509 define a digital certificate  Another approach is the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27 WG4 initiative on TSP practices and its positioning against CEN/ETSI  framework documents:   14516-1, Guidelines for the use and management of Trust Service Providers – Part 1: Overview and  concepts;   14516-2, Guidelines for the use and management of Trust Service Providers – Part 2: Guidelines on  information security of PKI Trust Service Providers;   14516-3, Guidelines for the use and management of Trust Service Providers – Part 3: Guidelines on  provision of services by PKI Trust Service Providers  The expected goal of the work made at ISO/SC27is to identify key TSP component services that can be operated by  independent service providers for a TSP such as PKI service provider, dissemination service provider, registration  service provider, etc.  28 https://threatpost.com/microsoft-to-preview-interflow-information-sharing-platform/106798  29 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn750892.aspx  30 http://blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2014/06/23/microsoft-interflow-a-security-and-threat-information-exchange- platform-announced/  http://cyberthreatalliance.org/ https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  42  Best efforts will be made by editors of these documents to make these standards compatible with the ones from  ETSI (for instance including parts equivalent to EN 319 403 using ISO 17065 as the accreditation standard).  The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an  X.509 digital certificate. Initially it was defined in RFC 2560, X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure Online  Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP31  but has been updated to RFC 6960, X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure  Online Certificate Status Protocol - OCSP32. It was created as an alternative to certificate revocation lists (CRL),  specifically addressing certain problems associated with using CRLs in a public key infrastructure (PKI). Current  OCSP/CRL specifications are not sufficient and must be profiled to cover requirements from Art.24.3 and Art.24.4  of eIDAS Regulation.  Another specification of interest in this area is RFC 4806, Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Extensions to  IKEv233  3.3.5 Formats of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  The following ISO standard aims at helping business and governments to guarantee the long-term authenticity of  electronic signatures, increasingly used in e-commerce and e-government. It will also ensure the interoperability of  electronic signatures when the documents they authenticate are transferred and processed through different  information technology systems. The ISO standard is in two parts:   ISO 14533-1:2012, Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and  dministration – Long term signature profiles – Part 1: Long term signature profiles for CMS  Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)   ISO 14533-2:2012, Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and  administration – Long term signature profiles – Part 2: Long term signature profiles for XML  Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)  Klaus-Dieter Naujok, Chair of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 154 who developed the standard, commented: \"ISO  14533-1:2012 and ISO 14533-2:2012 provide a framework complying with the European Commission Mandate  M/460, as well as helping the work by UN/CEFACT on its current revision on Recommendation 14 (Authentication  of Trade Documents by Means Other than Signature), for guaranteeing interoperability and consumption of  messages regardless of the target platform. The new standards provide for long term protection of these  document formats that is not currently available.\"  ISO 14533-1:2012 and ISO 14533-2:2012 were developed by ISO/TC 154, Processes, data elements and documents  in commerce, industry and administration.  3.3.6 Generation of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  The OASIS Digital Signature Services (DSS) develops techniques to support the processing of digital signatures, such  as an interface for requesting that a web service produce and/or verify a digital signature.  The Digital Signature Services (DSS) specifications describe two XML-based request/response protocols: a signing  protocol and a verifying protocol. The DSS Core specifications provide the basic protocols and elements, upon  which other services can be built. For instance, the DSS-X Technical Committee has specified several profiles for  specific usages.  31 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560  32 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960  33 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4806  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4806 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4806  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  43  The OASIS committee on extended services for digital signatures (DSS-X34) develops new profiles for digital  signature services  3.3.7 Validation of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  The IETF defines other options for a validation services, called Data Validation and Certification Server (DVCS)  which is a public key infrastructure or PKI service providing data validation services, asserting correctness of  digitally signed documents, validity of public key certificates and possession or existence of data.  A Data Validation and Certification Server (DVCS) is a Trusted Third Party (TTP)35 providing data validation services,  asserting correctness of digitally signed documents, validity of public key certificates, and possession or existence  of data.  Services provided by a DVCS do not replace the usage of CRLs and OCSP36, as mentioned in clause 3.3.4, for public  key certificate revocation checking in large open environments, due to concerns about the scalability of the  protocol.  RFC 3029 \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Data Validation and Certification Server Protocols37  3.3.8 Preservation of digital/electronic signatures and/or seals  In library and archival science, digital preservation is a formal endeavor to ensure that digital information of  continuing value remains accessible and usable. The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of  authenticated content over time  To standardize digital preservation practice and provide a set of recommendations for preservation program  implementation, the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) was developed. OAIS is  concerned with all technical aspects of a digital object’s life cycle: ingest, archival storage, data management,  administration, access and preservation planning   Not only OASIS is developing standards on how to preserve this digital information, there are also  other entities promoting other documents such as   Design Criteria Standard For Electronic Records Management Software Applications   Electronic archiving - Part 1: Specifications concerning the design and the operation of an  information system for electronic information preservation   Space data and information transfer systems - Open archival information system (OAIS) - Reference  model   Information and documentation – Records management   PDF/A Specification   Data Preservation Systems Security; Part 1: Requirements for Implementation and Management   Policy requirements for trust service providers signing and/or storing data objects   Spécifications fonctionnelles d'un composant Coffre-Fort Numérique destiné à la conservation  d'informations numériques dans des conditions de nature à en garantir leur intégrité dans le temps   Evidence Record Syntax  34 https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dss-x  35 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_third_party  36 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol  37 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3029  https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dss-x https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAIS  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  44  It´s also necessary to assess these services, for what ISO defined an standard on audit and Certification of  Trustworthy Digital Repositories (ISO 16363:2012), developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data  Systems (CCSDS), which was approved as a full international standard in March 2012  3.3.9 Time stamps and their issuance  A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself. In many  cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered  into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.  This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and  tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual  data is called timestamping. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping  ISO 8601 standardizes the representation of dates and times. These standard representations are often used to  construct timestamp values.  There are many timestamping schemes with different security goals:   PKI-based – timestamp token is protected using PKI digital signature.   Linking-based schemes – timestamp is generated such a way that it is related to other timestamps.   Distributed schemes – timestamp is generated in cooperation of multiple parties.   Transient key scheme – variant of PKI with short-living signing keys.   MAC – simple secret key based scheme, found in ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard.   Database – document hashes are stored in trusted archive; there is online lookup service for  verification.   Hybrid schemes – the linked and signed method is prevailing, see X9.95  Only the PKI covers the 3 of them, the RFC 3161, X9.95 and ISO/IEC 18014  According to the RFC 316138 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP), a trusted  timestamp is a timestamp issued by a trusted third party (TTP) acting as a Time Stamping Authority (TSA). It is used  to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records, …)  without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps. Multiple TSAs can be used to increase  reliability and reduce vulnerability.  The newer ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard39 for Trusted Time Stamps augments the RFC 3161 standard with data-level  security requirements to ensure data integrity against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party.  This standard has been applied to authenticating digitally signed data for regulatory compliance, financial  transactions, and legal evidence.  RFC 362840 Policy Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities (TSAs)  3.3.10 Electronic delivery services  The delivery of services, whether electronic or not, is one of the key goals of the UPU, the Universal Postal Union  (UPU), which is the second oldest international organization worldwide.  38 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3161  39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_ASC_X9.95_Standard  40 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3628  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  45  The UPU has developed some standards regarding interoperability aspects, the registered electronic mail, in  collaboration with CEN, etc.  S33 Interoperability framework for postal public key infrastructures:  The objective of this standard is to create a common Postal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to provide global  certification and security services aimed at globally binding the identity of individuals and organisations with their  public key. The framework itself and its first four elements (PKI structure, cryptographic algorithms, data formats  and data dissemination protocols) are included.  S52 Functional specification for postal registered electronic mail:  This standard defines the functional specification of a secure electronic postal service, referred to as the postal  registered electronic mail or PReM service. PReM provides a trusted and certified electronic mail exchange  between mailer, designated operators and addressee/mailee. In addition, evidence of corresponding events and  operations within the scope of PReM will be generated and archived for future attestation.  3.3.11 Supervision of services and certification of products  Supervision of services:  Considering the work done by the European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), there is a need to adopt the  implementing acts Art.20.4 to support the EA proposed model for CAB accreditation and QTSs/QTSPs evaluation of  conformity as well as to cover the missing part to that model i.e. the applicable “QTS/QTSP audit criteria” as  discussed in section 2.2.  Certification of products:  Security assessment of an IT product is done through the security evaluation of the product. That evaluation  should be made by a certification body, itself accredited by some authority. The Common Criteria evaluation  scheme (http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/), for instance, is organized in this way.  ISO 15408 defines a framework for the IT evaluation of IT security products.  Besides the Common Criteria evaluation model, the use of Regulation 765/2008 model should be assessed as well.  It is also applicable to the certification of products and a comparable model to the one developed to accredit CABs  to certify and confirm compliance of QTS/QTSPs to the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation could be  developed similarly for certification of products against appropriate criteria (be it evaluated and certified PPs).  Criteria for products – Protection profiles:  TSP and end-users will rely on IT products, either software or hardware (cryptographic modules, USB tokens…) to  store, create, validate or preserve (signed or sealed) data. Directive 1999/93/EC mentioned such requirement for  “secure signature creation devices”, but the eIDAS Regulation has broadened the concept “qualified signature/seal  creation devices”. The eIDAS Regulation allows server (remote) qualified signature, that is in fact a kind of  electronic service on-line requiring authentication (use of electronic mean of authentication), as well as remote  identity verification using an eID (art. 24.1.(b)). Therefore security assessment of such elements may fall in the  scope of interest of QTSP.  It is believed (expected) that CEN PPs developed under the CEN/ETSI framework for standardization of signatures  will be natural candidates as criteria for being referenced as criteria against which “qualified signature/seal  creation devices” must be certified as compliant with the provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  46  3.3.12 Formats of documents for which a digital/electronic signature or seal may be required  Protocols and format commonly used for documents include the following:   S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)   XML (Extensible Markup Language), and its variant that include:  o ebXML (electronic business XML)  o “AS4 Profile of ebMS 3.0\" from OASIS submitted to ISO  o ISO 20022: standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions (i.e. electronic  funds transfers). It describes a metadata repository containing descriptions of messages and  business processes, and a maintenance process for the repository content. The repository contains  a huge amount of financial services metadata that has been shared and standardized across the  industry. The metadata is stored in UML models with a special ISO 20022 UML Profile. Underlying  all of this is the ISO 20022 metamodel - a model of the models. The UML (Unified Modeling  Language) profile is the metamodel transformed into UML. The metadata is transformed into the  syntax of messages used in financial networks. The first syntax supported for messages was XML  Schema. ISO 20022 is widely used in financial services and adopted as SEPA format for storing &  processing transactions.   PDF  o ISO 32000 – Document management – Portable document format  o SR 003 032 on the Printable Representations of Electronic Signatures  3.3.13 Other initiatives  Beyond international standardization committees, there are numerous attempts to implement technical or  organisational answers to the need for trust services such as digital identity, signature or transactions. Where no  binding legal framework exists, particular requirements and specifications are usually issued by an authoritative  body (professional order/association, steering committee, workgroups, etc.) to ensure interoperability of solutions  and responsibilities of involved actors.  However, such ad hoc solutions tend to be limited to a specific domain and their reusability outside it can be  difficult, if not impossible, to assess. The following initiatives were thus selected as they address a sufficiently large  scope.  3.3.13.1 xDTM & SafeBiopharma (U.S.)  In the U.S., the xDTM Standard Association41 (an independent non-profit organization) is on its way to define and  advance requirements (the xDTM Standard), and create the framework for an associated certification program to  ensure open, secure digital transactions. In the same spirit as the e-IDAS Regulation, the xDTM self-defined  objective is to define an interoperable and widely accepted standard. The term Digital Transaction Management  (DTM) denotes a category of cloud services that would enable companies to manage their document-based  transactions digitally with the same legal value and acknowledgement as they have with paper-based transactions.  First experiments with digital signatures in the U.S. originated in the pharmaceutical industry (http://www.safe- biopharma.org/overview.htm) and has achieved some success in that domain. The xDTM initiative seems to  broaden the scope of the project in the same way that the e-IDAS Regulation expanded the 1999/93/EC Directive:  digital signatures and identities become means to new digital services (digital transactions).  41 www.xdtm.org  http://www.safe-biopharma.org/overview.htm http://www.safe-biopharma.org/overview.htm http://www.xdtm.org/  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  47  The xDTM Association has not yet released any standard.  3.3.13.2 e-SENS (Electronic Simple European Networked Services)  e-SENS is a large-scale project to provide an easy access to public European administration and services online, and  ensure interoperability across different national systems. Several European projects are part of this initiative:   SPOCS (Simple Procedures Online for Cross-Border Services, http://www.eu-spocs.eu) uses the solution for the  cross border use of natural persons eID developed by STORK. Furthermore it also builds on document  transport concepts developed by STORK. It has used the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) concept of PEPPOL for  document containers and has generalized it into a container format for eDocuments (OCD) to package  company information for transmission to Points of Single Contact in other countries.   e-CODEX (e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange, http://www.e-codex.eu) will build on and make  necessary changes to deliverables from SPOCS and the other pilots in order to meet its objectives of improving  the cross-border access of citizens and businesses to legal means in Europe as well as to improve the  interoperability between legal authorities within the EU.   PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online, http://www.peppol.eu) has developed and implemented  technology standards for European governmental public electronic procurement.   STORK (Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed, http://www.eid-stork.eu) aims at establishing a European eID  Interoperability Platform that will allow citizens to establish new e-relations across borders, just by presenting  their national eID. This platform allows European citizens to log in to public services of other Member States  using the eID technology of their home country.  Currently, STORK 2.0 extends its scope to mandates and representation (e.g. of legal entities) and advances from  eGovernment to private sector applications (http://www.eid-stork2.eu).  http://www.eu-spocs.eu/ http://www.e-codex.eu/ http://www.peppol.eu/ http://www.eid-stork.eu/ http://www.eid-stork2.eu/  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  48  4. Mapping and analysis  Description of methodology  The following section contain mappings between the eIDAS requirements as identified in chapter 2 and the  currently available standards as listed in the inventory in chapter 3 of this document.  The mapping is oriented at  the requirements specified in the different eIDAS articles.  In order to understand the meaning of the mapping and in order to apply the mapped standards in a proper way,  the following should to be considered:   The mapping indicates which standard  allows to meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The  mentioned standards usually only cover a part of the eIDAS requirements (the explanation will be  given further in the text).   In some cases the eIDAS Regulation articles laying down requirements for TSPs, TS’s, QTSP’s or QTS’s  allows for referencing standards (among other documents), either through direct reference or  potentially via specifications established  by the European legislator. Compliance with these  referenced standards will provide a legal presumption of compliance with the associated legal  provisions.   It should be noted that this legal presumption compliance referencing mechanism is not complete in  the Regulation in the sense that it does not cover all the provisions applicable to TSP/TS or QTSP/QTS  but to a part of them.   Furthermore, in practice, it might be rather unlikely at this moment in time, that a standard or a set of  standards are available which have been developed especially in order to serve all the different eIDAS  articles requirements applicable to all types of TSP/TS or QTSP/QTS. Again, the adequacy of the  standards to the articles' requirements can at best be partial.   Some of the standards content was compiled before the eIDAS Regulation had been released. The  content therefore could not cover all of its requirements. In such case, the adequacy of the standards  to the articles' requirements can at best be partial.   In any case, the eIDAS Regulation \"should be technology-neutral\" (recital 27). Thus, even if the  hereafter identified standards were to be mentioned in future delegated/implementing acts,  compliance with the Regulation could alternatively also be achieved through other implementations,  based upon other standards or based upon best practices. In case of a Qualified Service according to  the eIDAS requirements, the suitability and coverage of such an alternative solution to meetl the eIDAS  requirements will have to be judged by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) issuing a corresponding  Conformity Assessment Report (CAR).  The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, establish reference number of standards (Art.20.4 (a))  for  the accreditation of the conformity assessment bodies and for the conformity assessment report referred to in  Art.20.1 and for (Art.20.4.(b)) for auditing rules under which conformity assessment bodies will carry out their  conformity assessment of the qualified trust service providers as referred to in Art.20.1. The standards based  accreditation system the European cooperation for accreditation (EA) is currently establishing is however not  addressing the standardization of the “QTSP/QTS audit criteria” against which the QTSP/QTS compliance with all  the applicable provisions of the eIDAS Regulation will be assessed is missing. This is specifically addressed in  section 4.3.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  49  ETSI/CEN Framework - Trust service related standards mapping and analysis  4.2.1 Standards covering general TSP operations related requirements  4.2.1.1 Requirements common to all TSPs  Implementing acts foreseen in Art.19(4) do not limit the legislative power of the European Commission to simply  refer to standards that would have been assessed as allowing compliant implementations to meet the specific  covered requirements and hence granting such compliant implementations a legal presumption of compliance  with these requirements.  The Commission may through such acts:   (Art.19(4)a) specify the due diligence technical and organisational measures TSPs must implement to  manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide (Art.19(1)).   (Art.19(4)b) define the formats and procedures, including deadlines, applicable for the purpose of security  and personal data breach notifications by TSPs and QTSPs (Art.19(2)).  As already stated in section 2.3.1, the initiative of ENISA on security breach notifications (SBN) may make the  adoption of the related implementing act under art.19.4 of eIDAS Regulation unnecessary. ENISA is currently  developing technical guidelines to facilitate the implementation of article 19 of eIDAS Regulation. Once completed,  these guidelines would be available to stakeholders for voluntary adoption, and be subject to regular revision (as it  has been the case of these related to article 13a of the e-communication Framework Directive).  The following table however is analysing the relevance of the ETSI EN 319 4x1 standard in addressing the  requirements common to all TSPs as these requirements are identified through the reference to the corresponding  article of the eIDAS Regulation (first column). The second column provides, when applicable, a reference to  foreseen implementing acts. The third column identifies the standard(s) being candidate for allowing implementer  meeting the requirements (or standards referenced by primarily considered standard) for which the publication  status is given in the fourth column. The last column provides the results of the assessment/analysis on whether  the identified standard actually correctly address the requirement identified in the first column. The content of this  last column can be limited to the identification of the standard clause addressing the requirement; when no  addition comment is made it is assessed to allow addressing correctly the requirement.

There is no specific ETSI standard dedicated to address requirements on due diligence technical and organisational  measures that TSPs must implement to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide or  requirements on the formats and procedures, including deadlines, applicable for the purpose of security and  personal data breach notifications by TSPs.  Both these types of requirements are however addressed in documents addressing specific types of trust service  provider and trust services, requiring any potential referencing process to point to a long list of specific clauses  from a combination of specific documents. Furthermore only TSP issuing (qualified) certificates and TSP issuing  (qualified) time-stamps related standards are currently available.  4.2.1.2 Requirements common to all QTSPs  Requirements common to all QTSPs are these requirements applicable to all TSPs (see table in section 4.2.1.1)  together with the requirements listed in the following table.

Clause 6.3.9 referring to EN 319  411-1 corresponding clause 6.3.9.  Note: Instead of issuing a new  QSCD, the QTSP might want to  certify public keys originating from  QSCD already in the hand of a user  or operated I accordance with  Annex II.3. In such a case the QTSP  has to ensure by appropriate means  that the public key corresponds to a  private key that is truly residing in a  certified QSCD, before issuing the  certificate (Art.3(12)). This is  expected to be covered by EN 319  411-2 clauses 6.5.1(c), 6.5.2(a),  6.3.5(b), and 6.3.12  28(5)  38(5)  28(6)  38(6)  Temporary suspension of QC for  electronic seals and for electronic  signatures may be specified on a  national basis: Assessment to be  made on an ad-hoc national basis.  38(3)  Note: Also applying to QC for WSA  when special case of QC for  electronic seals – Recital (65)  38(4)  Note: Also applying to QC for WSA  when special case of QC for  electronic seals – Recital (65)  ETSI EN 319 412 is expected to cover sufficient requirements to ensure QTSPs issuing QCs to meet the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. However with regards to compliance with Art.24.3 and Art.24.4, it is  believed that EN 319 411-2 does not include sufficient provisions with regards to the CRL and OCSP profile and  creation process in order to meet the requirements of these articles.

The ETSI/CEN TS 102 023 standard, which is currently used for the certification of  timestamping authorities, was updated under the M460 mandate, and split in two standards.   ETSI EN 319 421 is a natural candidate for enforcing good security practices and correct time-management  of a timestamping authority ; ANSSI RGS A5 strengthens it but contains some French-specific requirements  that may not be compatible with the actual practices in other countries.   Conforming to the ETSI EN 319 422 ensures the binding of the date and time to data in the produced  timestamps.  ANSSI DCSSI-PP 2008/07 is currently the only evaluated Common Criteria protection profile for a timestamping  system. The prCEN/TS 419231 protection profile is currently under evaluation.

Moreover, REM systems may forward messages to  \"regular e-mail\" services, hence \"unqualified\" services providers.  UPU : That point is not addressed in the standards. In particular, issues regarding \"cross-border scenarios\" are  explicitely not covered.  (b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : In the standards, \"choice of the authentication mechanism is left to the [trust service  provider]\". Specific requirements must hence be added to correctly reflect these of the eIDAS Regulation.  UPU : Same situation (\"The act of physically authenticating individual calls to a SePS is outside the scope of this  specification\").  (c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : That point is covered in the functional working of the protocol.  UPU : idem.  (d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic signature or an advanced electronic seal  of a qualified trust service provider in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the data being changed  undetectably;  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  60  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : the standards only \"assume the usage of at least an Advanced Electronic Signature […]  issued with a Secure Signature Creation Device\", in the sense of the EU Directive 1999/93/EC. Hence, this standard  does not require such a signature, strictly speaking.  UPU : The standards contain no requirement on the level of the signatures.  (e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data is clearly indicated to the sender  and addressee of the data;  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : That point is not addressed in the standards.  UPU : idem.  However, that point could be deemed unapplicable to these standards, which do not consider that one could alter  the sent data in any way.  (f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by a qualified electronic time  stamp.  ETSI/CEN TS 102 640 : That point is not addressed in the standards.  UPU : The electronic PostMark is a \"superset of a standard timestamp\", and several European post services are  already providing ETSI 102 023-certified services.  Overall, the existing standards are technical and were written before any existing regulation. It is not surprising,  then, that they do not try to strongly enforce specific properties. In particular, they contain very few strict  requirements on the services.  Future ETSI standardisation work on electronic registered delivery services will leverage on the existing multipart  TS 102 640 series addressing standardisation of registered electronic mail (REM) and align these specifications to  the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 on electronic registered delivery services. Effective production  of such REM specifications and more general specifications addressing all other types of electronic registered  delivery services has not been planned yet and is likely not to finalised in 2016.  The standards could be used as a basis for a technical definition of the qualified electronic registered delivery  services, under additional requirements (service profiles) covering the above elements. For instance, the  requirement that sent data must be signed/sealed according to (d).  4.2.1.8 Requirements for QTSPs providing qualified certificates for website authentication  Article Standard Status Comment  45(2) Baseline requirements for the issuance and  management of publicly-trusted certificates (CAB  Forum CAB BR)  Published Partial (see below)  45(2) EV SSL certificate guidelines (CAB Forum CAB EVSSL) Published Partial (see below)  45(2) Guidance for Auditors and CSPs on ETSI TS 102 042  for Issuing Publicly-Trusted TLS/SSL Certificates (ETSI  TR 103 123)  Published Guidance document for  auditors (but much lower  Assurance scope than  expected in eIDAS  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  61  Article Standard Status Comment  45(2) Technical report TR 101 564 on guidance on ETSI TS  102 042 for issuing EV certificates for auditors and  CSPs  Published Intended to be used by  auditors as a guidance to  assess the compliance of a  CA according to TS 102 042  and for the CA to clarify  the requirements  Partial coverage: The CAB Forum documents are an industrial standard on the Internet, used by all the mainstream  web browsers, but their requirements, which aim at strongly ensuring a site’s identity and that of its owner, do not  fully match these of a « qualified certificate for website authentication », as defined in the eIDAS Regulation.

Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  63  The main issue with (a) is that \"trustworthiness\" is an abstract notion, which corresponds, in practice, to different  properties for different trust services. There are thus two possible solutions that are not necessarily exclusive.  First, implementing acts could refer to generic security practices, applicable to all TSPs, such as ETSI EN 319 401 or  ISO/IEC 27001:2013. Second, implementing acts could refer to specific standards, depending on each trust service,  such as protection profiles for signature services.  Candidate standards for referencing by Art.24(a) are:  - prCEN/EN 419 221 - PP for TSP cryptographic modules, in particular its Part 5 PP for cryptographic modules  for TSPs, aimed at being aligned with eIDAS Regulation.  - prCEN/EN 419 231 PP for trustworthy systems supporting time stamping.  - prCEN/EN 419 241 security requirements and PP’s for trustworthy systems supporting server signing.  - prCEN/TS 419 261 (was prTS 419 221-1, was prTS 14167-1) - Security requirements for Trustworthy  Systems (incl. Managing Certificates for Electronic Signatures).  While no standard has been identified as candidate for being referenced under Art.24(b), it could be expected that  prCEN/TS 419 261 could include provisions for trustworthy systems to meet Art.24(2)f requirements.  4.2.2.2 QSCD  Article Standard Status Comment  29(2)  39(2)  Application interfaces for secure signature creation  devices - Parts 1-5 (CEN EN 419 212)  Published Partial (see below)  29(2)  39(2)  Protection profiles for secure signature creation  devices – Parts 1-6 (CEN EN 419 211)  Published Partial (see below)  29(2)  39(2)  Protection profiles for TSP Cryptographic modules –  Part 1-5 (CEN EN 419 221)  Draft  (part 5 is a CEN  prEN 419 221-5)  Partial (see below)  29(2)  39(2)  Trustworthy systems supporting server signing  (signature generation services) - Parts 1-3 (CEN EN  419 241)  Draft  (TS 419241 is  published)  Partial (see below)  Annex II on qualified electronic signature/seal creation device require \"by appropriate technical and procedural  means\", that:  1.[…] such device ensures:  (a) the confidentiality of the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation is reasonably  assured;  (b) the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation can practically occur only once;  (c) the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation cannot, with reasonable assurance,  be derived and the electronic signature is reliably protected against forgery using currently available technology;  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  64  These properties are fully addressed in the protection profiles for cryptographic module and signature devices  (CEN EN 419 211, CEN EN 419 221). Common Criteria and FIPS PUB security evaluation have been successfully used  for SSCD for several years now, and the eIDAS Regulation is no reason for change on this matter.  (d) the electronic signature creation data used for electronic signature creation can be reliably protected by the  legitimate signatory against use by others.  2. Qualified electronic signature creation devices shall not alter the data to be signed or prevent such data from  being presented to the signatory prior to signing.  These requirements are addressed in the standards on signature creation applications (CEN EN 419 212 and CEN  EN 419 241).  3. Generating or managing electronic signature creation data on behalf of the signatory may only be done by a  qualified trust service provider.  That requirement is purely procedural and cannot be addressed in a standard.  4. Without prejudice to point (d) of point 1, qualified trust service providers managing electronic signature creation  data on behalf of the signatory may duplicate the electronic signature creation data only for back-up purposes  provided the following requirements are met:  (a) the security of the duplicated datasets must be at the same level as for the original datasets;  This point is addressed as 1.(a)-(c) in the protection profiles for cryptographic modules and other ETSI standards.  (b) the number of duplicated datasets shall not exceed the minimum needed to ensure continuity of the service.  That requirement is purely procedural and cannot be addressed in a standard.

These requirements are thus not  addressed. However, the qualified status of the signature’s certificates is considered among the available  constraints.  ETSI TS 119 102-1: not addressed in the standard.  (c) the signature validation data corresponds to the data provided to the relying party;  (d) the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is correctly provided to the relying party;  (e) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated to the relying party if a pseudonym was used at the time of  signing;  (g) the integrity of the signed data has not been compromised;  (h) the requirements provided for in Article 26 were met at the time of signing [the signature is an advanced  signature].  ETSI/CEN TS 102 853, ETSI TS 119 102-1: these checks are covered in the standard.  2.

In these standards, the signature are \"advanced\" in  the sense that they are technically more complex than the \"basic\" signatures formats they extend, and that they  ensure more evolved security properties (long-term duration of electronic signatures, timestamping, etc.).  Requirements on advanced electronic signature are defined in article 26:  (a) [must be] uniquely linked to the signatory;  (b) [must be] capable of identifying the signatory;  (d) [must be] linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is  detectable.  Practically, these requirements are enforced by the \"advanced\" signature formats: the link with the signer and  his/her identity come from the digital certificate, and the integrity-protected link between signature and signed  data, from cryptographic methods.  42 The term \"advanced electronic signature\" in these standards has absolutely no relationship with the notion used y  the eIDAS Regulation  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  68  (c) [must be] created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of  confidence, use under his sole control;  That requirement is not directly addressed by signature profiles. Indirectly, through the use of qualified certificate  attributes specified in the \"advanced\" standards, however, it is possible to determine that an electronic signature  has been made using a SSCD, which is a sufficient condition for (c) to be met (see below); but this only applies to a  specific kind of electronic signatures.  As with \"trustworthy systems\", condition (c) seems difficult to technically characterize using standards; audits and  case-by-case assessment are more relevant with such requirement.  4.2.3 Standards covering other requirements  4.2.3.1 Trusted Lists  The current technical specifications of the EU Member State national trusted lists are defined by CD 2009/767/EC  as amended and currently rely on ETSI TS 119 612 v1.1.1.  The technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists pursuant to Article 22(5) of Regulation (EU) No  910/2014 are laid down in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1505 of 8 September 2015 (OJ L 235,  9.9.2015, p26-36). CID 2015/1505/EU relies on TS 119 612 v2.1.1 for establishing such specifications.  Additional standards (see section 3.2.7 – Table 7) could support the correct management of trusted lists (ensuring  interoperability and correct practices for TL managers), but this is actually mostly outside the scope of the  implementing acts.  4.2.3.2 QTSPs/QTSs conformity assessment bodies accreditation, assessment report and auditing  rules  Considering the work done at the level and by European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), there is a need for  adopting Art.20.4 implementing acts to legitimate the EA proposed model for CAB accreditation and QTSs/QTSPs  evaluation of conformity as well as to cover the missing part to that model i.e. the applicable “QTS/QTSP audit  criteria” as discussed in section 2.2.  Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers  Version 1.1  |  June 2016  69  5. Conclusions – identified gaps  Based on the mapping between the requirements of eIDAS and the analysis of existing standards, it can be  concluded that the European Norms will be good candidates for meeting several requirements covered by  foreseen implementing acts, at least those regarding compliance with Annex I, III and IV. Some of the standards  only cover a part of a requirement – and these parts might also only be covered partly (like requirements for  QTSPs providing validation or preservation services). Some others cover a variety of different matters addressed by  various eIDAS articles (e.g. new norms EN 319 431 and EN 319 432).  Some of the standards are not yet available and it is still too early to assess them.  Existing standards can be endorsed for being used within the frames of eIDAS Regulation, to the extent presented  in the previous sections.  Considering the work done at the level and by European cooperation for Accreditation (EA), It might be considered  to adopt in the future the implementing acts set in article 20(4) to legitimate the EA proposed model for CAB  accreditation as well as to cover the applicable “QTS/QTSP audit criteria” to be developed in an “outcome based”  model as discussed in section 2.2.  The analysis also led, however, to a shortlist of gaps, where specific eIDAS requirement are not yet covered by EU  standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC).  Area of open issue  Open standard (draft or even not yet drafted) or description of  open issue  QTSPs providing validation services General requirements on testing compliance and interoperability  of signature creation and validation (ETSI TS 119 104)  ISO and ETSI/CEN standards exist for data preservation services.

    "abstract": "This report on one hand analyses the eIDAS requirements with regard to the standards, on the other analyses currently available standards and compares the results of both analyses. Such a mapping is oriented at the requirements specified in the various eIDAS articles. Pursuant to this mapping it can be concluded that usually the analysed standards usually cover some requirements in part or whole. Existing standards can be endorsed for being used within the frames of eIDAS Regulation, to the extent as presented in the previous sections. The analysis presented in this report led, however, to a shortlist of gaps, where specific eIDAS requirements have yet to be addressed in EU standards (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC) or international ones."

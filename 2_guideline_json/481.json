It encompasses use cases such as telematics,  connected infotainment or intra-vehicular communication. The report excludes Car-to-car as well as  autonomous vehicles as these technologies are not in use today. Practices discussed in this report concern  not only passenger cars but also commercial vehicles (such as busses, coaches etc) and aim to map the  current threats that passengers and drivers are exposed every day to. The goal is to secure smart cars today  for safer autonomous cars tomorrow.  Over the last few years, there have been a number of publications on attacks targeting automotive systems,  and in particular smart cars. An attack on a smart car would threaten the safety and privacy of passengers  and other citizens. These threats are already having a big impact on car manufacturers, with millions of cars  being recalled because of their vulnerability, not to mention the effects of the widespread media coverage  of the issues.  The objective of this study is to identify good practices that ensure the security of smart cars against cyber  threats, with the particularity that smart cars’ security shall also guarantee safety. The study lists the  sensitive assets present in smart cars, as well as the corresponding threats, risks, mitigation factors and  possible security measures to implement. To obtain this information, experts in the fields and areas related  with smart cars were contacted to gather their know-how and expertise. These exchanges led to three  categories of good practices: Policy and standards, Organizational measures, and Security functions.  The protection of smart cars depends on the protection of all systems involved (cloud services, applications,  car components, maintenance and diagnostic tools, etc.). However, the challenge resides mostly today in  the security of car components and aftermarket products, where security functions have to be implemented  in spite of several kinds of limitations: for example, security requirements may conflict with safety  requirements. Furthermore, the very large number of interfaces to secure may lead to planning and cost  issues; eventually, the long life of cars may create the need for dedicated security requirements.  The impact of attacks on a smart car has far-reaching consequences in terms of safety. The risk to the driver,  their passengers and other users of the road makes it a matter of national and European interest. For this  purpose, the following recommendations have been developed:  Recommendations for smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors:   Improve cyber security in smart cars. The industry actors should establish the good practices that  effectively enhance the security of their products.   Improve information sharing amongst industry actors. Information sharing helps industry actors  challenge the relevance of their security mechanisms according to field information. Communities for  information sharing already exist, and we recommend pursuing this effort.   Improve exchanges with security researchers and third parties. Industry actors should enhance their  contacts with third parties, especially from the security domain.  Recommendation for smart car manufacturers, tiers, aftermarket vendors and insurance companies:   Clarify liability among industry actors. Living in heavily-tiered environment, industry actors should  define processes to clarify their respective liability in case that security issues arise.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  07  Recommendation for industry groups and associations:   Achieve consensus on technical standards for good practices. The good practices listed in this report  are meant as an input for a standardization effort, rather than being directly applicable to a specific car  design. The details of the security requirements should be defined in the context of standards.   Define an independent third-party evaluation scheme. The existing safety standards for automotive  systems only marginally address security, and we recommend to define an independent evaluation  scheme.  Recommendation for industry groups and associations and security companies:   Build tools for security analysis. Industry actors can directly improve their security testing skills by  building tools for security testing and security monitoring.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  08  1. Introduction  Smart Cars integrate Internet of Things (IoT) components to bring added-value services to drivers and  passengers. These components communicate with each other and with the outside of the car (other cars,  external services).  Over the last few years, there have been many publications on attacks on automotive systems. A few of  them have been particularly under the eye of media, resulting in reputational damage for car manufacturers,  especially since several attacks were demonstrated as cheap and easy, as in the example of a teenager  unlocking and starting remotely a connected car1 with only $15 of simple electronics gear.  Beside reputational damage, the cost of cyber security is becoming an issue for car manufacturers.2 In the  past years, vulnerabilities were found and resulted in an ever increasing number of recalls:   Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek made a spectacular proof-of-concept of remote attacks by taking  control of a Jeep and sending it off-the-road3, forcing 1.4 million cars to be recalled;   Security researchers hacked the BMW ConnectedDrive4 and managed to remotely unlock cars, with  even more industrial impact than the Miller/Valasek hack (2.2 million cars had to be recalled);   More recently, even more vehicles (including most Volkswagen cars produced since 1995) have been  shown vulnerable to an attack on remote keyless entry5, thus once again increasing the size of  impacted fleet. This last issue marked a steep progression of the number of potentially affected cars,  which is in the order of magnitude of 100 million vehicles6.  Yet another example is the recent hack of Tesla electric cars7, requiring a software update for the car  operating system.  These threats have impacts on the security, the safety and the privacy of the passengers and of other  citizens.  The objective of this study is to identify the good practices to ensure the security of smart cars against cyber  threats, with the particularity that Smart Cars security shall also guarantee safety.  Objectives and scope  This study presents an analysis of the current situation in smart cars and considers the key factors in play,  including: how connectivity changed the security model of cars, how the heavily-tiered car ecosystem can  manage these issues, and how can security be integrated in existing, safety-oriented, product lifecycles.  Therefore, the following objectives have been set:   Review and analyse the architecture and interfaces of smart cars;  1 See http://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2015/02/23/14-year-old-hacks-connected-cars-with-pocket-money/  2 Anthony Foxx, Secretary, U S Department of Transportation and Mary Barra, the chairwomen and CEO of General  Motors Company, stress the importance of these issues in a keynote talk at the Billington Cyber summit 2016  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sPC2qHkq8  3 See http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/  4 See http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive- 2540957.html  5 See http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/08/hackers-use-arduino-to-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/  6 The affected company producing around 10 million vehicles a year.  7 See http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37426442  http://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2015/02/23/14-year-old-hacks-connected-cars-with-pocket-money/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sPC2qHkq8 http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/ http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive-2540957.html http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive-2540957.html http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/08/hackers-use-arduino-to-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/ http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37426442  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  09   Study the car ecosystem actors and lifecycles;   List the main threats applicable to smart cars;   Collect good security practices;   Analyse, in relation to the identified good security practices, gaps in current implementations;   Explore limiting factors, impairments, constraints and potential incentives for the target audience to  deploy these measures.  Methodology  This study was carried out using a five-step methodology (shown in Figure 1) which begins at the initial  information gathering from official sources and experts in the field and ends in the development of a report  summarizing the findings and the recommendations to the target audience.  Figure 1: Methodology used to carry out the study  1. Identification of experts: the first step was to identify the experts in the field of smart cars security.  In order to obtain varied and well-balanced results, experts were selected from Manufacturers, tier- 1 and tier-2 suppliers, aftermarket product suppliers, academics, and other actors, such as  consulting companies, test and certification companies and governmental actors.  2. Desktop Research: initial research of already published documents in order to get as much  information about communication dependencies as possible. This notably allowed to:   Identify the assets and threats specific to smart cars through desktop research and interviews  with stakeholders in the smart cars domain;   Identify good practices to secure the critical assets (business and societal) from cyber threats   Analyse the most feared attack scenarios  1. Identification of  experts  2. Desktop  research  3. Collection of  experts and  stakeholders point  of view  4. Analysis  5. Conclusions and  recommendations  6. Workshop  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  10   Present the good practices in a practical way by showing how to overcome the selected end-to- end attack scenarios.  3. Collection of experts and stakeholders point of view: we engaged stakeholders through interviews  to understand the current status of security and their challenges. For that purpose, we developed a  questionnaire to understand the challenges and needs of car manufacturers and their suppliers;  4. Analysis: the fourth step was to analyse all the data obtained, including the results of the interviews,  gathering initial conclusions.  5. Conclusions and recommendations: the last step was to further analyse and contrast these results  with the experience of the consortium and external sources.  The study was validated with the stakeholders, through a review phase and a face-to-face validation  workshop. We also stayed updated with regard to the C-ITS Platform8 run by DG MOVE9, to synergize efforts.  Moreover input from the CARSEC10 expert group was used to finalize the deliverable.  EU Policy context  From a regulation point of view, few initiatives are specific to smart cars:   The European Parliament voted in 2015 to mandate the implementation of the eCall11 system in cars  commercialized after April 2018;   More generally, since smart cars consist of cyber-physical components, they are concerned by:   The General Data Protection Regulation12, replacing the Data Protection Directive13;   The Network and Information Security Directive (NIS)14, which will have an impact on cloud  services that may be associated with smart car components.  Other initiatives have been launched, independently from these regulations. In particular, the EU  Commission launched the AIOTI15 Alliance in 2015, in order to enhance the dialogue between actors  of the Internet of Things (IoT). An AIOTI workgroup is specifically dedicated to Smart Mobility, which  includes IoT use cases pertaining to the car industry.  A 2015 report16 from the AIOTI Smart Mobility workgroup may be used as an introduction to other  initiatives in Europe on this topic:   The European Technology Platform for Road Transport Research (ERTRAC)   Research and Development initiatives funded via Horizon 2020   The C-ITS Deployment Platform   The Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership (ECSEL)   The Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI)   Main standards developing Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs), alliances & open source  initiatives   FIWARE   An exploration of national or company initiatives  8 See http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en.htm  9 See http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm  10 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  11 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/ecall-time-saved-lives-saved  12 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG  13 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046  14 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/network-and-information-security-directive-co-legislators- agree-first-eu-wide-legislation  15 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti  16 See http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=11822  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/ecall-time-saved-lives-saved http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/network-and-information-security-directive-co-legislators-agree-first-eu-wide-legislation https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/network-and-information-security-directive-co-legislators-agree-first-eu-wide-legislation https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=11822  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  11  While most of them are strongly related to autonomous driving, several have to take into account  cybersecurity issues already present in today’s cars.  Target Audience  This report provides information on smart cars’ security including lifecycle (including the security  maintenance in the field) and business perspective (not focusing only on technical measures). Therefore, the  target audience is mostly Car manufacturers, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and Aftermarket suppliers.  1.4.1 Car Manufacturers  Car manufacturers design new cars and select their equipment according to marketing considerations.  Regarding manufacturing of the car itself, their role is mainly limited to the assembly of the various car  components provided by their suppliers. They provide to their supplier functional, safety and security  requirements for the components as well as qualification of the products.  They also have to take into account security, safety and privacy by design, especially since aftermarket  components may be added to the vehicle later by the user.  1.4.2 Tier-1 and Tier-2 suppliers  Car manufacturing is a heavily tiered ecosystem. Car manufacturers integrate components provided by  suppliers, which are labelled as “Tier-1”. While driving systems are usually a prerogative of the manufacturer  itself, Tier-1 suppliers may be in charge of manufacturing most of the components directly facing the final  user. From entertainment systems to car seats, a large part of the car cost may be associated to components  manufactured by Tier-1 suppliers.  While Tier-1 suppliers have direct contractual relationships with car manufacturers to provide car  components, the ecosystem also includes suppliers labelled as “Tier-2”. Tier-2 suppliers only have  contractual relationships with Tier-1 suppliers. They produce, for example, plastics, mechanical parts, molds,  electronic components or software.  Also some Tier-2 suppliers may also become Tier-1, for instance Operating System (OS) providers for the  multimedia system have direct contact with the car manufacturer to allow more control, customization or  monetization on the applications, or also secure components providers in order to propose personalization  or Over The Air (OTA) management services.  In some cases, the design of one single component may be shared between several parties. For example,  concerning a telematics platform, its hardware and operating system may be designed and manufactured  by a Tier-1 supplier, while the software application may be designed and uploaded by the car manufacturer.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  12  1.4.3 Aftermarket suppliers  Customers can also buy aftermarket products from other vendors; for example smart dongles used on the  OBD-II port, providing additional features to their car. More traditional aftermarket products may include  media players or third-party GNSS.  Structure of this document  This document contains the following sections:   Key aspects of the smart cars. This section details the typical architectures found in smart cars, as well  as the relationships between main actors of the ecosystem. It eventually lists the sensitive assets of  smart cars;   Threats. This section elaborates on the assets by listing the main threats on smart cars. Sample attacks  taken from the state-of-the-art are given as illustration of the way these threats can lead to car  compromising. Eventually, a few significant attacks are further detailed into Attack scenarios, to clarify  the different steps necessary for an attack, as well as the expected attack potential required for such  attack;   Key findings. This section describes the good practices able to mitigate the aforementioned attacks. It  also puts these good practices in perspectives by describing the current gaps and challenges for their  implementation, as well as the constraints and incentives for the actors of the ecosystem;   Recommendations intended to overcome gaps and challenges in the implementation of good practices;   Glossary and abbreviations  Further details are given in appendix:   Appendix A details the calculation of attack potentials used in the attack scenarios,   Appendix B gives further details on the good practices.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  13  2. Key aspects of the smart cars  Definition  In this study, we define Smart Cars as systems providing connected, added-value features in order to  enhance car users’ experience or improve car safety. It encompasses use cases such as telematics, connected  infotainment or intra-vehicular communication. Practices discussed in this report concern not only  passenger cars but also commercial vehicles (such as busses, coaches etc) and aim to map the current threats  that passengers and drivers are exposed every day to.  Even if different definitions of smart, connected cars can be found in the literature, no official all-accepted  definition exists. Here a indicative overview of the different definition so far: a first effort to define different  levels of automation for on-road vehicles is done in SAE J3016. Figure 2 illustrates the different levels of  automation for on road vehicles, as defined in SAE J3016. This study covers vehicles belonging to levels 1 to  3.  Another definition comes from the Amsterdam declaration17 which make a distinction between connected  cars (including cooperative driving: communication between vehicles and also with the infrastructure (C- ITS)) and automated driving (referring to the capability of a vehicle to operate and manoeuvre independently  in real traffic situations, using on-board sensors, cameras, associated software, and maps in order to detect  its surroundings). Following this definition, only connected cars are taken into account in the context of this  study.  This study excludes car-to-car as well as autonomous vehicles as these technologies are not in use today.  V2X18  interfaces are not taken into account in this report (in the sense of analysing their vulnerabilities or  defining explicit countermeasures), however the existence of V2X interfaces will be taken into account,  whenever it has an impact on the assets or threats to be considered.  The study encompasses use cases such as:   Telematics, used for example in the context of fleet management or geo-fencing;   Connected infotainment, which provides an integrated multimedia offer with potential added value  services (such as the access to an application store) and can access driving information (such as speed)  as well as control non-essential functions (such as air conditioning);   Intra-vehicular communication, where the infotainment connections can be shared with user devices,  typically by creating a hotspot within the vehicle.  17 See also https://english.eu2016.nl/binaries/eu2016-en/documents/publications/2016/04/14/declaration-of- amsterdam/2016-04-08-declaration-of-amsterdam-final-format-3.pdf  18 The notion of V2X encompasses Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-pedestrian  (V2P) use cases.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  14  Figure 2: Automation level of vehicles  Typical architecture and assets  We describe in this section the typical architecture of smart cars, and list the assets that can be distinguished  within such architectures. The architecture of subnetworks and protocols may vary from a vehicle to  another, therefore Figure 3 provides a high-level overview of such systems.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  15  Figure 3 : High-level architecture of a smart car  Most car architectures distinguish between different domains, interconnected by a central gateway, as  shown in Figure 3. Domains correspond to different, or sometimes independent, features of the car. All these  components may cause risks, should they be compromised. The impact of these risks may vary between  safety, security or privacy concerns.  For this reason, components of a smart car are described as assets and  require appropriate protection. Figure 4 hereafter lists a number of these assets. More details concerning  these assets, as well as some logical assets (Section 2.2.7), are given in the following sections.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  16  Figure 4 : Smart cars assets  We distinguish the components according to the following categories:   Powertrain control   Chassis control   Body control   Infotainment control   Communications control   Diagnostic and maintenance systems  2.2.1 Powertrain control  This domain is in charge of the chain between the energy source of the car and its transformation into  propulsion.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  17  ECUs and sensors  Modern cars are composed of many embedded Electronic Control Units (ECU) that control mechanical or  electronic systems of the vehicle19. While ECUs are different from one domain to another, here are a few  general explanations on the architecture of ECUs and TCUs (Telematics Control Units):   As other IoT systems, automotive devices often rely on the ARM platform for application processors  (other available architectures are Power, SH, V850, and TriCore)20. Processors for other usage may come  from many origins. However, due to the constrained operating environment in automotive  environments (temperature, humidity, lifetime), specific declinations of processors, not commercial- grade but automotive-grade, are used.   For increasing security, and in particular for vehicular communications, these systems may also rely on  a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a smart card core or a Hardware Security Module (HSM)21.   ECU/TCU applications may be written directly in assembly or rely on a specialized real-time operating  system, such as VxWorks (Wind River Systems), Integrity (Green Hills Software), or AUTOSAR.  Subnetwork  The powertrain subnetwork typically relies on the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol.  CAN22, an ISO standard since 1993, is by far the most well-known and popular bus, to which most of the ECUs  of the vehicles are connected. There may be several CAN buses in a vehicle, interconnected by a gateway,  to isolate the most critical functions (such as powertrain management) from the less critical (such as  multimedia). The traffic on this internal network varies from one solution to another; in some instances the  network can support several hundreds of messages per second; the CAN bus is a prominent example and  has been thoroughly studied by many researchers23.  CANs, as with other protocols described in this report, face issues related to bandwidth, scalability or  security; protocols such as Ethernet24, introduced in 2008, are, today, still limited to a subpart of the network  (multimedia, assisted driving…).  The FlexRey protocol (ISO 17458)25 is also being put in use starting from 2008.

ECUs and sensors  ECUs are similar to those found in the powertrain domains (see Section 2.2.1). They allow the control of  functions such as steering control, airbag control, braking systems, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems  (ADAS).  Subnetwork  The subnetwork typically relies on the CAN protocol (see Section 2.2.1), but also on protocols such as  FlexRay, or RF (e.g. for Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems). FlexRay, introduced in 2008, is faster than CAN  and designed for drive-by-wire applications which substitutes usual mechanical functions with software. .  Other components  This typically includes the steering and brakes, but also airbag, embedded cameras, rear-view mirrors, or  even windshield wipers.  2.2.3 Body control  The body control is in charge of the body, which means most of the time the passenger’s compartment and  trunk.  ECUs and sensors  ECUs are similar to those found in the powertrain domains (see Section 2.2.1). They allow passengers to  control various functions such as instrument cluster, climate control, or door locking.  Subnetwork  The subnetwork typically relies on the CAN (see Section  2.2.1), LIN/SAE J260226 (for door lock, air  conditioning, seat belts…), or RF protocols27 (Keyless/passive entry systems). LIN, a value-oriented variant of  CAN introduced in 2002, is based on a single wire, has simpler controllers and offers lower bandwidth.  Other components  This typically includes the dashboard display, air conditioning, but also the lights, direction or warning lights,  the doors, windows, seat belts, and even motorized or heating seats.  2.2.4 Infotainment control  This domain is generally separated from the remainder of the body. It includes navigation services,  communications (telephone, etc.) as well as entertainment services (head unit audio/video).  ECUs and sensors  26 LIN Network for Vehicle Applications http://standards.sae.org/j2602/1_201211/  27 Radio Frequency protocols include among others S-WAVE Smart Wave, Zigbee, Bluetooth low energy, Wi-Fi, IEEE  802.15.4,Z wave. RF modules are also commonly used in proprietary protocols, such as a car key fobs.  http://standards.sae.org/j2602/1_201211/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  19  ECUs are similar to those found in the powertrain domains (see Section 2.2.1). They allow passengers to  control various functions such as the Head unit for audio/video content, but also navigation, or interactions  with the user’s telephone. Services offered through this domain can vary greatly, for example:   Entertainment services (audio/video)   Internet access   Driving services such as traffic information, maps...   Additional services such as fleet management, digital tachograph, geo-fencing...28  These services cause infotainment ECUs to sometimes have specific architectures:  - For infotainment systems, operating systems from the mobile industry may also be used in ECUs  (Windows CE (phased out), Android, Tizen or WebOS)  - QNX is also used in systems dedicated to the integration of users’ smartphones into the vehicle  systems. For example, it is used in Apple Carplay and Android Auto technologies, which allows  the end-user to get the display of a mobile phone mirrored to the infotainment display, and grant  him access to its mobile applications.  - Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) and Linux Genivi are two open-source projects aimed to create  software solutions for automotive applications.  Subnetwork  The subnetwork typically relies on protocols such as MOST, but also on ad-hoc networks using Bluetooth or  Wi-Fi. Infotainment systems rely on wireless connectivity provided either by an embedded UICC or by an  end-user device (smartphone) connected by Bluetooth or with a USB cable. In addition, Ethernet can be used  to connect camera systems.  Other components  External media that are directly connected to the infotainment components, such as drives or phones,  should also be considered as an asset.  2.2.5 Communications control  This domain, contrarily to the previous ones, is not a subnetwork, but more frequently a set of  communication features offered by a Telematics control unit (TCU), acting as a gateway.  Gateways ECUs with Telematics and communications  The gateway provides both the connectivity and most of the security protections intended for the  communications (firewalling, authentication features…). It collects data from the various ECUs using one of  the vehicle data buses and provides Internet remote connectivity through an embedded GSM module or  using driver’s smartphone for instance. This unit is generally also coupled with a GNSS to obtain vehicle  positioning information. A number of use-cases that are leveraging TCU connectivity are:   Remote diagnostic (e.g. failure notifications, updating ECU SW/FW or ECU parameters)   Remote transmission of vehicle data   Crash reporting and emergency warning (eCall, that will be mandatory in Europe in 2018)   Stolen vehicle tracking or geo-fencing   Remote engine start  28 Depending on the vehicle architecture, these services can be can be spread differently, for instance as part of the  Telematics Gateway ECU (next section).  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  20   Fleet management, for instance for rental car companies (for example for trip tracking or diagnosis)   Insurance, for pay-as-you-drive insurance plans   “smart driving assistant” (e.g. for fuel efficiency or to improve driving habits)   Inform driver on the battery State of Charge (SoC) for Electric Vehicles (EV)   Eco-driving   Big Data applications  External communication networks  The TCU typically provides 3G or Wi-Fi connectivity to provide several kinds of services, for example eCall,  but also V2X communication29. Other protocols are possible, as shown in Figure 5 hereafter, which gives an  example of external interfaces found in a smart car. These typically include interfaces intended for long  range communication, as well as wired or wireless interfaces intended for local use.  Figure 5 : An example of external interfaces of a smart car  Besides wired protocols such as USB or diagnostics, TCUs often provide various wireless protocols, as  detailed hereafter.  Long-range wireless protocols  29 As already mentioned in section 2.1, we take into account V2X interfaces even if V2X is not addressed as a use case  in this report.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  21  Telematics also rely on wireless connectivity30 provided either by a directly embedded UICC or the driver’s  cell phone.  Mobile protocols such as GSM/GPRS/3G/4G/UMTS/LTE may be used in a variety of contexts, but  the most prominent are the eCall service and the capacity of providing OTA updates to car component  firmware. Smart cars also use GNSS as part of their localization features. Protocols (such as LoRa and SIGFOX)  used nowadays for IoT protocols solutions could also be used by automobile in the future.  Intra-vehicle wireless protocols  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are frequently provided as a protocol of choice for intra-vehicular communication,  although the state-of-the-art suggests possible alternatives, such as ZigBee, Passive RFID, UWB or 60 GHz  mm Wave31. Usually, communication costs for the TCU are supported by the car manufacturer, whereas they  are supported by the end-user for the infotainment. Wireless protocols are also used in two different  contexts:   Near-range to relatively long-range protocols can be used for communication with sensors, for example  DASH7, used for Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)   Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection may be used, but mostly to communicate with smartphones, using  dedicated protocols32. The next type of components to benefit from such interfaces to the vehicles  seems to be wearables and smart home devices33. Such effort is already started in the context of the  Open Connectivity foundation project34.  Inter-vehicle, or Vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless protocols  Inter-vehicle communications use a specific band allocated for ITS communication (5.9 GHz Band, called  DSRC). Such communications typically use protocols such as   WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments), which is a mode of operation used by IEEE 802.11- compliant devices to operate in the DSRC band;   DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications), not to be mistaken with the DSRC Band, which is a  standard based on IEEE 802.11a;   IEEE 802.11p, which is based on the same ASTM Standard E2213-03 as DSRC.  The state-of-the-art also suggests possible alternatives, such as DSA31 or WiMAX for V2I communication35,  or CEN-DSRC (5.8 GHz) and ETSI-DSRC (5.9 GHz) for Electronic Tolling.  Protection of communication typically relies on a PKI deployed specifically for this purpose. Work in the  European Union on this matter is coordinated under the Connected and automated driving (C-ITS)  deployment platform36, which aims at harmonizing the PKI and trust model for the European Union.  Other components  30 Such as: 2G, 3G, 4G  31 See Lu, N., Cheng, N., Zhang, N., Shen, X., & Mark, J. W. (2014). Connected vehicles: Solutions and challenges. IEEE  internet of things journal, 1(4), 289-299.  32 For example Mirrorlink, CarPlay or Automotive Link  33 See http://www.surewise.com/car-warranty/articles/how-wearable-tech-influences-smart-cars/  34 See https://openconnectivity.org/press-releases/open-connectivity-foundation-announces-automotive-project  35 See Msadaa, I.

We also include aftermarket dongles in this category, since they use the same interfaces. It should however  be noted that they do not necessarily provide maintenance or diagnostic features.  OBD II ports and Garage or maintenance equipment  Various maintenance and diagnostic equipment can be plugged on cars via the OBD-II37 ports. They can be  standalone equipment, such as portable data collectors, or comprised of applications running on a PC or  tablet.  Aftermarket dongles  Aftermarket telematics components such as \"smart dongles\" also have OBD-II connectivity, as well as  external Bluetooth or cellular connectivity. They are often built upon the same set of components as the  competition (SoC, sensor packages, CAN transceiver chip...). They may also include debugging interfaces (for  example via mini-USB), configured to emulate a network adapter (i.e., once connected, the TCU appears as  a device on the network).  Diagnostic subnetwork  The subnetwork diagnostic is usually performed directly on the CAN bus (see section 2.2.1), through the  OBD-II port. Ethernet is also about to be used for diagnostics over the DoIP protocol (Diagnostic over IP).  2.2.7 Security, safety and privacy concerns  Assets are related to safety in several ways:   Compromising powertrain or chassis ECUs and networks may obviously cause a vehicle to behave in an  unexpected way, for example if an attacker illegitimately compromises ignition, steering, brakes, speed  and gear control, or driving support (such as ABS);38   Compromising body ECUs and networks systems that may increase harm to the passengers, should they  malfunction:   airbag or safety belts,   door force-lock used for child protection,   the windshield wipers,   alerts in the vehicle, dashboard display, notably speed, collision or lane departure warning...   air conditioning,   motorized or heating seats,   automatic trunk closing,   rear-view mirrors as well as automated windows or roof...  37 The OBD-II interface is also called a “diagnostics plug”, and is available on all vehicles sold in Europe  since 2001).  38 See for example https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hackers-fool-tesla-ss-autopilot-hide-spoof-obstacles/ and  https://www.wired.com/2016/06/teslas-autopilot-first-deadly-crash/  https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hackers-fool-tesla-ss-autopilot-hide-spoof-obstacles/ https://www.wired.com/2016/06/teslas-autopilot-first-deadly-crash/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  23  These systems may also cause a disturbance on surrounding vehicles, for example if there is a disruption  of headlights or of direction/warning lights;   Infotainment ECUs and networks may also cause safety issues : incorrect navigation data may lead the  car to unsafe areas, and a disturbance of the audio in the entertainment system (such as high volume  burst) may distract the driver  More specifically, the networks of the car can be specifically targeted and cause the same safety risks:   Internal networks (for example the CAN bus, but it also includes wireless networks such as Tire Pressure  Monitoring Systems (TPMS)): a disruption or integrity breach on these networks may result in a loss of  control of a vehicle;   Cellular connection of the car may also have adverse impacts on safety, for example in the case of a  spoofed firmware update triggered by SMS;   Local network (e.g. Wi-Fi, BT) and connection to user phones theoretically leads only to the  entertainment components of the vehicle. But as the study shows, the lack of isolation between  entertainment and driving systems might result in safety-related vulnerabilities from these entry points.  This reasoning might also be extended to other local connections such as a wireless keyfob;   V2X communications, which could lead to accidents, were they disrupted or spoofed39;   The disruption of eCall, or other alert or alarms, may eventually cause additional concerns at an accident  scene.  Additional security concerns are found in several ways:   An attacker may get an unauthorized access to functions not intended for users (fleet management,  digital tachograph, geo-fencing...). This typically evokes fraud situations, but this may also cause the  vehicle systems to malfunction and cause hazardous situations following drivers’ disruption;   Trade secrets may be at risk in several systems: TCU/ECU firmware, which might be sensitive with regard  to the competition. Some industry actors, in particular, may be wary of the possibility of device cloning  (for example the cloning of aftermarket products);   More generally, intellectual property may also be threatened: Smart car applications, or infotainment  application or media, which might be sensitive with regard to fraud (use of application copies obtained  through unofficial stores, unauthorized copies of paid premium content…)   Features or functions implemented using multiple components (such as ADAS) can augment risk in a  system if they are not correctly integrated in it.  Data confidentiality and privacy are eventually at risk as well. For example, compromising embedded  cameras may lead to privacy issues for the driver and passengers.  39 While these functionalities are out of scope of this study, we still need to consider them as potential entry points  for an attacker.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  24  3. Threats and risk analysis  Threats taxonomy  This study builds upon the threats described in ENISA’s previous work40. This set of threats has been  compared with other available threat analysis41 during the stocktaking phase of this study. While the  presentation and categories of threats differ from analysis to analysis, the outcome of this comparison  showed that the content remains the same, that nearly all threats found in ENISA’s report are retained. The  list of threats was discussed with experts during the interview phase, to focus on a restricted group of  significant threats, as shown in Figure 6:  Figure 6: Interviews: Main threats as perceived by interviewees  Below the list of threats and assets affected:  40 ENISA. (2015). Cyber security and resilience of intelligent public transport: good practices and recommendations.  41 McCarthy, C., Harnett, K., & Carter, A. (2014). Characterization of potential security threats in modern automobiles:  A composite modeling approach (No. DOT HS 812).  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  25  Table 1 - List of threats and assets affected  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  Physical  threats  Side channel, fault  injection,  glitching, access  to HW debug  ports…  This may typically consist in several scenarios :  tampering with the ECUs or TCUs (to recover keys or  access physical debug interfaces); using the device  electro-magnetic emanations or power usage to leak  information (side-channel); use light, power or other  means to alter the device behavior and ultimately  gain access to protected data (glitch, fault injection).  Physical threats arise from a well-identified attack  vector (physical manipulation of devices). They  might lead to various types of risks, including the  categories described hereafter as Nefarious  Activity/Abuse or  Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking.  ECUs and sensors  (privileged debug  interfaces of the ECUs,  causing a cascading  impact on all assets)  Unintentional  damages  (accidental)  Information  leakage or sharing  This may typically concern administration errors in  back-end services or errors when storing data  intended for diagnostic in garages, for example.  Mostly IP-sensitive  firmware of the ECUs  and sensors, as well as  private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Erroneous use or  administration of  devices and  systems  Unintentional damages (accidental) may result from  insufficiently trained personnel (for example when  using diagnostic equipment), or from an incorrect  OTA update pushed by the backend services.  ECUs and sensors,  causing a cascading  impact on all assets  Using information  from an unreliable  source  Unintentional damages may cascade from ill-defined  trust relationships: for example, trusting a third- party cloud provider with poor data protection, or  failing to notify a Tier developer that the data they  will store is sensitive.  All assets  Unintentional  change of data in  an information  system  Unintentional damages (accidental) may result from  insufficiently trained personnel (for example when  using diagnostic equipment), or from an incorrect  OTA update pushed by the backend services.  ECUs and sensors,  causing a cascading  impact on all assets  Inadequate design  and planning or  lack of adaption  Unintentional damages (accidental) may result from  insufficiently trained personnel (for administration,  design, operation…) causing for example  incompatibilities between components, or lack of  adaptation to the changing threat landscape (the use  of vulnerable cryptography is an example of this).  All assets  Disasters and  Outages  Network outage  A Network outage (for example from the ISP) may  result in a denial of service for sensitive operations,  such as OTA fixes for critical bugs or vulnerabilities.  This is also true for internal networks failures.  More generally, any design relying too much on  connectivity exposes the vehicle to potential issues  in case of outages. Vehicles should be designed to  offer a usable degraded mode of operation in case of  outage.  See also Failures/ Malfunctions  All assets  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  26  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  Damage/ Loss  (IT Assets)  Loss of  information in the  cloud  Sensitive data may be lost due to attacks or  accidents when stored by third-party cloud service  providers  Sensitive data stored by  cloud service providers  (these data do not  appear on the asset list,  but may typically be  related to infotainment  control)  Loss of (integrity  of) sensitive  information  The (integrity of) sensitive data may be lost due to IT  components wear and tear, causing potential  cascading issues (in case of a key alteration, for  example)  See also Failures/ Malfunctions  All assets  Damage caused  by a third party  Sensitive data may be lost or compromised due to  physical damages in cases of a traffic accident or  theft.  Private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Loss from DRM  conflicts  User data (traffic- or travel-related services,  audio/video entertainment…) may be deleted due to  DRM issues  Private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Information  leakage  Private or sensitive data (such as payment  information, driving habits…) may be leaked when  the car is sold to another user.  Private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Failures/  Malfunctions  Failures /  malfunctions of  (parts of) devices  or systems  See Damage/ Loss (IT Assets) - Loss of (integrity of)  sensitive information  -  Failures or  disruptions of the  power/main  supply  A failure of power supply has obvious safety issues  besides security issues. However, security causes  additional constraints. Typically, some security  functions (for example anti-tampering mechanisms)  should rely on separate and trusted power sources,  to avoid both accidental security failures and  potentially exploitable flaws for an attacker  All assets  Software bugs  The presence of software bugs is a basis for potential  exploitable vulnerabilities. The lack of a software  measure for the Mean-Time-Between-Failure also  implies that software bugs are more likely to happen  than Hardware failures over the lifetime of a car.  All assets  Failures or  disruptions of  communication  links  See Disasters and Outages - Network outage All assets  Eavesdropping / Interception/  Hijacking  Interception of  information /  Interfering  radiations  See physical threats. All assets  Replay of  messages  If internal networks are not sufficiently protected  against replay, potential attackers have an easy  Sensitive data  transmitted on  subnetworks  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  27  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  access to a wide range of dangerous commands,  such as steering, braking…  Man in the  middle/ session  hijacking  A large set of interfaces means that, assuming a poor  protection of the session, there are many incentives  for an attacker to impersonate a distant user:  - Impersonating an app store, or service  provider, may lead to financial abuse;  - Impersonating backend systems may help  the attacker in downloading a rogue  firmware on the vehicle;  - Impersonating another vehicle on a V2V  session may trigger dangerous behaviours;  - Impersonating a legitimate keyfob may lead  to theft;  - etc.  The same notion can also be applied to internal  network, for example to perform a MitM on the CAN  bus42.  All assets  Network  reconnaissance  and information  gathering  Information on car networks can be obtained in  many ways (looking for successive MSISDN numbers  for OTA updates, looking for vulnerable devices on  Shodan43, war driving for vulnerable protocols such  as ZigBee or Wi-Fi…)  Wireless External  communication  networks or  subnetworks  Repudiation of  actions  The liability of the driver being possibly engaged in  accidents/assurance/professional contexts, there is  an incentive to compromise data related to the car  usage such as driving habits or localization. This is  simply the extension of existing fraud schemes, for  example on tachographs.  Data related to  powertrain control,  Chassis control or  infotainment control  Nefarious  Activity/ Abuse  Denial of service  The denial of service is not only to be understood as  a particular form of network outage. A denial of  service may also be triggered on internal network by  flooding a CAN bus, or by provoking faults on an ECU  via a malicious payload. The potential impact of such  an attack depends on the targeted ECU, but may  lead to unexpected behaviours from driving systems  All assets  Manipulation of  hardware &  software,  Manipulation of  information  Changing the firmware of a component, or  otherwise altering its configuration data, is an  essential step of many attacks. The risk is  emphasized when there are no measures to protect  the authenticity of critical data or components, such  as a secure boot.  All assets  42 See https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#canspy-a-platform-for-auditing-can-devices  43 https://www.shodan.io/  https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#canspy-a-platform-for-auditing-can-devices  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  28  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  Manipulation of hardware also allows to perform a  man-in-the-middle (for example, cutting the CAN  bus or isolating a given ECU44)  Unauthorised  access to  information  system/network  The type of threat attracting the most attention of  the media45 is the case where a remote attacker can  take the control of an ECU (or impersonate an ECU  on an internal subnetwork) and take the control of a  car by sending driving-related commands (steering,  braking…).  All assets  Compromising  confidential  information  While information leak may be accidental  (See  Damage/ Loss (IT Assets) - Information leakage),  there are also incentives for attackers to deliberately  compromise private data or sensitive data such as  keys  All assets  Identity fraud  The simplest case of identity fraud is the cloning of a  keyfob. This may, however, be completed by other  cases, such as fraud, for example if a user wants  their car to display another identity when  communicating:  - with road infrastructures such as toll  systems;  - with manufacturer backend46.  All assets  Unauthorised use  of administration  of devices &  systems,  Unauthorised use  of software,  Unauthorised  installation of  software  A user may try to access unauthorized functions for  various  reasons: they might want to circumvent  DRMs on applications or media, or get an  unauthorized access to features (geo-fencing, digital  tachograph… See Eavesdropping/ Interception/  Hijacking - Repudiation of actions), or they might  simply want to tune the vehicle for comfort or  performance purpose.  Outside vehicles, manufacturers may also be  confronted with garages using unauthorized or  unlicensed professional tools and software.  This threat also includes the notion of cloning, for  example when an attacker copies the firmware of an  existing device, in order to commercialize it without  authorization.  All assets  Abuse of  authorizations,  Abuse of  information  leakage  A disgruntled employee (backend services, garage)  may use their authorizations to perform malicious  actions.  A slightly different scenario would be for an  infotainment application to abuse its authorizations  (for example, to mine private data or perform  surveillance activities)  All assets  44 See  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Demay-CANSPY-A-Platorm-For-Auditing-CAN-Devices- wp.pdf  45 See a recent example : https://www.wired.com/2016/03/thousands-trucks-buses-ambulances-may-open-hackers/  46 See http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538862?_sm_au_=icV3HHS2mMF57J6r  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Demay-CANSPY-A-Platorm-For-Auditing-CAN-Devices-wp.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Demay-CANSPY-A-Platorm-For-Auditing-CAN-Devices-wp.pdf https://www.wired.com/2016/03/thousands-trucks-buses-ambulances-may-open-hackers/ http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538862?_sm_au_=icV3HHS2mMF57J6r  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  29  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  The impact of such threats is enhanced in cases  where the system itself leaks data due to a poor  security design.  Malicious  software,  Malicious  software activity  The integration of infotainment and mobile  ecosystems may cause an increase of potential  malicious software introduced by the user. Malicious  software may provide a first step for attackers in a  multi-step attack, to get in driving systems via the  infotainment subnetwork.  Malicious software may also be a first step to gain  access to professional systems (e.g. garages or  backend), thus potentially gaining a privileged access  on a large set of vehicles.  It has to be noted that these ties to the mobile and  PC ecosystems also means that attackers may  recycle well-known attacks paths (generic  linux/android/windows) to eventually affect smart  cars47.  All assets  Remote activity  (execution)  All external interfaces may be subject to code  injection, which may ultimately result in code  execution in case of insufficient component  robustness.  All assets  Advanced  Persistent  Threats (APT)  -  Some security researchers48 consider smart car  attacks as similar to Advanced Persistent Threats, or  advanced enterprise threats, especially because the  attackers have to move “laterally into multiple  systems”. This risk is also relevant for infrastructures  (backend systems, or even V2X infrastructures). Such  attacks typically use several types of methods and  entry points, therefore can be a mix of every other  threat described in this table.  All assets  Attack potential  This study chooses not to define any specific threat agents (script kiddies, government agencies…)  except when it gives useful information on the attacker motivation.  Instead, the study will focus on  the notion of attack potential, meaning the potential of someone to perform an attack. Attack  potential is described in the Common Criteria49 and further refined in the Common Criteria  Evaluation Methodology50. In Common Criteria, a product evaluated to achieve a given assurance  level is supposed to resist attackers with a predetermined attack potential.  During the vulnerability  assessment, if evaluators detect a potential vulnerability, they will calculate the attack potential  required to exploit such a vulnerability. If the attack is exploitable with a potential lower than what  47 It was notably the main point of http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/  48 See https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/07/hacking-a-tesla/  49 Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation - Part 3: Security assurance components -  September 2012 - Version 3.1 Revision 4  50 Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation - Evaluation methodology - September 2012  - Version 3.1 Revision 4  http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/ https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/07/hacking-a-tesla/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  30  the product is expected to resist, the product will fail the associated evaluation task. This attack  potential is typically built upon several measures or estimations:   Time taken to identify and exploit;   Specialist technical expertise required;   Knowledge of the [product] design and operation;   Window of opportunity;   IT hardware/software or other equipment required for exploitation.  In practice, this means that an evaluated product may be vulnerable to some attacks, but that these  attacks require more expertise (or resources, or motivation) than the targeted resistance can handle.  For example, Common Criteria certificates follow a scale of EAL (Evaluation Assurance Level) where  a higher EAL means, through the AVA_VAN assurance requirements, that the product is expected to  resist stronger attackers:   A hardware product at an EAL2 level may resist to script kiddies using simple software  exploitation frameworks   The same product evaluated at EAL4+ may be expected to resist an attack by experts using  sophisticated equipment such as lasers or Focused Ion Beams.  When performing a threat assessment prior to a certification, computing an attack potential for a  threat will help decide:   Which certification level may provide assurance that the threat is covered;   Whether some attack scenarios will be “too strong” to be addressed by the expected  certification.  A separate issue for computing the attack potential may be that some of the estimating measures  dominate the others. A good example is the 2014 Jeep hack by Miller and Valasek where a lot of  time was required to identify the vulnerability (the DBus daemon), while exploiting it did not require  any special expertise or equipment.  Note also that, in practice, the attack potential of attackers increases over time, as they gain more  expertise and knowledge of the automotive systems as well as they build more sophisticated tools.  Moreover, the potential of attackers can sometimes grow rapidly: for. For instance, when a skilled  hacker publishes a vulnerability, including hints on how to exploit it, (and even scripts for automated  attacks), less skilled persons (like script kiddies) may have sufficient attack potential to repeat or  further exploit this same vulnerability. While this study will not try to calculate an accurate attack  potential for the attack scenarios hereafter, it aims at giving a hint at the differences of potential  required depending on the scenario. This is also intended to be a hint to future certification efforts.  Sample cyber security attacks  The Table 2 hereafter lists a sample of attacks showing how previous threats can be related to  existing research and exploitation paths:  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  31  Table 2 : Sample attacks  THREATS ATTACK LESSONS LEARNED  Network  reconnaissance and  information  gathering,  Unauthorised access  to information  system/network  Remote attack (see section 3.4.1 for more details on how  this kind of attack can be performed)  First introduced in 201151, remote attacks on cars (via  internet) have been widely exposed in the press due to the  work of Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek52. This type of attack  typically included attempts to craft messages on the CAN  bus to change the behaviour of the vehicle.

Direct CAN access is easier than  many manufacturers might think.

In this case, the researchers claim that the attack  could explain theft cases found in the wild.  This follows a long history of attacks on keyless entry  (including notably the RollJam55 attack) and start  systems5657, all of which relying on cheap hardware and  short exploitation time. Attacks exploiting vulnerable  cryptography on these systems are not new, with examples  as far as 200558.  Unauthorised use of  administration of  devices & systems  Theft (see section 3.4.3 for more details on how this kind of  attack can be performed)  Thefts have been shown to use, in the wild, administration  equipment to defeat keyless entry and start systems59.  These equipment were initially intended for locksmiths and  car dealers.  Identification, authentication and  authorization is needed for access  to privileged functions, especially  for maintenance equipment.  Information leakage,  Abuse of information  leakage  Surveillance (see section 3.4.4 for more details on how this  kind of attack can be performed)  Researchers devised an experimental setup to validate their  cost analysis estimation of a surveillance attack performed  by a mid-range attacker using dedicated hardware. The  attack uses ITS communication interfaces60.  Surveillance is possible in practice  for a mid-range attacker; interfaces  (e.g. ITS interfaces) lack the  pseudonymity measures allowing  to mitigate the attack  54 See Garcia, F.

Some examples of attacks scenarios are introduced hereafter to show in more details the  variety of attacks that can potentially target smart cars. Additionally, they provide an introduction  to the categories of good practices allowing to cover these threats. We consider several categories  of attacks, which are described as scenarios hereafter: Remote attacks, Persistent vehicle  alteration, Theft and Surveillance. These scenarios are detailed in the next sections. (More details  concerning the risk rating can be found in Section 7 – Appendix A).  3.4.1 Remote attacks (threatening passengers safety)  Table 3 : Attack scenario 1 - remote attack  A TT  A C  K  S  C EN  A R  IO  TYPE OF  ATTACK  DESCRIPTION ASSET AFFECTED  Remote, via  functional  interfaces  This attack exploits vulnerabilities in external functional interfaces, related to  telematics or infotainment. Connected ECUs may be used in a variety of  functional uses, all of which can be an entry point for such attacks61.  The scenario could typically follow these steps: first identify a vulnerable car,  then gain access to internal services (e.g. on a TCU), and eventually, from  the access gained onto the vehicle, obtain an access to vehicle systems.  In a first step,  External  communication  networks are  targeted.  Ultimately, all  ECUs and  sensors may be  compromised  CRITICALITY LIKELIHOOD62  High Unlikely  CASCADING EFFECTS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Vehicle (safety) systems disruption may  result in an accident, possibly involving other  vehicles.  All stakeholders providing, or operating external interfaces (ISPs,  manufacturers, Tiers, aftermarket and app providers, cloud  service providers). ECU manufacturers also concerned, since this  scenario exploits the lack of ECU self-protection.  RECOVERY TIME AND EFFORTS GOOD PRACTICES  Even if vulnerabilities may be fixed by an  OTA update, and even if the vehicle does  not seem physically damaged, it is likely  that a physical inspection will be needed  to ensure that safety is maintained.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards, organizational  measures)   In terms of security functions, Communication protection is  obviously needed to mitigate these attacks, and well as  Identification, authentication and authorization for all actions  accessible remotely. These functions are supported by  Cryptography, Security Audit, and software self-protection.63   Separation of telematics and infotainment traffic is  recommended allowing specialized handling of packets regarding  intrusion and malware detection.  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development, Safety and security process integration.  This kind of attack is very much in the public eye64. While the attack is not at all trivial to realize,  and therefore rated as “unlikely”, it can have devastating consequences.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  34  The type of attacks described by this scenario could be roughly described as in the Figure 7  hereafter65:  Figure 7 : Remote attacks threatening passengers’ safety  Example: As a first step, the attacker may know that a given vehicle model has a vulnerable SMS  (Single Messaging System) link, and knowing its MSIN, enumerates MSINs in hope that all numbers  have been sequentially assigned, thus discovering other vulnerable vehicles66.   The cost to identify such a vulnerability is only relatively high, because the attack surface of a smart  car is very large: if the direct IP connectivity of a car is well-protected, the attacker can move to  another entry point such as SMS.   Interestingly, the use of dedicated components to compromise cellular connection (“stingrays” or  “fake BTS”) was studied67 but is dismissed by newer studies describing it as an unnecessary complex  entry point compared to other methods, especially internet-based attacks68.   As a second step, they exploit the lack of authentication for SMS update, and upload a crafted firmware  to the TCU69.   This is an extreme example: the attacker will typically gain an access of some sort on a TCU. The  usefulness of this access will however be different depending on whether it consists in a simple  65 These steps are very similar to what is described in previous research, in particular Miller, C., & Valasek, C. (2014). A  survey of remote automotive attack surfaces.

(2015). Fast and vulnerable: a story of telematic failures. In 9th  USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT 15).  69 Alternatively (in the example of Miller/Valasek), the attacker may try to directly communicate with ECUs because it  contains non-diversified SSH credentials (that may have been extracted by a previous physical attack on another  vehicle).  http://argus-sec.com/blog/remote-attack-aftermarket-telematics-service http://argus-sec.com/blog/remote-attack-aftermarket-telematics-service  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  35  session, a highly privileged session, or the capacity to update a malicious firmware; which has  consequences on what is possible in the third and last step.   As a last step, their crafted firmware is able to communicate legitimately on the CAN bus, allowing to  communicate with the driving systems   The range of consequences may vary from the mildly disruptive (such as horn activation) to life- threatening situations, such as brake disconnect, engine halt or air bag activation.  Exploiting the complete scenario will require several vulnerabilities to be exploited in sequence, and  should not be regarded as an easy task. In particular, sending crafted messages on the CAN bus is not a  trivial way to trick an ECU into performing a malicious action70. Note also that the attack can come from  “unlikely” sources such as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) radio receivers71 or the vehicle FM Radio Data  System72.  3.4.2 Persistent vehicle alteration (by the legitimate user or by the use of diagnostic equipment)  This category includes for example cases where the legitimate user tries to modify the behaviour of their  vehicle, as summarized in Figure 8. This may include:   Attempts to “tune” the vehicle driving characteristics, for example to enhance performance. The car  hacker’s handbook, for example, is advertised to users as mean to perform “car mods” or “discover  undocumented features”73;  70 See Miller, C., & Valasek, C. (2014).

The objective may be for example vehicle tuning,  bypass of the geo-fencing on a corporate vehicle …  The user may also use diagnostic equipment, which  may also be used by other categories of attackers,  for example in a garage. The steps would then  consist in obtaining a legitimate or illegitimate  access to diagnostic equipment, then exploiting a  vulnerability in the diagnostic equipment to  persistently alter the behaviour of an ECU. In a  garage context, such an attack may be related to  business intelligence as much as an attack on the  vehicle itself  The primary targets are the OBD II  ports from the Diagnostic and  maintenance systems. In the case  of an alteration by the user, assets  related to the access control  functions of the ECUs and sensors74  are targeted.  In the case of a garage attack, IP and  Trade secrets, but also private data  stored on ECUs and sensors, or  transiting on subnetworks75.  In both cases, Powertrain control  and vehicle safety systems from  Chassis or body control may be hit  indirectly  CRITICALITY LIKELIHOOD  High  Possible to Unlikely  CASCADING EFFECTS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  The immediate effect can range from a data  leak to a disruption of vehicle systems. This  may result in an accident, possibly involving  other vehicles, while a data leak has less  critical consequence, but may result in brand  damage.  All stakeholders providing ECUs, diagnostic  equipment or aftermarket dongles (car  manufacturers, Tiers, aftermarket providers).  Garages are also concerned, since attacks  performed via diagnostic equipment are likely to  use garages as an entry point.  RECOVERY TIME AND  EFFORTS  GOOD PRACTICES  Even if vulnerabilities may be  fixed by an OTA update, and  even if the vehicle appears to  be physically damaged, it is  likely that a physical  inspection will be needed to  ensure that safety is  maintained.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards,  organizational measures)   In terms of security functions, Communication protection is  obviously needed to mitigate these attacks, as well as  Identification, authentication and authorization for all actions  accessible via diagnostic interfaces. Physical self-protection also  contributes to reduce the attack surface for local attacks (see  8.1.3.6 for details).   These functions are supported by Cryptography, Security Audit,  and software self-protection.  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development (especially for the access control to maintenance tools), safety and  security process integration  74 The assets primarily targeted are mostly related to access control, especially access to functions not intended for  users (fleet management, digital tachograph, geo-fencing...). Studies give example of privileged services than can be  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  37   Attempt to bypass monitoring services such as geo-fencing or fleet management. This is analogous to  existing situations such as tachograph fraud76 77, although it is an extension of the existing situation,  because tachograph fraud is clearly not part of geo-fencing or fleet management.  Other attackers than the legitimate user of the car may also want to alter the behaviour of the vehicle. For  example, the attacker may be a garage employee using diagnostic equipment:   Attacks in garages may be related to business intelligence (aiming at gaining sensible information on  competitors technical implementations)   Attacks inside or outside garages may be related to organized crime. This may for example be used as a  threat on the garage or users (on the model of ransomware). As for today, the presence of financial  incentives is not yet very frequent (for example payment information accessible in entertainment  systems). This example looks very much like existing scenarios targeting point-of-sale terminals, where  malware such as memory scrapers78 can be installed by employees. The situation is however slightly  different in garages, since:   The turnover in garages is not the same as large shopping centres that heavily rely on temporary  work; this creates less opportunity for attackers;   The incentive in point of sale is not as strong (attacks on points-of-sale directly allow to obtain  payment-enabling data)  Main scenario   Example 1: The attacker connects to the CAN bus, for example by identifying the appropriate pins on  the OBD II port. They may then plug a cheap CAN sniffer on these pins (step 1). The step 2 will consist  in  trying to analyse the CAN traffic and then alter the car behaviour via crafted packets (the car  hacker’s handbook gives the example of a spoofed speed transmitted to the digital tachograph79)   Example 2: As a first step, an attacker directly connects an ECU (using a JTAG port on the board). The  step 2 will consist in exploiting the JTAG debug capacities by uploading a crafted firmware80;   Other examples of attacks may consist in glitching, memory dump81…  compromised because static keys were discovered by a memory dump (for example SSH keys). Other targeted assets  are the driving systems, especially in cases where the user tries to modify the performance of their vehicle. Vehicle  safety systems may also be at risk due to accidental side effects of the attack. Modified traffic on the CAN bus may for  example trigger denials of service on the bus, or otherwise cause dangerous situations to arise on vehicle systems.  75 IP and Trade secrets may be targeted. In a context related to organized crime, the assets are more likely to be  vehicle safety systems, driving systems or private data (especially payment data)  76 http://www.euro-controle-route.eu/site/en/info/tacograph/fraud/  77 For the example of digital tachographs see: https://www.tispol.org/content/2016/02/02/07/31/technology-used- tachograph-fraud-becoming-more-complex-and-sophisticated-0  78 See for example, http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-pos- ram-scraper-malware.pdf  79 See Miller, C., & Valasek, C.

The document highlights the fact that  analyzing and crafting CAN packets is not an easy task.  80 See Car Hacker’s Handbook by Craig Smith, which reminds that it requires to obtain, and then reverse-engineer a  firmware, which is not trivial  81 See for example Foster, I., Prudhomme, A., Koscher, K., & Savage, S.

The second step may then consist in modifying an ECU by injecting a crafted  firmware, or simply a previous, vulnerable version of the firmware.   Example 2: Instead of trying to access the diagnostic equipment itself, the attacker may try to  compromise the laptop that interfaces with this equipment83. In that case the skills may not be much  more than being able to reverse a DLL and exploiting bad digital signature implementations, which are  skills frequently found in “black hat” communities related to DRM, point-of-sale, malware creation...  Even in that case, the attacker may need car-specific skills, for example to be able to craft a working  firmware. This also assumes that the attacker will perform their attack remotely through a malware,  which makes the whole attack more difficult by an order of magnitude.  Figure 8 : Persistent vehicle alteration scenarios  3.4.3 Theft  Table 5 : Attack scenario 3 - Theft  A TT  A C  K  S  C EN  A R  IO  TYPE OF  ATTACK  DESCRIPTION ASSET AFFECTED  Local  Several possible scenarios, some being more realistic than  others: Compromising a local wireless connection (e.g. Wi-Fi),  Key fob cloning, Relay attack, Rolling code jam, exploiting the  Keyless systems …  Body control domain and External  communication networks are the  primary asset targeted, but  ultimately all assets are concerned,  in cases where the vehicle is  eventually stolen  82 See http://fortune.com/2016/08/06/houston-car-hackers/  83 It was notably the main point of http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/  http://fortune.com/2016/08/06/houston-car-hackers/ http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  39  CRITICALITY LIKELIHOOD  Medium  Possible  CASCADING EFFECTS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Beyond the theft itself, privacy issues can happen (the same  way as the theft of smartphones or tablet may result in  private data being accessible by the thief).  Actors providing keyless entry systems (car  manufacturers and Tiers), but also Insurance  companies, insofar as policies should take into  account these scenarios and define appropriate  forensic procedures.  RECOVERY TIME  AND EFFORTS  GOOD PRACTICES  Assuming that most  vulnerabilities are  software-based, they  may be fixed by an  OTA or physical  update. Hardware  vulnerabilities may  cause much higher  recovery costs.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards, organizational measures);   In terms of security functions, Cryptography is obviously the first coming to mind, since  most of these attacks rely on the weak cryptography implemented in remote keyless  entry systems;   Communication protection is obviously needed to mitigate these attacks, and well as  Identification, authentication and authorization for all actions accessible, for example,  via local wireless entry points (Wi-Fi, keyfob…). Physical self-protection also  contributes to reduce the attack surface for local attacks (see 8.1.3.6 for details);   Security Audit may help the forensic analysis of such cases, from an insurance point of  view, as they are physically undetectable;   These functions are supported by self-protection. In particular, the design should allow  users to fall back to a mechanical lock whenever a vulnerability is found in their keyless  entry systems.  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development  In this scenario we consider the possibility for an attacker to gain physical access to the inside of a vehicle  without a legitimate access means.  Standard key fobs and access control devices usually work under the assumption that there is only one level  of access, thus gaining access to the inside of a vehicle often entails access to the vehicle main functions :  engine start, infotainment unit, trunk opening. While the most plausible risk is the plain and simple theft of  the vehicle or any of the owner’s possessions kept inside, such an attack may be a first step towards a more  involved attack scenario since access to the inside of the vehicle provides :   Access to the OBD-II diagnostic port, thus easier access to the CAN/LIN bus;   Access to the head-up unit physical interfaces (USB, CD/DVD) and assets (navigation data, personal data,  access to remote services);   Easier access to other ECUs (telematics control unit, engine / transmission control unit, gateway).  A complex scenario may involve an attacker that uses one of the means listed above in order to incapacitate  (fully or partially) the vehicle operation in such a way that only him/her can restore it remotely, and ask for  a ransom. In such a case the main issue is the reproducibility, since such an attack would only be profitable  if it has the potential to scale up.  The scenario can use very different approaches, such as:  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  40   Compromising a local wireless connection (a proof of concept already exists),, where an insecure Wi-Fi  connection could be used to ultimately disable the theft alarm84)   Key fob cloning: the following techniques may provide this capability:   gain access to the key fob secure memory (through reverse engineering or side-channel);   compromise the pairing process, for instance by compromising the device used for pairing in the  garage;   Use a known vulnerability to get hold of the unique ID from the car’s diagnostic port85.   Relay attack: this attack has been shown to be effective with PKES (Passive Key Entry and Start)  systems8687, where no other action than proximity is required on behalf of the user to open / ignite the  car. In such a case it is possible to relay the near-field radio signal over large distances using cheap  hardware, from the vehicle to the key fob. This requires the ability to place a radio transceiver near the  key fob. The attack can only be effective if the security mechanism does not change the keys in time or  if it uses a repeated set of security messages.   Rolling code jam: Even if the key cloning scenario is not feasible (by lack of the specific hardware used  for pairing the key with the vehicle or reverse engineering / side channel capabilities), it is possible to  compromise the rolling code by jamming the radio signal so that the code is not discarded by the vehicle  and can be replayed. This attack requires cheap hardware and has been successfully demonstrated for  a range of vehicles on the field88.   Keyless systems: The smartphone application that controls the opening of the car is compromised, in  order to gain illegitimate access to a car. While this mode of access control is far from being common, it  may be in a near future89, which will have the effect of overextending the attack surface with all mobile  (applications and OS) vulnerabilities.  Many vulnerabilities used in such attacks are not as technically challenging as in other scenarios, and may  use cheap and easy to come by devices90 that require no high level technical skills for their operation. In  some cases, though, cryptographic attacks are needed to circumvent the keyless entry protection. Due to  hardware limitation, these cryptographic protocols are however weaker than in many other domains, and  researchers have shown that attacks can be performed without expensive equipment91.  84 See Hacking the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV hybrid, Pen Test Partners,  https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/hacking-the-mitsubishi-outlander-phev-hybrid-suv/.

CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development (lack of privacy by design in components or protocols), safety and security process  integration  This scenario gathers considerations regarding the possibilities of surveillance offered by recent cars and  vehicles. With the exception of the effort of ETSI on the use of pseudonyms to avoid tracking92, there is little  published evidence or work for this kind of situations, several potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses have  been noticed by proofs of concept by researchers93.  92https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/eIDAS_THREAD/S03_eID/DPSECURITYCONSULTIN G_PINKAS.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/SECURITYWS/S03_OTHERSTANDARDSandINDUSTR YFORA/ISO_IEC_JTC2_SC27_RANNENBERG.pdf  93 See for example https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars- Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers-wp2.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/eIDAS_THREAD/S03_eID/DPSECURITYCONSULTING_PINKAS.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/eIDAS_THREAD/S03_eID/DPSECURITYCONSULTING_PINKAS.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/SECURITYWS/S03_OTHERSTANDARDSandINDUSTRYFORA/ISO_IEC_JTC2_SC27_RANNENBERG.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/SECURITYWS/S03_OTHERSTANDARDSandINDUSTRYFORA/ISO_IEC_JTC2_SC27_RANNENBERG.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers-wp2.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers-wp2.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  42  There are essentially two kinds of plausible surveillance scenarios:   Targeted surveillance, where a single individual is tracked using a vulnerability in its vehicle systems   Mass surveillance, where a large number of individuals are tracked through some common vulnerability.  An alternative to both scenarios consist in performing surveillance only on cloud-stored data, instead of  focusing on vehicles. This alternative will not be explored in detail here, since ENISA already addressed the  issue of cloud security94.  In the case of targeted surveillance the high investment (in cost and risk) of the attack hints at the following  plausible motives: espionage, crime, terrorism, or business intelligence. On the other hand the mass  surveillance case involves spying on a large number of vehicles in order to get exploitable data. While there  is not public record of such an exploitation (except for researchers’ demonstrations in limited scenarios), it  is in principle possible to setup such a system to passively sniff the RF emissions of the vehicles and  discriminate between them using unique identifiers.  The associated threat agents may thus be government agencies and criminal organisations, with a high  attack potential and strong incentives for targeted surveillance, whereas the scope may be broader for mass  surveillance due to the relative easiness of the underlying attacks  Typical attack vectors for targeted surveillance rely on modification of the vehicle software and/or hardware  in order to setup the surveillance. Software-based scenarios could typically be found in cases where the  attacker has no physical access to the targeted vehicle (therefore is unable to put a physical tracker in the  vehicle).  The relevant vulnerable components are then the ECU hardware and software (mainly the infotainment  system and navigation unit).  The typical attack vectors for mass surveillance are:   All wireless emissions: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GSM/3G/4G signals can be used to uniquely identify a  vehicle. In particular:   When the infotainment system provides a Wi-Fi hotspot functionality that broadcasts its SSID;   Most TPMS systems, when they are active, broadcast a unique RFID identifier;   Using a fake BTS, it is possible to spy on the ICCID of the USIM cards.   Car systems can allow fingerprinting95, quite the same way as browser or device fingerprinting.  However, it may be argued that the browser of an infotainment system allows an easier  fingerprinting than sensors, which are more difficult to access.   Cloud storages / backed systems, which collect the position of a large set of vehicles. These includes the  fleet management systems, localisation-aware services, and navigation systems real-time databases.  94 See  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c5=2006&c5=2016&c5=false&c2=publicationDate&reversed=on&b_start =0&c8=Cloud+Computing+Security  95 See for example Enev, M., Takakuwa, A., Koscher, K., & Kohno, T.

It should be noted that surveillance scenarios are facilitated by existing, user-accepted, monitoring features.  Several examples come to mind, amongst which:   The usage of OBD-II dongles to monitor driving habits in exchange of reduced assurance fees96;   The accumulation of private information due to the interconnection with social networks.  These user-accepted usages come with entry points, some of them privileged (for example OBD-II dongles),  which can be compromised by an attacker. Therefore, reducing the chance of privacy attacks could also  benefit from limiting the user-accepted surveillance solutions. European privacy regulation already  contributes to limit potential accumulation of private data and abuses of opt-out scenarios97 - however, they  do not address the security risks caused by the introduction of technical components dedicated to user-data  collection.  96 See for example http://www.computerworld.com/article/2684298/once-your-cars-connected-to-the-internet-who- guards-your-privacy.html  97 Such as the OnStar privacy issues described in http://www.autoblog.com/2011/09/26/gm-onstar-privacy/  http://www.computerworld.com/article/2684298/once-your-cars-connected-to-the-internet-who-guards-your-privacy.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2684298/once-your-cars-connected-to-the-internet-who-guards-your-privacy.html http://www.autoblog.com/2011/09/26/gm-onstar-privacy/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  44  4. Gap analysis and good practices  Gaps and challenges  4.1.1 Insecure design or development  Insecure development in today’s cars  While the automotive industry has a long-standing expertise in car safety, security issues of connected  systems in cars and their potential impact on car safety are not yet properly taken into account, except for  few of them98. Some studies tried to define a shortlist of the more frequent security issues found amongst  manufacturers99 100 101 102 103. After having double checked these shortlists during our own interviews, the  following issues seem indeed significant:   No defence in depth strategy during the design of the system (such as a secure boot process, isolation  of a Trusted Computing Base, limitation of the number of open ports, self-protection, …);   No security- or privacy-by-design. For example, telematics schemes may require the car maker to send  most of the information exchanged on the CAN bus to a third-party, such as vehicle speed, throttle  position, coolant and oil temperature, engine revision status, etc. More information than really needed  may be exported outside of the car. While some actors are aware that private data should not be  exported without a reason, the same line of reasoning is not always applied to sensitive data;   Lack of communication protection, on internal as well as external interfaces;104   Lack of authentication and authorization, especially for privileged access to ECUs; for example:   no validation or signing of firmware updates,   updates happen without server authentication, and even on an arbitrary server,   no secure boot,   no cellular authentication, or weak authentication mechanisms, or failure to use components that  provide authentication functions…,   no cryptographic keys distributed to garages;   Lack of hardening, for example:   No data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies are used on firmware,   Public vulnerabilities (DNS proxy, http service...) are left unfixed,   ECU services are exposed through different entry points, and even unnecessary communication  ports are left open; services such as telnet, web or SSH are sometimes bound to all network  interfaces,   Weak passwords policies,   Misconfiguration (e.g. VPN) …   Lack of diagnosis / response capabilities  98 See https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/07/hacking-a-tesla/  99 Markey, E.

As already stated, a transparent dialog with security researchers is needed to ensure that the whole  community is in a “responsible” disclosure process. The current situation in automotive is very far from this  situation, as   Some findings have been left unpublished due to legal actions between manufacturers and  researchers106, leaving exploitable vulnerabilities in the wild during as long as two years;   Other researchers have turned to media due to manufacturer’s lack of response107,108, thus publishing  vulnerabilities for which no fix is planned;   Some manufacturers do not perform frequent software updates, thus exposing automotive devices to  known vulnerabilities (for instance in software frameworks, such as a SSL library or browser library).  Such updates, even if released in due time by manufacturers, are still seldom deployed Over The Air and  may require the car owner to use a USB stick for installing the update or to go a car dealership garage;   As confirmed by interviews, security functions such as security logs 109 are not regarded as important,  while they are essential to security diagnostics in the field.  4.1.2 Liability  Studies show that most users are concerned with cybersecurity issues arising from the integration of  connected features in cars. In case a security event happens, they are also likely to blame in equal parts the  different actors of the ecosystem such as app stores, app developers and app manufacturers, to take the  example of a vulnerability arising from a connected smartphone110. Furthermore, there is no chance to  enforce a perfect isolation between driving, debug and infotainment (or connected) systems, which means  that vulnerabilities from any actor, including aftermarket components, may allow compromising safety- related features of a vehicle.  In this context, there is a need to clarify the liability of each actor in case of a  security event.  101 Koscher, K., Czeskis, A., Roesner, F., Patel, S., Kohno, T., Checkoway, S., & Savage, S.

Despite initiatives to  include security in these processes, there is still a lack of a common standard allowing a complete  integration of safety and security in the car development lifecycles.  The lack of shared technical standards for car security is an additional burden for those who try to build  secure development processes. Eventually, the complexities of this heavily-tiered ecosystem cause issues in  the supply chain and in the glue code111 between components.  Existing initiatives and limitations  The approach in SAE-J 3061112 tried to address one of the smart cars specifics, which is a security product  that has strong safety requirements and an existing engineering process dedicated to safety.  It also tried to distinguish between system level and vehicle level issues to define a development method for  vehicles, which would both take security into account, and be compatible with the existing lifecycles of the  industry. As such, the document is well adapted to smart cars, but still lacks recommendations to address  many specifics of this domain. For example, the SAE-J 3061 does not suggest specific remediation to:   The unusually large attack surface (large number of entry points and variety of attack methods) of smart  vehicles113;   The combination of easy access for attackers (being a mass-market product) and severe impact (safety  consequences on the user and other vehicles)114;   The persistence of threats, associated with the relatively long life of the products115;   The fact that smart features are not essential to the core features of the car116.  Several initiatives led to defining guidelines or rules to implement security in the automotive industry (see  figure hereafter), and other initiatives117,118 asked for collaboration on the security topics from the  automotive industry. Although some of them are well under development, like ISO/AWI 21434119, none of  them can be considered a standard yet, and the overall standard landscape has yet to achieve the level of  completeness and consistency found in domains such as aircraft safety or smartcard security. The Figure 9  111 Generally, the term “glue code” is used for the code binding diverse software components together, typically  written in a dynamic scripting language, as opposed to the static compiled software components. In the context of  security, glue code is considered a threat for it often implies bad understanding of the security assumptions of the  third-party component code.  112 See SAE-J 3061 - SURFACE VEHICLE RECOMMENDED PRACTICE - Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical  Vehicle Systems  113 Amongst possible lifecycle adaptation, one may think of the following :  - Adding a dedicated interface design review;  - Adding a dedicated hardening phase during the late integration phases.  114 This combination implies that smart car security should require a high security assurance. And yet, the SAE-J3061  does not explicitly suggest high assurance certification (for example, Common Criteria EAL4+ security hardware)  115 This situation should theoretically require smart car manufacturers to reach a consensus on future-proof  cryptographic key sizes, which may exceed the usual recommendations of national cyber-security agencies.  116 As such, a consensus could be reached amongst manufacturers to define an “offline mode” where cars would be  functional while deactivating most of the external interfaces, such as the infotainment. Such a mode could be an  option when sever flaws have been found and are not yet patched.  117 See https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/  118 See https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html  119 See http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=70918  https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/ https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=70918  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  47  hereafter gives a sample of existing initiatives, as well as a sample of initiatives of interest outside of the  automotive domain.  Figure 9 : Safety and security initiatives inside and outside of the automotive domains  At the moment, no certification framework is yet considered a standard for security evaluation or security  testing, which would allow detection of vulnerabilities before the product is released. While certification  frameworks exist for safety features, for example automatic brake system, most industry actors are still new  to the concepts and methods of security certification (for example, the notion of penetration testing).  Other industries (for example airborne systems) eventually defined their own frameworks, for example  when facing heavily-tiered environment rendering usual certification standards impractical. Before trying  the same approach on automotive products, one should be careful to assess whether these attempts have  been successful in practice.  The particular issue of technical standards  The lack of standard ultimately causes additional security issues: for example, several key components of  vehicles are still developed with proprietary technologies (the main example coming to mind is the protocols  used for CAN communication). This situation makes it more difficult for third-party vendors to develop  security solutions (for example firewalls or intrusion detection) that could be applied to a large market,  hence reducing effectively the cost of security for manufacturers.  Additional issues: supply chain and effects of re-used code  Moreover, the heavily-tiered ecosystem of car manufacturing also leads to security integration issues120.  Eventually, aftermarket products may share the same buses, which also lead to a significant risk121.

In 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (pp. 447-462). IEEE.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  48  such as TCUs can be provided by manufacturers, Tiers or aftermarket providers. Theoretically, all are equally  secure or vulnerable, but the ECUs from Tiers or aftermarket providers are more significant from a  remediation point of view.  As stated by researchers122, security issues in aftermarket products cannot, by definition, be controlled by  manufacturers. In practice, aftermarket vendors are described as fully supportive, but the complexity of the  supply chain relationships leads in practice to security patches not being deployed, even when vendors have  distributed them (similar issues can be found in smartphones, where security patches on the Android OS are  not necessarily cascaded in operators or vendors fine-tuned versions of the OS).  Other studies highlighted the issues caused by integration of SW and HW in the manufacturing, especially  the fact that some actors experience with safety issues may cause them to separate software and hardware  issues and miss global security vulnerabilities. More generally, the outsourcing model leads to glue code and  security flaws due to bad understanding of the security assumptions of third-party code123. While  acknowledging the effort made by the industry to integrate safety and security approaches, explicit  synchronization points should be defined between these activities124 and between actors of the supply chain.  In the field, this heavily-tiered environment causes additional issues. Security patches need to be validated  on the whole supply chain before they can be deployed, which leads in practice to security patches not being  deployed, even when the Tier-2 vendor, for example, has developed and distributed them122 (this issue is, in  a way, similar to the issues of a mobile OS security patch not redeployed by OEMs).  Constraints and incentives  4.2.1 Constraints  Constraints due to the use cases  Some studies point out that connected car use cases, themselves, could be inherently insecure. For example,  the use of some \"smart dongles\" is often described as a \"bad practice\" by construction: structural  vulnerabilities of the CAN bus have a very deep impact (MiTM, capacity to reflash ECUs, leading to possible  actions on brakes, throttle...). The user is only protected by the need for a physical access to the CAN  (typically via OBD-II).  In this context, those \"smart dongles” provide an attacker with the capacity of easily  performing a remote attack with the same high impact125, which means that there must be a better  protection offered for and a separation between dongles and the CAN bus.  Additionally, use cases lead the acceptable cost for some car components. For example, keyless entry  systems have an acceptable cost, which implies that they will eventually lack the hardware resources to  support state-of-the-art cryptography.  122 See Foster, I., Prudhomme, A., Koscher, K., & Savage, S.

(2015). Fast and vulnerable: a story of  telematic failures. In 9th USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT 15).  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  49  Constraints due to the architecture  Additionally, vehicle systems have very specific issues due to their architecture. In particular, the use of CAN  bus (as opposed to Internet-like protocols) would cause:   Greater vulnerability to DoS, since arbitration is priority-based 126;   More issues with network segregation (priority being implicitly derived from safety notions instead of  including security properties);   Greater vulnerability to reverse engineering due to the small range of valid CAN packets (meaning that  little work is needed and a simple fuzzing campaign can have a dramatic impact by itself) 126,127.  Moreover, in-vehicle systems include a very large number of embedded and interconnected components (a  typical car contains more than 100 ECUs). Previous studies tend to argue that usual hardening and network  isolation issues are insufficient to protect such interconnected systems128.  It also opens many entry points129 for an attacker: vulnerabilities in these ECUs may be accessed remotely  through130 multiple possible interfaces, and in some cases including a web browser131.  Aside of the remote interfaces, various local entry points and diagnostic/test interfaces exist, such as OBD  or USB ports, which can also be used to get access to the system, or at least understand how it is designed  and which messages are exchanged. Indeed, the legacy bus system (CAN, LIN) offers no protection of the  messages. Besides, there is no standard for protection of ECUs (authentication, firmware update), which is  left at manufacturers good will. Eventually, many entry points are physically accessible:   Proprietary connectors131: a proprietary implementation does not prevent the tester to find out that it  is an Ethernet interface, and to be able to communicate with it,   Reverse engineering of the firmware (in this example, it allows to learn the password rotation scheme  and the location of the new password in plaintext on the file system).  4.2.2 Incentives  Studies consider that the IoT integration into cars cause a leadership crisis amongst traditional  manufacturers, that are now challenged by actors coming from the software domain132. Companies from  different domains have different ways to deal with security issues, from disclosure to remediation, which  in turn has consequences on the amount of “brand damage” resulting from inevitable cybersecurity issues.  In this context, the deployment or non-deployment of cybersecurity measures may have far-reaching  consequences.  126 See Koscher, K., Czeskis, A., Roesner, F., Patel, S., Kohno, T., Checkoway, S., & Savage, S.

This tends to confirm a widely-accepted consensus that media attention, and more largely, good or bad  publicity134, due to security issues is a main driver to implementing security for industry actors.

The good practices are  described in the remainder of this document, and further explained in Appendix B. They are categorized as   Policy and standards   Organizational measures   Technical  Figure 10: Summary of good practices  4.3.1 Policy and standards  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES ASSOCIATED ATTACKS  Policy and  standards  GP-PS-01 – Adherence to regulation. Industry actors shall, as a first step, adhere  to regulation related to security and privacy.  All  GP-PS-02 – Liability. The question of liability needs to be addressed. The question  of where liability may fall lies between Tier actors,  car manufacturers, the  vendors, aftermarket support operators and the end users. The liability issues  All  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  52  have to be addressed in the context of national legislation and case law. Where  gaps are identified in national legislation, these should be addressed.  GP-PS-03 – Traceability. Car manufacturers and Tier actors shall ensure that  appropriate technical measures (e.g. logging, distinct authentication,  transparency provided through OEM/Tier sites concerning each particular  car/component, integration with Type Approval authorities and monitoring  agencies) exist allowing for tracing liability between actors.  All  4.3.2 Organizational measures  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  Organizational  measures –  general  GP-OM-01 - Designate a dedicated security team. Actors of the smart car industry  should rely on specialists, notably for secure design, penetration testing and risk  management. Expert advice for training and corporate security is also  recommended. Some efforts in this direction are done in the ISO AWI 21434 –still in  draft- (see also Section 8.1.2).  All  GP-OM-02 - Define a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS).  Actors of the smart car industry should define an ISMS, possibly inspired from SAE  J3061, ISO 27001 or NIST 800-53, and refine it to address the specific needs of their  industry, notably the management of Tier-1 and Tier-2 actors, and processes to  ensure continuous isolation of the components from aftermarket products.  All  Organizational  measures –  secure  development  GP-OM-03 - Assess the threat model and use cases.  Actors of the smart car  industry should perform a threat analysis prior to development possibly inspired  from SAE-J3061 TARA approach (including EVITA, TVRA, OCTAVE and HEAVENS  methods) or possible from the risk management approach of ISO 31000. Efforts in  this direction are also done in the context of ISO AWI 21434.  All  GP-OM-04 - Provide security and privacy by design. Actors of the smart car  industry should plan their development lifecycles to ensure that security and  privacy are taken into account no later than the design phase, in order to address  the threats identified in the risk assessment.  All  GP-OM-05 - Implement and test the security functions. Actors of the smart car  industry should clearly define appropriate security functions that will be explicitly  implemented and tested during the development lifecycle. Security functions  described in the next section, include Security Audit, Communication protection,  Cryptography, User data protection, Identification, authentication, authorization,  and Self-protection.  All  Organizational  measures – security until  the end-of-life  GP-OM-06 - Assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities. Actors of the  smart car industry should define appropriate assessment procedures to regularly  check the effectiveness of their security functions, and patch them whenever  needed.  All  GP-OM-07 - Define a security update policy.  Actors of the smart car industry  should define an update policy for security patches, taking into account appropriate  timing, conditions, and user awareness for the updates (to ensure safety during  the update), and OTA update mechanisms whenever possible. Manufacturers may  have to define whether a vulnerable component can, or should, be put offline when  proven vulnerable.  All  GP-OM-08 - Perform a vulnerability survey. Actors of the smart car industry should  perform a vulnerability survey to be proactively able to fix security issues before  they can be used in the wild. The vulnerability survey should include developer  All  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  53  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  findings, on-line researches, CERTs advisories, information shared by groups such as  CarSec, ISACs or AutoSAR, as well as input from customers and security researches.  Eventually, vulnerabilities impacting user data should be communicated as  transparently as possible, as expressed by the EU Opinion 03/2014 on Personal Data  Breach Notification from the Article 29 Working Party.  GP-OM-09 - Check the security assumptions regularly during life-time. The devices  and services made assumptions to ensure that the security requirements are  sufficient (limitations in the usage of the vehicle137, assumed properties of the  environment138, assumed properties of cryptographic properties 139…). Vendors and  users should be encouraged to check regularly that these assumptions are still valid.  All  GP-OM-10 - Protect the software update mechanism. Vendors should protect the  updates (typically via encryption and digital signature) and protect the application  of an update on the device. Eventually, the update server and infrastructure  (including diagnostic tools) should also be protected.  All  GP-OM-11 - Raise user awareness. Vendors and public authorities140 should explain  users what actions can contribute to mitigate potential threats, especially how to  securely use interfaced systems such as a smartphone.  In the other side, a car owner often does not know what was changed in his car.  OEM shall support users by setting up issue-tracking sites where users can track  changes of their cars and report problems.  All  4.3.3 Technical  This section is structured following the lifecycle of smart cars. Steps are inspired by previous work from  NHTSA/NIST141  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  Security functions –  Security audit  GP-SF-01 - Security events must be securely logged. Access to the logs must be  documented and protected from disclosure to unauthorized users. The audit trail  must be protected from unauthorized access.  All  GP-SF-02 – Users must be informed of security events. HW and embedded  systems should provide clear error data that can be leveraged upon by the SW  vendors. The user must be informed in case of security errors, updates or  compromised data in a device or service they use.  All  Security functions –  Communications  protection  GP-SF-03 - Provide end-to-end protection in confidentiality and integrity using  protocols that resist to replay attacks. Favour methods providing forward secrecy  whenever possible, for WAN traffic (internet, mobile network) as well as local  networks.  Remote attacks,  theft, surveillance  137 For example, users may be advised to remove connectivity features from their entertainment system until a fix has  been found for a given vulnerability  138 For example, vendors should perform a survey to be able to remove a compromised CA from the certificate store.  139 Vendors should check regularly this assumption. For example, vendors should be aware to new cryptographic  attacks in order to adapt users’ key length or cryptographic suites adequately.  140 See for instance FBI’s public announcement Motor vehicles increasingly vulnerable to remote exploits  141 See National Institute of Standards and Technology cyber security risk management framework applied to modern  vehicles  https://www.ic3.gov/media/2016/160317.aspx http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2014/812073_NatlInstitStandardsTechCyber.pdf http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2014/812073_NatlInstitStandardsTechCyber.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  54  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  GP-SF-04 - Mitigate vulnerabilities or limitations of standard security library.  Developers must be aware of the vulnerabilities and limitations of the third-party  components they use. They should mitigate them whenever possible by patching  and by securing the configuration of the communication stacks, which might  typically include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, TLS…  All  GP-SF-05 - Consider denial of service as a usual threat to communication  infrastructures. This good practice contributes to data availability. Vendors and  service providers are encouraged to read the ENISA Internet Infrastructure Threat  Landscape (for network components) 142.  Remote attacks  GP-SF-06 - Protect remote monitoring and administration interfaces. Vendors  should protect all monitoring and administration interfaces by mutual  authentication and access control mechanisms.  Remote attacks,  theft  Security functions -  cryptography  GP-SF-07 - Do not create proprietary cryptographic schemes, but use state-of- the-art standards instead. If needed, consider getting advice from security  experts or your national cybersecurity agency. C-ITS platform143 could also be  used for advices. If no recommendations exist for vendors at a national level,  ENISA recommendations should be considered as a reference144.  This applies also to random number generation, which is a critical part of the  cryptographic support, which should meet quality measures on statistical output  (for example based upon national requirements145).  Additionally, consider the expected life duration of the vehicle and find advice on  the relevant key size (national recommendations might, in some cases, be based  on shorter lifespans than a consumer car).  All  GP-SF-08 - Rely on an expert in cryptography, notably for interfacing with HW  accelerated cryptography or secure elements, or even using or configuring a  standard implementation. At least, code review should be performed to ensure  that HW or a standard implementation of cryptography is properly used. The code  review would ideally be performed by a third party, but independent internal  code reviews can also be of a high quality.  All  GP-SF-09 - Consider using dedicated, and independently audited, hardware  security modules. The standard for independent assessment of security HW  should be either FIPS 140-2, or a Common Criteria certification following relevant  Protection Profiles. If needed, consider getting advice from security experts or  your national cybersecurity agency.  Persistent vehicle  alteration  GP-SF-10 - Cryptographic keys should be securely managed, which means  securely generated, distributed (or provisioned), used, stored, and deleted  (including revocation). Manufacturers, as well as Tier-1/Tier-2 and aftermarket  vendors should consider very carefully the revocation mechanisms associated  with their components, especially for OTA provisioning or key management. If  needed, consider getting advice from security experts or your national  cybersecurity agency.

Vendors should identify all data relating to an  identified or identifiable person. In the case of smart cars, this may especially  include location-based data. Consider getting advice from your national data  protection agency.  Surveillance  GP-SF-12 - Implement transparency measures. The interactions with the user  (which should not be limited to the Terms and conditions) enable to cover the  legal transparency requirements.  Surveillance  GP-SF-13 - Design the product/service with legitimate purpose and  proportionality in mind. The actors must ensure that themselves and their  subcontractors or suppliers do not process user data more than needed, and do  not pursue an illegitimate purpose with regard to user data. As a general rule,  third party components integrated in the device or third party cloud services  should not access user data that have not been anonymized or pseudonymized  unless user agreement has been obtained.  Surveillance  GP-SF-14 - Define access control, anonymity and unlinkability measures to  enforce the protection of private data. These measures are typically access  control measures, pseudonymity and unlinkability measures (such as ensuring  that data is not correlated))146, and eventually anonymity measures. Anonymity  measures may be “one-way” or “non-reversible” (such as truncation or a hash  functions) or “reversible” such as encryption.  Surveillance  GP-SF-15 - Define measures to ensure secure deletion of user data in case of a  change of ownership. More generally, a secure factory-reset of the firmware and  configuration should be available on the vehicle.  Surveillance  Security functions -  Identification,  authentication,  authorization  GP-SF-16 - Use mutual authentication for remote communication. Devices or  users connecting to a server must be able to authenticate the server. Reciprocally,  servers must be able to authenticate clients and users146.146  Remote attacks  GP-SF-17 - Use multi-factor authentication for user authentication. Users should  be authenticated by 2-factor authentication whenever possible, including for  authentication to cloud services or mobile interfaces, as well as local  administration sessions of devices.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-18 - Implement access control measures to separate the privileges of  different users and the privileges of different applications as well as to ensure  traceability of access and modifications. In practice, privileged operations should  not be readily accessible to normal users. Implementing privilege levels, rings or  domains can also be extended to application separation.  OEMs and Tier Actors shall employ a sufficient and flexible infrastructure for  “distinct” cryptographic keys per Tier Actors, garage personnel or vehicle  owner147.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-19 - Allow and encourage the use of strong passwords. This concerns all  possible uses of passwords: direct device interfaces such as JTAG, but also web,  mobile or cloud interfaces. However, the use of passwords in general may cause  safety issues for user interactions in a moving vehicle; this good practice is  recommended mainly for setup and pairing activities, and especially for  administration or diagnostic features.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  146 See C-ITS Platform, Final report, January 2016 – C-ITS Working Group 4 on Data protection and privacy –  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report-january-2016.pdf  147 See also http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en for the key distribution.  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report-january-2016.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  56  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  GP-SF-20 - Enforce session management policies to avoid session hijacking.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-21 - Provide the user with mechanisms to securely erase their private  data. For client information in remote infrastructures such as cloud services, data  sanitization must be in place. For user data present on vehicles, secure deletion of  encryption keys may provide enough protection, assuming that data is encrypted  in conditions that guarantee long-term confidentiality.  Surveillance  Security functions –  self-protection  GP-SF-22 - Define a consistent policy for self-protection. Vendors should  challenge every security function of their design, consider how they could be  bypassed or weakened, and eventually implement self-protection measures.  Persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-23 – Implement Hardware self-protection. Vendors should define  measures to protect hardware against physical attacks or observation. This  includes tamper evidence or tamper resistance, and secure design measures.  Persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-24 – Implement Software self-protection. Vendors should define measures  to protect existing security functions, typically by validating inputs and outputs, or  by separating the capacities of the different software components (levels of trust,  virtualization…).  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-25 – Protect Non-user data. Vendors should protect data enforcing the  security functions, such as keys or configuration data.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-26 – Perform Hardening. Vendors should actively reduce the attack surface  of the product or device. This includes removing or disabling unused services or  interfaces (especially debug interfaces), providing secure configuration by default,  as well as integrating malware protection. Some actors may consider intrusion  detection systems for internal subnetworks (for example CAN bus monitoring),  although this study will not conclude on the merits of these solutions.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-27 – Isolate components. Vendors should reduce the capacity for attackers  to jump from a component to another, either by a physical disconnection or by  using gateways.

Recommendations  Our recommendations aim at enhancing trust within the actors of the ecosystem (car manufacturers, tiers  and aftermarket vendors), as well as the trust from citizens in the smart cars available on the market.  Improve cyber security in smart cars  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors  The first recommendation of this report is the most obvious one: industry actors must establish holistic  secure development processes for their products. It must include design, development, testing, and security  maintenance in the field. This report gives a possible starting point for the establishment of good practices  and we expect that industry actors will adopt these practices and effectively enhance the security of their  products.  By providing a first set of good practices in this report, we hope that the industry should be able to overcome  the challenge of Insecure design or development identified in section 4.1.1.  Improve information sharing amongst industry actors  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors  Information sharing is essential for several reasons. Sharing can help industry actors to:   build trust between stakeholders ( car manufacturer, Tiers etc),   contribute to (make and) accept standards,   improve integration through commonly accepted practices,   help industry actors to find countermeasures and challenge the relevance of their security  mechanisms,   provide a mechanism to challenge and develop the skill of security teams, and   support the detection and mediation of security issues.  Therefore, stakeholders should share and discuss new attack methods found in the wild, in order to help the  whole community find countermeasures. Therefore, information sharing will also contribute to overcome  the challenge of Insecure design or development identified in section 4.1.1.  Eventually, information sharing structures are an efficient way to challenge the skills of security teams by  common sessions with other industry players, laboratories, or national agencies.  Communities for information sharing already exist, such as the US Auto-ISAC148 and the CarSEC149 group built  by ENISA. This report recommends pursuing this effort and consider developing an automotive incident  response capabilities.  Clarify liability among industry actors  148 See https://www.automotiveisac.com/  149 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  https://www.automotiveisac.com/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  58  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers, aftermarket vendors, insurance companies  This report identified a particular challenge related to liability (see section 4.1.2). The question of liability  needs to be addressed. The question of where liability may fall lies between Tier actors,  car manufacturers,  the vendors, aftermarket support operators and the end users. The liability issues have to be addressed in  the context of national legislation and case law. Where gaps are identified in national legislation, these  should be addressed.  Criteria and processes  There are many ways to define criteria and processes to pinpoint liability in cases of security issues. We give  hereafter an example of such a process:   The HW vendor could be rendered “liable” by a certification of the hardware. The HW vendor could be  considered liable for any issues occurring in the HW, provided the OS or runtime environment complies  with the HW security guidance;   The vendor of the OS or runtime environment could be rendered “liable” by a certification of a  composite product (consisting of the runtime environment and a given security hardware). The vendor  could then be considered liable for any issues occurring in the OS or runtime environment, provided the  applications comply with a specific set of rules150. The notable point here is that the rules are meant to  allow an automated verification, typically by code analysis. Such analysis could, for example, be  performed when an application is submitted to an app store.  This example typically follows the practice of composite evaluations under the Common Criteria scheme and  is applied today in the smartcard environments. While car manufacturers are not expected to directly use a  scheme like Common Criteria, a similar approach would contribute to ensure:   That a given HW is a secure basis for an ECU   That a given OS is secure when used on a given HW   That clearly defined, and easily verifiable rules have been defined for applications, so that they do not  threaten then security of the OS  While it is generally accepted that evidences need to be given for the previously points, the processes that  should be followed may differ.  A first step for the security of these systems is to build robust and clear security specifications that will be  followed all over the lifecycle of the development and deployment of a car. Evidences that a system follows  these specifications should be systematically be provided.  A confirmation of the fulfilment of these requirements could be done by performing security evaluations  and/or certifications (under a well-adapted certification scheme).  Actors of the automobile industry are challenged by legal product liability regulation (comprising the “smart”  devices), which includes also systems or services contributed by subcontractors. Because of this reason, early  contact of the car manufacturer with its subcontractors on one side and the dedicated (product) liability  insurer on the other is recommended. Contractual agreements can be used in order to preserve each actor’s  rights.  150 See http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationform.asp?fid=7828  http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationform.asp?fid=7828  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  59  Achieve consensus on technical standards for good practices  Recommendation intended for: industry groups and associations  This reports lists good practices (see section 4.1), which are not meant to be directly applied on a car design.  Instead, they are meant as an input for a standardization effort. Industry actors should be aware that a  security standard for smart cars should challenge all the categories described in these good practices, in  order to be relevant security-wise. The details of the security requirements, on the other hand, must be  carefully built with regard to actual products, and this report recommends that these requirements are  subject of transparency and sharing between the different actors.  Following discussions with different participants in this survey, it is not recommended to create a new global  standard applied to any present and future automotive, but different actors should use and combine the  existed standards in order to better fit them in their use cases. The created consensus should be the golden  mean between standards, regulation and in-house solution.  Define an independent third-party evaluation scheme  Recommendation intended for: industry groups and associations  As security awareness increases among car manufacturers, they now include security in the life-cycle of their  product:   Requirements for their products for the design phase,   Security validation once the product is ready, to check conformity to these requirements and robustness  of security functions,   Security maintenance of the product through updates.  However, the automotive industry mostly assesses security with the same methods as safety (following  methods similar to ISO 26262 or MISRA). These standards marginally address security, and help reducing  malfunctions and failures (random and systematic faults), but do not protect against attacks.  This issue is part of challenge of Safety and security process integration described in section 4.1.3. In order  to overcome this challenge, the industry should define security validation processes that explicitly address  abuse cases and attacks, which requires a simulation of such attacks (in other words, penetration testing).  This requires different skills, and a different mindset as validation testing based on compliance to  specifications. For this reason, we recommend to build upon the existing skills and evaluations schemes  already in use amongst security professionals.  An example of such a scheme can be found in the initiative led by the Car-to-car communication consortium,  which aims at defining a Common Criteria Protection Profile (PP), at the EAL 4 level, for vehicle  communication devices151. The PP may not address all the categories of good practices of this report.  However, the integration of the Common Criteria scheme ensures the security assessment by skilled third- party laboratories, supervised by national cybersecurity agencies, following a standard process.  151 https://www.car-2-car.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Forum_2012/Workshop4_operational_Security.pdf  https://www.car-2-car.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Forum_2012/Workshop4_operational_Security.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  60  Some initiatives152 153  ask for collaboration on the security topics from the automotive industry, and suggest  dedicated security testing from actors skilled in penetration testing. Also, AUTOSAR and GENIVI have  established their own security projects, led by security experts.  We suggest that the industry builds on these examples to clarify a shared standard for security validation.  There is a need to define which method should be used (from basic security checks to penetration testing),  the expected amount and depth of testing depending of the component to be tested, and the trust model  for these tests (for example, certification of a third-party auditor with the authority to grant certificates  based on security evaluation).  Build tools for security analysis  Recommendation intended for: industry groups and associations, security companies  Additionally to previous recommendations, industry actors may find other ways to improve their security  testing skills. In particular, the development of dedicated tools appears as relevant for several activities.  Many established tools from the software can be readily re-used without significant modification.  This report provides a first effort in the definition of tools for:   Asset identification:   See Section 2.2 providing a first categorization of assets,   Threat modelling:   See Section 3 providing a first categorization of threats,   See Appendix A providing example of scenarios and risk ratings formulas according to the TVRA  method.  Industry actors should challenge these tools and further contribute on topics where tools provide the most  value:   Secure implementation, supported by static analysis during development, with rulesets adjusted to the  automotive environment;   Security testing, for example by defining fuzzing tools;   Security monitoring, for example by defining intrusion detection on technologies such as CAN.  Improve exchanges with security researchers and third parties  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors  Establishing communication channels between researchers, academics and the industry has benefited a  number of sectors.  In order to improve this communication, workshops, conferences, working groups, etc. should be organised.  Tools like responsible disclosure guidelines and bug bounty programs should be considered to be of special  value to enhance the information exchange.  152 https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/  153 https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html  https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/ https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  61  This kind of exchanges will be obviously quite beneficial for the sector, as security requirements can be taken  into account from the early stages of the system lifecycle all the way to implementation and deployment.

Appendix A: Detailed risk ratings for the attack scenarios  These scenarios have various levels of likelihood and impact on sensitive assets. To illustrate this, hereafter  is an example of risk rating. The rating uses the risk assessment method defined in TVRA, but:  - This should not be considered a substitution for a real risk assessment on a car system  - We apply this method to attack scenarios instead of vulnerabilities (in the TVRA sense)  For these reasons, this rating should only be seen as a way to show how threats need to be assessed, in  order for manufacturers to define priorities on the security issues that they might try to prevent.  The Table 8 hereafter summarizes the ratings for the scenarios selected in this report, while Table 9 gives a  rationale to explain the ratings.

Attacks threatening  passengers safety  Intensity is considered high, since the attack typically allows to be performed by several agents at a time (exploit kit), or to be performed  on several vehicles at a time (sequentially assigned phone numbers). Asset impact is high, since safety is at risk. Time, expertise,  knowledge of the ToE and equipment are all rated in a way that reflects existing attacks made by researchers (for example Miller and  Valasek). Opportunity is estimated at \"moderate\" as an attacker can work on their own vehicle, which means it still is expensive, and  restricts the number of models on which the attacker can work.  2. Persistent vehicle  alteration by the  legitimate user  Intensity is rated as \"single instance\", since a physical access is required. Impact is rated as high. The attacker may damage their vehicle  beyond repair, and may also put their own safety at risk. Expertise is rated as proficient, since the scenario is typically aimed at proficient  users trying to tune or modify their own vehicle. Knowledge of the TOE is supposed to be \"restricted\": online communities are a factor of  information-sharing for this public, and information known only by garages may be found in such communities. Time is rated under a  month for the same reason. Opportunity is estimated at \"easy\", since an attacker typically work on their own vehicle (even if one may  argue that the vehicle is still, and restricts the number of models on which the attacker can work. Equipment is supposed to be standard.  3. Persistent vehicle  alteration by  diagnostic equipment  Intensity is moderate because while it needs a vehicle to be accessed via diagnostic equipment, an example of this has been described as  repeatable on a wide range of models. Asset impact is high due to the potential safety risk. Time is estimated at under 3 months. Expertise  is \"expert\" because the attacker needs car-specific knowledge (to alter an ECU firmware), as well as they need to know how to reverse a  DLL and exploit bad digital signature implementations. Knowledge of the TOE is expected to include \"restricted\" information, due to the  attacker having potentially access to restricted diagnostic tools and data. Opportunity is rated at \"moderate\" since most of the work is  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  67  performed on the DLL, which is more readily accessible than the vehicle. Equipment is rated at \"specialized\" since an access to diagnostic  tools will be needed at some point.  4. Theft  Intensity is considered \"single instance\": while it can be repeated on several vehicles of the same model, there is still needs a physical  access for each (since theft is the ultimate goal). Impact is medium (as opposed to safety issues that are considered High). Time is  estimated at under 1 month, to reflect the fact that information sharing within criminal networks may contribute to a relatively easy  reproducibility of attacks. Expertise is estimated at proficient, since the simplest methods are similar to remote control hacks that are  already used today [reference needed]. Opportunity is moderate. Only standard equipment is required  5.1 Targeted  Surveillance  Intensity is by definition \"single instance\". The impact is considered Medium, since safety may only be threatened in a second step  Time is supposed to be inferior to 6 months, since a physical access is possible  5.2 Mass surveillance  Intensity is \"Moderate\", since it is only repeatable for cars having a given set of vulnerabilities. The impact is considered Medium, since  safety may only be threatened in a second step  Time is supposed to be superior to 6 months, since a remote exploitation is needed  5.3 Surveillance (via  cloud)  Intensity is \"High\", since it is repeatable for all vehicles using the same cloud services (possibly whole fleets for a leasing company, etc.).  The impact is considered Medium, since safety may only be threatened in a second step  Time, expertise, opportunity and equipment are rated to reflect that the technical domain is widely known to potential attackers (Cloud  APIs and interfaces)  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  68  8. Appendix B: Detailed good practices  8.1.1 Policy and standards  Table 10 summarizes the good practices selected during the interviews.  Table 10: Policy enforcement good practices as selected by interviewees  POLICY AND STANDARDS DETAILS  Enforce liability manufacturer for tier-1 and tier-2  Enforce liability manufacturer for damages due to compromised garage  Adhere to regulation -  When consulting experts, a few policy enforcement topics were discussed:   Industry actors should, as a first step, adhere to regulation related to security and privacy. Well aware  of the regulation, several experts highlighted the lack of proper cybersecurity regulation for their field;   Car manufacturers should be held liable for damages due to other actors under their control, notably  Tiers and garages;   Enforcing liability for damages due to aftermarket products was less a consensus amongst interviewees.  The measure is practically difficult, thus is addressed in this report under the Gaps and Challenges  section (4.1);   Eventually, liability can only be measured by the compliance to a shared standard and process, which is  also lacking today (see 4.1)  8.1.2 Organizational measures  Table 11 hereafter summarizes the good practices selected during the interviews.  Table 11 : Organizational measures as selected by interviewees  ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES GOOD PRACTICE  Designation of a security team  Design  Pen-testing  Risk management  Corporate security  Training and awareness  Information Security Management  System  Define an ISMS (ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SAE J3061 section 7…)  Automotive Security Engineering  Follow ISO/AWI 21434  Designate a dedicated security team. As dealing with cybersecurity issues requires a very narrow set of  skills, actors of the smart car industry should rely on specialists for several kinds of activities, notably risk  management, secure design, training and awareness, penetration testing and corporate security. Whether  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  69  this security team should be in-house or a third-party company is not indifferent in some cases; in particular,  risk management and corporate security require too much company knowledge to be easily outsourced.  Define a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS). Vehicles in the wild cannot be  completely protected if the company itself is not able to protect some particularly sensitive assets. For  example, if vehicles or components have keys injected during production, the risk of leaking these keys may  be more important on the company site than on vehicles themselves. For this reason, an effective ISMS may  be of some help. The SAE J3061 describes such an ISMS154, and references to standards often used to this  purpose (ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53).  8.1.2.1 Secure Development or outsourcing  Assess the threat model and use cases. This report gives examples of attack scenarios, along with a risk  rating, inspired by the TVRA method, for each scenario. Similar (albeit more detailed) risk assessment is to  be expected from any actor involved in smart car components development. The threat analysis itself can  follow several possible methods, none of them being a standard. SAE-J3061 describes a TARA (Test And Risk  Assessment) phase, which fully supports the EVITA, TVRA, OCTAVE and HEAVENS approaches.  Provide security by design. The security should be taken into account no later than the design phase, in  order to avoid unnecessary workarounds, refactoring costs, or worse: leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed  because a fix would be unpractical or too expensive. In particular, the secure design should demonstrate  how the vehicle security covers the threats identified in the risk assessment. Design should also take into  account cybersecurity key principles such as defence in depth or principle of least privilege155 , or the use of  a hardware-supported Trusted Computing Base (TCB) small, secure and trusted, for critical services.  Implement and test the security functions. The test phase should also assess how hard it is to bypass the  existing security functions, activity which is typically performed by penetration testing. Examples of security  controls and measures are described in the next section. These technical measures are sorted using  categories loosely adapted from the Common Criteria156 security certification standard. These categories  are:   Security Audit: security events must be logged, and users should be notified whenever needed;   Communication protection: communication should be protected against disclosure, modification,  replay and denial of service;   Cryptography: Confidentiality, integrity and authenticity must be protected by using strong and  standard cryptography. Keys must be managed securely, and the use of a trust infrastructure (such  as PKI) is encouraged;   User data protection: the integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of user data must be protected.  Confidentiality protection must be defined with regards to privacy issues;   Identification, authentication, authorization: strong authentication methods must be used, as well  as access control mechanisms. Passwords and sessions should be managed accordingly;   Self-protection: HW and SW self-protection measures should be in place to protect previous security  functions. Data used to enforce these security functions should be protected, and hardening should  be used to reduce the attack surface.  154 See section 7 of SAE-J3061, Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems, January 2016  155 See for example section 5 of SAE-J3061, Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems, January  2016  156 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  70  8.1.2.2 Security measures until the end-of-life  Following the good practices described so far shall significantly reduce the risk of having vulnerabilities found  in the product, however this risk can never be avoided. Vendors shall not only pro-actively perform a survey  for new vulnerability but also provide a secure and reliable device update mechanism to allow fixing  vulnerabilities.  Assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities using appropriate assessment procedures. Determine  the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the  desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.  Define a security update policy. The notion of security update has to be applied to smart cars with several  specifics in mind:  - The timing and conditions of the update are different in a vehicle than on a personal computer (users  should not be forced to wait for an update before they can start driving. On a similar note, it would be  unacceptable to disrupt operations when the vehicle is driving);  - A connected vehicle includes several types of components with different update policies: apps, secure  elements and ECUs cannot be updated the same way. While a secure OTA update seems theoretically  possible for all components, the need for physical updates might still be present in the next years in  many cases;  - Standard are still missing for these operations. While several OTA update framework already exist in  several domains, the car community still has to commit on a given, secure process if they want the same  channels to be used for manufacturers, Tier-1, Tier-2 and aftermarket developers. Some specific aspects,  such as certificate formats, might also need standardization to be fully adaptable to the connectivity  constraints of connected vehicles.  Some recommendations apply to the update policy:   The end-user must be informed of the support period of the device and of the end of support for security  fixes.   A patch may consist of a workaround if the developer did not yet provide a fix.   When over-the-air updates are not available, a plan for product recalls shall be considered.   For online services supporting smart cars, a rollback to a secure state must be possible.  Other aspects of the update cannot be addressed directly by this study. For example, applying security  updates must be done only when it cannot cause a safety issue, which requires each manufacturer to define  appropriate policies. In the same manner, manufacturers may have to think whether a vulnerable  component can, or should, be put offline when found vulnerable.  Perform vulnerability survey. Once a device is on the market, the vendor must perform a vulnerability  survey and fix security flaws accordingly. The vulnerability survey should include developer findings, on-line  researches, CERTs advisories, as well as input from customers and security researches. Eventually,  vulnerabilities impacting user data should be communicated as transparently as possible. The EU Opinion  03/2014 on Personal Data Breach Notification from the Article 29 Working Party gives examples of such  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  71  situations157. Manufacturers already move towards using dedicated Security Operations Centers to monitor  their infrastructures158. While a SOC generally do not delve into in-vehicle vulnerabilities, it may:   Detect anomalies that are an indication of a vehicle compromise   Prevent compromising critical functions of the infrastructure, such as remote provisioning or OTA  updates  Building a strong security community on a given domain gives many benefits:   Information sharing groups such as CarSec in Europe, or ISACs, can contribute to raise awareness  amongst industry actors;   CERTs prove useful in informing users of possible vulnerabilities and remediation. While existing CERTs  can occasionally play this role for automotive use cases159, dedicated incident response capabilities  might prove more efficient.   Having a transparent dialog with security researchers, may provide manufacturers with a quicker  assessment of their products’ possible flaws. It may also “push” the whole community towards more  responsible disclosure practices,   Setting up bounty programs, as already done by several car manufacturers, can also help finding flaws  before they are exploited by malicious actors.  A few more recommendations apply:   A policy for vulnerability handling and disclosure awareness should be defined160.   Bug bounty programs can also provide an incentive to third-party researchers161 162.   Known vulnerabilities must be patched163.  Check the security assumptions regularly during life-time. The devices and services made assumptions to  ensure that the security requirements are sufficient. Vendors and users should be encouraged to check  regularly that these assumptions are still valid. For example: limitations in the usage of the vehicle164,  assumed properties of the environment165, assumed properties of cryptographic properties 166…  157 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion- recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf  158 See for example https://www.sogeti.com/explore/press-releases/Sogeti-sets-up-a-security-operations-center-for- the-Renault-Group/  159 See for example Vulnerability Note VU#615456 - Lemur Vehicle Monitors BlueDriver LSB2 does not authenticate  users for Bluetooth access - http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/615456  160 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU  161 See FTC, Careful Connections - https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections- building-security-internet-things  162 See also the global bounty aggregator https://firebounty.com  163 See Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015 or FTC - Careful Connections  164 For example, users may be advised to remove connectivity features from their entertainment system until a fix has  been found for a given vulnerability  165 For example, vendors should perform a survey to be able to remove a compromised CA from the certificate store.  166 For example, vendors should check regularly this assumption, for example if a new cryptographic attack puts users  at risk unless they use longer keys or change their cryptographic suites.  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf https://www.sogeti.com/explore/press-releases/Sogeti-sets-up-a-security-operations-center-for-the-Renault-Group/ https://www.sogeti.com/explore/press-releases/Sogeti-sets-up-a-security-operations-center-for-the-Renault-Group/ http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/615456 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections-building-security-internet-things https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections-building-security-internet-things https://firebounty.com/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  72  Protect the software update mechanism. In all cases, the update process requires the vehicle to  authenticate the party providing the update, as well as the carrier of this update (for example SMS  authentication does not replace the firmware signature, but is used as a complementary countermeasure)  Security updates provide protection against vulnerabilities found during the life of a device or application167.  However this comes at a cost, since support of this functionality also provides an entry point for an attacker.  In particular vendors should:  o Provide automatic and timely security updates168;  o Protect the updates (typically via encryption and digital signature). The update files must not contain  sensitive data 169. The signature must be verified before the update is applied;  o Protect the application of an update on the device. An attacker should not be able to trigger a  firmware installation without an authorization;  o Protect the security update interface against attacks;  o Maintain the update server, to avoid attackers using an obsolete domain name to push malicious  updates170.  Raise users’ awareness. Vendors should explain users what actions can contribute to mitigate potential  threats, especially how to securely use interfaced systems such as a smartphone.  8.1.3 Security functions  This section is structured following the lifecycle of smart cars. Steps are inspired by previous work from  NHTSA/NIST171  8.1.3.1 Security Audit  Security events must be logged172, and access to the logs must be documented and protected from  disclosure to unauthorized users. Logs are also needed for device integration. Typically, Tier-2 suppliers  must give possibility for Tier-1 suppliers to understand security events happening in their products. However  logs may also give information to an attacker, which is a serious security drawback. For this reason, the audit  trail must be protected173  Notifications should be easy to understand and help users find a remediation or workaround. HW and  embedded systems should provide clear error data that can be leveraged upon by the SW vendors.

In particular, users must be notified in the case of security events175. Notification might vary greatly  depending on the type of software considered. Mobile applications notification, messaging such as SMS or  e-mail, hardware interfaces such as LEDs, dedicated error messages to a gateway176…  8.1.3.2 Communication protection  Provide end-to-end protection in confidentiality and integrity using protocols that resist to replay attacks.  Favor methods providing forward secrecy whenever possible. This should be true even for the  communication of already encrypted data177; encryption must cover not only WAN traffic (internet, mobile  network), but also local network178.  Mitigate vulnerabilities or limitations of standard security library. Using a standard security library does  not mean that the product will automatically be secure. Developers must be aware of the vulnerabilities  (due to a flawed implementation) and limitations (vulnerability of the protocol itself) of the third-party  components they use. They should mitigate them whenever possible by performing patching179 and by  securing the configuration of the communication stacks180, which might typically include Bluetooth181,Wi- Fi182, TLS183…  Consider denial of service as a usual threat to communication infrastructures184. This threat should be  addressed from the design phase of the infrastructures. On this topic, this study encourages the vendors and  174 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  175 See OWASP I8 | Insufficient Security Configurability  176 Developers should be aware that for some functions, an excess of clarity is a valuable information for an attacker.  As a common example, when a login fails, the product should not communicate to the user whether the error is due  to a non-existent login or a bad login/password combination. The optimal balance between not enough or too much  clarity is to be assessed during dedicated security testing.  177 See OWASP I9 | Insecure Software/Firmware, or Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015.  Many protocols use both transport layer and applicative layer protection. The need for applicative layer protection  comes from end-to-end protection needs: the transport layer could be exposed if different transport technologies are  used during the transmission, therefore needing a dedicated protection:   In TCP communications, TLS 1.2 is the default choice for securing the transport layer;;   Applicative layer can be protected by recognized cryptographic means, so as to protect confidentiality and  integrity of the payload.  178 See OWASP I4 | Lack of Transport Encryption  179 Third-party and open-source libraries need frequent patching: vulnerabilities are regularly found in all most open- source implementations, even those considered as “industry standard”. Communications protection work only as  long as firmware updates are available and applied to fix vulnerabilities.  180 Due to the existence of vulnerabilities in frequently used protocol implementations, configuration of the library is  a significant part of the security functionality. Developers should in particular be vigilant to the configuration of  cipher suite negotiation and key sizes: allowing weak cipher suites provides an entry point for attacks aiming at  downgrading the level of security of the exchanges (See for example CVE-2015-0204 at https://cve.mitre.org/cgi- bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204)  181 See the example of Bluetooth, including Bluetooth 4.0, in Guide to Bluetooth Security - Recommendations of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology - John Padgette, Karen Scarfone, Lily Chen  182 See for instance attacks on WEP http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/120.pdf , WPS PIN vulnerability  https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755  or the Pixie Dust attack on WPS https://passwordscon.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/08/Dominique_Bongard.pdf  183 SSL and TLS have a long history of security vulnerabilities (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457 ).  184 See OWASP I3 | Insecure Network Services  http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/120.pdf https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 https://passwordscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dominique_Bongard.pdf https://passwordscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dominique_Bongard.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  74  service providers to read the ENISA Internet Infrastructure Threat Landscape (for network components)185  or the GSMA IoT Device Connection Efficiency Guidelines186.  Protect remote monitoring interfaces. SMS commands should not be protected only by whitelisting187. For  this reason, privileged commands such as SMS administration commands shall be protected by mutual  authentication. More generally, protection of remote monitoring interfaces is crucial since they often  provide a highly-privileged entry point into a device. This protection includes access control for both the  gateway and ECU level and authentication mechanisms.  8.1.3.3 Cryptography  Many protection measures rely on cryptographic functions. In a broad definition, cryptography support for  security must include:   Symmetric or asymmetric encryption;   Message authentication and integrity;   User/entity authentication;   Hash functions;   Digital signature;   Key management;   Random number generation.  Do not create proprietary cryptographic schemes, but use state-of-the-art standards instead.188 Even a  home-brewed implementation of a standard is not a good practice when standard implementations are  available. If needed, consider getting advice from security experts or your national cybersecurity agency.189  If no recommendations exist for vendors at a national level, ENISA recommendations should be considered  as a reference.190 This applies also to random number generation, which is a critical part of the cryptographic  support. A possible recommendation would be the use of cryptographically secure pseudorandom number  generators.191  Rely on an expert in cryptography for interfacing with HW accelerated cryptography or secure elements,  or even using or configuring a standard implementation. These tasks are difficult for most of developers. If  not properly done, the security might be heavily reduced or even completely suppressed. This part should  be performed by an expert in cryptography or at least a third-party code review should be performed to  ensure that HW or a standard implementation of cryptography is properly used.  185 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic- landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure  186 http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/gsma-iot-device-connection-efficiency-guidelines/  187 The main reasons for this are that:   phone numbers can be spoofed.   whitelists are not secret   whitelists may be changed by other SMS commands (administration commands).  188 See for example see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015 or Careful connections by FTC  189 This study will not delve into the detailed requirements for cryptographic algorithms or acceptable keys sizes. One  can refer to “Algorithms, key size and parameters” report of Enisa (2014).  190 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-size-and- parameters-report-2014  191 See examples in http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/gsma-iot-device-connection-efficiency-guidelines/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-size-and-parameters-report-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-size-and-parameters-report-2014 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  75  Consider using dedicated hardware security modules. HW-based cryptography solutions may help avoiding  the incorrect implementation of cryptographic algorithms by software vendors, as well the coexistence of  multiple implementations of the same algorithms. They eventually provide implementations that are more  resource-efficient. Choosing HW accelerated cryptography means that a reasonable assurance must be  obtained on the quality of the HW implementation, since “bad cryptography” on HW will be leveraged on  all the SW using these functions192.  Eventually, using certified HW may solve most of these issues. In particular, Manufacturers may look for  independently audited HW. The standard for independent assessment of security HW would be in that case  either FIPS 140-2 or Common Criteria certification following relevant Protection Profiles. If needed, consider  getting advice from security experts or your national cybersecurity agency.  Cryptographic keys should be securely generated, distributed (or provisioned), used, stored, and deleted  (including revocation). Badly implemented key management can introduce vulnerabilities that may easily  be exploited. Devices without direct user interfaces are particularly vulnerable to PKI compromising. While  users of a PC can easily delete or install certificates, such devices rely mostly on remote administration, and  sometimes do not even allow end-users to perform such administration tasks. For this reason,  Manufacturers, as well as Tier-1/Tier-2 and aftermarket vendors should consider very carefully the  revocation mechanisms associated with their components. This is especially true when the mechanisms of  key provisioning and management are performed over-the-air193. If needed, consider getting advice from  security experts or your national cybersecurity agency194.  8.1.3.4 User data protection  Identify personal data. The interpretation of privacy protection raises many issues, one of them being to  successfully identify what can be considered a personal data. The definition according to the EU Directive  95/46/EC includes data relating to an identified or identifiable person. In the case of smart cars, however, it  may be safe to assume that most data related to the user activity are somewhat personal, especially  location-based data. This last approach will have to be continued throughout the whole product or service  192 Random number generators are a good example of vulnerable functions with an impact on many features.   As a general rule, a true random number should be used for key generation, but may not be required for  salts, initialization vectors… where a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number may be sufficient.  One may argue that using a cryptographically secure software pseudorandom number generator is more  secure than a badly implemented hardware “true random number generator”;   When using hardware claiming a “true random”, developers should consider using strong post-processing  functions. The functions used for that purpose are typically block encryption or hash functions;  More details on the different categories of random generators can be found in documents from national  cybersecurity agencies. See in particular A proposal for: Functionality classes for random number generators, Version  2.0, 18 September 2011, by the BSI.  193 Industry players introduced the notion of remote provisioning for mobile communication (See for example GSMA  remote provisioning architecture and Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of  Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group). While keys are loaded in SIM cards in protected environment, the  “embedded UICCs” rely on remote subscription management systems to obtain key material. The protection of these  exchanges is consequently critical and must be assessed accordingly by manufacturers and vendors. Should the keys  be leaked, the user and the vendors could be at risk in many ways (loss of control over the device, eavesdropping,  credential theft, cloning…). More generally, the notion of confidential key agreement must be considered in IoT in  general, and smart cars in particular.  194 This study will not delve into the detailed requirements for cryptographic algorithms or acceptable keys sizes,  since national cybersecurity agencies already provide consistent guidance on this topic  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  76  lifecycle. Metadata should be considered as personal data by default, since they are subject to the same  threats195. Consider getting advice from your national data protection agency.  Implement transparency measures. The interactions with the user (which should not be limited to the Terms  and conditions196) enable to cover the legal transparency requirements197.  Design the product/service with legitimate purpose and proportionality in mind. The design phase of the  service or product, where the details of the processing have to be assessed with regards to the explicit and  legitimate purposes. The actors must ensure that themselves and their subcontractors or suppliers do not  process user data more than needed, and do not pursue an illegitimate purpose with regard to user data. As  a general rule, third party components integrated in the device or third party cloud services should not  access unencrypted user data unless user agreement has been obtained. Access control or  anonymity/pseudonymity measures gives assurance that user data is not accessed by these third parties.  Define access control, anonymity and unlinkability measures to enforce the protection of private data .  These measures are typically access control measures198, pseudonymity and unlinkability measures (such as  ensuring that data is not correlated199), and eventually anonymity measures. Anonymity measures may be  195 See http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/02/why-the-internet-of-things-is-a-problem-for-metadata-retention/  196 While the Terms and Conditions are a practical support for the vendors, many actors consider that this cannot be  considered a good practice. In particular, the user may be lost in a barely-legible legalese instead of being able to  make informed choices regarding their privacy. The US FTC gives recommendations on this topic, for example using  other supports such as registration emails.  197 The service or device provider must communicate  • The provider’s name and address;  • What data is collected, in layman terms;  • The purpose of processing, explaining notably why the processing is necessary for the performance,  to protect the vital interests of the data subject, or for compliance with a legal obligation;  • The recipients of the data;  • How the user can:  o Access all data processed about him,  o Require the rectification, deletion or blocking of data that is incomplete, inaccurate or isn't being  processed in compliance with the data protection rules.  • And all other information required to ensure the processing is fair;  • The service or device provider must require the consent of the user (or “data subject”).  On top of legal requirements, actors might also consider:  • Defining a strict opt-in policy;  • Enabling rectification, deletion or blocking of data without a reason;  • Ensuring data portability.  198 As a general rule, access to sensitive data should be controlled. For web services and components including  virtualization, access control could be completed by data isolation  199 The typical example is ensuring that the key used to browse the “customer database” is not the same as the key  used to browse the “usage analytics database”. However the situation is more complicated in practice: in the case of  smart cars, for example, network locator is a critical factor of linkability and should be taken into account accordingly.  Vendors should also be aware, that unlinkability can also:  • Cause trust issues and reduce attack mitigation capabilities (for example if a user cannot be notified  that their device is compromised);  • Cause a conflict with other legal requirements.  There is no one-size-fits-all good practice to balance unlinkability against other desired properties. The right balance  must be defined during the design stage by examining the associated risks.  http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/02/why-the-internet-of-things-is-a-problem-for-metadata-retention/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  77  “one-way” or “non-reversible” (such as truncation200 or a hash functions201) or “reversible” such as  encryption202.  Define measures to ensure secure deletion of user data in case of a change of ownership. More generally,  a secure factory-reset of the firmware and configuration should be available on the vehicle.  8.1.3.5 Identification, authentication, authorization  Use mutual authentication for remote communication. Devices or users connecting to a server must be  able to authenticate the server. Reciprocally, servers must be able to authenticate clients and users. Mutual  authentication203 consists in demonstrating cryptographically to both the client and the server that they are  communicating with the expected party. Mutual authentication is generally performed by using Public Key  Infrastructures (PKI) and certificates. These methods can be embedded in protocols such as TLS. However  using methods such as TLS does not grant a secure mutual authentication, unless:  • There is a certificate for both the server and the client;  • Certificate are properly validated (ruling out, for example, the use of self-signed certificates);  • Revocation lists are verified (alternatively, interrogations to an OCSP server);  • All services require this authentication step204. Which also means that even private URLs  accessible on a device must require authentication;  • Certificate pinning is used205.  As a side note, it must be noted that certificate pinning does not eliminate the need for certificate validation.  For example, the pinned certificate can be an intermediate or root Certificate Authority (CA) – which means  that the end certificate still has to be verified against the CAs.  Use multi-factor authentication for user authentication. Users should be authenticated by 2-factor  authentication whenever possible, including for authentication to cloud services or mobile interfaces206, as  well as local administration sessions of devices. Several methods can be used for multi-factor authentication.  As an example, the NIST provides a summary of these methods207.  Implement access control measures to separate the privileges of different users as well as the privileges of  different applications. In practice, privileged operations should not be readily accessible to normal users.  Reducing access to these services can be achieved either by disabling them (some studies recommend  200 Truncation is often used in the payment industry to anonymize cardholder data (see  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI%20SSC%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf )  201 Hash functions also have vulnerabilities (see for example  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). As for other cryptographic operations, robust standard  mechanisms should be preferred – vendors are encouraged to contact their national cybersecurity agency if needed.  202 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right, OWASP I5 | Privacy  Concerns and OWASP I10 | Poor Physical Security. As a sidenote, encrypted storage can also address authenticity or  integrity of user data if combined with the right mechanisms (for example AES-GCM).  203 SSee Symantec’s “Insecurity in the Internet of things”, March 12, 2015  204 See Home Automation Benchmarking by SYNACK, but also Making Smart Locks Smarter (aka.

Typically:  o An administrative access should always require authentication, and should ideally require unique  credentials for each device208;  o Not all individual accounts need to have access user data stored in the device or associated  services209;  o User accounts must be unique and separated for both local and distant services210;  o The device must distinguish between normal users and admin users. The latter only have access to  configuration functions211.  Implementing privilege levels, rings or domains can also be extended to application separation. Some  platforms implement such levels in hardware. If such functions are available, vendors are advised to use  them212. If not, operating systems already provide capacities to implement privilege control. At the firmware  / software level, access control must be used to control access rights of both applications and individuals. In  particular, not all applications need to be root or be executed in kernel land.  Allow and encourage the use of strong passwords. As it is regularly demonstrated, passwords are often a  weak point, whether they are weak user passwords or weak default passwords for products internal services.  Many devices use strong protection measures that are defeated by the lack of proper password  management213. This concerns all possible uses of passwords: direct device interfaces such as JTAG, but also  web, mobile or cloud interfaces. The usual measures are the following:  o Allow and encourage the use of strong passwords214, regardless of the presence of a second  authentication factor;  o Require the user to change credentials (username, password) at their first login215;  o Do not use hard-coded or “default” passwords or shared passwords, for instance for remote support  accounts;  o Do not store/expose passwords in clear text or with weak protection. Adaptative one-way functions  such as PBKDF2, scrypt or bcrypt should be preferred216;  208 See for example Foster, I., Prudhomme, A., Koscher, K., & Savage, S. (2015).

Hash functions such as MD5, SHA should  not be used for password protection, and even SHA256 or SHA3 would lack the additional work factor to be efficient  in a password storage context  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  79  o Use countermeasures against password guessing / account harvesting217. Services must be protected  against:  o horizontal guessing (testing a small number of usual passwords on a high number of user  accounts);  o vertical guessing (testing a high number of passwords on a single user account)  o This typically includes lock-out and delaying measures as well as high password strength /  entropy and diversification of passwords across devices. This also includes countermeasures  against account discovery or other means used to exploit password recovery functions218;  o Define options for password control. Typically, in the case of an administrator account, the default  option should require strong passwords by default219.220.  Password policies are eventually useless if the final user is not fully aware of the threats and good practices.  Vendors and service providers should consider raising the awareness of their users whenever possible, for  example to support the use of password managers. Examples of simple guidelines can be found in ENISA  Basic security practices regarding passwords and online identities221.  Since the use of strong passwords is not acceptable for normal users interactions in a moving vehicle, this  good practice is recommended mainly for setup and pairing activities, and especially for administration or  diagnostic features.  Enforce session management policies to avoid session hijacking. Session management also contributes to  making sure that the authorized user is the one using a given session. Typically:  • Sensitive functions such as administration via web services should require re- authentication.222  • No data should be transmitted before authorization.223  • Strong (random) session handlers should be used to avoid replay.224  • The user must know at any time if, and why, they are logged on a particular service, meaning  that no passive sign-up for third party services should be performed.225  8.1.3.6 Self-protection  Define a consistent policy for self-protection. Self-protection includes all measures taken to enhance the  robustness of previously mentioned security functions. Developers should challenge every security function  217 see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015  218 see OWASP I2 | Insufficient Authentication/Authorization  219 See OWASP I2 | Insufficient Authentication/Authorization and OWASP I8 | Insufficient Security Configurability  220 An example of policy can be found at https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/password- protection-policy. Policies may vary depending on the threat analysis and dimensions (such as password length) also  depend on attacker’s capabilities, especially the computing power, which grows constantly over time. Vendors are  invited to contact their national cybersecurity agency or CERT to stay informed of the state-of-the-art.  221 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/basic-security-practices-regarding-passwords-and-online- identities  222 See OWASP I2 | Insufficient Authentication/Authorization  223 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  224 See for example Veracode White Paper – The Internet of Things: Security Research Study, 2015, and also The  Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  225 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/password-protection-policy https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/password-protection-policy http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/basic-security-practices-regarding-passwords-and-online-identities http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/basic-security-practices-regarding-passwords-and-online-identities  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  80  of their design, consider how they could be bypassed or weakened, and eventually implement self- protection measures. The main topics considered here are:   Hardware self-protection: these measures aim at protecting the hardware against physical attacks  or observation. They include tamper evidence or tamper resistance, and secure design measures226   Software self-protection: software also contributes to protect existing security functions, typically  by validating inputs and outputs, or by separating the capacities of the different software  components (levels of trust, virtualization…).  Self-protection can also be addressed by validating the software state in-memory (in order not to  execute commands that it wasn't intended to do originally)227 or running only signed binaries (in  order to fight against dropping of malware).  Software self-protection can also be achieved by using two separated OS; a secure one to perform  security functions and a “normal” one (e.g. Linux, android) for any other use.228   Non-user data protection: data used to enforce the security functions should be protected. These  measures intend to avoid storing internal keys as cleartext, or any other data that could be used to  circumvent the service security.   Hardening: hardening consists in reducing the attack surface of the product or device. This includes  removing unused services or interfaces (for instance remote shell access to the device, which should  not be needed in production), as well as integrating malware protection. Hardening in smart cars is  particularly difficult to address, since these systems are behaving both like embedded and  networked systems.  Some actors have advocated that, in the CAN context, intrusion detection should be used on top of  firewalls, in the same manner as usual IT systems use both in a defense-in-depth approach229.  Dedicated solutions are already being commercialized, in order to provide CAN bus monitoring in a  fashion quite similar to the traditional IDS/IPS systems230. This study will not, however, conclude on  the respective merits of these solutions.  226 Hardware protection measures are related to:  - threats that are not related to privacy, and where the user itself is the attacker (for example fraud use cases);  - threats to equipment that is not protected by physical measures.  These are also related to attackers with very high skills and motivation profiles (which is for example the model used  in smartcards this includes for example:  - Use of tamper-resistant hardware such as Active shields;  - Protection against glitch;  - Protection against fault injection;  - Protection against side channels (for example electromagnetic or power analysis).  Examples can be found for example in Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of  Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group. Even if this level of security cannot be required for all smart home devices,  several physical protection measures can be recommended to ensure a better overall security on the device.  227 There are existing self-protection technologies (such as CFI - control flow integrity-) that allows to resist in memory  attacks such as ROP. These types of attacks are very common in IT, and are finding their way into IoT these days.  228 Efforts to develop a proven secure OS have already been started:http://www.provenrun.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/02/Proven-Security-for-the-Internet-of-Things-v2.pdf  229 See http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/  230 See for example http://iotbusinessnews.com/2016/06/08/34788-symantec-launches-new-iot-solution-help- carmakers-protect-zero-day-attacks/ or http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be- stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/  http://www.provenrun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Proven-Security-for-the-Internet-of-Things-v2.pdf http://www.provenrun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Proven-Security-for-the-Internet-of-Things-v2.pdf http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/ http://iotbusinessnews.com/2016/06/08/34788-symantec-launches-new-iot-solution-help-carmakers-protect-zero-day-attacks/ http://iotbusinessnews.com/2016/06/08/34788-symantec-launches-new-iot-solution-help-carmakers-protect-zero-day-attacks/ http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/ http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  81   Isolation: this subset of hardening measures is especially relevant for the car industry. Isolation of  components aims at reducing the capacity, for an attacker, to jump from a component to another.  This notion is found in the two main paradigms for CAN bus isolation in cars:  o Solution 1 : the CAN bus related to driving systems is “air gapped”, that is, completely  isolated from the infotainment network and internet  o Solution 2 : Systems are connected, but a gateway is in place to ensure the isolation between  networks, typically by access control mechanisms  These two solutions have architectural consequences – for example, the first only allows physical  updates, while the second allows OTA updates.  Studies argue that the second solution is gaining momentum, especially now that the eCall  regulation requires a SIM-card to be present in all cars, which provides a channel for updates231.  More generally, a separation of telematics and infotainment traffic is recommended allowing  specialized handling of packets regarding intrusion and malware detection.   Updates: updates are a subject of other self-protection measures. However, it is a quite important  function which is not always sufficiently protected. Updates may be used to update the vehicle’s  system with new functionalities, but also to provide corrections of security issues for the system.  Different parts can be of the need of an update, e.g. infotainment applications, maps, other  applications of the system or even the entire Operating System.  Nowadays, most of these updates are planned to be performed using OTA connectivity  OTA updating should reduce the cost of updating vehicle software, while improving functionalities  and fix issues (functional or security) on the car.  However, as already mentioned before, a particular attention has to be done on the downloaded  updates. Only signed updated should be finally installed whether an authentication could also be  required.  Most of the self-protection measures must be considered from the early design phases. Only the hardening  can be defined as an additional measure that can take place after the design and implementation phases.  Implement HW tamper evidence / tamper resistance. Devices vendors should be aware of tamper evident  or tamper-resistant mechanisms232. While they are not recommended in any case, vendors should consider  using them depending on the level of sensitivity of the assets stored on the device. In particular, even  constrained devices could be able to implement some kind of tamper evidence, even if they are not able to  implement resistance and response. More details on anti-tamper technologies can be found at different  sources, for example Black Hat233 or ICCC234 conferences  231 See for example Responsibility for Vehicle Security and Driver Privacy in the Age of the Connected Car,  IDC/Veracode, February 2016, IDC #EMEA41026016  232 This includes typically:  • Basic to moderate “Tamper resistance” mechanisms, which will slow an attacker (this typically includes  specific sealing methods for the casing, or the use of epoxy to protect components, or the entire board);  • Basic to moderate “Tamper evidence” mechanisms, such as tamper-evident seals or labels, or even switches  or sensors (light, power…) that will trigger a tamper response;  • Basic to moderate “tamper response” mechanisms such as sending an alarm to a remote service, logging a  security error or erasing sensitive data.  233 Introduction to Embedded Security, Joe Grand, Black Hat USA 2004  234 Physical protection: Anti-tamper mechanisms in Common Criteria security evaluations, Epoche & Espri, ICCC  Norway 2010  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  82  Implement HW protections at the design level. Hardware design can be used to make the device harder to  attack235.  Protect the software security functions by reinforcing interfaces and strengthening the application  separation at runtime. Software can contribute to self-protection measures for instance for robustness of  interfaces against bad inputs236. Secure implementation, thoroughly tested, will protect against common  attack vectors such as buffer/heap overflows or OWASP’s List of the Top Ten Web Vulnerabilities237. This  typically includes robustness of network interfaces against buffer overflows or fuzzing238. Implement trust  zones for the execution of applications (and/or ensuring segregation or execution protection), for example  by whitelisting applications, or by using Trusted Execution Environments or Secure boot, or SW  virtualization239…  The default configuration of devices and services should be secured. The operation mode of the device (or  service) should be the most secure one by default. A user might arguably want to disable a given security  function, but this should be the consequence of a deliberate action from the user, and the user should be  warned that this change reduces the security of the solution240.  Encrypted storage is not only useful to protect user data, but also to protect data that is needed to enforce  security on the device241. Internal data may be just as sensitive as user data, but are often not protected  235 In particular:  • Memory (including memory controller) can include measures such as secure erase and wear  levelling, Direct memory access, Non executable memory, …;  • Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design can contribute to security by including blind and buried vias,  buried bus lines, or electronic fuses and similar techniques, for example to deactivate JTAG access  (other uses can also be considered).  • System on Chip (SoC) design can include some of the previous measures, and can also include pin  placement, or the implementation of “system level” features such as HW Virtualization, micro  kernels, Secure boot, Trusted Execution Environments…  Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group  states that \"For chips with security features or functionality that may impact security it is important to understand  where these are located on the chip’s pin out. It is generally advisable not to use chips where these features are on  the outer two rows in high-security environments due to risk of fly wires being used\". Some labs consider today that  for \"grid array\" chip carriers, the outer three or four rows might be relatively easy to access for an attacker. In any  case, a consensus is needed amongst stakeholders and security labs on this topic, so cybersecurity agencies could  provide vendors with clear recommendations.  The ease of access to the components, as well as their removability, can also be considered during the design phases,  even if it cannot be the primary physical protection measure.  236 see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015  237 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project  238 OWASP I3 | Insecure Network Services  239 See for example Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015, IoT-A - D4.2 - Concepts and  Solutions for Privacy and Security in the Resolution Infrastructure  240 Providing a secure configuration by default means in practice that  • a remote service will use HTTPS by default  • setup processes include the necessary steps to upload any security configuration data such as  certificates  • the stronger password policies will be selected by default  • …  241 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right and OWASP I10 | Poor  Physical Security  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  83  enough, leading for example, to situations where \"hardcoded root credentials, API keys for Amazon Web  Services, URLs never meant to be known to end-users, and manufacturing network configurations\"242 can be  found in cleartext on devices. As a general rule, configuration data should be encrypted at rest and in  transit243.  Perform hardening to reduce the attack surface: remove unused services or interfaces, integrate  dedicated security software, activate memory or control flow protections. For devices that have a  complete operating system, several measures can be considered to harden the device, such as ASLR, non- executable memory, process segregation or sandboxing. Another measure is removing unused tools,  services and libraries244. Unnecessary services should not be present on the device (typically telnet must  always be deactivated, but even SSH or FTP can be deactivated in many cases). This type of measures is also  applicable at a network level: the device should not leave open ports, especially ports that could be exposed  via plug-n-play protocols245. The default configuration of the device should be based upon the most secure  parameters, and users should be warned if they have the possibility to roll back to less secure parameters.  For example multi-factor authentication should be the default configuration. Users should be warned if they  want to configure the service to single-factor authentication. Vendors should also consider integrating  malware protection to their systems246, since the smart home ecosystem provides many possible ways for  malware to enter a device (mobile, personal computer, device network interfaces…). Eventually, Vendors  should consider deactivation or protection of the external interfaces247, for example:  • protecting the physical debug interfaces such as JTAG/ISP (by password and physical action),  or physically deactivate the physical debug access;  • including mitigation to avoid exploitation of interfaces such as I2C/SPI buses or serial  interfaces;  • Suppressing or limiting to a local access248, the administration interfaces.  More generally, vendors should consider their means of protection for:  • Boot ROM interface;  • Firmware update interfaces;  • Configuration and calibration interfaces;  • Inter-processor IPC;  • USB external interfaces;  • Protection against DMA attacks249;  • No unnecessary external interfaces should be accessible from the exterior of the device250.  242 See A Primer on IoT Security Research, March 30 2015, Stanislav  243 See OWASP I8 | Insufficient Security Configurability and See Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber- Security for Internet of Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group  244 See Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015 and The Internet of Fails Where IoT Has Gone  Wrong and How We're Making It Right  245 See Home Automation Benchmarking by SYNACK, or OWASP I3 | Insecure Network Services  246 see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015  247 See for example Veracode White Paper – The Internet of Things: Security Research Study or Security of Things: An  Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group  248 See OWASP I10 | Poor Physical Security  249 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack  250 See e.g. OWASP I10 | Poor Physical Security  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Athens, Greece  TP-07-16-043-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-184-7  doi: 10.2824/87614  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/smart-infrastructures/intelligent-public-transport/smart-cities-architecture-model",

It encompasses use cases such as telematics,  connected infotainment or intra-vehicular communication. The report excludes Car-to-car as well as  autonomous vehicles as these technologies are not in use today. Practices discussed in this report concern  not only passenger cars but also commercial vehicles (such as busses, coaches etc) and aim to map the  current threats that passengers and drivers are exposed every day to. The goal is to secure smart cars today  for safer autonomous cars tomorrow.  Over the last few years, there have been a number of publications on attacks targeting automotive systems,  and in particular smart cars. An attack on a smart car would threaten the safety and privacy of passengers  and other citizens. These threats are already having a big impact on car manufacturers, with millions of cars  being recalled because of their vulnerability, not to mention the effects of the widespread media coverage  of the issues.  The objective of this study is to identify good practices that ensure the security of smart cars against cyber  threats, with the particularity that smart cars’ security shall also guarantee safety. The study lists the  sensitive assets present in smart cars, as well as the corresponding threats, risks, mitigation factors and  possible security measures to implement. To obtain this information, experts in the fields and areas related  with smart cars were contacted to gather their know-how and expertise. These exchanges led to three  categories of good practices: Policy and standards, Organizational measures, and Security functions.  The protection of smart cars depends on the protection of all systems involved (cloud services, applications,  car components, maintenance and diagnostic tools, etc.). However, the challenge resides mostly today in  the security of car components and aftermarket products, where security functions have to be implemented  in spite of several kinds of limitations: for example, security requirements may conflict with safety  requirements. Furthermore, the very large number of interfaces to secure may lead to planning and cost  issues; eventually, the long life of cars may create the need for dedicated security requirements.  The impact of attacks on a smart car has far-reaching consequences in terms of safety. The risk to the driver,  their passengers and other users of the road makes it a matter of national and European interest. For this  purpose, the following recommendations have been developed:  Recommendations for smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors:   Improve cyber security in smart cars. The industry actors should establish the good practices that  effectively enhance the security of their products.   Improve information sharing amongst industry actors. Information sharing helps industry actors  challenge the relevance of their security mechanisms according to field information. Communities for  information sharing already exist, and we recommend pursuing this effort.   Improve exchanges with security researchers and third parties. Industry actors should enhance their  contacts with third parties, especially from the security domain.  Recommendation for smart car manufacturers, tiers, aftermarket vendors and insurance companies:   Clarify liability among industry actors. Living in heavily-tiered environment, industry actors should  define processes to clarify their respective liability in case that security issues arise.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  07  Recommendation for industry groups and associations:   Achieve consensus on technical standards for good practices. The good practices listed in this report  are meant as an input for a standardization effort, rather than being directly applicable to a specific car  design. The details of the security requirements should be defined in the context of standards.   Define an independent third-party evaluation scheme. The existing safety standards for automotive  systems only marginally address security, and we recommend to define an independent evaluation  scheme.  Recommendation for industry groups and associations and security companies:   Build tools for security analysis. Industry actors can directly improve their security testing skills by  building tools for security testing and security monitoring.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  08  1. Introduction  Smart Cars integrate Internet of Things (IoT) components to bring added-value services to drivers and  passengers. These components communicate with each other and with the outside of the car (other cars,  external services).  Over the last few years, there have been many publications on attacks on automotive systems. A few of  them have been particularly under the eye of media, resulting in reputational damage for car manufacturers,  especially since several attacks were demonstrated as cheap and easy, as in the example of a teenager  unlocking and starting remotely a connected car1 with only $15 of simple electronics gear.  Beside reputational damage, the cost of cyber security is becoming an issue for car manufacturers.2 In the  past years, vulnerabilities were found and resulted in an ever increasing number of recalls:   Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek made a spectacular proof-of-concept of remote attacks by taking  control of a Jeep and sending it off-the-road3, forcing 1.4 million cars to be recalled;   Security researchers hacked the BMW ConnectedDrive4 and managed to remotely unlock cars, with  even more industrial impact than the Miller/Valasek hack (2.2 million cars had to be recalled);   More recently, even more vehicles (including most Volkswagen cars produced since 1995) have been  shown vulnerable to an attack on remote keyless entry5, thus once again increasing the size of  impacted fleet. This last issue marked a steep progression of the number of potentially affected cars,  which is in the order of magnitude of 100 million vehicles6.  Yet another example is the recent hack of Tesla electric cars7, requiring a software update for the car  operating system.  These threats have impacts on the security, the safety and the privacy of the passengers and of other  citizens.  The objective of this study is to identify the good practices to ensure the security of smart cars against cyber  threats, with the particularity that Smart Cars security shall also guarantee safety.  Objectives and scope  This study presents an analysis of the current situation in smart cars and considers the key factors in play,  including: how connectivity changed the security model of cars, how the heavily-tiered car ecosystem can  manage these issues, and how can security be integrated in existing, safety-oriented, product lifecycles.  Therefore, the following objectives have been set:   Review and analyse the architecture and interfaces of smart cars;  1 See http://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2015/02/23/14-year-old-hacks-connected-cars-with-pocket-money/  2 Anthony Foxx, Secretary, U S Department of Transportation and Mary Barra, the chairwomen and CEO of General  Motors Company, stress the importance of these issues in a keynote talk at the Billington Cyber summit 2016  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sPC2qHkq8  3 See http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/  4 See http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive- 2540957.html  5 See http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/08/hackers-use-arduino-to-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/  6 The affected company producing around 10 million vehicles a year.  7 See http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37426442  http://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2015/02/23/14-year-old-hacks-connected-cars-with-pocket-money/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sPC2qHkq8 http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/ http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive-2540957.html http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Beemer-Open-Thyself-Security-vulnerabilities-in-BMW-s-ConnectedDrive-2540957.html http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/08/hackers-use-arduino-to-unlock-100-million-volkswagens/ http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37426442  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  09   Study the car ecosystem actors and lifecycles;   List the main threats applicable to smart cars;   Collect good security practices;   Analyse, in relation to the identified good security practices, gaps in current implementations;   Explore limiting factors, impairments, constraints and potential incentives for the target audience to  deploy these measures.  Methodology  This study was carried out using a five-step methodology (shown in Figure 1) which begins at the initial  information gathering from official sources and experts in the field and ends in the development of a report  summarizing the findings and the recommendations to the target audience.  Figure 1: Methodology used to carry out the study  1. Identification of experts: the first step was to identify the experts in the field of smart cars security.  In order to obtain varied and well-balanced results, experts were selected from Manufacturers, tier- 1 and tier-2 suppliers, aftermarket product suppliers, academics, and other actors, such as  consulting companies, test and certification companies and governmental actors.  2. Desktop Research: initial research of already published documents in order to get as much  information about communication dependencies as possible. This notably allowed to:   Identify the assets and threats specific to smart cars through desktop research and interviews  with stakeholders in the smart cars domain;   Identify good practices to secure the critical assets (business and societal) from cyber threats   Analyse the most feared attack scenarios  1. Identification of  experts  2. Desktop  research  3. Collection of  experts and  stakeholders point  of view  4. Analysis  5. Conclusions and  recommendations  6. Workshop  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  10   Present the good practices in a practical way by showing how to overcome the selected end-to- end attack scenarios.  3. Collection of experts and stakeholders point of view: we engaged stakeholders through interviews  to understand the current status of security and their challenges. For that purpose, we developed a  questionnaire to understand the challenges and needs of car manufacturers and their suppliers;  4. Analysis: the fourth step was to analyse all the data obtained, including the results of the interviews,  gathering initial conclusions.  5. Conclusions and recommendations: the last step was to further analyse and contrast these results  with the experience of the consortium and external sources.  The study was validated with the stakeholders, through a review phase and a face-to-face validation  workshop. We also stayed updated with regard to the C-ITS Platform8 run by DG MOVE9, to synergize efforts.  Moreover input from the CARSEC10 expert group was used to finalize the deliverable.  EU Policy context  From a regulation point of view, few initiatives are specific to smart cars:   The European Parliament voted in 2015 to mandate the implementation of the eCall11 system in cars  commercialized after April 2018;   More generally, since smart cars consist of cyber-physical components, they are concerned by:   The General Data Protection Regulation12, replacing the Data Protection Directive13;   The Network and Information Security Directive (NIS)14, which will have an impact on cloud  services that may be associated with smart car components.  Other initiatives have been launched, independently from these regulations. In particular, the EU  Commission launched the AIOTI15 Alliance in 2015, in order to enhance the dialogue between actors  of the Internet of Things (IoT). An AIOTI workgroup is specifically dedicated to Smart Mobility, which  includes IoT use cases pertaining to the car industry.  A 2015 report16 from the AIOTI Smart Mobility workgroup may be used as an introduction to other  initiatives in Europe on this topic:   The European Technology Platform for Road Transport Research (ERTRAC)   Research and Development initiatives funded via Horizon 2020   The C-ITS Deployment Platform   The Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership (ECSEL)   The Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI)   Main standards developing Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs), alliances & open source  initiatives   FIWARE   An exploration of national or company initiatives  8 See http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en.htm  9 See http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm  10 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  11 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/ecall-time-saved-lives-saved  12 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG  13 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046  14 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/network-and-information-security-directive-co-legislators- agree-first-eu-wide-legislation  15 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti  16 See http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=11822  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/transport/index_en.htm https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/ecall-time-saved-lives-saved http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/network-and-information-security-directive-co-legislators-agree-first-eu-wide-legislation https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/network-and-information-security-directive-co-legislators-agree-first-eu-wide-legislation https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=11822  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  11  While most of them are strongly related to autonomous driving, several have to take into account  cybersecurity issues already present in today’s cars.  Target Audience  This report provides information on smart cars’ security including lifecycle (including the security  maintenance in the field) and business perspective (not focusing only on technical measures). Therefore, the  target audience is mostly Car manufacturers, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and Aftermarket suppliers.  1.4.1 Car Manufacturers  Car manufacturers design new cars and select their equipment according to marketing considerations.  Regarding manufacturing of the car itself, their role is mainly limited to the assembly of the various car  components provided by their suppliers. They provide to their supplier functional, safety and security  requirements for the components as well as qualification of the products.  They also have to take into account security, safety and privacy by design, especially since aftermarket  components may be added to the vehicle later by the user.  1.4.2 Tier-1 and Tier-2 suppliers  Car manufacturing is a heavily tiered ecosystem. Car manufacturers integrate components provided by  suppliers, which are labelled as “Tier-1”. While driving systems are usually a prerogative of the manufacturer  itself, Tier-1 suppliers may be in charge of manufacturing most of the components directly facing the final  user. From entertainment systems to car seats, a large part of the car cost may be associated to components  manufactured by Tier-1 suppliers.  While Tier-1 suppliers have direct contractual relationships with car manufacturers to provide car  components, the ecosystem also includes suppliers labelled as “Tier-2”. Tier-2 suppliers only have  contractual relationships with Tier-1 suppliers. They produce, for example, plastics, mechanical parts, molds,  electronic components or software.  Also some Tier-2 suppliers may also become Tier-1, for instance Operating System (OS) providers for the  multimedia system have direct contact with the car manufacturer to allow more control, customization or  monetization on the applications, or also secure components providers in order to propose personalization  or Over The Air (OTA) management services.  In some cases, the design of one single component may be shared between several parties. For example,  concerning a telematics platform, its hardware and operating system may be designed and manufactured  by a Tier-1 supplier, while the software application may be designed and uploaded by the car manufacturer.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  12  1.4.3 Aftermarket suppliers  Customers can also buy aftermarket products from other vendors; for example smart dongles used on the  OBD-II port, providing additional features to their car. More traditional aftermarket products may include  media players or third-party GNSS.  Structure of this document  This document contains the following sections:   Key aspects of the smart cars. This section details the typical architectures found in smart cars, as well  as the relationships between main actors of the ecosystem. It eventually lists the sensitive assets of  smart cars;   Threats. This section elaborates on the assets by listing the main threats on smart cars. Sample attacks  taken from the state-of-the-art are given as illustration of the way these threats can lead to car  compromising. Eventually, a few significant attacks are further detailed into Attack scenarios, to clarify  the different steps necessary for an attack, as well as the expected attack potential required for such  attack;   Key findings. This section describes the good practices able to mitigate the aforementioned attacks. It  also puts these good practices in perspectives by describing the current gaps and challenges for their  implementation, as well as the constraints and incentives for the actors of the ecosystem;   Recommendations intended to overcome gaps and challenges in the implementation of good practices;   Glossary and abbreviations  Further details are given in appendix:   Appendix A details the calculation of attack potentials used in the attack scenarios,   Appendix B gives further details on the good practices.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  13  2. Key aspects of the smart cars  Definition  In this study, we define Smart Cars as systems providing connected, added-value features in order to  enhance car users’ experience or improve car safety. It encompasses use cases such as telematics, connected  infotainment or intra-vehicular communication. Practices discussed in this report concern not only  passenger cars but also commercial vehicles (such as busses, coaches etc) and aim to map the current threats  that passengers and drivers are exposed every day to.  Even if different definitions of smart, connected cars can be found in the literature, no official all-accepted  definition exists. Here a indicative overview of the different definition so far: a first effort to define different  levels of automation for on-road vehicles is done in SAE J3016. Figure 2 illustrates the different levels of  automation for on road vehicles, as defined in SAE J3016. This study covers vehicles belonging to levels 1 to  3.  Another definition comes from the Amsterdam declaration17 which make a distinction between connected  cars (including cooperative driving: communication between vehicles and also with the infrastructure (C- ITS)) and automated driving (referring to the capability of a vehicle to operate and manoeuvre independently  in real traffic situations, using on-board sensors, cameras, associated software, and maps in order to detect  its surroundings). Following this definition, only connected cars are taken into account in the context of this  study.  This study excludes car-to-car as well as autonomous vehicles as these technologies are not in use today.  V2X18  interfaces are not taken into account in this report (in the sense of analysing their vulnerabilities or  defining explicit countermeasures), however the existence of V2X interfaces will be taken into account,  whenever it has an impact on the assets or threats to be considered.  The study encompasses use cases such as:   Telematics, used for example in the context of fleet management or geo-fencing;   Connected infotainment, which provides an integrated multimedia offer with potential added value  services (such as the access to an application store) and can access driving information (such as speed)  as well as control non-essential functions (such as air conditioning);   Intra-vehicular communication, where the infotainment connections can be shared with user devices,  typically by creating a hotspot within the vehicle.  17 See also https://english.eu2016.nl/binaries/eu2016-en/documents/publications/2016/04/14/declaration-of- amsterdam/2016-04-08-declaration-of-amsterdam-final-format-3.pdf  18 The notion of V2X encompasses Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-pedestrian  (V2P) use cases.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  14  Figure 2: Automation level of vehicles  Typical architecture and assets  We describe in this section the typical architecture of smart cars, and list the assets that can be distinguished  within such architectures. The architecture of subnetworks and protocols may vary from a vehicle to  another, therefore Figure 3 provides a high-level overview of such systems.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  15  Figure 3 : High-level architecture of a smart car  Most car architectures distinguish between different domains, interconnected by a central gateway, as  shown in Figure 3. Domains correspond to different, or sometimes independent, features of the car. All these  components may cause risks, should they be compromised. The impact of these risks may vary between  safety, security or privacy concerns.  For this reason, components of a smart car are described as assets and  require appropriate protection. Figure 4 hereafter lists a number of these assets. More details concerning  these assets, as well as some logical assets (Section 2.2.7), are given in the following sections.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  16  Figure 4 : Smart cars assets  We distinguish the components according to the following categories:   Powertrain control   Chassis control   Body control   Infotainment control   Communications control   Diagnostic and maintenance systems  2.2.1 Powertrain control  This domain is in charge of the chain between the energy source of the car and its transformation into  propulsion.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  17  ECUs and sensors  Modern cars are composed of many embedded Electronic Control Units (ECU) that control mechanical or  electronic systems of the vehicle19. While ECUs are different from one domain to another, here are a few  general explanations on the architecture of ECUs and TCUs (Telematics Control Units):   As other IoT systems, automotive devices often rely on the ARM platform for application processors  (other available architectures are Power, SH, V850, and TriCore)20. Processors for other usage may come  from many origins. However, due to the constrained operating environment in automotive  environments (temperature, humidity, lifetime), specific declinations of processors, not commercial- grade but automotive-grade, are used.   For increasing security, and in particular for vehicular communications, these systems may also rely on  a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a smart card core or a Hardware Security Module (HSM)21.   ECU/TCU applications may be written directly in assembly or rely on a specialized real-time operating  system, such as VxWorks (Wind River Systems), Integrity (Green Hills Software), or AUTOSAR.  Subnetwork  The powertrain subnetwork typically relies on the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol.  CAN22, an ISO standard since 1993, is by far the most well-known and popular bus, to which most of the ECUs  of the vehicles are connected. There may be several CAN buses in a vehicle, interconnected by a gateway,  to isolate the most critical functions (such as powertrain management) from the less critical (such as  multimedia). The traffic on this internal network varies from one solution to another; in some instances the  network can support several hundreds of messages per second; the CAN bus is a prominent example and  has been thoroughly studied by many researchers23.  CANs, as with other protocols described in this report, face issues related to bandwidth, scalability or  security; protocols such as Ethernet24, introduced in 2008, are, today, still limited to a subpart of the network  (multimedia, assisted driving…).  The FlexRey protocol (ISO 17458)25 is also being put in use starting from 2008.  Other components  19 Such as: powertrain, brake, suspension, airbag  20 See http://www.automotive-eetimes.com/news/arm-architecture-leads-automotive-market-semicast-finds  21 Embedded in the processor itself  22 ISO 11898-1:2015 Road vehicles -- Controller area network (CAN) -- Part 1: Data link layer and physical signalling  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=63648  23 Most notably in Miller, C., & Valasek, C.

ECUs and sensors  ECUs are similar to those found in the powertrain domains (see Section 2.2.1). They allow the control of  functions such as steering control, airbag control, braking systems, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems  (ADAS).  Subnetwork  The subnetwork typically relies on the CAN protocol (see Section 2.2.1), but also on protocols such as  FlexRay, or RF (e.g. for Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems). FlexRay, introduced in 2008, is faster than CAN  and designed for drive-by-wire applications which substitutes usual mechanical functions with software. .  Other components  This typically includes the steering and brakes, but also airbag, embedded cameras, rear-view mirrors, or  even windshield wipers.  2.2.3 Body control  The body control is in charge of the body, which means most of the time the passenger’s compartment and  trunk.  ECUs and sensors  ECUs are similar to those found in the powertrain domains (see Section 2.2.1). They allow passengers to  control various functions such as instrument cluster, climate control, or door locking.  Subnetwork  The subnetwork typically relies on the CAN (see Section  2.2.1), LIN/SAE J260226 (for door lock, air  conditioning, seat belts…), or RF protocols27 (Keyless/passive entry systems). LIN, a value-oriented variant of  CAN introduced in 2002, is based on a single wire, has simpler controllers and offers lower bandwidth.  Other components  This typically includes the dashboard display, air conditioning, but also the lights, direction or warning lights,  the doors, windows, seat belts, and even motorized or heating seats.  2.2.4 Infotainment control  This domain is generally separated from the remainder of the body. It includes navigation services,  communications (telephone, etc.) as well as entertainment services (head unit audio/video).  ECUs and sensors  26 LIN Network for Vehicle Applications http://standards.sae.org/j2602/1_201211/  27 Radio Frequency protocols include among others S-WAVE Smart Wave, Zigbee, Bluetooth low energy, Wi-Fi, IEEE  802.15.4,Z wave. RF modules are also commonly used in proprietary protocols, such as a car key fobs.  http://standards.sae.org/j2602/1_201211/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  19  ECUs are similar to those found in the powertrain domains (see Section 2.2.1). They allow passengers to  control various functions such as the Head unit for audio/video content, but also navigation, or interactions  with the user’s telephone. Services offered through this domain can vary greatly, for example:   Entertainment services (audio/video)   Internet access   Driving services such as traffic information, maps...   Additional services such as fleet management, digital tachograph, geo-fencing...28  These services cause infotainment ECUs to sometimes have specific architectures:  - For infotainment systems, operating systems from the mobile industry may also be used in ECUs  (Windows CE (phased out), Android, Tizen or WebOS)  - QNX is also used in systems dedicated to the integration of users’ smartphones into the vehicle  systems. For example, it is used in Apple Carplay and Android Auto technologies, which allows  the end-user to get the display of a mobile phone mirrored to the infotainment display, and grant  him access to its mobile applications.  - Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) and Linux Genivi are two open-source projects aimed to create  software solutions for automotive applications.  Subnetwork  The subnetwork typically relies on protocols such as MOST, but also on ad-hoc networks using Bluetooth or  Wi-Fi. Infotainment systems rely on wireless connectivity provided either by an embedded UICC or by an  end-user device (smartphone) connected by Bluetooth or with a USB cable. In addition, Ethernet can be used  to connect camera systems.  Other components  External media that are directly connected to the infotainment components, such as drives or phones,  should also be considered as an asset.  2.2.5 Communications control  This domain, contrarily to the previous ones, is not a subnetwork, but more frequently a set of  communication features offered by a Telematics control unit (TCU), acting as a gateway.  Gateways ECUs with Telematics and communications  The gateway provides both the connectivity and most of the security protections intended for the  communications (firewalling, authentication features…). It collects data from the various ECUs using one of  the vehicle data buses and provides Internet remote connectivity through an embedded GSM module or  using driver’s smartphone for instance. This unit is generally also coupled with a GNSS to obtain vehicle  positioning information. A number of use-cases that are leveraging TCU connectivity are:   Remote diagnostic (e.g. failure notifications, updating ECU SW/FW or ECU parameters)   Remote transmission of vehicle data   Crash reporting and emergency warning (eCall, that will be mandatory in Europe in 2018)   Stolen vehicle tracking or geo-fencing   Remote engine start  28 Depending on the vehicle architecture, these services can be can be spread differently, for instance as part of the  Telematics Gateway ECU (next section).  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  20   Fleet management, for instance for rental car companies (for example for trip tracking or diagnosis)   Insurance, for pay-as-you-drive insurance plans   “smart driving assistant” (e.g. for fuel efficiency or to improve driving habits)   Inform driver on the battery State of Charge (SoC) for Electric Vehicles (EV)   Eco-driving   Big Data applications  External communication networks  The TCU typically provides 3G or Wi-Fi connectivity to provide several kinds of services, for example eCall,  but also V2X communication29. Other protocols are possible, as shown in Figure 5 hereafter, which gives an  example of external interfaces found in a smart car. These typically include interfaces intended for long  range communication, as well as wired or wireless interfaces intended for local use.  Figure 5 : An example of external interfaces of a smart car  Besides wired protocols such as USB or diagnostics, TCUs often provide various wireless protocols, as  detailed hereafter.  Long-range wireless protocols  29 As already mentioned in section 2.1, we take into account V2X interfaces even if V2X is not addressed as a use case  in this report.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  21  Telematics also rely on wireless connectivity30 provided either by a directly embedded UICC or the driver’s  cell phone.  Mobile protocols such as GSM/GPRS/3G/4G/UMTS/LTE may be used in a variety of contexts, but  the most prominent are the eCall service and the capacity of providing OTA updates to car component  firmware. Smart cars also use GNSS as part of their localization features. Protocols (such as LoRa and SIGFOX)  used nowadays for IoT protocols solutions could also be used by automobile in the future.  Intra-vehicle wireless protocols  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are frequently provided as a protocol of choice for intra-vehicular communication,  although the state-of-the-art suggests possible alternatives, such as ZigBee, Passive RFID, UWB or 60 GHz  mm Wave31. Usually, communication costs for the TCU are supported by the car manufacturer, whereas they  are supported by the end-user for the infotainment. Wireless protocols are also used in two different  contexts:   Near-range to relatively long-range protocols can be used for communication with sensors, for example  DASH7, used for Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)   Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection may be used, but mostly to communicate with smartphones, using  dedicated protocols32. The next type of components to benefit from such interfaces to the vehicles  seems to be wearables and smart home devices33. Such effort is already started in the context of the  Open Connectivity foundation project34.  Inter-vehicle, or Vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless protocols  Inter-vehicle communications use a specific band allocated for ITS communication (5.9 GHz Band, called  DSRC). Such communications typically use protocols such as   WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments), which is a mode of operation used by IEEE 802.11- compliant devices to operate in the DSRC band;   DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications), not to be mistaken with the DSRC Band, which is a  standard based on IEEE 802.11a;   IEEE 802.11p, which is based on the same ASTM Standard E2213-03 as DSRC.  The state-of-the-art also suggests possible alternatives, such as DSA31 or WiMAX for V2I communication35,  or CEN-DSRC (5.8 GHz) and ETSI-DSRC (5.9 GHz) for Electronic Tolling.  Protection of communication typically relies on a PKI deployed specifically for this purpose. Work in the  European Union on this matter is coordinated under the Connected and automated driving (C-ITS)  deployment platform36, which aims at harmonizing the PKI and trust model for the European Union.  Other components  30 Such as: 2G, 3G, 4G  31 See Lu, N., Cheng, N., Zhang, N., Shen, X., & Mark, J. W. (2014). Connected vehicles: Solutions and challenges.

We also include aftermarket dongles in this category, since they use the same interfaces. It should however  be noted that they do not necessarily provide maintenance or diagnostic features.  OBD II ports and Garage or maintenance equipment  Various maintenance and diagnostic equipment can be plugged on cars via the OBD-II37 ports. They can be  standalone equipment, such as portable data collectors, or comprised of applications running on a PC or  tablet.  Aftermarket dongles  Aftermarket telematics components such as \"smart dongles\" also have OBD-II connectivity, as well as  external Bluetooth or cellular connectivity. They are often built upon the same set of components as the  competition (SoC, sensor packages, CAN transceiver chip...). They may also include debugging interfaces (for  example via mini-USB), configured to emulate a network adapter (i.e., once connected, the TCU appears as  a device on the network).  Diagnostic subnetwork  The subnetwork diagnostic is usually performed directly on the CAN bus (see section 2.2.1), through the  OBD-II port. Ethernet is also about to be used for diagnostics over the DoIP protocol (Diagnostic over IP).  2.2.7 Security, safety and privacy concerns  Assets are related to safety in several ways:   Compromising powertrain or chassis ECUs and networks may obviously cause a vehicle to behave in an  unexpected way, for example if an attacker illegitimately compromises ignition, steering, brakes, speed  and gear control, or driving support (such as ABS);38   Compromising body ECUs and networks systems that may increase harm to the passengers, should they  malfunction:   airbag or safety belts,   door force-lock used for child protection,   the windshield wipers,   alerts in the vehicle, dashboard display, notably speed, collision or lane departure warning...   air conditioning,   motorized or heating seats,   automatic trunk closing,   rear-view mirrors as well as automated windows or roof...  37 The OBD-II interface is also called a “diagnostics plug”, and is available on all vehicles sold in Europe  since 2001).  38 See for example https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hackers-fool-tesla-ss-autopilot-hide-spoof-obstacles/ and  https://www.wired.com/2016/06/teslas-autopilot-first-deadly-crash/  https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hackers-fool-tesla-ss-autopilot-hide-spoof-obstacles/ https://www.wired.com/2016/06/teslas-autopilot-first-deadly-crash/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  23  These systems may also cause a disturbance on surrounding vehicles, for example if there is a disruption  of headlights or of direction/warning lights;   Infotainment ECUs and networks may also cause safety issues : incorrect navigation data may lead the  car to unsafe areas, and a disturbance of the audio in the entertainment system (such as high volume  burst) may distract the driver  More specifically, the networks of the car can be specifically targeted and cause the same safety risks:   Internal networks (for example the CAN bus, but it also includes wireless networks such as Tire Pressure  Monitoring Systems (TPMS)): a disruption or integrity breach on these networks may result in a loss of  control of a vehicle;   Cellular connection of the car may also have adverse impacts on safety, for example in the case of a  spoofed firmware update triggered by SMS;   Local network (e.g. Wi-Fi, BT) and connection to user phones theoretically leads only to the  entertainment components of the vehicle. But as the study shows, the lack of isolation between  entertainment and driving systems might result in safety-related vulnerabilities from these entry points.  This reasoning might also be extended to other local connections such as a wireless keyfob;   V2X communications, which could lead to accidents, were they disrupted or spoofed39;   The disruption of eCall, or other alert or alarms, may eventually cause additional concerns at an accident  scene.  Additional security concerns are found in several ways:   An attacker may get an unauthorized access to functions not intended for users (fleet management,  digital tachograph, geo-fencing...). This typically evokes fraud situations, but this may also cause the  vehicle systems to malfunction and cause hazardous situations following drivers’ disruption;   Trade secrets may be at risk in several systems: TCU/ECU firmware, which might be sensitive with regard  to the competition. Some industry actors, in particular, may be wary of the possibility of device cloning  (for example the cloning of aftermarket products);   More generally, intellectual property may also be threatened: Smart car applications, or infotainment  application or media, which might be sensitive with regard to fraud (use of application copies obtained  through unofficial stores, unauthorized copies of paid premium content…)   Features or functions implemented using multiple components (such as ADAS) can augment risk in a  system if they are not correctly integrated in it.  Data confidentiality and privacy are eventually at risk as well. For example, compromising embedded  cameras may lead to privacy issues for the driver and passengers.  39 While these functionalities are out of scope of this study, we still need to consider them as potential entry points  for an attacker.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  24  3. Threats and risk analysis  Threats taxonomy  This study builds upon the threats described in ENISA’s previous work40. This set of threats has been  compared with other available threat analysis41 during the stocktaking phase of this study. While the  presentation and categories of threats differ from analysis to analysis, the outcome of this comparison  showed that the content remains the same, that nearly all threats found in ENISA’s report are retained. The  list of threats was discussed with experts during the interview phase, to focus on a restricted group of  significant threats, as shown in Figure 6:  Figure 6: Interviews: Main threats as perceived by interviewees  Below the list of threats and assets affected:  40 ENISA. (2015). Cyber security and resilience of intelligent public transport: good practices and recommendations.  41 McCarthy, C., Harnett, K., & Carter, A. (2014). Characterization of potential security threats in modern automobiles:  A composite modeling approach (No. DOT HS 812).  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  25  Table 1 - List of threats and assets affected  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  Physical  threats  Side channel, fault  injection,  glitching, access  to HW debug  ports…  This may typically consist in several scenarios :  tampering with the ECUs or TCUs (to recover keys or  access physical debug interfaces); using the device  electro-magnetic emanations or power usage to leak  information (side-channel); use light, power or other  means to alter the device behavior and ultimately  gain access to protected data (glitch, fault injection).  Physical threats arise from a well-identified attack  vector (physical manipulation of devices). They  might lead to various types of risks, including the  categories described hereafter as Nefarious  Activity/Abuse or  Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking.  ECUs and sensors  (privileged debug  interfaces of the ECUs,  causing a cascading  impact on all assets)  Unintentional  damages  (accidental)  Information  leakage or sharing  This may typically concern administration errors in  back-end services or errors when storing data  intended for diagnostic in garages, for example.  Mostly IP-sensitive  firmware of the ECUs  and sensors, as well as  private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Erroneous use or  administration of  devices and  systems  Unintentional damages (accidental) may result from  insufficiently trained personnel (for example when  using diagnostic equipment), or from an incorrect  OTA update pushed by the backend services.  ECUs and sensors,  causing a cascading  impact on all assets  Using information  from an unreliable  source  Unintentional damages may cascade from ill-defined  trust relationships: for example, trusting a third- party cloud provider with poor data protection, or  failing to notify a Tier developer that the data they  will store is sensitive.  All assets  Unintentional  change of data in  an information  system  Unintentional damages (accidental) may result from  insufficiently trained personnel (for example when  using diagnostic equipment), or from an incorrect  OTA update pushed by the backend services.  ECUs and sensors,  causing a cascading  impact on all assets  Inadequate design  and planning or  lack of adaption  Unintentional damages (accidental) may result from  insufficiently trained personnel (for administration,  design, operation…) causing for example  incompatibilities between components, or lack of  adaptation to the changing threat landscape (the use  of vulnerable cryptography is an example of this).  All assets  Disasters and  Outages  Network outage  A Network outage (for example from the ISP) may  result in a denial of service for sensitive operations,  such as OTA fixes for critical bugs or vulnerabilities.  This is also true for internal networks failures.  More generally, any design relying too much on  connectivity exposes the vehicle to potential issues  in case of outages. Vehicles should be designed to  offer a usable degraded mode of operation in case of  outage.  See also Failures/ Malfunctions  All assets  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  26  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  Damage/ Loss  (IT Assets)  Loss of  information in the  cloud  Sensitive data may be lost due to attacks or  accidents when stored by third-party cloud service  providers  Sensitive data stored by  cloud service providers  (these data do not  appear on the asset list,  but may typically be  related to infotainment  control)  Loss of (integrity  of) sensitive  information  The (integrity of) sensitive data may be lost due to IT  components wear and tear, causing potential  cascading issues (in case of a key alteration, for  example)  See also Failures/ Malfunctions  All assets  Damage caused  by a third party  Sensitive data may be lost or compromised due to  physical damages in cases of a traffic accident or  theft.  Private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Loss from DRM  conflicts  User data (traffic- or travel-related services,  audio/video entertainment…) may be deleted due to  DRM issues  Private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Information  leakage  Private or sensitive data (such as payment  information, driving habits…) may be leaked when  the car is sold to another user.  Private data  transmitted over  subnetworks  Failures/  Malfunctions  Failures /  malfunctions of  (parts of) devices  or systems  See Damage/ Loss (IT Assets) - Loss of (integrity of)  sensitive information  -  Failures or  disruptions of the  power/main  supply  A failure of power supply has obvious safety issues  besides security issues. However, security causes  additional constraints. Typically, some security  functions (for example anti-tampering mechanisms)  should rely on separate and trusted power sources,  to avoid both accidental security failures and  potentially exploitable flaws for an attacker  All assets  Software bugs  The presence of software bugs is a basis for potential  exploitable vulnerabilities. The lack of a software  measure for the Mean-Time-Between-Failure also  implies that software bugs are more likely to happen  than Hardware failures over the lifetime of a car.  All assets  Failures or  disruptions of  communication  links  See Disasters and Outages - Network outage All assets  Eavesdropping / Interception/  Hijacking  Interception of  information /  Interfering  radiations  See physical threats. All assets  Replay of  messages  If internal networks are not sufficiently protected  against replay, potential attackers have an easy  Sensitive data  transmitted on  subnetworks  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  27  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  access to a wide range of dangerous commands,  such as steering, braking…  Man in the  middle/ session  hijacking  A large set of interfaces means that, assuming a poor  protection of the session, there are many incentives  for an attacker to impersonate a distant user:  - Impersonating an app store, or service  provider, may lead to financial abuse;  - Impersonating backend systems may help  the attacker in downloading a rogue  firmware on the vehicle;  - Impersonating another vehicle on a V2V  session may trigger dangerous behaviours;  - Impersonating a legitimate keyfob may lead  to theft;  - etc.  The same notion can also be applied to internal  network, for example to perform a MitM on the CAN  bus42.  All assets  Network  reconnaissance  and information  gathering  Information on car networks can be obtained in  many ways (looking for successive MSISDN numbers  for OTA updates, looking for vulnerable devices on  Shodan43, war driving for vulnerable protocols such  as ZigBee or Wi-Fi…)  Wireless External  communication  networks or  subnetworks  Repudiation of  actions  The liability of the driver being possibly engaged in  accidents/assurance/professional contexts, there is  an incentive to compromise data related to the car  usage such as driving habits or localization. This is  simply the extension of existing fraud schemes, for  example on tachographs.  Data related to  powertrain control,  Chassis control or  infotainment control  Nefarious  Activity/ Abuse  Denial of service  The denial of service is not only to be understood as  a particular form of network outage. A denial of  service may also be triggered on internal network by  flooding a CAN bus, or by provoking faults on an ECU  via a malicious payload. The potential impact of such  an attack depends on the targeted ECU, but may  lead to unexpected behaviours from driving systems  All assets  Manipulation of  hardware &  software,  Manipulation of  information  Changing the firmware of a component, or  otherwise altering its configuration data, is an  essential step of many attacks. The risk is  emphasized when there are no measures to protect  the authenticity of critical data or components, such  as a secure boot.  All assets  42 See https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#canspy-a-platform-for-auditing-can-devices  43 https://www.shodan.io/  https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#canspy-a-platform-for-auditing-can-devices  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  28  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  Manipulation of hardware also allows to perform a  man-in-the-middle (for example, cutting the CAN  bus or isolating a given ECU44)  Unauthorised  access to  information  system/network  The type of threat attracting the most attention of  the media45 is the case where a remote attacker can  take the control of an ECU (or impersonate an ECU  on an internal subnetwork) and take the control of a  car by sending driving-related commands (steering,  braking…).  All assets  Compromising  confidential  information  While information leak may be accidental  (See  Damage/ Loss (IT Assets) - Information leakage),  there are also incentives for attackers to deliberately  compromise private data or sensitive data such as  keys  All assets  Identity fraud  The simplest case of identity fraud is the cloning of a  keyfob. This may, however, be completed by other  cases, such as fraud, for example if a user wants  their car to display another identity when  communicating:  - with road infrastructures such as toll  systems;  - with manufacturer backend46.  All assets  Unauthorised use  of administration  of devices &  systems,  Unauthorised use  of software,  Unauthorised  installation of  software  A user may try to access unauthorized functions for  various  reasons: they might want to circumvent  DRMs on applications or media, or get an  unauthorized access to features (geo-fencing, digital  tachograph… See Eavesdropping/ Interception/  Hijacking - Repudiation of actions), or they might  simply want to tune the vehicle for comfort or  performance purpose.  Outside vehicles, manufacturers may also be  confronted with garages using unauthorized or  unlicensed professional tools and software.  This threat also includes the notion of cloning, for  example when an attacker copies the firmware of an  existing device, in order to commercialize it without  authorization.  All assets  Abuse of  authorizations,  Abuse of  information  leakage  A disgruntled employee (backend services, garage)  may use their authorizations to perform malicious  actions.  A slightly different scenario would be for an  infotainment application to abuse its authorizations  (for example, to mine private data or perform  surveillance activities)  All assets  44 See  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Demay-CANSPY-A-Platorm-For-Auditing-CAN-Devices- wp.pdf  45 See a recent example : https://www.wired.com/2016/03/thousands-trucks-buses-ambulances-may-open-hackers/  46 See http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538862?_sm_au_=icV3HHS2mMF57J6r  https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Demay-CANSPY-A-Platorm-For-Auditing-CAN-Devices-wp.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Demay-CANSPY-A-Platorm-For-Auditing-CAN-Devices-wp.pdf https://www.wired.com/2016/03/thousands-trucks-buses-ambulances-may-open-hackers/ http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538862?_sm_au_=icV3HHS2mMF57J6r  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  29  CATEGORY THREAT VARIANTS AND DETAILS ASSETS AFFECTED  The impact of such threats is enhanced in cases  where the system itself leaks data due to a poor  security design.  Malicious  software,  Malicious  software activity  The integration of infotainment and mobile  ecosystems may cause an increase of potential  malicious software introduced by the user. Malicious  software may provide a first step for attackers in a  multi-step attack, to get in driving systems via the  infotainment subnetwork.  Malicious software may also be a first step to gain  access to professional systems (e.g. garages or  backend), thus potentially gaining a privileged access  on a large set of vehicles.  It has to be noted that these ties to the mobile and  PC ecosystems also means that attackers may  recycle well-known attacks paths (generic  linux/android/windows) to eventually affect smart  cars47.  All assets  Remote activity  (execution)  All external interfaces may be subject to code  injection, which may ultimately result in code  execution in case of insufficient component  robustness.  All assets  Advanced  Persistent  Threats (APT)  -  Some security researchers48 consider smart car  attacks as similar to Advanced Persistent Threats, or  advanced enterprise threats, especially because the  attackers have to move “laterally into multiple  systems”. This risk is also relevant for infrastructures  (backend systems, or even V2X infrastructures). Such  attacks typically use several types of methods and  entry points, therefore can be a mix of every other  threat described in this table.  All assets  Attack potential  This study chooses not to define any specific threat agents (script kiddies, government agencies…)  except when it gives useful information on the attacker motivation.  Instead, the study will focus on  the notion of attack potential, meaning the potential of someone to perform an attack. Attack  potential is described in the Common Criteria49 and further refined in the Common Criteria  Evaluation Methodology50. In Common Criteria, a product evaluated to achieve a given assurance  level is supposed to resist attackers with a predetermined attack potential.  During the vulnerability  assessment, if evaluators detect a potential vulnerability, they will calculate the attack potential  required to exploit such a vulnerability. If the attack is exploitable with a potential lower than what  47 It was notably the main point of http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/  48 See https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/07/hacking-a-tesla/  49 Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation - Part 3: Security assurance components -  September 2012 - Version 3.1 Revision 4  50 Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation - Evaluation methodology - September 2012  - Version 3.1 Revision 4  http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/ https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/07/hacking-a-tesla/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  30  the product is expected to resist, the product will fail the associated evaluation task. This attack  potential is typically built upon several measures or estimations:   Time taken to identify and exploit;   Specialist technical expertise required;   Knowledge of the [product] design and operation;   Window of opportunity;   IT hardware/software or other equipment required for exploitation.  In practice, this means that an evaluated product may be vulnerable to some attacks, but that these  attacks require more expertise (or resources, or motivation) than the targeted resistance can handle.  For example, Common Criteria certificates follow a scale of EAL (Evaluation Assurance Level) where  a higher EAL means, through the AVA_VAN assurance requirements, that the product is expected to  resist stronger attackers:   A hardware product at an EAL2 level may resist to script kiddies using simple software  exploitation frameworks   The same product evaluated at EAL4+ may be expected to resist an attack by experts using  sophisticated equipment such as lasers or Focused Ion Beams.  When performing a threat assessment prior to a certification, computing an attack potential for a  threat will help decide:   Which certification level may provide assurance that the threat is covered;   Whether some attack scenarios will be “too strong” to be addressed by the expected  certification.  A separate issue for computing the attack potential may be that some of the estimating measures  dominate the others. A good example is the 2014 Jeep hack by Miller and Valasek where a lot of  time was required to identify the vulnerability (the DBus daemon), while exploiting it did not require  any special expertise or equipment.  Note also that, in practice, the attack potential of attackers increases over time, as they gain more  expertise and knowledge of the automotive systems as well as they build more sophisticated tools.  Moreover, the potential of attackers can sometimes grow rapidly: for. For instance, when a skilled  hacker publishes a vulnerability, including hints on how to exploit it, (and even scripts for automated  attacks), less skilled persons (like script kiddies) may have sufficient attack potential to repeat or  further exploit this same vulnerability. While this study will not try to calculate an accurate attack  potential for the attack scenarios hereafter, it aims at giving a hint at the differences of potential  required depending on the scenario. This is also intended to be a hint to future certification efforts.  Sample cyber security attacks  The Table 2 hereafter lists a sample of attacks showing how previous threats can be related to  existing research and exploitation paths:  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  31  Table 2 : Sample attacks  THREATS ATTACK LESSONS LEARNED  Network  reconnaissance and  information  gathering,  Unauthorised access  to information  system/network  Remote attack (see section 3.4.1 for more details on how  this kind of attack can be performed)  First introduced in 201151, remote attacks on cars (via  internet) have been widely exposed in the press due to the  work of Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek52. This type of attack  typically included attempts to craft messages on the CAN  bus to change the behaviour of the vehicle.  Lack of communication protection  (from the point of view of the  discovery and the lack of  authentication); lack of  Identification, authentication and  authorization for actions accessible  remotely.  Network  reconnaissance and  information  gathering,  Unauthorised access  to information  system/network  Remote attack (see section 3.4.1 for more details on how  this kind of attack can be performed)  In a variation of previous attacks, the access gained remotely  can be used for other purposes, for example force the geo- fencing of the vehicle, as exposed in a more recent example  of remote attack53  Lack of communication protection  (from the point of view of the  discovery and the lack of  authentication); lack of  Identification, authentication and  authorization for actions accessible  remotely.

Direct CAN access is easier than  many manufacturers might think.  Lack of protections in the CAN  protocol allow to perform a man- in-the-middle, even if timing  constraints makes the exploitation  non-trivial in practice  Man in the middle,  Inadequate design  and planning or lack  of adaption  Theft (see section 3.4.3 for more details on how this kind of  attack can be performed)  Researchers recently presented a correlation-based attack  on remote keyless entry systems concerning millions of cars  (“most VW Group vehicles manufactured between 1995 and  Vulnerable (implementation of)  cryptography  51 See Checkoway, S., McCoy, D., Kantor, B., Anderson, D., Shacham, H., Savage, S., ... & Kohno, T.

In this case, the researchers claim that the attack  could explain theft cases found in the wild.  This follows a long history of attacks on keyless entry  (including notably the RollJam55 attack) and start  systems5657, all of which relying on cheap hardware and  short exploitation time. Attacks exploiting vulnerable  cryptography on these systems are not new, with examples  as far as 200558.  Unauthorised use of  administration of  devices & systems  Theft (see section 3.4.3 for more details on how this kind of  attack can be performed)  Thefts have been shown to use, in the wild, administration  equipment to defeat keyless entry and start systems59.  These equipment were initially intended for locksmiths and  car dealers.  Identification, authentication and  authorization is needed for access  to privileged functions, especially  for maintenance equipment.  Information leakage,  Abuse of information  leakage  Surveillance (see section 3.4.4 for more details on how this  kind of attack can be performed)  Researchers devised an experimental setup to validate their  cost analysis estimation of a surveillance attack performed  by a mid-range attacker using dedicated hardware. The  attack uses ITS communication interfaces60.  Surveillance is possible in practice  for a mid-range attacker; interfaces  (e.g. ITS interfaces) lack the  pseudonymity measures allowing  to mitigate the attack  54 See Garcia, F.

Some examples of attacks scenarios are introduced hereafter to show in more details the  variety of attacks that can potentially target smart cars. Additionally, they provide an introduction  to the categories of good practices allowing to cover these threats. We consider several categories  of attacks, which are described as scenarios hereafter: Remote attacks, Persistent vehicle  alteration, Theft and Surveillance. These scenarios are detailed in the next sections. (More details  concerning the risk rating can be found in Section 7 – Appendix A).  3.4.1 Remote attacks (threatening passengers safety)  Table 3 : Attack scenario 1 - remote attack  A TT  A C  K  S  C EN  A R  IO  TYPE OF  ATTACK  DESCRIPTION ASSET AFFECTED  Remote, via  functional  interfaces  This attack exploits vulnerabilities in external functional interfaces, related to  telematics or infotainment. Connected ECUs may be used in a variety of  functional uses, all of which can be an entry point for such attacks61.  The scenario could typically follow these steps: first identify a vulnerable car,  then gain access to internal services (e.g. on a TCU), and eventually, from  the access gained onto the vehicle, obtain an access to vehicle systems.  In a first step,  External  communication  networks are  targeted.  Ultimately, all  ECUs and  sensors may be  compromised  CRITICALITY LIKELIHOOD62  High Unlikely  CASCADING EFFECTS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Vehicle (safety) systems disruption may  result in an accident, possibly involving other  vehicles.  All stakeholders providing, or operating external interfaces (ISPs,  manufacturers, Tiers, aftermarket and app providers, cloud  service providers). ECU manufacturers also concerned, since this  scenario exploits the lack of ECU self-protection.  RECOVERY TIME AND EFFORTS GOOD PRACTICES  Even if vulnerabilities may be fixed by an  OTA update, and even if the vehicle does  not seem physically damaged, it is likely  that a physical inspection will be needed  to ensure that safety is maintained.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards, organizational  measures)   In terms of security functions, Communication protection is  obviously needed to mitigate these attacks, and well as  Identification, authentication and authorization for all actions  accessible remotely. These functions are supported by  Cryptography, Security Audit, and software self-protection.63   Separation of telematics and infotainment traffic is  recommended allowing specialized handling of packets regarding  intrusion and malware detection.  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development, Safety and security process integration.  This kind of attack is very much in the public eye64. While the attack is not at all trivial to realize,  and therefore rated as “unlikely”, it can have devastating consequences.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  34  The type of attacks described by this scenario could be roughly described as in the Figure 7  hereafter65:  Figure 7 : Remote attacks threatening passengers’ safety  Example: As a first step, the attacker may know that a given vehicle model has a vulnerable SMS  (Single Messaging System) link, and knowing its MSIN, enumerates MSINs in hope that all numbers  have been sequentially assigned, thus discovering other vulnerable vehicles66.   The cost to identify such a vulnerability is only relatively high, because the attack surface of a smart  car is very large: if the direct IP connectivity of a car is well-protected, the attacker can move to  another entry point such as SMS.   Interestingly, the use of dedicated components to compromise cellular connection (“stingrays” or  “fake BTS”) was studied67 but is dismissed by newer studies describing it as an unnecessary complex  entry point compared to other methods, especially internet-based attacks68.   As a second step, they exploit the lack of authentication for SMS update, and upload a crafted firmware  to the TCU69.   This is an extreme example: the attacker will typically gain an access of some sort on a TCU. The  usefulness of this access will however be different depending on whether it consists in a simple  65 These steps are very similar to what is described in previous research, in particular Miller, C., & Valasek, C. (2014). A  survey of remote automotive attack surfaces.

In 9th  USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT 15).  69 Alternatively (in the example of Miller/Valasek), the attacker may try to directly communicate with ECUs because it  contains non-diversified SSH credentials (that may have been extracted by a previous physical attack on another  vehicle).  http://argus-sec.com/blog/remote-attack-aftermarket-telematics-service http://argus-sec.com/blog/remote-attack-aftermarket-telematics-service  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  35  session, a highly privileged session, or the capacity to update a malicious firmware; which has  consequences on what is possible in the third and last step.   As a last step, their crafted firmware is able to communicate legitimately on the CAN bus, allowing to  communicate with the driving systems   The range of consequences may vary from the mildly disruptive (such as horn activation) to life- threatening situations, such as brake disconnect, engine halt or air bag activation.  Exploiting the complete scenario will require several vulnerabilities to be exploited in sequence, and  should not be regarded as an easy task. In particular, sending crafted messages on the CAN bus is not a  trivial way to trick an ECU into performing a malicious action70. Note also that the attack can come from  “unlikely” sources such as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) radio receivers71 or the vehicle FM Radio Data  System72.  3.4.2 Persistent vehicle alteration (by the legitimate user or by the use of diagnostic equipment)  This category includes for example cases where the legitimate user tries to modify the behaviour of their  vehicle, as summarized in Figure 8. This may include:   Attempts to “tune” the vehicle driving characteristics, for example to enhance performance. The car  hacker’s handbook, for example, is advertised to users as mean to perform “car mods” or “discover  undocumented features”73;  70 See Miller, C., & Valasek, C. (2014).

The objective may be for example vehicle tuning,  bypass of the geo-fencing on a corporate vehicle …  The user may also use diagnostic equipment, which  may also be used by other categories of attackers,  for example in a garage. The steps would then  consist in obtaining a legitimate or illegitimate  access to diagnostic equipment, then exploiting a  vulnerability in the diagnostic equipment to  persistently alter the behaviour of an ECU. In a  garage context, such an attack may be related to  business intelligence as much as an attack on the  vehicle itself  The primary targets are the OBD II  ports from the Diagnostic and  maintenance systems. In the case  of an alteration by the user, assets  related to the access control  functions of the ECUs and sensors74  are targeted.  In the case of a garage attack, IP and  Trade secrets, but also private data  stored on ECUs and sensors, or  transiting on subnetworks75.  In both cases, Powertrain control  and vehicle safety systems from  Chassis or body control may be hit  indirectly  CRITICALITY LIKELIHOOD  High  Possible to Unlikely  CASCADING EFFECTS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  The immediate effect can range from a data  leak to a disruption of vehicle systems. This  may result in an accident, possibly involving  other vehicles, while a data leak has less  critical consequence, but may result in brand  damage.  All stakeholders providing ECUs, diagnostic  equipment or aftermarket dongles (car  manufacturers, Tiers, aftermarket providers).  Garages are also concerned, since attacks  performed via diagnostic equipment are likely to  use garages as an entry point.  RECOVERY TIME AND  EFFORTS  GOOD PRACTICES  Even if vulnerabilities may be  fixed by an OTA update, and  even if the vehicle appears to  be physically damaged, it is  likely that a physical  inspection will be needed to  ensure that safety is  maintained.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards,  organizational measures)   In terms of security functions, Communication protection is  obviously needed to mitigate these attacks, as well as  Identification, authentication and authorization for all actions  accessible via diagnostic interfaces.

CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development (especially for the access control to maintenance tools), safety and  security process integration  74 The assets primarily targeted are mostly related to access control, especially access to functions not intended for  users (fleet management, digital tachograph, geo-fencing...). Studies give example of privileged services than can be  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  37   Attempt to bypass monitoring services such as geo-fencing or fleet management. This is analogous to  existing situations such as tachograph fraud76 77, although it is an extension of the existing situation,  because tachograph fraud is clearly not part of geo-fencing or fleet management.  Other attackers than the legitimate user of the car may also want to alter the behaviour of the vehicle. For  example, the attacker may be a garage employee using diagnostic equipment:   Attacks in garages may be related to business intelligence (aiming at gaining sensible information on  competitors technical implementations)   Attacks inside or outside garages may be related to organized crime. This may for example be used as a  threat on the garage or users (on the model of ransomware). As for today, the presence of financial  incentives is not yet very frequent (for example payment information accessible in entertainment  systems). This example looks very much like existing scenarios targeting point-of-sale terminals, where  malware such as memory scrapers78 can be installed by employees. The situation is however slightly  different in garages, since:   The turnover in garages is not the same as large shopping centres that heavily rely on temporary  work; this creates less opportunity for attackers;   The incentive in point of sale is not as strong (attacks on points-of-sale directly allow to obtain  payment-enabling data)  Main scenario   Example 1: The attacker connects to the CAN bus, for example by identifying the appropriate pins on  the OBD II port. They may then plug a cheap CAN sniffer on these pins (step 1). The step 2 will consist  in  trying to analyse the CAN traffic and then alter the car behaviour via crafted packets (the car  hacker’s handbook gives the example of a spoofed speed transmitted to the digital tachograph79)   Example 2: As a first step, an attacker directly connects an ECU (using a JTAG port on the board). The  step 2 will consist in exploiting the JTAG debug capacities by uploading a crafted firmware80;   Other examples of attacks may consist in glitching, memory dump81…  compromised because static keys were discovered by a memory dump (for example SSH keys). Other targeted assets  are the driving systems, especially in cases where the user tries to modify the performance of their vehicle. Vehicle  safety systems may also be at risk due to accidental side effects of the attack. Modified traffic on the CAN bus may for  example trigger denials of service on the bus, or otherwise cause dangerous situations to arise on vehicle systems.  75 IP and Trade secrets may be targeted. In a context related to organized crime, the assets are more likely to be  vehicle safety systems, driving systems or private data (especially payment data)  76 http://www.euro-controle-route.eu/site/en/info/tacograph/fraud/  77 For the example of digital tachographs see: https://www.tispol.org/content/2016/02/02/07/31/technology-used- tachograph-fraud-becoming-more-complex-and-sophisticated-0  78 See for example, http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-pos- ram-scraper-malware.pdf  79 See Miller, C., & Valasek, C.

The document highlights the fact that  analyzing and crafting CAN packets is not an easy task.  80 See Car Hacker’s Handbook by Craig Smith, which reminds that it requires to obtain, and then reverse-engineer a  firmware, which is not trivial  81 See for example Foster, I., Prudhomme, A., Koscher, K., & Savage, S.

The second step may then consist in modifying an ECU by injecting a crafted  firmware, or simply a previous, vulnerable version of the firmware.   Example 2: Instead of trying to access the diagnostic equipment itself, the attacker may try to  compromise the laptop that interfaces with this equipment83. In that case the skills may not be much  more than being able to reverse a DLL and exploiting bad digital signature implementations, which are  skills frequently found in “black hat” communities related to DRM, point-of-sale, malware creation...  Even in that case, the attacker may need car-specific skills, for example to be able to craft a working  firmware. This also assumes that the attacker will perform their attack remotely through a malware,  which makes the whole attack more difficult by an order of magnitude.  Figure 8 : Persistent vehicle alteration scenarios  3.4.3 Theft  Table 5 : Attack scenario 3 - Theft  A TT  A C  K  S  C EN  A R  IO  TYPE OF  ATTACK  DESCRIPTION ASSET AFFECTED  Local  Several possible scenarios, some being more realistic than  others: Compromising a local wireless connection (e.g. Wi-Fi),  Key fob cloning, Relay attack, Rolling code jam, exploiting the  Keyless systems …  Body control domain and External  communication networks are the  primary asset targeted, but  ultimately all assets are concerned,  in cases where the vehicle is  eventually stolen  82 See http://fortune.com/2016/08/06/houston-car-hackers/  83 It was notably the main point of http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/  http://fortune.com/2016/08/06/houston-car-hackers/ http://blog.crysys.hu/2015/10/hacking-cars-in-the-style-of-stuxnet/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  39  CRITICALITY LIKELIHOOD  Medium  Possible  CASCADING EFFECTS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED  Beyond the theft itself, privacy issues can happen (the same  way as the theft of smartphones or tablet may result in  private data being accessible by the thief).  Actors providing keyless entry systems (car  manufacturers and Tiers), but also Insurance  companies, insofar as policies should take into  account these scenarios and define appropriate  forensic procedures.  RECOVERY TIME  AND EFFORTS  GOOD PRACTICES  Assuming that most  vulnerabilities are  software-based, they  may be fixed by an  OTA or physical  update. Hardware  vulnerabilities may  cause much higher  recovery costs.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards, organizational measures);   In terms of security functions, Cryptography is obviously the first coming to mind, since  most of these attacks rely on the weak cryptography implemented in remote keyless  entry systems;   Communication protection is obviously needed to mitigate these attacks, and well as  Identification, authentication and authorization for all actions accessible, for example,  via local wireless entry points (Wi-Fi, keyfob…). Physical self-protection also  contributes to reduce the attack surface for local attacks (see 8.1.3.6 for details);   Security Audit may help the forensic analysis of such cases, from an insurance point of  view, as they are physically undetectable;   These functions are supported by self-protection. In particular, the design should allow  users to fall back to a mechanical lock whenever a vulnerability is found in their keyless  entry systems.  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development  In this scenario we consider the possibility for an attacker to gain physical access to the inside of a vehicle  without a legitimate access means.  Standard key fobs and access control devices usually work under the assumption that there is only one level  of access, thus gaining access to the inside of a vehicle often entails access to the vehicle main functions :  engine start, infotainment unit, trunk opening. While the most plausible risk is the plain and simple theft of  the vehicle or any of the owner’s possessions kept inside, such an attack may be a first step towards a more  involved attack scenario since access to the inside of the vehicle provides :   Access to the OBD-II diagnostic port, thus easier access to the CAN/LIN bus;   Access to the head-up unit physical interfaces (USB, CD/DVD) and assets (navigation data, personal data,  access to remote services);   Easier access to other ECUs (telematics control unit, engine / transmission control unit, gateway).  A complex scenario may involve an attacker that uses one of the means listed above in order to incapacitate  (fully or partially) the vehicle operation in such a way that only him/her can restore it remotely, and ask for  a ransom. In such a case the main issue is the reproducibility, since such an attack would only be profitable  if it has the potential to scale up.  The scenario can use very different approaches, such as:  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  40   Compromising a local wireless connection (a proof of concept already exists),, where an insecure Wi-Fi  connection could be used to ultimately disable the theft alarm84)   Key fob cloning: the following techniques may provide this capability:   gain access to the key fob secure memory (through reverse engineering or side-channel);   compromise the pairing process, for instance by compromising the device used for pairing in the  garage;   Use a known vulnerability to get hold of the unique ID from the car’s diagnostic port85.   Relay attack: this attack has been shown to be effective with PKES (Passive Key Entry and Start)  systems8687, where no other action than proximity is required on behalf of the user to open / ignite the  car. In such a case it is possible to relay the near-field radio signal over large distances using cheap  hardware, from the vehicle to the key fob. This requires the ability to place a radio transceiver near the  key fob. The attack can only be effective if the security mechanism does not change the keys in time or  if it uses a repeated set of security messages.   Rolling code jam: Even if the key cloning scenario is not feasible (by lack of the specific hardware used  for pairing the key with the vehicle or reverse engineering / side channel capabilities), it is possible to  compromise the rolling code by jamming the radio signal so that the code is not discarded by the vehicle  and can be replayed. This attack requires cheap hardware and has been successfully demonstrated for  a range of vehicles on the field88.   Keyless systems: The smartphone application that controls the opening of the car is compromised, in  order to gain illegitimate access to a car. While this mode of access control is far from being common, it  may be in a near future89, which will have the effect of overextending the attack surface with all mobile  (applications and OS) vulnerabilities.  Many vulnerabilities used in such attacks are not as technically challenging as in other scenarios, and may  use cheap and easy to come by devices90 that require no high level technical skills for their operation. In  some cases, though, cryptographic attacks are needed to circumvent the keyless entry protection. Due to  hardware limitation, these cryptographic protocols are however weaker than in many other domains, and  researchers have shown that attacks can be performed without expensive equipment91.  84 See Hacking the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV hybrid, Pen Test Partners,  https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/hacking-the-mitsubishi-outlander-phev-hybrid-suv/.

Hardware vulnerabilities may  cause much higher recovery  costs.   General good practices apply (Policy and standards, organizational  measures). In this case, privacy regulation, may notably contribute to  reduce the amount of memorized private data in the first place, thus  reducing the impact of an attack;   In terms of security functions, Communication protection is obviously  needed to mitigate these attacks (especially for communication with  cloud-based services) as well as Identification, authentication and  authorization.   These functions are supported by Cryptography, Security Audit, and  software self-protection.  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Insecure design or development (lack of privacy by design in components or protocols), safety and security process  integration  This scenario gathers considerations regarding the possibilities of surveillance offered by recent cars and  vehicles. With the exception of the effort of ETSI on the use of pseudonyms to avoid tracking92, there is little  published evidence or work for this kind of situations, several potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses have  been noticed by proofs of concept by researchers93.  92https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/eIDAS_THREAD/S03_eID/DPSECURITYCONSULTIN G_PINKAS.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/SECURITYWS/S03_OTHERSTANDARDSandINDUSTR YFORA/ISO_IEC_JTC2_SC27_RANNENBERG.pdf  93 See for example https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars- Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers-wp2.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/eIDAS_THREAD/S03_eID/DPSECURITYCONSULTING_PINKAS.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/eIDAS_THREAD/S03_eID/DPSECURITYCONSULTING_PINKAS.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/SECURITYWS/S03_OTHERSTANDARDSandINDUSTRYFORA/ISO_IEC_JTC2_SC27_RANNENBERG.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2015/201506_SECURITYWEEK/SECURITYWS/S03_OTHERSTANDARDSandINDUSTRYFORA/ISO_IEC_JTC2_SC27_RANNENBERG.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers-wp2.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Petit-Self-Driving-And-Connected-Cars-Fooling-Sensors-And-Tracking-Drivers-wp2.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  42  There are essentially two kinds of plausible surveillance scenarios:   Targeted surveillance, where a single individual is tracked using a vulnerability in its vehicle systems   Mass surveillance, where a large number of individuals are tracked through some common vulnerability.  An alternative to both scenarios consist in performing surveillance only on cloud-stored data, instead of  focusing on vehicles. This alternative will not be explored in detail here, since ENISA already addressed the  issue of cloud security94.  In the case of targeted surveillance the high investment (in cost and risk) of the attack hints at the following  plausible motives: espionage, crime, terrorism, or business intelligence. On the other hand the mass  surveillance case involves spying on a large number of vehicles in order to get exploitable data. While there  is not public record of such an exploitation (except for researchers’ demonstrations in limited scenarios), it  is in principle possible to setup such a system to passively sniff the RF emissions of the vehicles and  discriminate between them using unique identifiers.  The associated threat agents may thus be government agencies and criminal organisations, with a high  attack potential and strong incentives for targeted surveillance, whereas the scope may be broader for mass  surveillance due to the relative easiness of the underlying attacks  Typical attack vectors for targeted surveillance rely on modification of the vehicle software and/or hardware  in order to setup the surveillance. Software-based scenarios could typically be found in cases where the  attacker has no physical access to the targeted vehicle (therefore is unable to put a physical tracker in the  vehicle).  The relevant vulnerable components are then the ECU hardware and software (mainly the infotainment  system and navigation unit).  The typical attack vectors for mass surveillance are:   All wireless emissions: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GSM/3G/4G signals can be used to uniquely identify a  vehicle. In particular:   When the infotainment system provides a Wi-Fi hotspot functionality that broadcasts its SSID;   Most TPMS systems, when they are active, broadcast a unique RFID identifier;   Using a fake BTS, it is possible to spy on the ICCID of the USIM cards.   Car systems can allow fingerprinting95, quite the same way as browser or device fingerprinting.  However, it may be argued that the browser of an infotainment system allows an easier  fingerprinting than sensors, which are more difficult to access.   Cloud storages / backed systems, which collect the position of a large set of vehicles. These includes the  fleet management systems, localisation-aware services, and navigation systems real-time databases.  94 See  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c5=2006&c5=2016&c5=false&c2=publicationDate&reversed=on&b_start =0&c8=Cloud+Computing+Security  95 See for example Enev, M., Takakuwa, A., Koscher, K., & Kohno, T.

It should be noted that surveillance scenarios are facilitated by existing, user-accepted, monitoring features.  Several examples come to mind, amongst which:   The usage of OBD-II dongles to monitor driving habits in exchange of reduced assurance fees96;   The accumulation of private information due to the interconnection with social networks.  These user-accepted usages come with entry points, some of them privileged (for example OBD-II dongles),  which can be compromised by an attacker. Therefore, reducing the chance of privacy attacks could also  benefit from limiting the user-accepted surveillance solutions. European privacy regulation already  contributes to limit potential accumulation of private data and abuses of opt-out scenarios97 - however, they  do not address the security risks caused by the introduction of technical components dedicated to user-data  collection.  96 See for example http://www.computerworld.com/article/2684298/once-your-cars-connected-to-the-internet-who- guards-your-privacy.html  97 Such as the OnStar privacy issues described in http://www.autoblog.com/2011/09/26/gm-onstar-privacy/  http://www.computerworld.com/article/2684298/once-your-cars-connected-to-the-internet-who-guards-your-privacy.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2684298/once-your-cars-connected-to-the-internet-who-guards-your-privacy.html http://www.autoblog.com/2011/09/26/gm-onstar-privacy/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  44  4. Gap analysis and good practices  Gaps and challenges  4.1.1 Insecure design or development  Insecure development in today’s cars  While the automotive industry has a long-standing expertise in car safety, security issues of connected  systems in cars and their potential impact on car safety are not yet properly taken into account, except for  few of them98. Some studies tried to define a shortlist of the more frequent security issues found amongst  manufacturers99 100 101 102 103. After having double checked these shortlists during our own interviews, the  following issues seem indeed significant:   No defence in depth strategy during the design of the system (such as a secure boot process, isolation  of a Trusted Computing Base, limitation of the number of open ports, self-protection, …);   No security- or privacy-by-design. For example, telematics schemes may require the car maker to send  most of the information exchanged on the CAN bus to a third-party, such as vehicle speed, throttle  position, coolant and oil temperature, engine revision status, etc. More information than really needed  may be exported outside of the car. While some actors are aware that private data should not be  exported without a reason, the same line of reasoning is not always applied to sensitive data;   Lack of communication protection, on internal as well as external interfaces;104   Lack of authentication and authorization, especially for privileged access to ECUs; for example:   no validation or signing of firmware updates,   updates happen without server authentication, and even on an arbitrary server,   no secure boot,   no cellular authentication, or weak authentication mechanisms, or failure to use components that  provide authentication functions…,   no cryptographic keys distributed to garages;   Lack of hardening, for example:   No data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies are used on firmware,   Public vulnerabilities (DNS proxy, http service...) are left unfixed,   ECU services are exposed through different entry points, and even unnecessary communication  ports are left open; services such as telnet, web or SSH are sometimes bound to all network  interfaces,   Weak passwords policies,   Misconfiguration (e.g. VPN) …   Lack of diagnosis / response capabilities  98 See https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/08/07/hacking-a-tesla/  99 Markey, E.

As already stated, a transparent dialog with security researchers is needed to ensure that the whole  community is in a “responsible” disclosure process. The current situation in automotive is very far from this  situation, as   Some findings have been left unpublished due to legal actions between manufacturers and  researchers106, leaving exploitable vulnerabilities in the wild during as long as two years;   Other researchers have turned to media due to manufacturer’s lack of response107,108, thus publishing  vulnerabilities for which no fix is planned;   Some manufacturers do not perform frequent software updates, thus exposing automotive devices to  known vulnerabilities (for instance in software frameworks, such as a SSL library or browser library).  Such updates, even if released in due time by manufacturers, are still seldom deployed Over The Air and  may require the car owner to use a USB stick for installing the update or to go a car dealership garage;   As confirmed by interviews, security functions such as security logs 109 are not regarded as important,  while they are essential to security diagnostics in the field.  4.1.2 Liability  Studies show that most users are concerned with cybersecurity issues arising from the integration of  connected features in cars. In case a security event happens, they are also likely to blame in equal parts the  different actors of the ecosystem such as app stores, app developers and app manufacturers, to take the  example of a vulnerability arising from a connected smartphone110. Furthermore, there is no chance to  enforce a perfect isolation between driving, debug and infotainment (or connected) systems, which means  that vulnerabilities from any actor, including aftermarket components, may allow compromising safety- related features of a vehicle.  In this context, there is a need to clarify the liability of each actor in case of a  security event.  101 Koscher, K., Czeskis, A., Roesner, F., Patel, S., Kohno, T., Checkoway, S., & Savage, S.

Despite initiatives to  include security in these processes, there is still a lack of a common standard allowing a complete  integration of safety and security in the car development lifecycles.  The lack of shared technical standards for car security is an additional burden for those who try to build  secure development processes. Eventually, the complexities of this heavily-tiered ecosystem cause issues in  the supply chain and in the glue code111 between components.  Existing initiatives and limitations  The approach in SAE-J 3061112 tried to address one of the smart cars specifics, which is a security product  that has strong safety requirements and an existing engineering process dedicated to safety.  It also tried to distinguish between system level and vehicle level issues to define a development method for  vehicles, which would both take security into account, and be compatible with the existing lifecycles of the  industry. As such, the document is well adapted to smart cars, but still lacks recommendations to address  many specifics of this domain. For example, the SAE-J 3061 does not suggest specific remediation to:   The unusually large attack surface (large number of entry points and variety of attack methods) of smart  vehicles113;   The combination of easy access for attackers (being a mass-market product) and severe impact (safety  consequences on the user and other vehicles)114;   The persistence of threats, associated with the relatively long life of the products115;   The fact that smart features are not essential to the core features of the car116.  Several initiatives led to defining guidelines or rules to implement security in the automotive industry (see  figure hereafter), and other initiatives117,118 asked for collaboration on the security topics from the  automotive industry. Although some of them are well under development, like ISO/AWI 21434119, none of  them can be considered a standard yet, and the overall standard landscape has yet to achieve the level of  completeness and consistency found in domains such as aircraft safety or smartcard security. The Figure 9  111 Generally, the term “glue code” is used for the code binding diverse software components together, typically  written in a dynamic scripting language, as opposed to the static compiled software components. In the context of  security, glue code is considered a threat for it often implies bad understanding of the security assumptions of the  third-party component code.  112 See SAE-J 3061 - SURFACE VEHICLE RECOMMENDED PRACTICE - Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical  Vehicle Systems  113 Amongst possible lifecycle adaptation, one may think of the following :  - Adding a dedicated interface design review;  - Adding a dedicated hardening phase during the late integration phases.  114 This combination implies that smart car security should require a high security assurance. And yet, the SAE-J3061  does not explicitly suggest high assurance certification (for example, Common Criteria EAL4+ security hardware)  115 This situation should theoretically require smart car manufacturers to reach a consensus on future-proof  cryptographic key sizes, which may exceed the usual recommendations of national cyber-security agencies.  116 As such, a consensus could be reached amongst manufacturers to define an “offline mode” where cars would be  functional while deactivating most of the external interfaces, such as the infotainment. Such a mode could be an  option when sever flaws have been found and are not yet patched.  117 See https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/  118 See https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html  119 See http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=70918  https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/ https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=70918  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  47  hereafter gives a sample of existing initiatives, as well as a sample of initiatives of interest outside of the  automotive domain.  Figure 9 : Safety and security initiatives inside and outside of the automotive domains  At the moment, no certification framework is yet considered a standard for security evaluation or security  testing, which would allow detection of vulnerabilities before the product is released. While certification  frameworks exist for safety features, for example automatic brake system, most industry actors are still new  to the concepts and methods of security certification (for example, the notion of penetration testing).  Other industries (for example airborne systems) eventually defined their own frameworks, for example  when facing heavily-tiered environment rendering usual certification standards impractical. Before trying  the same approach on automotive products, one should be careful to assess whether these attempts have  been successful in practice.  The particular issue of technical standards  The lack of standard ultimately causes additional security issues: for example, several key components of  vehicles are still developed with proprietary technologies (the main example coming to mind is the protocols  used for CAN communication). This situation makes it more difficult for third-party vendors to develop  security solutions (for example firewalls or intrusion detection) that could be applied to a large market,  hence reducing effectively the cost of security for manufacturers.  Additional issues: supply chain and effects of re-used code  Moreover, the heavily-tiered ecosystem of car manufacturing also leads to security integration issues120.  Eventually, aftermarket products may share the same buses, which also lead to a significant risk121. Units  120 See Checkoway, S., McCoy, D., Kantor, B., Anderson, D., Shacham, H., Savage, S., & Kohno, T. (2011, August).  Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces.

In 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (pp. 447-462). IEEE.  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  48  such as TCUs can be provided by manufacturers, Tiers or aftermarket providers. Theoretically, all are equally  secure or vulnerable, but the ECUs from Tiers or aftermarket providers are more significant from a  remediation point of view.  As stated by researchers122, security issues in aftermarket products cannot, by definition, be controlled by  manufacturers. In practice, aftermarket vendors are described as fully supportive, but the complexity of the  supply chain relationships leads in practice to security patches not being deployed, even when vendors have  distributed them (similar issues can be found in smartphones, where security patches on the Android OS are  not necessarily cascaded in operators or vendors fine-tuned versions of the OS).  Other studies highlighted the issues caused by integration of SW and HW in the manufacturing, especially  the fact that some actors experience with safety issues may cause them to separate software and hardware  issues and miss global security vulnerabilities. More generally, the outsourcing model leads to glue code and  security flaws due to bad understanding of the security assumptions of third-party code123. While  acknowledging the effort made by the industry to integrate safety and security approaches, explicit  synchronization points should be defined between these activities124 and between actors of the supply chain.  In the field, this heavily-tiered environment causes additional issues. Security patches need to be validated  on the whole supply chain before they can be deployed, which leads in practice to security patches not being  deployed, even when the Tier-2 vendor, for example, has developed and distributed them122 (this issue is, in  a way, similar to the issues of a mobile OS security patch not redeployed by OEMs).  Constraints and incentives  4.2.1 Constraints  Constraints due to the use cases  Some studies point out that connected car use cases, themselves, could be inherently insecure. For example,  the use of some \"smart dongles\" is often described as a \"bad practice\" by construction: structural  vulnerabilities of the CAN bus have a very deep impact (MiTM, capacity to reflash ECUs, leading to possible  actions on brakes, throttle...). The user is only protected by the need for a physical access to the CAN  (typically via OBD-II).  In this context, those \"smart dongles” provide an attacker with the capacity of easily  performing a remote attack with the same high impact125, which means that there must be a better  protection offered for and a separation between dongles and the CAN bus.  Additionally, use cases lead the acceptable cost for some car components. For example, keyless entry  systems have an acceptable cost, which implies that they will eventually lack the hardware resources to  support state-of-the-art cryptography.  122 See Foster, I., Prudhomme, A., Koscher, K., & Savage, S.

(2015). Fast and vulnerable: a story of  telematic failures. In 9th USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT 15).  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  49  Constraints due to the architecture  Additionally, vehicle systems have very specific issues due to their architecture. In particular, the use of CAN  bus (as opposed to Internet-like protocols) would cause:   Greater vulnerability to DoS, since arbitration is priority-based 126;   More issues with network segregation (priority being implicitly derived from safety notions instead of  including security properties);   Greater vulnerability to reverse engineering due to the small range of valid CAN packets (meaning that  little work is needed and a simple fuzzing campaign can have a dramatic impact by itself) 126,127.  Moreover, in-vehicle systems include a very large number of embedded and interconnected components (a  typical car contains more than 100 ECUs). Previous studies tend to argue that usual hardening and network  isolation issues are insufficient to protect such interconnected systems128.  It also opens many entry points129 for an attacker: vulnerabilities in these ECUs may be accessed remotely  through130 multiple possible interfaces, and in some cases including a web browser131.  Aside of the remote interfaces, various local entry points and diagnostic/test interfaces exist, such as OBD  or USB ports, which can also be used to get access to the system, or at least understand how it is designed  and which messages are exchanged. Indeed, the legacy bus system (CAN, LIN) offers no protection of the  messages. Besides, there is no standard for protection of ECUs (authentication, firmware update), which is  left at manufacturers good will. Eventually, many entry points are physically accessible:   Proprietary connectors131: a proprietary implementation does not prevent the tester to find out that it  is an Ethernet interface, and to be able to communicate with it,   Reverse engineering of the firmware (in this example, it allows to learn the password rotation scheme  and the location of the new password in plaintext on the file system).  4.2.2 Incentives  Studies consider that the IoT integration into cars cause a leadership crisis amongst traditional  manufacturers, that are now challenged by actors coming from the software domain132. Companies from  different domains have different ways to deal with security issues, from disclosure to remediation, which  in turn has consequences on the amount of “brand damage” resulting from inevitable cybersecurity issues.  In this context, the deployment or non-deployment of cybersecurity measures may have far-reaching  consequences.  126 See Koscher, K., Czeskis, A., Roesner, F., Patel, S., Kohno, T., Checkoway, S., & Savage, S.

This tends to confirm a widely-accepted consensus that media attention, and more largely, good or bad  publicity134, due to security issues is a main driver to implementing security for industry actors.

Car manufacturers and Tier actors shall ensure that  appropriate technical measures (e.g. logging, distinct authentication,  transparency provided through OEM/Tier sites concerning each particular  car/component, integration with Type Approval authorities and monitoring  agencies) exist allowing for tracing liability between actors.  All  4.3.2 Organizational measures  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  Organizational  measures –  general  GP-OM-01 - Designate a dedicated security team. Actors of the smart car industry  should rely on specialists, notably for secure design, penetration testing and risk  management. Expert advice for training and corporate security is also  recommended. Some efforts in this direction are done in the ISO AWI 21434 –still in  draft- (see also Section 8.1.2).  All  GP-OM-02 - Define a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS).  Actors of the smart car industry should define an ISMS, possibly inspired from SAE  J3061, ISO 27001 or NIST 800-53, and refine it to address the specific needs of their  industry, notably the management of Tier-1 and Tier-2 actors, and processes to  ensure continuous isolation of the components from aftermarket products.  All  Organizational  measures –  secure  development  GP-OM-03 - Assess the threat model and use cases.  Actors of the smart car  industry should perform a threat analysis prior to development possibly inspired  from SAE-J3061 TARA approach (including EVITA, TVRA, OCTAVE and HEAVENS  methods) or possible from the risk management approach of ISO 31000. Efforts in  this direction are also done in the context of ISO AWI 21434.  All  GP-OM-04 - Provide security and privacy by design. Actors of the smart car  industry should plan their development lifecycles to ensure that security and  privacy are taken into account no later than the design phase, in order to address  the threats identified in the risk assessment.  All  GP-OM-05 - Implement and test the security functions. Actors of the smart car  industry should clearly define appropriate security functions that will be explicitly  implemented and tested during the development lifecycle. Security functions  described in the next section, include Security Audit, Communication protection,  Cryptography, User data protection, Identification, authentication, authorization,  and Self-protection.  All  Organizational  measures – security until  the end-of-life  GP-OM-06 - Assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities. Actors of the  smart car industry should define appropriate assessment procedures to regularly  check the effectiveness of their security functions, and patch them whenever  needed.  All  GP-OM-07 - Define a security update policy.  Actors of the smart car industry  should define an update policy for security patches, taking into account appropriate  timing, conditions, and user awareness for the updates (to ensure safety during  the update), and OTA update mechanisms whenever possible. Manufacturers may  have to define whether a vulnerable component can, or should, be put offline when  proven vulnerable.  All  GP-OM-08 - Perform a vulnerability survey. Actors of the smart car industry should  perform a vulnerability survey to be proactively able to fix security issues before  they can be used in the wild. The vulnerability survey should include developer  All  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  53  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  findings, on-line researches, CERTs advisories, information shared by groups such as  CarSec, ISACs or AutoSAR, as well as input from customers and security researches.  Eventually, vulnerabilities impacting user data should be communicated as  transparently as possible, as expressed by the EU Opinion 03/2014 on Personal Data  Breach Notification from the Article 29 Working Party.  GP-OM-09 - Check the security assumptions regularly during life-time. The devices  and services made assumptions to ensure that the security requirements are  sufficient (limitations in the usage of the vehicle137, assumed properties of the  environment138, assumed properties of cryptographic properties 139…). Vendors and  users should be encouraged to check regularly that these assumptions are still valid.  All  GP-OM-10 - Protect the software update mechanism. Vendors should protect the  updates (typically via encryption and digital signature) and protect the application  of an update on the device. Eventually, the update server and infrastructure  (including diagnostic tools) should also be protected.  All  GP-OM-11 - Raise user awareness. Vendors and public authorities140 should explain  users what actions can contribute to mitigate potential threats, especially how to  securely use interfaced systems such as a smartphone.  In the other side, a car owner often does not know what was changed in his car.  OEM shall support users by setting up issue-tracking sites where users can track  changes of their cars and report problems.  All  4.3.3 Technical  This section is structured following the lifecycle of smart cars. Steps are inspired by previous work from  NHTSA/NIST141  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  Security functions –  Security audit  GP-SF-01 - Security events must be securely logged. Access to the logs must be  documented and protected from disclosure to unauthorized users. The audit trail  must be protected from unauthorized access.  All  GP-SF-02 – Users must be informed of security events. HW and embedded  systems should provide clear error data that can be leveraged upon by the SW  vendors. The user must be informed in case of security errors, updates or  compromised data in a device or service they use.  All  Security functions –  Communications  protection  GP-SF-03 - Provide end-to-end protection in confidentiality and integrity using  protocols that resist to replay attacks. Favour methods providing forward secrecy  whenever possible, for WAN traffic (internet, mobile network) as well as local  networks.  Remote attacks,  theft, surveillance  137 For example, users may be advised to remove connectivity features from their entertainment system until a fix has  been found for a given vulnerability  138 For example, vendors should perform a survey to be able to remove a compromised CA from the certificate store.  139 Vendors should check regularly this assumption. For example, vendors should be aware to new cryptographic  attacks in order to adapt users’ key length or cryptographic suites adequately.  140 See for instance FBI’s public announcement Motor vehicles increasingly vulnerable to remote exploits  141 See National Institute of Standards and Technology cyber security risk management framework applied to modern  vehicles  https://www.ic3.gov/media/2016/160317.aspx http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2014/812073_NatlInstitStandardsTechCyber.pdf http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NVS/Crash%20Avoidance/Technical%20Publications/2014/812073_NatlInstitStandardsTechCyber.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  54  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  GP-SF-04 - Mitigate vulnerabilities or limitations of standard security library.  Developers must be aware of the vulnerabilities and limitations of the third-party  components they use. They should mitigate them whenever possible by patching  and by securing the configuration of the communication stacks, which might  typically include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, TLS…  All  GP-SF-05 - Consider denial of service as a usual threat to communication  infrastructures. This good practice contributes to data availability. Vendors and  service providers are encouraged to read the ENISA Internet Infrastructure Threat  Landscape (for network components) 142.  Remote attacks  GP-SF-06 - Protect remote monitoring and administration interfaces. Vendors  should protect all monitoring and administration interfaces by mutual  authentication and access control mechanisms.  Remote attacks,  theft  Security functions -  cryptography  GP-SF-07 - Do not create proprietary cryptographic schemes, but use state-of- the-art standards instead. If needed, consider getting advice from security  experts or your national cybersecurity agency. C-ITS platform143 could also be  used for advices. If no recommendations exist for vendors at a national level,  ENISA recommendations should be considered as a reference144.  This applies also to random number generation, which is a critical part of the  cryptographic support, which should meet quality measures on statistical output  (for example based upon national requirements145).  Additionally, consider the expected life duration of the vehicle and find advice on  the relevant key size (national recommendations might, in some cases, be based  on shorter lifespans than a consumer car).  All  GP-SF-08 - Rely on an expert in cryptography, notably for interfacing with HW  accelerated cryptography or secure elements, or even using or configuring a  standard implementation. At least, code review should be performed to ensure  that HW or a standard implementation of cryptography is properly used. The code  review would ideally be performed by a third party, but independent internal  code reviews can also be of a high quality.  All  GP-SF-09 - Consider using dedicated, and independently audited, hardware  security modules. The standard for independent assessment of security HW  should be either FIPS 140-2, or a Common Criteria certification following relevant  Protection Profiles. If needed, consider getting advice from security experts or  your national cybersecurity agency.  Persistent vehicle  alteration  GP-SF-10 - Cryptographic keys should be securely managed, which means  securely generated, distributed (or provisioned), used, stored, and deleted  (including revocation). Manufacturers, as well as Tier-1/Tier-2 and aftermarket  vendors should consider very carefully the revocation mechanisms associated  with their components, especially for OTA provisioning or key management. If  needed, consider getting advice from security experts or your national  cybersecurity agency.

Vendors should identify all data relating to an  identified or identifiable person. In the case of smart cars, this may especially  include location-based data. Consider getting advice from your national data  protection agency.  Surveillance  GP-SF-12 - Implement transparency measures. The interactions with the user  (which should not be limited to the Terms and conditions) enable to cover the  legal transparency requirements.  Surveillance  GP-SF-13 - Design the product/service with legitimate purpose and  proportionality in mind. The actors must ensure that themselves and their  subcontractors or suppliers do not process user data more than needed, and do  not pursue an illegitimate purpose with regard to user data. As a general rule,  third party components integrated in the device or third party cloud services  should not access user data that have not been anonymized or pseudonymized  unless user agreement has been obtained.  Surveillance  GP-SF-14 - Define access control, anonymity and unlinkability measures to  enforce the protection of private data. These measures are typically access  control measures, pseudonymity and unlinkability measures (such as ensuring  that data is not correlated))146, and eventually anonymity measures. Anonymity  measures may be “one-way” or “non-reversible” (such as truncation or a hash  functions) or “reversible” such as encryption.  Surveillance  GP-SF-15 - Define measures to ensure secure deletion of user data in case of a  change of ownership. More generally, a secure factory-reset of the firmware and  configuration should be available on the vehicle.  Surveillance  Security functions -  Identification,  authentication,  authorization  GP-SF-16 - Use mutual authentication for remote communication. Devices or  users connecting to a server must be able to authenticate the server. Reciprocally,  servers must be able to authenticate clients and users146.146  Remote attacks  GP-SF-17 - Use multi-factor authentication for user authentication. Users should  be authenticated by 2-factor authentication whenever possible, including for  authentication to cloud services or mobile interfaces, as well as local  administration sessions of devices.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-18 - Implement access control measures to separate the privileges of  different users and the privileges of different applications as well as to ensure  traceability of access and modifications. In practice, privileged operations should  not be readily accessible to normal users. Implementing privilege levels, rings or  domains can also be extended to application separation.  OEMs and Tier Actors shall employ a sufficient and flexible infrastructure for  “distinct” cryptographic keys per Tier Actors, garage personnel or vehicle  owner147.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-19 - Allow and encourage the use of strong passwords. This concerns all  possible uses of passwords: direct device interfaces such as JTAG, but also web,  mobile or cloud interfaces. However, the use of passwords in general may cause  safety issues for user interactions in a moving vehicle; this good practice is  recommended mainly for setup and pairing activities, and especially for  administration or diagnostic features.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  146 See C-ITS Platform, Final report, January 2016 – C-ITS Working Group 4 on Data protection and privacy –  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report-january-2016.pdf  147 See also http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en for the key distribution.  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report-january-2016.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  56  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICES  ASSOCIATED  ATTACKS  GP-SF-20 - Enforce session management policies to avoid session hijacking.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-21 - Provide the user with mechanisms to securely erase their private  data. For client information in remote infrastructures such as cloud services, data  sanitization must be in place. For user data present on vehicles, secure deletion of  encryption keys may provide enough protection, assuming that data is encrypted  in conditions that guarantee long-term confidentiality.  Surveillance  Security functions –  self-protection  GP-SF-22 - Define a consistent policy for self-protection. Vendors should  challenge every security function of their design, consider how they could be  bypassed or weakened, and eventually implement self-protection measures.  Persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-23 – Implement Hardware self-protection. Vendors should define  measures to protect hardware against physical attacks or observation. This  includes tamper evidence or tamper resistance, and secure design measures.  Persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-24 – Implement Software self-protection. Vendors should define measures  to protect existing security functions, typically by validating inputs and outputs, or  by separating the capacities of the different software components (levels of trust,  virtualization…).  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-25 – Protect Non-user data. Vendors should protect data enforcing the  security functions, such as keys or configuration data.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-26 – Perform Hardening. Vendors should actively reduce the attack surface  of the product or device. This includes removing or disabling unused services or  interfaces (especially debug interfaces), providing secure configuration by default,  as well as integrating malware protection. Some actors may consider intrusion  detection systems for internal subnetworks (for example CAN bus monitoring),  although this study will not conclude on the merits of these solutions.  Remote attacks,  persistent vehicle  alteration, theft  GP-SF-27 – Isolate components. Vendors should reduce the capacity for attackers  to jump from a component to another, either by a physical disconnection or by  using gateways.

Recommendations  Our recommendations aim at enhancing trust within the actors of the ecosystem (car manufacturers, tiers  and aftermarket vendors), as well as the trust from citizens in the smart cars available on the market.  Improve cyber security in smart cars  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors  The first recommendation of this report is the most obvious one: industry actors must establish holistic  secure development processes for their products. It must include design, development, testing, and security  maintenance in the field. This report gives a possible starting point for the establishment of good practices  and we expect that industry actors will adopt these practices and effectively enhance the security of their  products.  By providing a first set of good practices in this report, we hope that the industry should be able to overcome  the challenge of Insecure design or development identified in section 4.1.1.  Improve information sharing amongst industry actors  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors  Information sharing is essential for several reasons. Sharing can help industry actors to:   build trust between stakeholders ( car manufacturer, Tiers etc),   contribute to (make and) accept standards,   improve integration through commonly accepted practices,   help industry actors to find countermeasures and challenge the relevance of their security  mechanisms,   provide a mechanism to challenge and develop the skill of security teams, and   support the detection and mediation of security issues.  Therefore, stakeholders should share and discuss new attack methods found in the wild, in order to help the  whole community find countermeasures. Therefore, information sharing will also contribute to overcome  the challenge of Insecure design or development identified in section 4.1.1.  Eventually, information sharing structures are an efficient way to challenge the skills of security teams by  common sessions with other industry players, laboratories, or national agencies.  Communities for information sharing already exist, such as the US Auto-ISAC148 and the CarSEC149 group built  by ENISA. This report recommends pursuing this effort and consider developing an automotive incident  response capabilities.  Clarify liability among industry actors  148 See https://www.automotiveisac.com/  149 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  https://www.automotiveisac.com/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/carsec-expert-group  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  58  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers, aftermarket vendors, insurance companies  This report identified a particular challenge related to liability (see section 4.1.2). The question of liability  needs to be addressed. The question of where liability may fall lies between Tier actors,  car manufacturers,  the vendors, aftermarket support operators and the end users. The liability issues have to be addressed in  the context of national legislation and case law. Where gaps are identified in national legislation, these  should be addressed.  Criteria and processes  There are many ways to define criteria and processes to pinpoint liability in cases of security issues. We give  hereafter an example of such a process:   The HW vendor could be rendered “liable” by a certification of the hardware. The HW vendor could be  considered liable for any issues occurring in the HW, provided the OS or runtime environment complies  with the HW security guidance;   The vendor of the OS or runtime environment could be rendered “liable” by a certification of a  composite product (consisting of the runtime environment and a given security hardware). The vendor  could then be considered liable for any issues occurring in the OS or runtime environment, provided the  applications comply with a specific set of rules150. The notable point here is that the rules are meant to  allow an automated verification, typically by code analysis. Such analysis could, for example, be  performed when an application is submitted to an app store.  This example typically follows the practice of composite evaluations under the Common Criteria scheme and  is applied today in the smartcard environments. While car manufacturers are not expected to directly use a  scheme like Common Criteria, a similar approach would contribute to ensure:   That a given HW is a secure basis for an ECU   That a given OS is secure when used on a given HW   That clearly defined, and easily verifiable rules have been defined for applications, so that they do not  threaten then security of the OS  While it is generally accepted that evidences need to be given for the previously points, the processes that  should be followed may differ.  A first step for the security of these systems is to build robust and clear security specifications that will be  followed all over the lifecycle of the development and deployment of a car. Evidences that a system follows  these specifications should be systematically be provided.  A confirmation of the fulfilment of these requirements could be done by performing security evaluations  and/or certifications (under a well-adapted certification scheme).  Actors of the automobile industry are challenged by legal product liability regulation (comprising the “smart”  devices), which includes also systems or services contributed by subcontractors. Because of this reason, early  contact of the car manufacturer with its subcontractors on one side and the dedicated (product) liability  insurer on the other is recommended. Contractual agreements can be used in order to preserve each actor’s  rights.  150 See http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationform.asp?fid=7828  http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationform.asp?fid=7828  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  59  Achieve consensus on technical standards for good practices  Recommendation intended for: industry groups and associations  This reports lists good practices (see section 4.1), which are not meant to be directly applied on a car design.  Instead, they are meant as an input for a standardization effort. Industry actors should be aware that a  security standard for smart cars should challenge all the categories described in these good practices, in  order to be relevant security-wise. The details of the security requirements, on the other hand, must be  carefully built with regard to actual products, and this report recommends that these requirements are  subject of transparency and sharing between the different actors.  Following discussions with different participants in this survey, it is not recommended to create a new global  standard applied to any present and future automotive, but different actors should use and combine the  existed standards in order to better fit them in their use cases. The created consensus should be the golden  mean between standards, regulation and in-house solution.  Define an independent third-party evaluation scheme  Recommendation intended for: industry groups and associations  As security awareness increases among car manufacturers, they now include security in the life-cycle of their  product:   Requirements for their products for the design phase,   Security validation once the product is ready, to check conformity to these requirements and robustness  of security functions,   Security maintenance of the product through updates.  However, the automotive industry mostly assesses security with the same methods as safety (following  methods similar to ISO 26262 or MISRA). These standards marginally address security, and help reducing  malfunctions and failures (random and systematic faults), but do not protect against attacks.  This issue is part of challenge of Safety and security process integration described in section 4.1.3. In order  to overcome this challenge, the industry should define security validation processes that explicitly address  abuse cases and attacks, which requires a simulation of such attacks (in other words, penetration testing).  This requires different skills, and a different mindset as validation testing based on compliance to  specifications. For this reason, we recommend to build upon the existing skills and evaluations schemes  already in use amongst security professionals.  An example of such a scheme can be found in the initiative led by the Car-to-car communication consortium,  which aims at defining a Common Criteria Protection Profile (PP), at the EAL 4 level, for vehicle  communication devices151. The PP may not address all the categories of good practices of this report.  However, the integration of the Common Criteria scheme ensures the security assessment by skilled third- party laboratories, supervised by national cybersecurity agencies, following a standard process.  151 https://www.car-2-car.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Forum_2012/Workshop4_operational_Security.pdf  https://www.car-2-car.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Forum_2012/Workshop4_operational_Security.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  60  Some initiatives152 153  ask for collaboration on the security topics from the automotive industry, and suggest  dedicated security testing from actors skilled in penetration testing. Also, AUTOSAR and GENIVI have  established their own security projects, led by security experts.  We suggest that the industry builds on these examples to clarify a shared standard for security validation.  There is a need to define which method should be used (from basic security checks to penetration testing),  the expected amount and depth of testing depending of the component to be tested, and the trust model  for these tests (for example, certification of a third-party auditor with the authority to grant certificates  based on security evaluation).  Build tools for security analysis  Recommendation intended for: industry groups and associations, security companies  Additionally to previous recommendations, industry actors may find other ways to improve their security  testing skills. In particular, the development of dedicated tools appears as relevant for several activities.  Many established tools from the software can be readily re-used without significant modification.  This report provides a first effort in the definition of tools for:   Asset identification:   See Section 2.2 providing a first categorization of assets,   Threat modelling:   See Section 3 providing a first categorization of threats,   See Appendix A providing example of scenarios and risk ratings formulas according to the TVRA  method.  Industry actors should challenge these tools and further contribute on topics where tools provide the most  value:   Secure implementation, supported by static analysis during development, with rulesets adjusted to the  automotive environment;   Security testing, for example by defining fuzzing tools;   Security monitoring, for example by defining intrusion detection on technologies such as CAN.  Improve exchanges with security researchers and third parties  Recommendation intended for: smart car manufacturers, tiers and aftermarket vendors  Establishing communication channels between researchers, academics and the industry has benefited a  number of sectors.  In order to improve this communication, workshops, conferences, working groups, etc. should be organised.  Tools like responsible disclosure guidelines and bug bounty programs should be considered to be of special  value to enhance the information exchange.  152 https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/  153 https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html  https://www.iamthecavalry.org/domains/automotive/5star/ https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/automotive/automotive-security-review-board.html  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  61  This kind of exchanges will be obviously quite beneficial for the sector, as security requirements can be taken  into account from the early stages of the system lifecycle all the way to implementation and deployment.

Appendix A: Detailed risk ratings for the attack scenarios  These scenarios have various levels of likelihood and impact on sensitive assets. To illustrate this, hereafter  is an example of risk rating. The rating uses the risk assessment method defined in TVRA, but:  - This should not be considered a substitution for a real risk assessment on a car system  - We apply this method to attack scenarios instead of vulnerabilities (in the TVRA sense)  For these reasons, this rating should only be seen as a way to show how threats need to be assessed, in  order for manufacturers to define priorities on the security issues that they might try to prevent.  The Table 8 hereafter summarizes the ratings for the scenarios selected in this report, while Table 9 gives a  rationale to explain the ratings.

Persistent  vehicle  alteration by  the legitimate  user  The assets primarily targeted are  mostly related to access control,  especially access to functions not  intended for users (fleet management,  digital tachograph, geo-fencing...).  Studies give example of privileged  services than can be compromised  because static keys were discovered  by a memory dump (for example SSH  keys )  Other targeted assets are the driving  systems, especially in cases where  the user tries to modify the  performance of their  vehicle safety systems may also be  at risk due to accidental side effects of  the attack.

Attacks threatening  passengers safety  Intensity is considered high, since the attack typically allows to be performed by several agents at a time (exploit kit), or to be performed  on several vehicles at a time (sequentially assigned phone numbers). Asset impact is high, since safety is at risk. Time, expertise,  knowledge of the ToE and equipment are all rated in a way that reflects existing attacks made by researchers (for example Miller and  Valasek). Opportunity is estimated at \"moderate\" as an attacker can work on their own vehicle, which means it still is expensive, and  restricts the number of models on which the attacker can work.  2. Persistent vehicle  alteration by the  legitimate user  Intensity is rated as \"single instance\", since a physical access is required. Impact is rated as high. The attacker may damage their vehicle  beyond repair, and may also put their own safety at risk. Expertise is rated as proficient, since the scenario is typically aimed at proficient  users trying to tune or modify their own vehicle. Knowledge of the TOE is supposed to be \"restricted\": online communities are a factor of  information-sharing for this public, and information known only by garages may be found in such communities. Time is rated under a  month for the same reason. Opportunity is estimated at \"easy\", since an attacker typically work on their own vehicle (even if one may  argue that the vehicle is still, and restricts the number of models on which the attacker can work. Equipment is supposed to be standard.  3. Persistent vehicle  alteration by  diagnostic equipment  Intensity is moderate because while it needs a vehicle to be accessed via diagnostic equipment, an example of this has been described as  repeatable on a wide range of models. Asset impact is high due to the potential safety risk. Time is estimated at under 3 months. Expertise  is \"expert\" because the attacker needs car-specific knowledge (to alter an ECU firmware), as well as they need to know how to reverse a  DLL and exploit bad digital signature implementations. Knowledge of the TOE is expected to include \"restricted\" information, due to the  attacker having potentially access to restricted diagnostic tools and data. Opportunity is rated at \"moderate\" since most of the work is  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  67  performed on the DLL, which is more readily accessible than the vehicle. Equipment is rated at \"specialized\" since an access to diagnostic  tools will be needed at some point.  4. Theft  Intensity is considered \"single instance\": while it can be repeated on several vehicles of the same model, there is still needs a physical  access for each (since theft is the ultimate goal). Impact is medium (as opposed to safety issues that are considered High). Time is  estimated at under 1 month, to reflect the fact that information sharing within criminal networks may contribute to a relatively easy  reproducibility of attacks. Expertise is estimated at proficient, since the simplest methods are similar to remote control hacks that are  already used today [reference needed]. Opportunity is moderate. Only standard equipment is required  5.1 Targeted  Surveillance  Intensity is by definition \"single instance\". The impact is considered Medium, since safety may only be threatened in a second step  Time is supposed to be inferior to 6 months, since a physical access is possible  5.2 Mass surveillance  Intensity is \"Moderate\", since it is only repeatable for cars having a given set of vulnerabilities. The impact is considered Medium, since  safety may only be threatened in a second step  Time is supposed to be superior to 6 months, since a remote exploitation is needed  5.3 Surveillance (via  cloud)  Intensity is \"High\", since it is repeatable for all vehicles using the same cloud services (possibly whole fleets for a leasing company, etc.).  The impact is considered Medium, since safety may only be threatened in a second step  Time, expertise, opportunity and equipment are rated to reflect that the technical domain is widely known to potential attackers (Cloud  APIs and interfaces)  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  68  8. Appendix B: Detailed good practices  8.1.1 Policy and standards  Table 10 summarizes the good practices selected during the interviews.  Table 10: Policy enforcement good practices as selected by interviewees  POLICY AND STANDARDS DETAILS  Enforce liability manufacturer for tier-1 and tier-2  Enforce liability manufacturer for damages due to compromised garage  Adhere to regulation -  When consulting experts, a few policy enforcement topics were discussed:   Industry actors should, as a first step, adhere to regulation related to security and privacy. Well aware  of the regulation, several experts highlighted the lack of proper cybersecurity regulation for their field;   Car manufacturers should be held liable for damages due to other actors under their control, notably  Tiers and garages;   Enforcing liability for damages due to aftermarket products was less a consensus amongst interviewees.  The measure is practically difficult, thus is addressed in this report under the Gaps and Challenges  section (4.1);   Eventually, liability can only be measured by the compliance to a shared standard and process, which is  also lacking today (see 4.1)  8.1.2 Organizational measures  Table 11 hereafter summarizes the good practices selected during the interviews.  Table 11 : Organizational measures as selected by interviewees  ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES GOOD PRACTICE  Designation of a security team  Design  Pen-testing  Risk management  Corporate security  Training and awareness  Information Security Management  System  Define an ISMS (ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SAE J3061 section 7…)  Automotive Security Engineering  Follow ISO/AWI 21434  Designate a dedicated security team. As dealing with cybersecurity issues requires a very narrow set of  skills, actors of the smart car industry should rely on specialists for several kinds of activities, notably risk  management, secure design, training and awareness, penetration testing and corporate security. Whether  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  69  this security team should be in-house or a third-party company is not indifferent in some cases; in particular,  risk management and corporate security require too much company knowledge to be easily outsourced.  Define a dedicated Information Security Management System (ISMS). Vehicles in the wild cannot be  completely protected if the company itself is not able to protect some particularly sensitive assets. For  example, if vehicles or components have keys injected during production, the risk of leaking these keys may  be more important on the company site than on vehicles themselves. For this reason, an effective ISMS may  be of some help. The SAE J3061 describes such an ISMS154, and references to standards often used to this  purpose (ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53).  8.1.2.1 Secure Development or outsourcing  Assess the threat model and use cases. This report gives examples of attack scenarios, along with a risk  rating, inspired by the TVRA method, for each scenario. Similar (albeit more detailed) risk assessment is to  be expected from any actor involved in smart car components development. The threat analysis itself can  follow several possible methods, none of them being a standard. SAE-J3061 describes a TARA (Test And Risk  Assessment) phase, which fully supports the EVITA, TVRA, OCTAVE and HEAVENS approaches.  Provide security by design. The security should be taken into account no later than the design phase, in  order to avoid unnecessary workarounds, refactoring costs, or worse: leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed  because a fix would be unpractical or too expensive. In particular, the secure design should demonstrate  how the vehicle security covers the threats identified in the risk assessment. Design should also take into  account cybersecurity key principles such as defence in depth or principle of least privilege155 , or the use of  a hardware-supported Trusted Computing Base (TCB) small, secure and trusted, for critical services.  Implement and test the security functions. The test phase should also assess how hard it is to bypass the  existing security functions, activity which is typically performed by penetration testing. Examples of security  controls and measures are described in the next section. These technical measures are sorted using  categories loosely adapted from the Common Criteria156 security certification standard. These categories  are:   Security Audit: security events must be logged, and users should be notified whenever needed;   Communication protection: communication should be protected against disclosure, modification,  replay and denial of service;   Cryptography: Confidentiality, integrity and authenticity must be protected by using strong and  standard cryptography. Keys must be managed securely, and the use of a trust infrastructure (such  as PKI) is encouraged;   User data protection: the integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of user data must be protected.  Confidentiality protection must be defined with regards to privacy issues;   Identification, authentication, authorization: strong authentication methods must be used, as well  as access control mechanisms. Passwords and sessions should be managed accordingly;   Self-protection: HW and SW self-protection measures should be in place to protect previous security  functions. Data used to enforce these security functions should be protected, and hardening should  be used to reduce the attack surface.  154 See section 7 of SAE-J3061, Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems, January 2016  155 See for example section 5 of SAE-J3061, Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems, January  2016  156 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org  http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  70  8.1.2.2 Security measures until the end-of-life  Following the good practices described so far shall significantly reduce the risk of having vulnerabilities found  in the product, however this risk can never be avoided. Vendors shall not only pro-actively perform a survey  for new vulnerability but also provide a secure and reliable device update mechanism to allow fixing  vulnerabilities.  Assess the security controls and patch vulnerabilities using appropriate assessment procedures. Determine  the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the  desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.  Define a security update policy. The notion of security update has to be applied to smart cars with several  specifics in mind:  - The timing and conditions of the update are different in a vehicle than on a personal computer (users  should not be forced to wait for an update before they can start driving. On a similar note, it would be  unacceptable to disrupt operations when the vehicle is driving);  - A connected vehicle includes several types of components with different update policies: apps, secure  elements and ECUs cannot be updated the same way. While a secure OTA update seems theoretically  possible for all components, the need for physical updates might still be present in the next years in  many cases;  - Standard are still missing for these operations. While several OTA update framework already exist in  several domains, the car community still has to commit on a given, secure process if they want the same  channels to be used for manufacturers, Tier-1, Tier-2 and aftermarket developers. Some specific aspects,  such as certificate formats, might also need standardization to be fully adaptable to the connectivity  constraints of connected vehicles.  Some recommendations apply to the update policy:   The end-user must be informed of the support period of the device and of the end of support for security  fixes.   A patch may consist of a workaround if the developer did not yet provide a fix.   When over-the-air updates are not available, a plan for product recalls shall be considered.   For online services supporting smart cars, a rollback to a secure state must be possible.  Other aspects of the update cannot be addressed directly by this study. For example, applying security  updates must be done only when it cannot cause a safety issue, which requires each manufacturer to define  appropriate policies. In the same manner, manufacturers may have to think whether a vulnerable  component can, or should, be put offline when found vulnerable.  Perform vulnerability survey. Once a device is on the market, the vendor must perform a vulnerability  survey and fix security flaws accordingly. The vulnerability survey should include developer findings, on-line  researches, CERTs advisories, as well as input from customers and security researches. Eventually,  vulnerabilities impacting user data should be communicated as transparently as possible. The EU Opinion  03/2014 on Personal Data Breach Notification from the Article 29 Working Party gives examples of such  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  71  situations157. Manufacturers already move towards using dedicated Security Operations Centers to monitor  their infrastructures158. While a SOC generally do not delve into in-vehicle vulnerabilities, it may:   Detect anomalies that are an indication of a vehicle compromise   Prevent compromising critical functions of the infrastructure, such as remote provisioning or OTA  updates  Building a strong security community on a given domain gives many benefits:   Information sharing groups such as CarSec in Europe, or ISACs, can contribute to raise awareness  amongst industry actors;   CERTs prove useful in informing users of possible vulnerabilities and remediation. While existing CERTs  can occasionally play this role for automotive use cases159, dedicated incident response capabilities  might prove more efficient.   Having a transparent dialog with security researchers, may provide manufacturers with a quicker  assessment of their products’ possible flaws. It may also “push” the whole community towards more  responsible disclosure practices,   Setting up bounty programs, as already done by several car manufacturers, can also help finding flaws  before they are exploited by malicious actors.  A few more recommendations apply:   A policy for vulnerability handling and disclosure awareness should be defined160.   Bug bounty programs can also provide an incentive to third-party researchers161 162.   Known vulnerabilities must be patched163.  Check the security assumptions regularly during life-time. The devices and services made assumptions to  ensure that the security requirements are sufficient. Vendors and users should be encouraged to check  regularly that these assumptions are still valid. For example: limitations in the usage of the vehicle164,  assumed properties of the environment165, assumed properties of cryptographic properties 166…  157 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion- recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf  158 See for example https://www.sogeti.com/explore/press-releases/Sogeti-sets-up-a-security-operations-center-for- the-Renault-Group/  159 See for example Vulnerability Note VU#615456 - Lemur Vehicle Monitors BlueDriver LSB2 does not authenticate  users for Bluetooth access - http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/615456  160 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU  161 See FTC, Careful Connections - https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections- building-security-internet-things  162 See also the global bounty aggregator https://firebounty.com  163 See Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015 or FTC - Careful Connections  164 For example, users may be advised to remove connectivity features from their entertainment system until a fix has  been found for a given vulnerability  165 For example, vendors should perform a survey to be able to remove a compromised CA from the certificate store.  166 For example, vendors should check regularly this assumption, for example if a new cryptographic attack puts users  at risk unless they use longer keys or change their cryptographic suites.  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp213_en.pdf https://www.sogeti.com/explore/press-releases/Sogeti-sets-up-a-security-operations-center-for-the-Renault-Group/ https://www.sogeti.com/explore/press-releases/Sogeti-sets-up-a-security-operations-center-for-the-Renault-Group/ http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/615456 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdU4LutBGU https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections-building-security-internet-things https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/careful-connections-building-security-internet-things https://firebounty.com/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  72  Protect the software update mechanism. In all cases, the update process requires the vehicle to  authenticate the party providing the update, as well as the carrier of this update (for example SMS  authentication does not replace the firmware signature, but is used as a complementary countermeasure)  Security updates provide protection against vulnerabilities found during the life of a device or application167.  However this comes at a cost, since support of this functionality also provides an entry point for an attacker.  In particular vendors should:  o Provide automatic and timely security updates168;  o Protect the updates (typically via encryption and digital signature). The update files must not contain  sensitive data 169. The signature must be verified before the update is applied;  o Protect the application of an update on the device. An attacker should not be able to trigger a  firmware installation without an authorization;  o Protect the security update interface against attacks;  o Maintain the update server, to avoid attackers using an obsolete domain name to push malicious  updates170.  Raise users’ awareness. Vendors should explain users what actions can contribute to mitigate potential  threats, especially how to securely use interfaced systems such as a smartphone.  8.1.3 Security functions  This section is structured following the lifecycle of smart cars. Steps are inspired by previous work from  NHTSA/NIST171  8.1.3.1 Security Audit  Security events must be logged172, and access to the logs must be documented and protected from  disclosure to unauthorized users. Logs are also needed for device integration. Typically, Tier-2 suppliers  must give possibility for Tier-1 suppliers to understand security events happening in their products. However  logs may also give information to an attacker, which is a serious security drawback. For this reason, the audit  trail must be protected173  Notifications should be easy to understand and help users find a remediation or workaround. HW and  embedded systems should provide clear error data that can be leveraged upon by the SW vendors.

In particular, users must be notified in the case of security events175. Notification might vary greatly  depending on the type of software considered. Mobile applications notification, messaging such as SMS or  e-mail, hardware interfaces such as LEDs, dedicated error messages to a gateway176…  8.1.3.2 Communication protection  Provide end-to-end protection in confidentiality and integrity using protocols that resist to replay attacks.  Favor methods providing forward secrecy whenever possible. This should be true even for the  communication of already encrypted data177; encryption must cover not only WAN traffic (internet, mobile  network), but also local network178.  Mitigate vulnerabilities or limitations of standard security library. Using a standard security library does  not mean that the product will automatically be secure. Developers must be aware of the vulnerabilities  (due to a flawed implementation) and limitations (vulnerability of the protocol itself) of the third-party  components they use. They should mitigate them whenever possible by performing patching179 and by  securing the configuration of the communication stacks180, which might typically include Bluetooth181,Wi- Fi182, TLS183…  Consider denial of service as a usual threat to communication infrastructures184. This threat should be  addressed from the design phase of the infrastructures. On this topic, this study encourages the vendors and  174 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  175 See OWASP I8 | Insufficient Security Configurability  176 Developers should be aware that for some functions, an excess of clarity is a valuable information for an attacker.  As a common example, when a login fails, the product should not communicate to the user whether the error is due  to a non-existent login or a bad login/password combination. The optimal balance between not enough or too much  clarity is to be assessed during dedicated security testing.  177 See OWASP I9 | Insecure Software/Firmware, or Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015.  Many protocols use both transport layer and applicative layer protection. The need for applicative layer protection  comes from end-to-end protection needs: the transport layer could be exposed if different transport technologies are  used during the transmission, therefore needing a dedicated protection:   In TCP communications, TLS 1.2 is the default choice for securing the transport layer;;   Applicative layer can be protected by recognized cryptographic means, so as to protect confidentiality and  integrity of the payload.  178 See OWASP I4 | Lack of Transport Encryption  179 Third-party and open-source libraries need frequent patching: vulnerabilities are regularly found in all most open- source implementations, even those considered as “industry standard”. Communications protection work only as  long as firmware updates are available and applied to fix vulnerabilities.  180 Due to the existence of vulnerabilities in frequently used protocol implementations, configuration of the library is  a significant part of the security functionality. Developers should in particular be vigilant to the configuration of  cipher suite negotiation and key sizes: allowing weak cipher suites provides an entry point for attacks aiming at  downgrading the level of security of the exchanges (See for example CVE-2015-0204 at https://cve.mitre.org/cgi- bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204)  181 See the example of Bluetooth, including Bluetooth 4.0, in Guide to Bluetooth Security - Recommendations of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology - John Padgette, Karen Scarfone, Lily Chen  182 See for instance attacks on WEP http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/120.pdf , WPS PIN vulnerability  https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755  or the Pixie Dust attack on WPS https://passwordscon.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/08/Dominique_Bongard.pdf  183 SSL and TLS have a long history of security vulnerabilities (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457 ).  184 See OWASP I3 | Insecure Network Services  http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/120.pdf https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 https://passwordscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dominique_Bongard.pdf https://passwordscon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dominique_Bongard.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  74  service providers to read the ENISA Internet Infrastructure Threat Landscape (for network components)185  or the GSMA IoT Device Connection Efficiency Guidelines186.  Protect remote monitoring interfaces. SMS commands should not be protected only by whitelisting187. For  this reason, privileged commands such as SMS administration commands shall be protected by mutual  authentication. More generally, protection of remote monitoring interfaces is crucial since they often  provide a highly-privileged entry point into a device. This protection includes access control for both the  gateway and ECU level and authentication mechanisms.  8.1.3.3 Cryptography  Many protection measures rely on cryptographic functions. In a broad definition, cryptography support for  security must include:   Symmetric or asymmetric encryption;   Message authentication and integrity;   User/entity authentication;   Hash functions;   Digital signature;   Key management;   Random number generation.  Do not create proprietary cryptographic schemes, but use state-of-the-art standards instead.188 Even a  home-brewed implementation of a standard is not a good practice when standard implementations are  available. If needed, consider getting advice from security experts or your national cybersecurity agency.189  If no recommendations exist for vendors at a national level, ENISA recommendations should be considered  as a reference.190 This applies also to random number generation, which is a critical part of the cryptographic  support. A possible recommendation would be the use of cryptographically secure pseudorandom number  generators.191  Rely on an expert in cryptography for interfacing with HW accelerated cryptography or secure elements,  or even using or configuring a standard implementation. These tasks are difficult for most of developers. If  not properly done, the security might be heavily reduced or even completely suppressed. This part should  be performed by an expert in cryptography or at least a third-party code review should be performed to  ensure that HW or a standard implementation of cryptography is properly used.  185 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic- landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure  186 http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/gsma-iot-device-connection-efficiency-guidelines/  187 The main reasons for this are that:   phone numbers can be spoofed.   whitelists are not secret   whitelists may be changed by other SMS commands (administration commands).  188 See for example see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015 or Careful connections by FTC  189 This study will not delve into the detailed requirements for cryptographic algorithms or acceptable keys sizes. One  can refer to “Algorithms, key size and parameters” report of Enisa (2014).  190 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-size-and- parameters-report-2014  191 See examples in http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/threat-landscape-of-the-internet-infrastructure http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/gsma-iot-device-connection-efficiency-guidelines/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-size-and-parameters-report-2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-size-and-parameters-report-2014 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  75  Consider using dedicated hardware security modules. HW-based cryptography solutions may help avoiding  the incorrect implementation of cryptographic algorithms by software vendors, as well the coexistence of  multiple implementations of the same algorithms. They eventually provide implementations that are more  resource-efficient. Choosing HW accelerated cryptography means that a reasonable assurance must be  obtained on the quality of the HW implementation, since “bad cryptography” on HW will be leveraged on  all the SW using these functions192.  Eventually, using certified HW may solve most of these issues. In particular, Manufacturers may look for  independently audited HW. The standard for independent assessment of security HW would be in that case  either FIPS 140-2 or Common Criteria certification following relevant Protection Profiles. If needed, consider  getting advice from security experts or your national cybersecurity agency.  Cryptographic keys should be securely generated, distributed (or provisioned), used, stored, and deleted  (including revocation). Badly implemented key management can introduce vulnerabilities that may easily  be exploited. Devices without direct user interfaces are particularly vulnerable to PKI compromising. While  users of a PC can easily delete or install certificates, such devices rely mostly on remote administration, and  sometimes do not even allow end-users to perform such administration tasks. For this reason,  Manufacturers, as well as Tier-1/Tier-2 and aftermarket vendors should consider very carefully the  revocation mechanisms associated with their components. This is especially true when the mechanisms of  key provisioning and management are performed over-the-air193. If needed, consider getting advice from  security experts or your national cybersecurity agency194.  8.1.3.4 User data protection  Identify personal data. The interpretation of privacy protection raises many issues, one of them being to  successfully identify what can be considered a personal data. The definition according to the EU Directive  95/46/EC includes data relating to an identified or identifiable person. In the case of smart cars, however, it  may be safe to assume that most data related to the user activity are somewhat personal, especially  location-based data. This last approach will have to be continued throughout the whole product or service  192 Random number generators are a good example of vulnerable functions with an impact on many features.   As a general rule, a true random number should be used for key generation, but may not be required for  salts, initialization vectors… where a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number may be sufficient.  One may argue that using a cryptographically secure software pseudorandom number generator is more  secure than a badly implemented hardware “true random number generator”;   When using hardware claiming a “true random”, developers should consider using strong post-processing  functions. The functions used for that purpose are typically block encryption or hash functions;  More details on the different categories of random generators can be found in documents from national  cybersecurity agencies. See in particular A proposal for: Functionality classes for random number generators, Version  2.0, 18 September 2011, by the BSI.  193 Industry players introduced the notion of remote provisioning for mobile communication (See for example GSMA  remote provisioning architecture and Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of  Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group). While keys are loaded in SIM cards in protected environment, the  “embedded UICCs” rely on remote subscription management systems to obtain key material. The protection of these  exchanges is consequently critical and must be assessed accordingly by manufacturers and vendors. Should the keys  be leaked, the user and the vendors could be at risk in many ways (loss of control over the device, eavesdropping,  credential theft, cloning…). More generally, the notion of confidential key agreement must be considered in IoT in  general, and smart cars in particular.  194 This study will not delve into the detailed requirements for cryptographic algorithms or acceptable keys sizes,  since national cybersecurity agencies already provide consistent guidance on this topic  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  76  lifecycle. Metadata should be considered as personal data by default, since they are subject to the same  threats195. Consider getting advice from your national data protection agency.  Implement transparency measures. The interactions with the user (which should not be limited to the Terms  and conditions196) enable to cover the legal transparency requirements197.  Design the product/service with legitimate purpose and proportionality in mind. The design phase of the  service or product, where the details of the processing have to be assessed with regards to the explicit and  legitimate purposes. The actors must ensure that themselves and their subcontractors or suppliers do not  process user data more than needed, and do not pursue an illegitimate purpose with regard to user data. As  a general rule, third party components integrated in the device or third party cloud services should not  access unencrypted user data unless user agreement has been obtained. Access control or  anonymity/pseudonymity measures gives assurance that user data is not accessed by these third parties.  Define access control, anonymity and unlinkability measures to enforce the protection of private data .  These measures are typically access control measures198, pseudonymity and unlinkability measures (such as  ensuring that data is not correlated199), and eventually anonymity measures. Anonymity measures may be  195 See http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/02/why-the-internet-of-things-is-a-problem-for-metadata-retention/  196 While the Terms and Conditions are a practical support for the vendors, many actors consider that this cannot be  considered a good practice. In particular, the user may be lost in a barely-legible legalese instead of being able to  make informed choices regarding their privacy. The US FTC gives recommendations on this topic, for example using  other supports such as registration emails.  197 The service or device provider must communicate  • The provider’s name and address;  • What data is collected, in layman terms;  • The purpose of processing, explaining notably why the processing is necessary for the performance,  to protect the vital interests of the data subject, or for compliance with a legal obligation;  • The recipients of the data;  • How the user can:  o Access all data processed about him,  o Require the rectification, deletion or blocking of data that is incomplete, inaccurate or isn't being  processed in compliance with the data protection rules.  • And all other information required to ensure the processing is fair;  • The service or device provider must require the consent of the user (or “data subject”).  On top of legal requirements, actors might also consider:  • Defining a strict opt-in policy;  • Enabling rectification, deletion or blocking of data without a reason;  • Ensuring data portability.  198 As a general rule, access to sensitive data should be controlled. For web services and components including  virtualization, access control could be completed by data isolation  199 The typical example is ensuring that the key used to browse the “customer database” is not the same as the key  used to browse the “usage analytics database”. However the situation is more complicated in practice: in the case of  smart cars, for example, network locator is a critical factor of linkability and should be taken into account accordingly.  Vendors should also be aware, that unlinkability can also:  • Cause trust issues and reduce attack mitigation capabilities (for example if a user cannot be notified  that their device is compromised);  • Cause a conflict with other legal requirements.  There is no one-size-fits-all good practice to balance unlinkability against other desired properties. The right balance  must be defined during the design stage by examining the associated risks.  http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/02/why-the-internet-of-things-is-a-problem-for-metadata-retention/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  77  “one-way” or “non-reversible” (such as truncation200 or a hash functions201) or “reversible” such as  encryption202.  Define measures to ensure secure deletion of user data in case of a change of ownership. More generally,  a secure factory-reset of the firmware and configuration should be available on the vehicle.  8.1.3.5 Identification, authentication, authorization  Use mutual authentication for remote communication. Devices or users connecting to a server must be  able to authenticate the server. Reciprocally, servers must be able to authenticate clients and users. Mutual  authentication203 consists in demonstrating cryptographically to both the client and the server that they are  communicating with the expected party. Mutual authentication is generally performed by using Public Key  Infrastructures (PKI) and certificates. These methods can be embedded in protocols such as TLS. However  using methods such as TLS does not grant a secure mutual authentication, unless:  • There is a certificate for both the server and the client;  • Certificate are properly validated (ruling out, for example, the use of self-signed certificates);  • Revocation lists are verified (alternatively, interrogations to an OCSP server);  • All services require this authentication step204. Which also means that even private URLs  accessible on a device must require authentication;  • Certificate pinning is used205.  As a side note, it must be noted that certificate pinning does not eliminate the need for certificate validation.  For example, the pinned certificate can be an intermediate or root Certificate Authority (CA) – which means  that the end certificate still has to be verified against the CAs.  Use multi-factor authentication for user authentication. Users should be authenticated by 2-factor  authentication whenever possible, including for authentication to cloud services or mobile interfaces206, as  well as local administration sessions of devices. Several methods can be used for multi-factor authentication.  As an example, the NIST provides a summary of these methods207.  Implement access control measures to separate the privileges of different users as well as the privileges of  different applications. In practice, privileged operations should not be readily accessible to normal users.  Reducing access to these services can be achieved either by disabling them (some studies recommend  200 Truncation is often used in the payment industry to anonymize cardholder data (see  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI%20SSC%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf )  201 Hash functions also have vulnerabilities (see for example  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function). As for other cryptographic operations, robust standard  mechanisms should be preferred – vendors are encouraged to contact their national cybersecurity agency if needed.  202 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right, OWASP I5 | Privacy  Concerns and OWASP I10 | Poor Physical Security. As a sidenote, encrypted storage can also address authenticity or  integrity of user data if combined with the right mechanisms (for example AES-GCM).  203 SSee Symantec’s “Insecurity in the Internet of things”, March 12, 2015  204 See Home Automation Benchmarking by SYNACK, but also Making Smart Locks Smarter (aka.

Typically:  o An administrative access should always require authentication, and should ideally require unique  credentials for each device208;  o Not all individual accounts need to have access user data stored in the device or associated  services209;  o User accounts must be unique and separated for both local and distant services210;  o The device must distinguish between normal users and admin users. The latter only have access to  configuration functions211.  Implementing privilege levels, rings or domains can also be extended to application separation. Some  platforms implement such levels in hardware. If such functions are available, vendors are advised to use  them212. If not, operating systems already provide capacities to implement privilege control. At the firmware  / software level, access control must be used to control access rights of both applications and individuals. In  particular, not all applications need to be root or be executed in kernel land.  Allow and encourage the use of strong passwords. As it is regularly demonstrated, passwords are often a  weak point, whether they are weak user passwords or weak default passwords for products internal services.  Many devices use strong protection measures that are defeated by the lack of proper password  management213. This concerns all possible uses of passwords: direct device interfaces such as JTAG, but also  web, mobile or cloud interfaces. The usual measures are the following:  o Allow and encourage the use of strong passwords214, regardless of the presence of a second  authentication factor;  o Require the user to change credentials (username, password) at their first login215;  o Do not use hard-coded or “default” passwords or shared passwords, for instance for remote support  accounts;  o Do not store/expose passwords in clear text or with weak protection. Adaptative one-way functions  such as PBKDF2, scrypt or bcrypt should be preferred216;  208 See for example Foster, I., Prudhomme, A., Koscher, K., & Savage, S. (2015).

Services must be protected  against:  o horizontal guessing (testing a small number of usual passwords on a high number of user  accounts);  o vertical guessing (testing a high number of passwords on a single user account)  o This typically includes lock-out and delaying measures as well as high password strength /  entropy and diversification of passwords across devices. This also includes countermeasures  against account discovery or other means used to exploit password recovery functions218;  o Define options for password control. Typically, in the case of an administrator account, the default  option should require strong passwords by default219.220.  Password policies are eventually useless if the final user is not fully aware of the threats and good practices.  Vendors and service providers should consider raising the awareness of their users whenever possible, for  example to support the use of password managers. Examples of simple guidelines can be found in ENISA  Basic security practices regarding passwords and online identities221.  Since the use of strong passwords is not acceptable for normal users interactions in a moving vehicle, this  good practice is recommended mainly for setup and pairing activities, and especially for administration or  diagnostic features.  Enforce session management policies to avoid session hijacking. Session management also contributes to  making sure that the authorized user is the one using a given session. Typically:  • Sensitive functions such as administration via web services should require re- authentication.222  • No data should be transmitted before authorization.223  • Strong (random) session handlers should be used to avoid replay.224  • The user must know at any time if, and why, they are logged on a particular service, meaning  that no passive sign-up for third party services should be performed.225  8.1.3.6 Self-protection  Define a consistent policy for self-protection. Self-protection includes all measures taken to enhance the  robustness of previously mentioned security functions. Developers should challenge every security function  217 see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015  218 see OWASP I2 | Insufficient Authentication/Authorization  219 See OWASP I2 | Insufficient Authentication/Authorization and OWASP I8 | Insufficient Security Configurability  220 An example of policy can be found at https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/password- protection-policy. Policies may vary depending on the threat analysis and dimensions (such as password length) also  depend on attacker’s capabilities, especially the computing power, which grows constantly over time. Vendors are  invited to contact their national cybersecurity agency or CERT to stay informed of the state-of-the-art.  221 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/basic-security-practices-regarding-passwords-and-online- identities  222 See OWASP I2 | Insufficient Authentication/Authorization  223 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  224 See for example Veracode White Paper – The Internet of Things: Security Research Study, 2015, and also The  Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  225 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right  https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/password-protection-policy https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/password-protection-policy http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/basic-security-practices-regarding-passwords-and-online-identities http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/basic-security-practices-regarding-passwords-and-online-identities  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  80  of their design, consider how they could be bypassed or weakened, and eventually implement self- protection measures. The main topics considered here are:   Hardware self-protection: these measures aim at protecting the hardware against physical attacks  or observation. They include tamper evidence or tamper resistance, and secure design measures226   Software self-protection: software also contributes to protect existing security functions, typically  by validating inputs and outputs, or by separating the capacities of the different software  components (levels of trust, virtualization…).  Self-protection can also be addressed by validating the software state in-memory (in order not to  execute commands that it wasn't intended to do originally)227 or running only signed binaries (in  order to fight against dropping of malware).  Software self-protection can also be achieved by using two separated OS; a secure one to perform  security functions and a “normal” one (e.g. Linux, android) for any other use.228   Non-user data protection: data used to enforce the security functions should be protected. These  measures intend to avoid storing internal keys as cleartext, or any other data that could be used to  circumvent the service security.   Hardening: hardening consists in reducing the attack surface of the product or device. This includes  removing unused services or interfaces (for instance remote shell access to the device, which should  not be needed in production), as well as integrating malware protection. Hardening in smart cars is  particularly difficult to address, since these systems are behaving both like embedded and  networked systems.  Some actors have advocated that, in the CAN context, intrusion detection should be used on top of  firewalls, in the same manner as usual IT systems use both in a defense-in-depth approach229.  Dedicated solutions are already being commercialized, in order to provide CAN bus monitoring in a  fashion quite similar to the traditional IDS/IPS systems230. This study will not, however, conclude on  the respective merits of these solutions.  226 Hardware protection measures are related to:  - threats that are not related to privacy, and where the user itself is the attacker (for example fraud use cases);  - threats to equipment that is not protected by physical measures.  These are also related to attackers with very high skills and motivation profiles (which is for example the model used  in smartcards this includes for example:  - Use of tamper-resistant hardware such as Active shields;  - Protection against glitch;  - Protection against fault injection;  - Protection against side channels (for example electromagnetic or power analysis).  Examples can be found for example in Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of  Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group. Even if this level of security cannot be required for all smart home devices,  several physical protection measures can be recommended to ensure a better overall security on the device.  227 There are existing self-protection technologies (such as CFI - control flow integrity-) that allows to resist in memory  attacks such as ROP. These types of attacks are very common in IT, and are finding their way into IoT these days.  228 Efforts to develop a proven secure OS have already been started:http://www.provenrun.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/02/Proven-Security-for-the-Internet-of-Things-v2.pdf  229 See http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/  230 See for example http://iotbusinessnews.com/2016/06/08/34788-symantec-launches-new-iot-solution-help- carmakers-protect-zero-day-attacks/ or http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be- stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/  http://www.provenrun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Proven-Security-for-the-Internet-of-Things-v2.pdf http://www.provenrun.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Proven-Security-for-the-Internet-of-Things-v2.pdf http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/ http://iotbusinessnews.com/2016/06/08/34788-symantec-launches-new-iot-solution-help-carmakers-protect-zero-day-attacks/ http://iotbusinessnews.com/2016/06/08/34788-symantec-launches-new-iot-solution-help-carmakers-protect-zero-day-attacks/ http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/ http://www.automotiveitnews.org/articles/572873/car-hacking-can-be-stopped-by-ips-from-argus-cyber/  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  81   Isolation: this subset of hardening measures is especially relevant for the car industry. Isolation of  components aims at reducing the capacity, for an attacker, to jump from a component to another.  This notion is found in the two main paradigms for CAN bus isolation in cars:  o Solution 1 : the CAN bus related to driving systems is “air gapped”, that is, completely  isolated from the infotainment network and internet  o Solution 2 : Systems are connected, but a gateway is in place to ensure the isolation between  networks, typically by access control mechanisms  These two solutions have architectural consequences – for example, the first only allows physical  updates, while the second allows OTA updates.  Studies argue that the second solution is gaining momentum, especially now that the eCall  regulation requires a SIM-card to be present in all cars, which provides a channel for updates231.  More generally, a separation of telematics and infotainment traffic is recommended allowing  specialized handling of packets regarding intrusion and malware detection.   Updates: updates are a subject of other self-protection measures. However, it is a quite important  function which is not always sufficiently protected. Updates may be used to update the vehicle’s  system with new functionalities, but also to provide corrections of security issues for the system.  Different parts can be of the need of an update, e.g. infotainment applications, maps, other  applications of the system or even the entire Operating System.  Nowadays, most of these updates are planned to be performed using OTA connectivity  OTA updating should reduce the cost of updating vehicle software, while improving functionalities  and fix issues (functional or security) on the car.  However, as already mentioned before, a particular attention has to be done on the downloaded  updates. Only signed updated should be finally installed whether an authentication could also be  required.  Most of the self-protection measures must be considered from the early design phases. Only the hardening  can be defined as an additional measure that can take place after the design and implementation phases.  Implement HW tamper evidence / tamper resistance. Devices vendors should be aware of tamper evident  or tamper-resistant mechanisms232. While they are not recommended in any case, vendors should consider  using them depending on the level of sensitivity of the assets stored on the device. In particular, even  constrained devices could be able to implement some kind of tamper evidence, even if they are not able to  implement resistance and response. More details on anti-tamper technologies can be found at different  sources, for example Black Hat233 or ICCC234 conferences  231 See for example Responsibility for Vehicle Security and Driver Privacy in the Age of the Connected Car,  IDC/Veracode, February 2016, IDC #EMEA41026016  232 This includes typically:  • Basic to moderate “Tamper resistance” mechanisms, which will slow an attacker (this typically includes  specific sealing methods for the casing, or the use of epoxy to protect components, or the entire board);  • Basic to moderate “Tamper evidence” mechanisms, such as tamper-evident seals or labels, or even switches  or sensors (light, power…) that will trigger a tamper response;  • Basic to moderate “tamper response” mechanisms such as sending an alarm to a remote service, logging a  security error or erasing sensitive data.  233 Introduction to Embedded Security, Joe Grand, Black Hat USA 2004  234 Physical protection: Anti-tamper mechanisms in Common Criteria security evaluations, Epoche & Espri, ICCC  Norway 2010  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  82  Implement HW protections at the design level. Hardware design can be used to make the device harder to  attack235.  Protect the software security functions by reinforcing interfaces and strengthening the application  separation at runtime. Software can contribute to self-protection measures for instance for robustness of  interfaces against bad inputs236. Secure implementation, thoroughly tested, will protect against common  attack vectors such as buffer/heap overflows or OWASP’s List of the Top Ten Web Vulnerabilities237. This  typically includes robustness of network interfaces against buffer overflows or fuzzing238. Implement trust  zones for the execution of applications (and/or ensuring segregation or execution protection), for example  by whitelisting applications, or by using Trusted Execution Environments or Secure boot, or SW  virtualization239…  The default configuration of devices and services should be secured. The operation mode of the device (or  service) should be the most secure one by default. A user might arguably want to disable a given security  function, but this should be the consequence of a deliberate action from the user, and the user should be  warned that this change reduces the security of the solution240.  Encrypted storage is not only useful to protect user data, but also to protect data that is needed to enforce  security on the device241. Internal data may be just as sensitive as user data, but are often not protected  235 In particular:  • Memory (including memory controller) can include measures such as secure erase and wear  levelling, Direct memory access, Non executable memory, …;  • Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design can contribute to security by including blind and buried vias,  buried bus lines, or electronic fuses and similar techniques, for example to deactivate JTAG access  (other uses can also be considered).  • System on Chip (SoC) design can include some of the previous measures, and can also include pin  placement, or the implementation of “system level” features such as HW Virtualization, micro  kernels, Secure boot, Trusted Execution Environments…  Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group  states that \"For chips with security features or functionality that may impact security it is important to understand  where these are located on the chip’s pin out. It is generally advisable not to use chips where these features are on  the outer two rows in high-security environments due to risk of fly wires being used\". Some labs consider today that  for \"grid array\" chip carriers, the outer three or four rows might be relatively easy to access for an attacker. In any  case, a consensus is needed amongst stakeholders and security labs on this topic, so cybersecurity agencies could  provide vendors with clear recommendations.  The ease of access to the components, as well as their removability, can also be considered during the design phases,  even if it cannot be the primary physical protection measure.  236 see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015  237 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project  238 OWASP I3 | Insecure Network Services  239 See for example Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015, IoT-A - D4.2 - Concepts and  Solutions for Privacy and Security in the Resolution Infrastructure  240 Providing a secure configuration by default means in practice that  • a remote service will use HTTPS by default  • setup processes include the necessary steps to upload any security configuration data such as  certificates  • the stronger password policies will be selected by default  • …  241 See The Internet of Fails: Where IoT Has Gone Wrong and How We're Making It Right and OWASP I10 | Poor  Physical Security  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project  Cyber Security and Resilience of smart cars  December 2016  83  enough, leading for example, to situations where \"hardcoded root credentials, API keys for Amazon Web  Services, URLs never meant to be known to end-users, and manufacturing network configurations\"242 can be  found in cleartext on devices. As a general rule, configuration data should be encrypted at rest and in  transit243.  Perform hardening to reduce the attack surface: remove unused services or interfaces, integrate  dedicated security software, activate memory or control flow protections. For devices that have a  complete operating system, several measures can be considered to harden the device, such as ASLR, non- executable memory, process segregation or sandboxing. Another measure is removing unused tools,  services and libraries244. Unnecessary services should not be present on the device (typically telnet must  always be deactivated, but even SSH or FTP can be deactivated in many cases). This type of measures is also  applicable at a network level: the device should not leave open ports, especially ports that could be exposed  via plug-n-play protocols245. The default configuration of the device should be based upon the most secure  parameters, and users should be warned if they have the possibility to roll back to less secure parameters.  For example multi-factor authentication should be the default configuration. Users should be warned if they  want to configure the service to single-factor authentication. Vendors should also consider integrating  malware protection to their systems246, since the smart home ecosystem provides many possible ways for  malware to enter a device (mobile, personal computer, device network interfaces…). Eventually, Vendors  should consider deactivation or protection of the external interfaces247, for example:  • protecting the physical debug interfaces such as JTAG/ISP (by password and physical action),  or physically deactivate the physical debug access;  • including mitigation to avoid exploitation of interfaces such as I2C/SPI buses or serial  interfaces;  • Suppressing or limiting to a local access248, the administration interfaces.  More generally, vendors should consider their means of protection for:  • Boot ROM interface;  • Firmware update interfaces;  • Configuration and calibration interfaces;  • Inter-processor IPC;  • USB external interfaces;  • Protection against DMA attacks249;  • No unnecessary external interfaces should be accessible from the exterior of the device250.  242 See A Primer on IoT Security Research, March 30 2015, Stanislav  243 See OWASP I8 | Insufficient Security Configurability and See Security of Things: An Implementers’ Guide to Cyber- Security for Internet of Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group  244 See Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015 and The Internet of Fails Where IoT Has Gone  Wrong and How We're Making It Right  245 See Home Automation Benchmarking by SYNACK, or OWASP I3 | Insecure Network Services  246 see Symantec Insecurity in the Internet of things, March 12, 2015  247 See for example Veracode White Paper – The Internet of Things: Security Research Study or Security of Things: An  Implementers’ Guide to Cyber-Security for Internet of Things Devices and Beyond, NCC group  248 See OWASP I10 | Poor Physical Security  249 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack  250 See e.g. OWASP I10 | Poor Physical Security  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Athens, Greece  TP-07-16-043-EN-N  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-184-7  doi: 10.2824/87614  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/smart-infrastructures/intelligent-public-transport/smart-cities-architecture-model",
